I use PxBinaryConverter to convert a PxCollection that holding about million PxActors from Win format to Linux format It tooks me hours Profiling shows that of CPU time is consumed by PointerRemapgetObjectRef This patch reduced the conversion time from hours to seconds Tested with GCC I have a big issue with the physX Plugin I have a Character created and the shape is little more detailed I have tried to make a custom mesh for the kinemetric option and the cloth still goes through the character Am I missing something is the cloth plugin not working why does the plugin have a custom mesh but doesnt work for clothing I dont know But I really need to get things going with my game apexcloth Hi there Im using PhysX library and the following Assert occurs frequently PhysXFoundation dllanonymous namespaceDefaultAssertHandleroperatorconst char expr const char file int line bool ignore Line C PhysX dllphysxSqIncrementalAABBPrunerCoreremoveObjectconst unsigned int poolIndex const unsigned int poolRelocatedLastIndex unsigned int timeStamp Line C PhysX dllphysxSqExtendedBucketPrunerremoveObjectconst physxSqPrunerPayload object unsigned int objectIndex const physxSqPrunerPayload swapObject unsigned int swapObjectIndex unsigned int timeStamp Line C PhysX dllphysxSqAABBPrunerremoveObjectsconst unsigned int handles unsigned int count Line C PhysX dllphysxSqSceneQueryManagerremovePrunerShapeunsigned int compoundId unsigned int data Line C PhysX dllphysxNpShapeManagerteardownAllSceneQueryphysxSqSceneQueryManager sqManager const physxPxRigidActor actor Line C PhysX dllremoveActorTphysxNpRigidDynamicphysxScbBodyphysxNpRigidDynamic actor physxScbBody scbActor physxNpScene scene bool wakeOnLostTouch bool removeFromAggregate Line C PhysX dllphysxNpSceneremoveRigidDynamicphysxNpRigidDynamic body bool wakeOnLostTouch bool removeFromAggregate Line C PhysX dllphysxNpSceneremoveActorInternalphysxPxActor actor bool wakeOnLostTouch bool removeFromAggregate Line C PhysX dllphysxNpSceneremoveActorphysxPxActor actor bool wakeOnLostTouch Line C Assertion fails on PXASSERTfoundEntry and mAABBTree tree mAABBTree tree are pointing to Null bool IncrementalAABBPrunerCoreremoveObjectconst PoolIndex poolIndex const PoolIndex poolRelocatedLastIndex PxU timeStamp erase the entry and get the data IncrementalPrunerMapEntry entry bool foundEntry true const PxU treeIndex mAABBTree mLastTree mappingerasepoolIndex entry mLastTree mCurrentTree if it was not found in the last tree look at the current tree iftreeIndex mCurrentTree foundEntry mAABBTree mCurrentTree mappingerasepoolIndex entry exit somethings is wrong here entry was not found here PXASSERTfoundEntry iffoundEntry return false tree must exist PXASSERTmAABBTree treeIndex tree CoreTree tree mAABBTree treeIndex timeStamp treetimeStamp Can anyone help me solve this problem Thanks Created new emscripten platform using the linux build as a template emscripten build does not support snippetssamplesalthough this support should be possible to add after configuring emscripten in the local environment running a standard generateprojectssh selecting emscripten and make in a build configuration directory builds a wasmjs file for loading in the browser a new module has been added PhysxWebBindings which only exists in the emscripten platform This includesfor now a single cpp file describing th embind bindings This build has only been tested on mac and WSL This is not expected to work in windows The bindings include what is used today by Amazon Sumerian it is expected that other consumers will pull this down and augment the bindings as desired although I suppose it would be possible to bind everything when use PxGeometryQuerysweep sweep box with convexmesh at some direction it return wrong position in the convexmesh what cause it Ive installed cuda for GeForce RTX But when I finished installing I try to use nbody to test There is an error presented by cudaErrorOperatingSystem CUDA error at bodysystemcudaimplh code cudaErrorOperatingSystem cudaGraphicsGLRegisterBuffer mpGRes i mpbo i cudaGraphicsMapFlagsNone Can anyone help me solve this problem Thank you mHullDataHullVertices is allocated with the incorrect size in ConvexHullBuilderinit and ConvexPolygonsBuildercomputeHullPolygons Currently its mHullDataHullVertices reinterpretcastPxVec PXALLOCsizeofPxVec mHullmNbHullVertices PxVec But should be mHullDataHullVertices reinterpretcastPxVec PXALLOCsizeofPxVec mHullmNbHullVertices PxVec Changing the Base SDK to tvOS in the Build Settings of the cmake generated iOS Xcode project allows the successful compilation of tvOS libraries that link and work as expected tvOS is essentially identical to iOS for this kind of library Can we add support for generating tvOS projects as part of the generateprojectssh script How can I compile physx in Linux Have a tutorialThank you
