I am having issues using the shouldUseDeviceOrientation true property when on a flat surface It works fine if I hold the camera up and respects portrait or landscape but when I take a pic of a flat horizontal surface I cant rely on the image being the correct orientation Would be great if I could simply pass a value when I know the orientation I want I am using this SDK and getting an error in the status bar Here is the details and video link When i open camera its freezing and crashing I am using Xcode and iOS Error Attempted to read an unowned reference but the object was already deallocated I am using xcode and iOS Please help migrated to swift Changes iOS build target to Compiles for Swift Working and compiling using Swift If you are interested in merging this to master I can fix the conflicts Thanks When opening up the camera audio from bluetooth headphones lowers to a weird lower and lesser quality volume Sometimes it just cuts off Once the camera closes the audio sometimes returns back to its normal volume I tried messing around with AVAudioSessionCategoryOptions for iOS but cant seem to get the settings right Has anyone else tried opening the camera while listening to music using bluetooth headphones and noticed this Hello guys thank you for your work Is it possible to compile your pod for Swift because im blocked with the new Xcode Thank you very much
