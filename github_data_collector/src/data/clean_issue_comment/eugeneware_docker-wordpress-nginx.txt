Dockerfile gets updated to the latest Ubuntu LTS version Some packages also seems obsolete E Package php fpm has no installation candidate E Package php mysql has no installation candidate E Package phpapc has no installation candidate I think they should be replaced by phpfpm phpmysql and phpapcu Hi guys im absolutely new to Docker so I have one question I followed the tutorial and successfully installed Wordpress on myIP The point is i dont know whats the name of Mysql Database that WP using Is there any way to do that BTW when i was trying to use command mysqlsecureinstallation to log in to Mysql to create more databases i couldnt How should i do I want to make my own Dockerfile with CentOS and my favorite version of Apace PHP and Mysql How can i do that just like what Eugene did And after that i want to deploy wordpress to Amazon EC instance using that images Can someone help me about this I really appreciate it After the process of download docker gave a warning Status
