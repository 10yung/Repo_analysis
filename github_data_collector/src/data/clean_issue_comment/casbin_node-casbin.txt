Hello recently Im having another issue while creating a new userrole I would like to assign some default rights for it We can definitly call multiple times addPolicy but it cannot guarantee that all the default policies have been added Im risking having an invalid user in that case So Im thinking if we could have some wrappers like addPolicies removePolicies addPolicies returns Promisetrue only if all the policies have been added if one of them fails then it cancels this operation remove the ones have been added removePolicies is similar Im trying to create an app where end users can create ABAC policies for resources in my app via a custom UI In a nutshell all attributes would be predefined by me for use in the app and the user would go to the custom UI and select attributes based on the subject action resource and time Can Casbin support such a system Ive been digging into Casbin trying to fully grasp how to use it with ABAC and I feel like the static models would hinder such an endeavor since from my understanding the static model contains the actual logic and seem to be using dot notation to access the attributes on the argument objects Hi Thanks for the nice access control package I have a use case where we wanted to tell the client side that they dont have access to the following attribute when they try to access it But right now the AC only check the roles and allow to filter the attribute in other words gracious style Is there a function for me to inform the roles that their access is denied because they requested the attributes that they dont have access Right now I think I can compare the attributes pre and post filter if its not equal I can throw an error but this will require me to do the same checking like the filter if I want to know which attributes that they dont have access rained you can try Casbin to implement it Im implementing a new model for accounts and users in our application Were now extending it so that users have roles in organizations teams So I might be an admin on one team and a user on another I also see the use for having roles that are a step above all teams where they are admins over all teams might be called Superadmin maxpaj NodeCasbin supports the RBAC with domains model see here In this model domain can also be called tenant or organization as you said The roles are assigned within a domain context Basically what we want is a model that is modular enough so that we can cover a lot of cases You can mix the RBAC model with other models like ACL ABAC RESTful its more flexible than other available auth libraries
