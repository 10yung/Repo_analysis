strokebased and those types of icons are either render incorrectly do not render at all or even cause a crash in some cases It appears that all currently available icons in this package are fillbased Minimal sample repository UnExpected behavior and Screenshots A simple SVG icon like this img width altaisvg src illustrates the problems Adobe Illustrator can export this as an SVG file using any of these three options Inline style svg idLayer datanameLayer xmlns viewBox titlebluerectstyletitle rect x y width height stylefill nonestroke fstrokelinejoin round svg Internal CSS svg idLayer datanameLayer xmlns viewBox defs style cls fill none stroke f strokelinejoin round style defs titleabluerectstylesheettitle rect classcls x y width height svg Presentation Attributes svg idLayer datanameLayer xmlns viewBox titlebluerectpresentationattributestitle rect x y width height fillnone stroke f strokelinejoinround svg The first one causes the Preview site to crash with the following error Uncaught Error The style prop expects a mapping from style properties to values not a string For example stylemarginRight spacing em when using JSX The other two options render incorrectly or not at all I placed the AIexported SVGs with Typeicons and rebuilt the app and then copied the new build to the preview folder and ran the Preview site img width altincorrectsvgrendering src When I inspect the generated SVG elements for Internal CSS icon I see this svg strokecurrentColor fillcurrentColor forcing the fill where should be none strokewidth removing strokes version idLayer x px y px viewBox height em width em xmlns rect x y width height rect svg note that the style tag is gone as well as the class attribute from the rect and for Presentation Attributes one svg strokecurrentColor fillcurrentColor strokewidth idLayer dataNameLayer viewBox height em width em xmlns titletitle title content is gone rect x y width height fillnone stroke f strokelinejoinround rect svg In the latter case the fill is specified explicitly by an attribute so it overrides fillcurrentColor but the stoke is gone because it was not specified explicitly Adobe Illustrator as well as other tools I tried relies on default stroke width of per SVG specs so if it is not set to be a thicker stroke when the icon is designed the strokewidth attribute will not be exported Desktop please complete the following information Device MBP OS macOS Catalina Browser chrome Version Additional context It appears that the following pieces of code are to blame packagesreacticonsscriptsbuildjs remove class attr filter name class filter e etagName style includesetagName packagesreacticonssrciconBasetsx svg strokecurrentColor fillcurrentColor strokeWidth What were the reasons for removing the class attribute and forcing fill and stroke attributes like that PS I have a PR ready but first wanted to make sure it will not break something I am not aware of PPS This might be similar to issue Add lineawesome How often to you update reacticons to pull in new icons that may have been added For example here is a free font awesome icon that you all are not currently pulling in that I would like to use via reacticons Closes Screenshot at AM Add flat color icons as per Closes Note I was unable to get the multiColor true flag to work in my local but perhaps that is due to my lack of knowledge of how to do so Please advise if my changes are insufficient cardimajs Bumps handlebars from to details summaryChangelogsummary Sourced from handlebarss changelog v November th Bugfixes fix add

maintaining this project I find it extremely valuable This PR should be mergeable asis but if not Id love to know of any other things that need to be done when adding an icon library I have Added the submodule for Bootstrap Icons Updated the manifest at packagesreacticonssrciconsindexjs and included the required glob filters for the reverse and fill variants Updated the gitignore for the built icons to include bs Symlinked the forked reacticons library inside of packagepreviewnodemodules and verified that all the new icons appear properly Bonus fixed a previewdocs site issue thats bugged me for a while sorted the sidebar navigation items Thanks again PS If the process I just followed is correct or if not and you let me know whats missing Id be happy to write up a brief contributing doc for future contributors Just let me know Describe the bug Typing Fa followed by the letter U on the search box will crash the demo website Expected behavior Being able to type FaU
