The script on Windows generated an UTF file I had to convert it in UTF to use with hashcat and John Hi Just flipped through the code very cool Have you considered publishing this to the PowerShell Gallery Makes it a bit more discoverable improves reusability other folks can use it as a dependency without much effort simple to install etc Its pretty straightforward and if you dont want to manually do it you could have AppVeyor do it for you each time you commit perhaps with a gate on commit message If youre up for it and would like any help hit me up Cheers
