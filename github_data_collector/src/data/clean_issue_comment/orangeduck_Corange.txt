Ive been adding explanations mostly for file handling to the wiki What other stuff would be missing Is png a format the developer wishes to support Ive had to add a handler for pngs that uses libspng I can create a PR to add it to the main project Here I dont understand why you do time fmodtime aframetime aframecount and then time aframetime for the first frame I am working with CLion and it really likes CMake so I made an implementation The bird in the platformer has weird movement it doesnt seem intuitive it seems to accelerate either too little or too much It would be a good idea to make the buttons add acceleration to the velocity and not edit the velocity directly It would be nice to show whats possible Is there any chance to add CMakeLists support for this project Makefile targets installunix installwin and installwin dont install header files The SDLGLLoadExtension macro is looking for NULL return to determine extension availability that could have undefined behavior From the SDL reference manual if you look up a function that doesnt exist youll get a nonNULL result that is NOT safe to call for Linux at least A more correct form would be something like define SDLGLLoadExtensiontype name if SDLGLExtensionSupportedname name typeSDLGLGetProcAddressname else if SDLGLExtensionSupportednameEXT name typeSDLGLGetProcAddressnameEXT else if SDLGLExtensionSupportednameARB name typeSDLGLGetProcAddressnameARB else fprintfstderr Failed to load any of function s n name In any case I found this problem because when trying Corange I cant load any of the extensions For instance glCreateProgram does not exist in the extension list of glGetStringGLEXTENSIONS and SDLGLExtensionSupported returns false for it as well The context is a im on nvidias latest propietary drivers gtx Any idea why
