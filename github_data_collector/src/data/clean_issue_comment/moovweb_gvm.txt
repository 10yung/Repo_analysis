 When the user changes directories automatically use a compatible Go version or else warn the user that the Go version specified in gomod is not installed Hi voxxit Based on last commits and many unreplied issues it looks like that gvm is abandoned is it If yes can you recommend alternative Thanks Its convenient to provide the ability to change the default base URL for downloading go binaries as the default setting may be not accessible in some regions eg China gvm install go Downloading Go source ERROR Couldnt download Go source Check the logs Usersmcjgvmlogsgodownloadlog log tail f Usersmcjgvmlogsgodownloadlog error RPC failed curl transfer closed with outstanding read data remaining fatal the remote end hung up unexpectedly fatal early EOF fatal indexpack failed Cloning into Usersmcjgvmarchivego Cloning into Usersmcjgvmarchivego error RPC failed curl LibreSSL SSLread SSLERRORSYSCALL errno fatal the remote end hung up unexpectedly fatal early EOF fatal indexpack failed Every time I switch to a new go version some binaries eg go linters in GOBIN must be reinstalled or copied manually which is inconvenient Its really helpful that gvm supports copying or moving binaries in GOBIN between different go versions Running gvm install go or any version gets me Installing go Compiling homemynamegvmscriptsinstall line go command not found ERROR Failed to compile Check the logs at homemynamegvmlogsgogo compilelog ERROR Failed to use installed version The log gives me Building Go cmddist using homemynamego ERROR Cannot find homemynamego bingo Set GOROOTBOOTSTRAP to a working Go tree Go Sometimes I need to run Go command line tools from a privileged environment However gvm is trickier to use with sudo The best Ive found so far is sh sudo E bash go gvm or custom go tool here exit However it would be more convenient to have a oneline syntax for this kind of command call Any tips I tried sudo E tonixxx clean boil and sudo E bash c tonixxx clean boil but strangely they were not able to receive my full environment so bash was not able to find my tonixxx binary like it can in a normal user shell I am loading gvm from direnv in case that matters Sure you can list them and pick the latest but that requires manual intervention a Get Latest option would also be useful for scripts Not sure if this project is being actively developed from looking at the info here on git
