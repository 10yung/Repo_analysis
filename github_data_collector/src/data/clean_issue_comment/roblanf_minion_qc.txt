First off Thanks for this great tool Its very useful I have a feature request for you to consider The current guppy basecaller has an option called calibdetect When engaged this will detect reads that match the preloaded calibration strands some lambda DNA I believe and create several additional columns of information in the sequencingsummarytxt file Calibration strand reads seem to be around kb in length One great addition to your script could be one more summary plots describing the reads that were tagged as calibration strands especially their estimated accuracy Cheers Mike Axtell Hi All Im wondering if you can help me I am trying to run my barcodesummarytxt file generated from demuxing with Guppy Any ideas why it failed Or maybe I cant use this file and I didnt notice in the literature Cheers Peter Screenshot at Hello Rob I am having some problems with the program when it gets to the combining point individually everything works very smoothly with all the relevant files produced INFO Analysing data from all flowcells combined Error in rbindlistresults Item of list input is not a dataframe datatable or list Calls asdataframe rbindlist Execution halted Do you know what the issue might be It is looking at promethion flow cells so quite a large data set Thanks Caitlin Hi I am working on including support for MinIONQC in MultiQC which is a fantastic results aggregator So far I have added results using summaryyaml see this html file for its current state multiqcreporthtmlzip Your feedback is welcome But what would be truly useful is including plots below as this would enable easier comparison of plots across samples yieldovertime qbyhour readsperhour lengthbyhour This would require raw data output for above plots from MinIONQC It would be great if you could enable writing relevant plot raw data as output as csv json etc PS If you would like to try my dev version of MultiQC follow these steps git clonedownload the repo cd MultiQC python setuppy develop multiqc

supported by minionqc It appears they are incompatible but I wonder if I can make it work with a bit of data manipulation I looked up the headers in sequencingsummarytxt from your example data and minKnows output and there are some discrepancies besides column order In particular columns passesfiltering and numcalledtemplate are missing from minKnow data Can they be made compatible without too much of work from example file filename readid runid channel starttime duration numevents passesfiltering templatestart numeventstemplate templateduration numcalledtemplate sequencelengthtemplate
