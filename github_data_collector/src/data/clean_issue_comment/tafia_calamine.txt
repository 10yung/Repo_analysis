Would it be possible to add Excel table support The ability to identify cell ranges that are part of tables Im guessing it would similar to javaapachepoi XSSFWorkbook wb new XSSFWorkbookinp for int iSheet iSheet wbgetNumberOfSheets iSheet XSSFSheet sheet wbgetSheetAtiSheet TreeMapString XSSFTable orderTable new TreeMap for XSSFTable xlTable wbgetSheetAtiSheetgetTables CellReference endCell xlTablegetEndCellReference CellReference startCell xlTablegetStartCellReference for iRow startCellgetRow iRow endCellgetRow iRow Row row sheetgetRowiRow for iCol startCellgetCol iCol endCellgetCol iCol do the things do the things RUST Crate googlesheets Akin to Google Sheets Python API The RangeDeserialize and RangeDeserializeBuilder functionality is great but its not immediately clear that these functions are closely integrated with serde All the examples show the values being deserialized into a tuple but I think it would be good to have at least one example somewhere showing how it can be deserialized into a struct in combination with serde timexlsx timexlsx is composed of one cell This cell recognized as Float I expect as String Is this the intended behavior The test code is below test fn time setup let path formatteststimexlsx envCARGOMANIFESTDIR let mut excel Xlsx openworkbook pathunwrap let range excelworksheetrangeSheet unwrapunwrap rangeeqrange String tostring Hello I was wondering if there was a way to find the name of the author of a sheet in the same way the file command filexls Composite Document File V Document Little Endian Os Windows Version Code page Author AUTHORNAME Last Saved By AUTHORNAME Last Printed Wed Apr Create TimeDate Wed Apr Last Saved TimeDate Wed Apr Security I dont find anything in the documentation I have to read excel sheets with headers where the header row is not the first row I currently try to solve this by first using rangerowsenumeratefind to get a row that contains the header names I expect and then using the index of that row to get a subrange of my original range I introduced a bug by using the index I got from that process as the new start and therefore started at eg row instead of I fixed that by adding the found header index to the current range start I guess this is kind of hard to use Its a nonzipped XML Or some maybe somework to be done to do it In my excel sheet Ive got a column with dates Unfortunately calamineDateType has no variant for dates and when I handle a date as a string I get for It would be nice to have builtin date conversion This seems like a file format that fits very well with the possible applications for Calamine
