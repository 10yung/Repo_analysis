testassertions and spies deprecate old assertionmethods e e ba dad a Security The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th Bugfixes fix use Stringfield in lookup when checking for constructor d test add fluent API for testing Handlebars c ac c

It would make the code much more cleaner I would suggest to make presentational components functional instead of class based Functional components are not dressed up with any of the capabilities of React component objects and hence there may be performance advantages It would be great to have this project as video series or as step by step tutorial where you learn bit by bit and have a functional product in the end Hi clintonwoo Thanks for your awesome React app This app has two errors on executing npm test I fixed them If you like these changes please merge this Pull Request Jest setting is missing I ran npm test and got the following message SecurityError localStorage is not available for opaque origins Test Suites failed total Tests total Snapshots total Time s estimated s Ran all test suites npm ERR Test failed See above for more details I think that Jest settings are missing I added testEnvironment node parameter to packagejson fail to initialize Apollo for testing After setting testEnvironment I run npm test again and got the following error message thispropsserverStateapollodata isnt initialized TypeError Cannot read property data of undefined Test Suites failed passed total Tests failed passed total Snapshots passed total Time s Ran all test suites npm ERR Test failed See above for more details Im not sure is this a coding mistake I switched to from thispropsserverStateapollodata I dont know if this chage is a correct fix finally After fixing them all test passed Test Suites passed total Tests passed total Snapshots passed total Time s Ran all test suites I wanted to say congrats for the nice project I was thinking it would be nice to have a rendered UI as close as possible as the original one Some time ago I started a csshtml clone of the Hacker News UI just for fun I was trying to reproduce the same pixel perfect result on the browser but with better markup bleah those tables and with flexbox Do you think you can improve it Or either would you accept a PR with some code introducing a result but with better markup Looking at I decided to go ahead and try swprecache The plugin doesnt actually cache anything while webpack in compiletime but is caching runtime and returning cached assets when the app is offline The service worker gets registered only in the index route but should consider if it would be better to do globally I also added NODEENVproduction flag for the build step as otherwise the next app was not build with production mode for me locally I tested this with npm start afterwards and it included webpackhmr requests
