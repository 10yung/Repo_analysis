Recently the community has undergone name change from Perl Raku Here are the recommendations for file extensions Since rakudo release raku interpreter is available to execute raku scripts Example raku scriptraku So to reflect this I have edited the files with new extensions updated readme I installed and tested in local linux machine with rakudo and it indeed works May be name change of the repo would make it uniform with the raku changes Thanks Thanks for your excellent work However what if someone cannot install this kernel by zef Is there a way to manually install Hi there This link takes me to jupyterlab environment where I can find Python and Perl notebooks While Python notebook works without any issues Perl notebook does not execute codes in the notebook and console both Though the cell execution time is instantaneous in Python cells it is still slowthough improved significantly in Perl cells What am I missing Regards Suman per ugexe
