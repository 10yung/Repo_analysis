Does Pears support LESS In your readme Pears is an open source WordPress theme Ill admit the code is a bit rough initially based on the default twentyone theme Did you mean Twenty Ten disclaimer i am a github noob so i apologize if this is not the place to ask this I noticed stylecss is probably just from the old TwentyTen theme but Id like to use it Its in the themes root folder and I have added a reference to it from headerphp I can see the style sheet if i go directly to the url but the site doesnt recognize it Is it because it has to be a less file I tried to change it to that too but no luck Is anyone using a custom style sheet for this I dont want to have to ftp screenless every time i have a change Cant seem to figure out how to replicate the static welcome page from pears in my local Wordpress installation Any ideas I was looking for a way to use Sass snippets rather than CSS snippets so I did some digging and discovered a very useful API for compiling CSS using preprocessors Ive modified the functionsphp file to include the following configurations php Setup for CSS preprocessors Possible options here css sass scss less stylus defineSTYLETYPE scss defineCOMPASS true if youre using Sassscss will you be using compass Simply update those to use your CSS preprocessor of choice Hopefully this will be useful to others pI havent done extensive testing on which special characters but my case caused fairly serious issues Im creating a style guide and wanted to mark up codeprecode and codecodecode outputs The example output isp pre code php code codeecho Hello Worldcode code code pre pWhen I used this initially the page treated the angle brackets as closing tags which then caused everything below to act oddly In the Pears HTML field I replaced the angle brackets as followsp pre code php code codeecho Hello Worldcode code code pre pWhen I update the page this fixes the page but the Pears HTML field replaces the entities with the characters they would render to causing subsequent updates to be broken again I dont know how many other special characters do would do this or how many of those would cause page issues after submissionp Hi Dan I just made small commit to my fork to focus display on your Pears project As I want to use Pears to show some accessibility snippets I need and want to improve some small accessibility details You used reset and doubled it by outline none to links So I put it back and made it greenish to be nice with your great layout Check this out hope you like If you dont maybe you could just remove outline none from everywhere to leave default focus enabled All the best Dominik diff git afooterphp bfooterphp index e d fb d afooterphp bfooterphp p classccThis work is licensed under a a rellicense href Commons AttributionNonCommercialShareAlike Unported Licenseap pa href idsbimg srcwpcontentthemespearsimagessbblackpng ap pa href idsbimg srcphp bloginfotemplatedirectory imagessbblackpng ap div footer jQuery After a couple days of use I felt the difficulty of editing the patterns on the front end without having tab and shifttab in the text areas so I added it Now you can use LESS and it will compile to css on the fly updated jquery version in use adding jquery color to help with user feedback textarea flashes red for invalid LESS and green for valid changed single layout a bit notes up top less to left css to right html below
