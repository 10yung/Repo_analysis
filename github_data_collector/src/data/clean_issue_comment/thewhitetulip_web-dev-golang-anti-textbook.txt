Hi Im interested in contributing for this project translating it into Tagalog Is it okay for me to do so Thanks Good evening This project looks great I am a gopher from China Maybe I want to translate the Chinese version Can I have a try You are teaching people some bad practices by not hashing passwords You should never store plain text passwords If we look at Parameterised routing within the Basic web application section I believe this comment is misleading While it may be used later to retrieve the task id and delete this is not the case here This will be an open issue for those who want to be collaborators While this might well be the shortest way you found to demonstrate the output you wanted training users toward this function stands a good chance of them trying to use it to solve early problems it is not suitable for The database part is using sqlite which is a pain to install and adds more complexity to the end user I suggest there should be another section which uses nosql which is pure go I suggest bolt I willl be happpy to write that section about bolt as I have been using it for fun and even have this library to help with bolt The benefits of adding options to use bolt will be Fast setup The readers will be fast up and running following the examples The examples are less complext meaning it can also be a way for readers to have a handy perspective of how real web apps might look like
