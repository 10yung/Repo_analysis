Hi sbousseaden First thanks a lot for sharing your work I guess it hours and hours of lab Your repo is a real good idea for blueteams and SOC You give a nice try to cover the ATTA CK matrix but some artefacts may have a different format than logs and evtx For example it can be PCAP files for an network scan fingerprint In addition it can be interesting when testing to know to generate those events I share sources for pentesting cheatsheets which can help covering some TTPs in the references I would be please to contribute to this repo BR
