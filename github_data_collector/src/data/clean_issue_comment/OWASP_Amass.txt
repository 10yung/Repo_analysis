It would be interesting to be able to run amass as a daemon and be able to submit requests via a webapi and retrieve the results in a service bus like RabbitMq panic runtime error invalid memory

Has anyone managed to get to work in Parallel or if not have a idea of why it will not work in parallel or of a work around I could use Hi what is thr exact go get link for amass the link provided at the page doesnt seem to work go get v u githubcomOWASPAmassv I am filing this as a new issue to avoid clogging up a closed issue I am seeing this with the latest using the release binary for Linux x on Ubuntu passive will return hundreds of results but replacing passive with ip will return no or occasionally very few results even though spotchecking some of the subdomains found passively shows that they do actually resolve to IP addresses or CNAMEs Heres a minimal example which demonstrates the above amass enum v passive src noalts include Pastebin d twittercom Querying Pastebin for

twittercom subdomains No names were discovered Spot checking one of the passive subdomains shows that it does in fact resolve host mobiletwittercom mobiletwittercom has address mobiletwittercom has address mobiletwittercom has address mobiletwittercom has address This is on a home network with no DNS interception or rewriting and no VPN although I did try it over a VPN as well just to avoid any issues with my home network and got the same results I also built the Docker image and ran it that way getting the same results No names were discovered After some bisecting it seems to me like it stopped working between and but Im not sure If I capture the network traffic in Wireshark whilst the Amass command is running I can actually see the valid DNS response coming back from one of the DNS servers but for some reason Amass is ignoring it there are no messages printed about falsepositives or falsenegatives relating to the DNS resolvers caffix Please let me know if theres anything else I can do to help debug this Thank you I just installed amass I wanted to run amass enum passive d domaincom But its showing me an error panic runtime error invalid memory address or nil pointer

this could be the reason why it happens OS version Ubuntu LTS Screen Shot at AM According to the documentation a TinkerPop server is supported However with the Commit a d bb d bf da it appears all
