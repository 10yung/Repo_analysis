Being log spammed with the following Passing info command to redis as is administrative commands cannot be effectively namespaced and should be called on the redis connection directly passthrough has been deprecated and will be removed in redisnamespace at usrlocallitabuilds vendorbundleruby gemslita liblitahandlersinforb in redisinfo Anything that can be done to stop the logspam as it looks to be causing the bot to crash after a couple days These are being written every time a new message comes through Is it possible to add an HTTP URL for an adapter I know this can be added for handlers but when I tro to add it for an adapter I receive the following error Gem Load Error is undefined local variable or method http for LitaAdaptersGlipClass Hi guys Im curently using the slack app bot to post the interactive message with button into slack and return the command to call lita working the rest ex save data I try to get this script working only on bot lita of course but I cannot find anyway to get lita to handle the callback message from itself after pressing on Save button Please advice me some guides for this thanks I am trying to create a new handler and Lita does not seem to be registering it I am running Lita version and ruby I have used the lita handler command to generate the scaffolding of the handler and just added the basic echo example as the handler code I have created a gem and deployed it to my internal gem repo I see that bundle install is pulling in my gem along with other community handlers but when asking lita echo hello nothing happens and no errors are thrown also saying help there is not any refernce to echo here is my handler codethis is just the echo example ruby module Lita module Handlers class EchoHandler Handler route echo s echo command true help echo TEXT Replies back with TEXT def echoresponse responsereplyresponsematches end end LitaregisterhandlerEchoHandler end end other than a few changes in the gemspec to remove TODO that is all I have modified from the autogenerated files Is there something else I need to for the handler to be registered Is there a way to check to see if it is loaded I have put Lita in debug but there is no info related to my handler Is there a way I can configure Lita to send requests to slack and any other selected http endpoints using a proxy Hey so I have a sufficiently complex plugin that has multiple subcomponents The reason these components are all in one plugin is because they have a large amount of shared dependencies and keeping them together just makes everything easier to maintain The problem is that it appears the default configuration builder doesnt really handle namespacing as the documentation seems to indicate I have a test that exposes the issue but before I went to far in trying to address it I wanted to make sure that this is something that youd want to support ruby context with multiple handlers with the same namespace do it has all the attributes for each handler do registryregisterhandlerfoo config bar default baz registryregisterhandlermoo do namespace foo config mar default maz end registryregisterhandlertoo do namespace foo config tar default taz end expectconfighandlersfoobarto eqbaz expectconfighandlersfoomarto eqmaz expectconfighandlersfootarto eqtaz end end the result of this test is this LitaDefaultConfiguration handlers config with multiple handlers with the same namespace has all the attributes for each handler FailureError expectconfighandlersfoobarto eqbaz NoMethodError undefined method bar for LitaConfiguration x ff a ae b Did you mean tar speclitadefaultconfigurationspecrb in block levels in top required Is this the intended behavior Is this something that Lita even supports I am adding lita as a bot to our whole org but I want to be able to restrict access to some critical plugins github or CodeDeploy integrations to the engineers Currently I believe I need to fork these gems to restrict the routes to the right Lita group Or is there a way to do this at a global level that I missed If this does not exist Ill take a jab at a PR for this Hi Im working on an adapter for Discord the existing one doesnt support oauth properly imo For this Im also trying to override the default help command to generate something specific to discord ie Im putting everything in a code block and aligning the content to a sort of table I was able to get this to work by adding a new command to the adapter but Lita still outputs the default help command output too Is it possible to disable this default help command Hi I try to have Lita BOT to sendmessages to a hipchat room but never succeeded Here are my code ruby def gettargetbyuserowner user LitaUserfindbynameowner Need to prevent the user does not exist in hipchat return nil if usernil return LitaSourcenewuser user end def gettargetbyroomroom room LitaRoomfindbynameroom Need to prevent the user does not exist in hipchat return nil if roomnil robotjoinroom return
