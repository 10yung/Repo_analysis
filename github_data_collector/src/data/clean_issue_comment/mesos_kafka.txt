When mesos agent start with isolationcgroupsdevicesfilesystemlinuxgpunvidia For example sudo binmesosagentsh ip nohostnamelookup master workdirworkdatamesosslavels noswitchuser isolationcgroupsdevicesfilesystemlinuxgpunvidia then the broker start will failed with timeout kafkamesossh broker start Error broker start timeout we found the gpunvidia isolation is the real cause Without gpunvidia everything works fine Added support for rest apis with json requests Modified test cases for testing the jsonr requests Here is the reference Error Message Error resolving plugin id deundercouchdownload version Could not GET peer not authenticated Resolution Updating to gradle and deundercouchdownload to fixed to issue I updated buildgradle and gradlewrapperproperties in this PR Since commit ed ff c fc a f ef b a ca f b The listeners config is forced to only PLAINTEXT when bindaddress is defined which effectively disable the ability to use more than one listeners This will be useful in dynamic reservations Modifications Added a disk param to the Broker Model disk size defaults to Added Test cases for Disk params Hi I used mesoskafka in mesos version However it was not started up because it was built mesos version So I update mesos version to I checked running in mesos version Please this pull request Thanks We have hit this issues multiple times where the framework is restarted when brokers are starting up during reconciliation the framework fails to register an endpoint on that broker as it does not recognise TASKSTARTING as a valid state This eventually leaves the broker state as follows when running js id task id kafka a db a c a cc db slaveId c ad fa a fbbcf e c a S executorId kafka ae e a d d d d hostname localhost attributes state running As the framework knows the hostname and port from the mesos offer it receives that the broker will start up on wouldnt it make sense to add the endpoint initially when launching the task rather than appending to it after the task has started System Status Operating System CentOS Kernal Version el x Zookeeper Mesos mesoskafka master or both occurred same error I kept receiving error when I start broker It is ok to show broker list and add broker kafkamesossh broker list brokers id active true state starting resources cpus mem heap portauto jvmoptions failover delay m maxdelay m stickiness period m metrics collected underreplicatedpartitions offlinepartitionscount isactivecontroller kafkamesossh broker start Error javaioIOException javalangNullPointerException This is my kafkamesosproperties mesos and master is hostname it is saved in etchosts debugtrue uservagrant storagezkkafkamesos masterzkmaster mesos zkmesos mesos mesos api It is difficult to figure out that I did setup wrongly Could you help me We had several occasions where the mesos slave with running broker got restarted the framework tries to reconcile the broker task then the framework got restarted while the broker state is reconciling saved in zk after that the framework will be stuck due to the reconciling broker state which wasnt reconciling at all It will not start any brokers even though the broker is no longer running the only way I found to fix this is to manually go into zk kafkamesos node and delete all the task broker attributes that contains reconciling state from the brokers json The code causing this problem Maybe it should resume the reconciliation or remove the check all together rather than do nothing if the state is reconciling I m doing a POC to deploy Kafka as an application on Mesos Cluster I came across these codebases on github One developed by apachemesos github page other developed by mesosphere and can run only on DCOS github page Question Would like to know if there are any differences between DCOSKafka mesosKafka in terms of features and extended functionality Regarding MesosKafka I don t see active participation on github and some open issues for mesoskafka in the past months Can I assume that the service is robust enough that I can use in production environment Any Inputs on this would be helpful Not sure if this is the correct place to ask or not
