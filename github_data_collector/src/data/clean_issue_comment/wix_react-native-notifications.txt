reactnativenotifications buildgradle comgooglefirebasefirebasecore comgooglefirebasefirebaseiid comgooglefirebasefirebasemessaging Thanks Apparently the README is a bit outdated I am using RN and V and can not get it to build correctly In main application i keep geting cannot resolve symbol wix for import and of course i am getting below cannot resolve symbol RNNotificationsPackage I followed guide under android installation Should this package link automatically or should i link it manually I tried solution from but it did not work for me Hello Is this package capable of being used for GPS based notifications I want people to upload stuff and tell people about it in there vicinity So in my app already have the GPS location of the users when opening the app user A uploads something and wants to notify people in a mile radius around them People inside this mile radius receive the push notification and other people dont Is this possible with this Enviroment react reactnative reactnativenotifications Problem I am not receiving any notification data when the app is in the background expected behaviour user taps on notification in the notification tray the app launches and the notification data appears in the RemoteNotificationOpened event actual behaviour user taps on notification in the notification tray the app launches and the notification data does not appear in the RemoteNotificationOpened event Note When the app is in the foreground the notification data comes as expected I am using reactnativenotifications library to receive notifications in a reactnative mobile app I dont want to set up the notificationrelated listeners until the user has provided permission to receive notifications Q The documentation says that it is highly recommended to keep listeners registration at global scope rather than at screen scope What problems should I expect if I set up listeners at a screen at which the user is asked to provide permission Q The device token listener NotificationsAndroidsetRegistrationTokenUpdateListener does NOT seem to work if it is inside a promise What am I missing here Please see my code below javascript This function is called when the user clicks on the button Provide permission to receive notifications const requestPermissionNotification async let hasPermission false try hasPermission await NotificationsAndroidisRegisteredForRemoteNotifications catch error Alertalert Notification To utilise the full functionality of this app Permission to receive notifications is required text Ok end of trycatch if hasPermission A Register Token THIS LISTENER DOES NOT SEEM TO WORK UNLESS IT IS SET UP OUTSIDE THE COMPONENT NotificationsAndroidsetRegistrationTokenUpdateListenerdeviceToken

on android version and Im currently using wix reactnativenotifications and found that the READMEmd for this version no longer exists I believe its because of the new version coming up However could you provide the previous READMEmd
