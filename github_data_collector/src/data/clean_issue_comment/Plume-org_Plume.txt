Many activitypub servers are starting to enable Mastodon style authorized fetch for security reasons As plume does not sign the user fetches this means it is not possible to fetch actor information from these servers The current solution is rather hacky but it is the best we can figure out without more input and guidance The ideal solution is to have a quasi actor that can sign these requests and be transparent to the user As of now it merely fetches the first local user that comes to hand and signs the request with their information Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Currently there is no data structure used to save update metadata on a blog entry Describe the solution youd like Add updated field to a blog entry then add this metadata on the blog page for example Capture d e cran a Additional context This feature is also required by Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I am frustrated that Plume insists on capitalizing my blog names and tags when I have taken care to enter lowercase words only The funny thing is that the slug for blog entries are all lowercase even when one or more words have been capitalized Describe the solution youd like I would like Plume to use the casing I have entered instead of secondguessing me Describe alternatives youve considered In my opinion the entire URL ought to be lowercased no matter what has been entered The onpage text should be displayed exactly as entered by the author Cheers As soon as I created my account some bot elsewhere on the fediverse called Federation Bot immediately followed me To prevent things like this Id like to be able to manually approve or deny requests for a follow subscription instead of having it just go through This wont affect Atom feeds of course but it does stop rogue fediverse bots like this trying to massfollow people Describe your bug explaining how to reproduce it and what was expected I published an article on I expected that the article would be editable after publishing eg for updating or correcting mistakes Please fill the following information when relevant or remove them if not Plume version Web Browser Firefox Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe It may be hard to understand why a post is in one of our timelines especially in the case of someone boostinglinking someone else you dont follow or when the same post appears multiple times because it got boosted Describe the solution youd like Adding a little X boostedliked indicator to each concerned card Describe alternatives youve considered None
