 Expected Behavior Hi I want to know how does mitie deal with the segmentation of OOV In fact two of my train example like this The daily life of the League Of Legends name on November chinese name The daily life of the Tomb Raider name on November chinese name My training sample is in Chinese which contains many entities related to the game name Some game names contain numbers some have no numbers like and In the example above I want mitie to identify the entities as and the is a simple representation of the datewhich should not be include Current Behavior I label the entity correctlyHowever the first sample is often identified as rather than How can I deal with this problem I try to add several databut Its work Should I add more data Version Where did you get MITIE pip install Platform windows and linux BUG REPORT TEMPLATE Delete the above instructions and then provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above Then fill out the template below Expected Behavior Tell us what should happen What were you doing What part of MITIE are you using What do you think should happen So Im using the namedentityextractor trained it on some data then extracting entities from some data the model has never seen before using the extractentities Expecting to get back the extracted entities with their scores ranging Current Behavior The entities are extracted correctly but the score is Steps to Reproduce Provide an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce this problem Include code to reproduce if relevant Train model give it new data get back score Version downloaded on th of July Where did you get MITIE Github Platform bit Behaviour and Step to Reproduce When I running on GB RAM and GB swap it uses full ram and GB swap but still GB free on the swap Why It raises stdbadalloc instead of using the rest of swap Version Where did you get MITIE Clone latest Platform Ubuntu Compiler GNU Make Hi davisking Is it possible to train my NER model using GPU How to annotate for large text file Any suggestions for appropriate tools to be used We are using Windows PRO Bit with RASA and Mitie version My RAM is GB and Processor CPU Ghz PageFile says MB used available Im running MITIE with examples with threads It took hours and throw exception I have uploaded the exception message what i get mitieissue mitiepyline in savedisk iffmitiesavenamedentityextractorpuremodelfilename selfobj OSError exception access viloation reading x Also my model contains only trainingdatajson other files like entityextractordatintentclassifierdat metadatajsonregexfeaurizerjson are not generated But when i test the same with only examples its all good Hi When I try to run nerpy I get the following error File C Users xxxx rasanlu MITIE examples python nerpy line in module from mitie import File C Users xxxx rasanlu MITIE examples python mitielib mitiepy line in module

xxxx rasanlu MITIE mitielib src and C Users xxxx rasanlu MITIE mitielib include why is it not able to get to the function call need help sorry guys its not exactly issue but its information i need guys please tell me why default C used in mitie when we are doing cross validation with taking input minC maxC and epsilon i believe we are using cross validation for choosing best hyper parameterC epsilon then what is the use of defining C i know what is the use of C regularisation hyper parameter my problem is i tried with different value of C but keeping other value as it is and every time i got same Accuracy and F score with different best C value why is it so please see log C num training samples C fscore C fscore C fscore C fscore C fscore C fscore C fscore C fscore C fscore C fscore C

baali scotthaleen avitale kecsap lopuhin davisking jinyichao avitale I have a large amount of texts which I want to test through the python examples My question is The annotated data I am going to provide does it have to be split up into sentences Do I have the ability to pass a whole text with multiple sentences paragraphs and lines and thus the range numbers of each entity be based on the word counting of the whole document and not each sentence separately Based on the comment of the inner code for example on trainnerpy When you train a namedentityextractor you need to get a dataset of sentences or sentence or paragraph length chunks of text where each sentence is annotated with the entities you want to find I would like to make clearer the part on the paragraph length chunks of text Thank you in advance how can i improve this situation give me some suggestion please
