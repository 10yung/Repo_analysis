auth Could not log sqlactiverecord event NoMethodError undefined method name for nilNilClass PGError ERROR zerolength delimited identifier at or near LINE SELECT users FROM users WHERE users LIMIT This happens when the currentuser method is called Whats odd is that in rails db this works dgap select firstname email from users where id RECORD firstname bridget email bridgetcnncom but in console I get the same error as above ruby Userfind Could not log sqlactiverecord event NoMethodError undefined method name for nilNilClass ActiveRecordStatementInvalid PGError ERROR zerolength delimited identifier at or near LINE SELECT users FROM users WHERE users LIMIT and ruby User returns the models attributes Its as if it suddenly cant tell what column to id with All required columns contain values This started happening after I made a back up of the users table dgap create table usersbak as select from users Then I removed some users dgap delete from users where id The user with an id of one is definitely still there So I restored the table dgap alter table users rename to usersborken dgap alter table usersbak rename to users and Im still getting the same errors libcontrollerauthenticationrb def currentuser currentuser Userfindsession userid if session userid end Untouched Thoughts Any insight would be greatly appreciated Steve I used the niftyscaffold to generate a scaffold for my preexisting Media model The scaffold generated the following paths amongst others as part of the scaffold editmediapath newmediapath This caused a NameError and when I checked rake routes I discovered that the RESTful resource routing had defined them as editmediumpath newmediumpath From my explorations it seems that Rails routing creates these paths based on the classify method but that the Nifty scaffolding uses something else This may be a problem in Rails itself too because the formfor method does not correctly identify the appropriate paths either when using the short form as defined in but I would appreciate it if other more knowledgeable people could confirm that this is indeed a real issue and that Im not just forgetting something I ended up not only having to modify the paths of the scaffold but also have to add conditional code to the forms to assign the appropriate path and method Without this fix the login form isnt displayed if you arent using authlogic Thanks for the great gem
