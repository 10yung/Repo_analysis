license report to track scan status in your README Below are docs for integrating FOSSA license checks into your CI CircleCI TravisCI Jenkins Other As mentioned on the forum I tried to use API Notebooks with our TransportAPI RAML but hit a problem with the json extensions in our resource names TransportAPI RAML My test notebook We define resources with a with a json extension For example one API URL is Because the resource is named nearjson the typeahead feature isnt finding it all and it doesnt seem to be possible to call the endpoint I guess I would hope to use javascript looking like this transportapiukbusstopsneargetparams API Notebook only seems to support RAML Attempting to use a RAML file prompts the error message Unsupported RAML version RAML Apologies if this is more of a question than an issue it seems strange this has not been flagged previously Is support for RAML available or else planned at all Thanks When running the last item The songs details will be in the

status Thanks I am trying to generate documentation for a hyphenated url portalicdcodes but I am not able to access the route clientportalicdcodes from api notebook Error ReferenceError code is not defined at eval eval at anonymous anonymous at eval anonymous at at frun at e Hey guys I am creating documentation using this tool to show how people can use my REST API but API Notebook plugin and ramlclientgenerator are using different syntax to create clients and make calls so someone cant copy code and make it work locally I was wondering if it is possible to use ramlclientgenerator inside Notebooks Or maybe there is a package that has the same API as Notebooks and I couldnt find it It would make writing documentation so much easier Cheers I am a newer about the apinotebook when I try to expose it as a webapp through grunt build It did not works well it noticed cant establish a connection to the server at localhost The second problem I met is that how I can use the local raml file rather than url APIcreateClientusers home apiraml it did not work well Thank you very much
