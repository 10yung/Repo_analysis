Sometimes quite often when I edit an existing annotation Im able to open it and edit the text but when I want to savecommit it kbdCc Cckbd I get the following error and nothing is saved pdfinfoquery epdfinfo No such annotation annot To be able to commit the annotation I then need to revert the PDFView buffer and openeditcommit the annotation again which is quite annoying I tried to find more details about what is causing this error but it really looks like it happens randomly I guess it could be caused by incompatibility with some minor modes I use see below but I was not able to determine which Any help with solving this issue is appreciated Enabled minor modes AsyncBytecompPackage AutoComposition AutoCompression AutoEncryption AutoInsert Cua DeleteSelection DesktopSave

upgrade pdftools on my Debian system with vanilla Emacs It fails to rebuild the server with the following output Configuring and compiling autoreconf i configureac installing arlib configureac

software in a nonstandard prefix Alternatively you may set the environment variables popplerCFLAGS and popplerLIBS to avoid the need to call pkgconfig See the pkgconfig man page for more details Build failed o Note maybe try the d option Comint exited abnormally with code at Mon Dec I have the same packages installed that worked fine before I have tried building from GitHub too but here it claims that cask is missing even though I have installed it I hope theres a fix for this because reverting to DocView really feels like a downgrade I switched my Emacs configuration from Debian to Windows My config for pdftools remains unchanged I noticed however that text rendering in pdftools now is fuzzy The text is blurry and though readable is not clear Only if I toggle the Window frame to full size the whole screen then the text is clear This issue is unique to Emacs developmental and cannot be reproduced in Emacs I recently removed my elpa directory and had packageel reinstall all my packages which includes pdftools since I installed it from MELPA I also use usepackage and it turned out that my particular usepackage declaration for pdftools actually caused a problem Since Im using a usepackage declaration that is similar to John Wiegleys example here Ive come to wonder what the correct declaration would be and whether it would be a good idea to add it to the README In this Github issue you suggest the following declaration emacslisp usepackage pdfloader config pdfloaderinstall However in my case this doesnt work because I also bind some keys in pdfviewmodemap in my usepackage declaration and just loading pdfloader doesnt seem to define this key map The background story After blowing away my elpa directory and letting Emacs repopulate it I ran into the problem that whenever I tried opening a pdf file I got the following warning pdfoccurelc failed to define function pdfoccurglobalminormode The warning turns up a few times in the issues reported on Github but there was no solution that solved the issue for me In particular the suggestion to reinstall the package didnt work because that was basically what triggered the error in the first place So I started digging into this and I found that pdfoccurel hadnt been compiled properly the file pdfoccurelc did not contain any byte code This turned out to be caused by the fact that pdfoccurel has require pdftools combined with the fact my usepackage config is for the package pdftools and has config pdftoolsinstall in it Because of the require statement in pdfoccurel compiling this file caused pdftoolsel to be loaded Because of the config section in my usepackage declaration loading this file also caused the function pdftoolsinstall to be called Since I was installing the package in a fresh instance meaning the server epdfinfo didnt exist pdftoolsinstall proceeded to compile epdfinfo That compilation went fine but it somehow caused the compilation of pdfoccurel to fail The file pdfoccurelc is created so pdfoccurel is not loaded instead but it is empty I know its the building of epdfinfo that causes the compilation of pdfoccurel to fail because if I answer n to the question whether I want to build epdfinfo pdfoccurel compiles fine John Wiegleys usepackage example for pdftools passes noquery to the call to pdftoolsinstall but I dont So to try and put it in a nut shell if you have a usepackage declaration for pdftools and the config section calls pdftoolsinstall and if you then uninstall pdftools restart Emacs and reinstall pdftools youll likely run into this problem I have a document for which forward and backward search works with auctex Its a multifile doc However neither direction works when a specific source file When I invoke the auctex view command in this source file I get epdfinfo Destination not found Equally when I click on a location in the PDF which corresponds to that source file I get the same error message Here are some useless logs synctexbackwardsearchredactedmainpdf ERR Destination not found synctexforwardsearchredactedmainpdfredactedintrotex ERR Destination not found Any ideas How could I debug this further When I use Cc Ca t to annotate a pdf I get a picture that blocks out part of the text right in the middle of the page but nothing to indicate where the annotation has been placed on the page A yellow label appears only when the mouse pointer happens to roll over that position as shown in the picture below mouse pointer moved away to operate screen capture The ocred Chinese text has its own issues as plaintext is jumbled up So markup annotation is out of the question Is there a way to fix this Is there a way to copy the text of a highlighted region annotation from the pdf to the kill ring without manually selecting the region s boundaries again I use orgnoter to bulk extract the text of all the highighted regions in the pdf It works fine Occasionally I would like to copy to the kill ring the text of just one highlight Currently I have to select manually again with the mouse the startend boundaries of the same region which i already highighted Is there a smarter way to do this By the way thanks for pdftools which I find very usefull in my research work I think that I have to have a similar issue to and as I recently went into the package manager in Emacs and upgraded pdftools package On restarting Emacs I was asked whether I want to rebuild the epdfinfo program at which I encountered the following error homejkochemacsdelpapdftools buildserver Failed to recognize this system trying to continue Configuring and compiling configure q make s Preparing installation files Installing Finished configure error in homejkochemacsdelpapdftools buildserver configure error no acceptable C compiler found in PATH See configlog for more details Build failed o Note maybe try the d option Comint exited abnormally with code at Mon Nov I have tried to remove pdftools completely and install fresh but this did not work I am somewhat confused as to what has changed on my system since the last time I upgraded pdftools Any insights would be most appreciated as pdftools is a great package
