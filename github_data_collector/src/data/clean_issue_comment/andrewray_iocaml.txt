 Hi there I tried installing iocaml via opam ie opam install iocaml but it failed Gathering sources iocaml Archive in cache iocamlkernel Archive in cache Processing actions ERROR The compilation of iocamlkernel failed at gmake all Processing iocamlkernel gmake uninstall ERROR while installing iocamlkernel opamversion os freebsd command gmake all path usrhomefooopamsystembuildiocamlkernel

include zmqh error generated gmake Makefile stub Fehler Libzmq is installed and zmqh can be found in the directory usrlocalinclude This directory does not seem to get searched when running ocamlfind c iocamlzmqstubsc I havent found any quick fix otherwise I would have provided a patchpull request Thank you for providing an OCaml kernel for Jupyter and I hope this issues gets fixed Cheers tpltnt The following error does not allow to install iocaml right now ERROR curl code while downloading and in the end ERROR The sources of the following couldnt be obtained aborting biniou This may be fixed by running opam update but of course it cannot be fixed because is indeed As a quick fix why not I propose to not bind to that website but instead rewrite the dependency to take the releases from Please fixing ASAP is much appreciated seems like a matter of changing line opam install iocaml Your request cant be satisfied conduit is in conflict with lwt No solution found exiting As promised the first step in the master plan P One thing Im not sure about is what to do about the custom top level Jbuilder hasnt gained the ability to create those yet but it seems like its not essential to go ahead with this port Last year you said you wanted to upgrade the server as well but wouldnt it work fine to just have the server still use the old protocol and the old version of the iocaml kernel Its only people using jupyter directly that need the new protocol anywayss I am learning OCaml right now and using a Python notebook for that is awesome thanks iocaml exists so if I am doing something stupid please tell me Installed a new ocamlopam installation created a new switch for iocaml opam switch A iocaml eval opam config env opam install iocaml opam install core To make sure everything is ok I created a new virtualenv for Python and installed the supported IPython mkvirtualenv iocaml pip install ipython all Followed the instructions at the wiki and tried the new kernel ipython notebook profileiocaml It runs it highlights it evaluates my expressions nice Now it doesnt loadrequireuse core or anything so use topfind results in File not found error so require core is not going to work because require is not recognised and open CoreStd is unbound Yes I created an iocamlinit file as suggested by and it looks pretty much like this Added by OPAM let try Topdirsdirdirectory Sysgetenv OCAMLTOPLEVELPATH with Notfound use topfind thread camlp o and no it is not working What am I doing wrong Hi Im having issue installing iocaml on ubuntu opam install iocaml The following actions will
