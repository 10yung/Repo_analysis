 Upgrade to Rails would like to add in support of ActionText Dependabot cant resolve your Ruby dependency files As a result Dependabot couldnt update your dependencies The error Dependabot encountered was BundlerVersionConflict with message Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem publifycore In Gemfile publifycore publifyamazonsidebar was resolved to which depends on publifycore Could not find gem publifycore which is required by gem publifyamazonsidebar in any of the relevant sources source at publifycore If you think the above is an error on Dependabots side please dont hesitate to get in touch well do whatever we can to fix it You can mention dependabot in the comments below to contact the Dependabot team Its customary to have one factory file per model Lightbox trigger code may not be loaded in Frontend We may need to split this up Also does the Twitter integration even work anymore Because changing themes shouldnt change your feeds Publify should be neutral with respect to Analytics tools and not promote GA Additional plugins should be created to provide support for eg Matomo An alternative would be to just provide a generic analytics code field where users can paste the entire provided JavaScript blob from their chosen analytics provider
