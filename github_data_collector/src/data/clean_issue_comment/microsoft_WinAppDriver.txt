Hello I use a WMS desktop application written in WindowsForms in my company I would like to automatize entire order processing which takes place in this application But I encountered a serious problem with UIRecorder UIRecorder does not always display elements of list I attached appropriate screens where you can see that there are two elements in a list but UIRecorder shows nothing Could you tell me if it is a bug of WinAppDriver or application is written wrong Thanks in advance for help We have a problem with set text for EnvironmentnewLine or r n When sending r n Winappdrivers sets lines instead of one line Set Text Hello guest r nwelcome to WinAppDriver Expected Text value Hello guest r nwelcome to WinAppDriver Actual Text value Hello guest r n r nwelcome to WinAppDriver But When we send n only it works as expected Set Text Hello guest nwelcome to WinAppDriver Expected Text value Hello guest r nwelcome to WinAppDriver Actual Text value Hello guest r nwelcome to WinAppDriver Whats the best way to set newline r n and newparagraph r n r n using winappdriver When using FindElementsByXpaththe elements are not being returnedIt returns null Howeverwhen used FindElementByXpaththe first element found is being returned Good evening Ive read some of the posted questions regarding using some of the patterns with WinAppDriver and Selenium I was able to use the ToggleToggleSettings with the GetAttribute method but I was still unsure if its possible to get the value of the ValuePattern pattern Heres the reason why I want to get the value of the ValuePattern I entered text into a control and the Text method in Selenium wont return the sting value I entered so I can validate the text value I was able to get text from other controls using the Text method in Selenium Im using WinAppDriver with Selenium and C The control type is a DataItem so Im not sure if that plays a role in the way I can retrieve text from the control Is it possible to get that ValuePattern value through the GetAttribute method in Selenium or would I have to go through the SystemWindowsAutomation namespace Im extremely new to windows automation so please be gentle lol Hello guys Im using the winAppDriver to run my automationusing the latest stable version Im facing one problem really weird sometimes the TC fail with the following message SystemInvalidOperationException Currently selected window has been closed What I do is Find one element clear it send a new value send KeyEnter get the windowhandles and click in another button This TC work most of the time but in some execution the windows just disappear as you can see in the log bellow Any clue how can we handle this properly Right now I have marked this one as floky and have a retry logic on it so no more problem but this seems to me as a issue in WinAppDriver itself very last log of WinAppDriver POST sessionF BFE F CF A D F C D element value HTTP Accept applicationjson imagepng ContentLength ContentType applicationjsoncharsetutf Host value HTTP OK ContentLength ContentType applicationjson sessionIdF BFE F CF A D F C D status GET sessionF BFE F CF A D F C D windowhandles HTTP Accept applicationjson imagepng Host HTTP OK ContentLength ContentType applicationjson sessionIdF BFE F CF A D F C D status value POST sessionF BFE F CF A D F C D element HTTP Accept applicationjson imagepng ContentLength ContentType applicationjsoncharsetutf Host usingaccessibility idvaluefoo HTTP Bad Request ContentLength ContentType applicationjson status valueerrorno such windowmessageCurrently selected window has been closed I want to expand the tree node Not sure how can I do that using winappdriver Looks like it should be if cid UIAButtonControlTypeId cid UIAAppBarControlTypeId Hello I want to send Keys to a textbox inside a combobox Problem is the combobox and descendant elements have the same Automation Id Inspect tool looks like this grafik This is part of the Open File Dialog from Windows which my program uses All three elements pane combo box and edit have the Automation Id I want to address the third one directly to send the Clear command before sending new Keys So what i came up with parentElementFindElementByAccessibilityId FindElementByAccessibilityId FindElementByAccessibilityIdntByName Sadly this is not working parentElementFindElementByAccessibilityId returns the exact same element as parentElementFindElementByAccessibilityId FindElementByAccessibilityId The issue is why can i find the element itself when searching for descendants Hello when Im using Visual Studio to test my app When I run the test the app start in background and the test fail When i start the Test in Debug mode everything works fine Window opens focused and in front Clicks hit right buttons etc Is this a problem with WinAppDriver or VS I found somebody else having the same issue here Annotation
