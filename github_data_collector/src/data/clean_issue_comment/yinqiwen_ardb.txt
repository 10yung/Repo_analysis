The old timeout is ms this cause ardb keep consuming CPU about increase timeout to ms solved this problem Since builds currently fail on newer g versions due to string format warnings itd be nice to be able to disable Werror by including an additional Wnoerror This could be done with override CXXFLAGS and make CXXFLAGSWnoerror Run make then utilstatuscc In static member function static const char rocksdbStatusCopyStateconst char utilstatuscc error char strncpychar const char sizet output truncated before terminating nul copying as many bytes from a string as its length Werrorstringoptruncation stdstrncpyresult state cch utilstatuscc note length computed here stdstrlenstate for the null terminator cc plus all warnings being treated as errors make Makefile utilstatuso Error make Leaving directory homejcardbdepsrocksdb make Makefile homejcardbsrcdepsrocksdb librocksdba Error make Leaving directory homejcardbsrc make Makefile all Error gcc version Red Hat GCC The redis sdiff has the signature sdiff key key meaning only one key needs to be provided and keys that arent present are considered empty sets Ardb requires at least two keys to be provided or else it errors out with incorrect number of arguments Ardb does correctly treat absent keys as empty sets Ref ardb release Hi RocksDB supports column family as a way of partitioning I can see rocksdbenginecpp also handles family name from from context variable But I am am unable to find a way to send this information through redis command I am using redis SET and GET commands Thanks The test was successful when there was no write operation Is it related to the write operation INFO Period Statistics Dump End ERROR INFO RocksDB Optionsmemtableprefixbloomsizeratio INFO RocksDB Optionsmemtablehugepagesize INFO RocksDB Optionsbloomlocality INFO RocksDB Optionsmaxsuccessivemerges INFO RocksDB Optionsoptimizefiltersforhits INFO RocksDB Optionsparanoidfilechecks INFO RocksDB Optionsforceconsistencychecks INFO RocksDB Optionsreportbgiostats INFO RocksDB dbversionsetcc Recovered from manifest fileoptdbardbdatarocksdbMANIFEST succeededmanifestfilenumber is nextfilenumber is lastsequence is lognumber is prevlognumber is maxcolumnfamily is INFO RocksDB dbversionsetcc Column family default ID log number is INFO RocksDB dbdbimplopencc DB pointer x f e c e INFO Ardb init enginerocksdb success INFO Ardb will accept connections on INFO Ardb started with version INFO Slave Connecting master INFO Slave Remote master is an ardb instance INFO Send psync cksm engine rocksdb INFO Recv psync replyFULLBACKUP b a c e bb feefba b e b INFO Slave Create sync backup pathoptdbardbbackupsyncrocksdbbackup tmp INFO Backup file sync success INFO Backup sync success INFO Start loading snapshotoptdbardbbackupsyncrocksdbbackup INFO RocksDB dbdbimplcc Shutdown canceling all background work INFO RocksDB dbdbimplcc Shutdown complete ERROR Failed to backup rocksdb for reasonNotFound optdbardbbackupsyncrocksdbbackup meta is missing INFO RocksDB RocksDB version INFO RocksDB Git sha rocksdbbuildgitsha f f af cf c f b fc e ec ad ecd d INFO RocksDB Compile date Jan INFO RocksDB DB SUMMARY INFO RocksDB CURRENT file CURRENT INFO RocksDB IDENTITY file IDENTITY INFO RocksDB MANIFEST file MANIFEST size Bytes INFO RocksDB SST files in optdbardbdatarocksdb dir Total Num files INFO RocksDB Write Ahead Log file in optdbardbdatarocksdb log size ardb version data GB master ardb slave ardb salve cant copy GB data only copy new data can you give me any help In order to search for proximity neighbors is data set required to be in some projection such as mercator or lat lon grid is acceptable Im running ARDB with RocksDB as a backend My database is around GB I usually have one window with watch rediscli info to monitor the status and if I do rediscli compactdb and wait a while the first window will freeze All requests to ARDB will get blocked for a while until the compaction ends This doesnt happen right away when I start compaction only after a short while I havent looked too deep into this Is this a known issue In the config file there is Close the connection after a client is idle for N seconds to disable timeout but I dont seem to find anywhere that references this value Especially in dbcppArdbScanClients its using GetConftcpkeepalive to kick out idle clients instead of timeout Is this configuration not used
