 Step Provide a summary of your problem I want to execute some commands with the shellcommandbefore option of my tmuxp file but without those commands being shown on my shell The best thing that I could do was to put a clear command as the last but the screen still blinks with my commands for some seconds Step Provide tmuxp details Python Version Tmux version a Tmuxp version Step Describe your environment Architecture Arch OS version Manjaro Architect Step Describe the problem Steps to reproduce Create the following tmuxp file yaml sessionname sample windows windowname main layout tiled shellcommandbefore cd echo ok clear Them load that tmuxp file Observed Results You will notice that you can see on the top the commands on shellcommandbefore Expected Results I would want to have a option that run those commands silently Currently if you attempt to freeze and save the config to an existing file then you are informed that you cannot do so because the file already exists I am willing to code and submit a pull request that would allow the tmuxp freeze command to overwrite the specified file Does anyone see any problems with this because I did not look anywhere else in the code except the function responsible for the command The following is a linked issue but it got closed because of staling Bumps coverage from to details summaryChangelogsummary pemSourced from a href

receive only security updates if desired details Can tmuxp pass flags to a new session IIRC tmuxinator has something like that If not it probably needs to be handled somewhere around where sessionname is handled Access Session Window or Pane object being adjusted This would allow hooklike access to tmux session window and panes throughout the workspace builder lifecycle yaml plugins mytmuxppluginpluginTmuxResurrect sessionname my session windows windowname my window layout tiled shellcommandbefore cd run as a first command in all panes panes echo pane echo pane Assume a git repo mytmuxpplugin with a directory mytmuxpplugin inside it and a pypi package called mytmuxpplugin mytmuxppluginpluginpy python class TmuxResurrect def beforeworkspacebuilderself session On blank workspace after session created but before any windowspanescommands entered technically itd be possible to do any kind of subprocess call here as well def beforescriptself session access to libtmux session object in tmuxp load def reattachself session if sessionname already live before reattaching def onwindowcreateself window if windowwindowname my window do stuff def afterwindowfinishedself window after commands stuff commands finally entered pass I was peeking through the tmux changelogs and this entry caught my eye Add support for percentage sizes for resizepane x Also change splitwindow and joinpane l to accept similar percentages and no longer document p If that is what I think it is it would be interesting to have support for such relative sizes in tmuxp Hopefully this isnt off topic here Does tmuxp provide an alternative to TPMtmuxresurrect Id like something where all the programs arent written in bash and tmuxresurrect tmuxcontinuum has some problems tmuxps freeze option sounds good but at least restoring scrollback and at least maybe for bash somehow having perpane history files would be nice I managed to get this working relatively ok for the above plugins once Is tmuxp libtmux appropriate for attempting a better reimplementation of these Thanks How do I set windowpane names properly This windowname remotehost panes ssh remotehost gives me a window called ssh which is completely useless if I have more than one AND it kind of makes using tmuxp moot since I have to to through all my windows and reset their names after starting my session Besides REALLY need to be fixed as well As of now I have this in my tmuxconf bindkey S commandprompt p ssh newwindow n ssh which make me able to use sendprefix S to create a new window with a remote session to that remote host AND the name of that remote host without a spawned shell to start with When I logout from the host the window dies I was really hoping that could be recreated with tmuxp
