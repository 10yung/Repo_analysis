Open PR for the Popmotion branch This is a WIP and no decisions are final Framer Motion existence as a highlevel API has freed space for Popmotion to be even more lowlevel than it currently is Certain upcoming Framer product requirements and upcoming browser APIs like the Animation Worklet have opened up the need for access to for t time synchronous animation functions The current thrust of this PR is to move Popmotion away from the streamheavy approach of to a place where it doesnt have an opinion about how each animation runs and to break it down even further as an animation toolset javascript const animation tween from to duration ease linear animation It might be that there is a function added to Popmotion that is capable of taking these tbased pure functions and converting them into reactive or similar streams To support the more toolsety approach of this API and to improve maintainability of the library Im moving Popcorns utility functions and popmotioneasing back into Popmotion Stylefire being a DOMspecific renderer is finally being moved out To recognise the deprecation of Pose this PR currently removes them from the monorepo and as links from the Popmotion homepage Looks like it was introduced by mistake in Move rollupplugintypescript and typescript to devDependency Background I update popmotion got those warning warning reactpose popmotionpose posecore rollupplugintypescript has unmet peer dependency rollup Its because rollupplugintypescript included dependency and its not need on user Ensure youre using the latest version CodeSandbox examples might not always be using the latest version of Pose Add the package name to bug title Popmotion Object does not support find method on IE Describe the bug Using es Arrayprototypefind but not list it img width altimage src How to reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Go to Click on Scroll down to See error Expected behaviour no errors Link to CodePen example or similar Device information In which environment are you reproducing the bug Device eg iPhone OS Windows Browser IE Version Additional context Add any other context about the problem here stylevaluestype is detecting like valid color object that is not like colortest red I create a pull request that fix this issue and many others Im fixing several color validations for missing cases like colortest red false or transforms like hslatransform lightness alpha hsla All cases where data is missing or incorrectly assumed like a valid color input value Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Id like to be able to style a component when hovering on its parent and also when hovering on the component itself Eg show a button when hovering on the parent and then change the background colouranimate when hovering over the button Ive made a quick example js const Parent poseddiv hoverable true const Child poseddiv hover parent hover pose if I set this the parents pose gets overridden hoverable true Describe the solution youd like One idea is to add a posePrefix config item Ive implemented this here js const Parent poseddiv hoverable true posePrefix parent const Child poseddiv parenthover parent hover pose hoverable true hover child hover pose Describe alternatives youve considered It would be possible to do a simplified version of this with css transitions instead however Id like to use reactposes transitions I was trying to use the pathLength property Stylefire provides with no luck Stylefires documentation reads These are all set as a progress of the total path length from to which is automatically measured by Stylefire This seems to be wrong it should be to Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Im trying to smoothly animate the height of a div that contains div to a new height after we replace the divs For example initially divheight and after changing children divheight of course those values would really depend on the children basically animate between the two states displayed in the codesandbox Ive tried to use whats described in in the section Explicit FLIP methods but its not a react solution and also since it sets the element style as positionabsolute the parents ignore the animation and just switch instantaneously to the final state Describe the solution youd like I want the element to smoothly animate to a new height every time that it changes Describe alternatives youve considered Ive tried also apart from this library capturing the initial height rendering the new height set back the old height and then animate to the new one but the code was a bit too verbose Thats why I decided to go with a library Additional context No It seems that at some point there was collision detection on popmotion but now its dead Id like to know if there is an alternative or something Or when will collision detection be available To have things like shown on objects falling and reacting with each other etc
