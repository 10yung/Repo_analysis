HelloI can not understand one sentence in your paperWhen the training error keeps unchanged in five sequential epochs we merge the parameters of each batch normalization into the adjacent convolution filtersI try to figure it out by reading your code but fail to deal with matlabThanks In your paper We set the rotation angle range to For the scaling of eigenvalues it is set from to and for scale factors and respectively In your code ksize theta pirand l rand l l rand kernel anisotropicGaussianksizethetal l double kernel singlekernel I would like to ask how to set the parameter of the gaussian blur kernel thank you Hi thank you so much for the source code Besides could you please provide the resulting image of the degradation model The training is normal The following problems are encountered in the testing process wrong with vlnnbnorm vlimpldispatchcudnnC CUoperator BatchNormForwardWithMomentCudnndataTypeoperator cuDNN error cudnn d matlab r b bin matconvnet beta matlab src bits nnbnormcudnncu CUDNNSTATUSBADPARAM I have some confusion about the generation of LR images with different spatially variant degradations can you provide more details Thank you very much Demorealapplicationdenoisinganddeblurringcolor frogSuperResolution Undefined function or variable vlargparse Error in vlnnSubP line opts vlargparseopts varargin nonrecursive Error in vlsrmdmatlab line resi x vlnnSubPresix scalelscale Error in Demorealapplicationdenoisinganddeblurringcolor line res vlsrmdmatlabnet input When use this you should also set useGPU and comment net vlsimplenntidynet Can you provide test results that ran out of your network Including Set Set B and Urban modeltrain Not enough input arguments error in net vlsimplenntidynet How can I fix it When I was runing the generatepatchesm a error was raised that undefined function or variable dataaugmentation I would like asking about it is it a default function or user defined function that no provided thank you very much I saw the dimentionreduced blur kernels are precalculated as SRMDnonblindmat I am very interested in the problem how can precalculate Because I try to SR the real image If have some tips
