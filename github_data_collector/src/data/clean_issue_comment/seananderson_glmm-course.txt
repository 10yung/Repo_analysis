Introduce it early on in the workshop Why do we progress from a linear model to a GLM to a GLMM etc GAMs too Maybe simulate some data Might also make a good blog post Also demonstrate how this only works if the grouplevel intercepts are constrained as random effects Was a point of confusion for many Will make the repository easier to follow without the presentations and make for a complete set of notes Currently uses slopes only as an artifact of why I originally wrote this code Intercepts would be simpler and more straightforward Majority voted to skip this Already pretty overwhelming by this point Might also reduce the number of alternative models in that exercise
