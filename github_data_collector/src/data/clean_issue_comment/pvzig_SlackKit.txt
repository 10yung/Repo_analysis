This is a feature request for pagination support for endpoints like and This would involve the relevant methods changing to accept an optional cursor argument and then also providing the responsemetadatanextcursor value to the success handler closure I have some local changes that achieve this for these two endpoints and I could take a stab at a proper PR for this but I wanted to get your thoughts on it first Thanks The dependency story for SlackKit can be simplified by migrating to SwiftNIO This has the additional benefit of using frameworks that have the backing support of Apple In Slack theres a limit for length of messages bytes Id been banging my head against the wall trying to figure out why my message is not being printed in chat when everything ran perfectly on console before guessing there might be a limit No error was shown for that Would it be a good idea to throw this kind of error Im working on a Slash command that needs access to information from the WebhookRequest to help determine the response My initial thought was to subclass Middleware in order to do this While this will suit my needs I wonder if it is better to generalize this approach Is there a reason the current implementation exists Would there be interest in adding new middleware that supports this case Based on this tutorial Docs Enterprise Grid Docs Blog
