It would be great if it would be possible to install with a Swift Package Manager Tim Cook would love that Add swiftversions to podspec file to avoid build failures with CocoaPods There are supposed to be red and white stripes on the US flag one for each of the original colonies FlagKits current rendition has Not only is this numerically incorrect but it distorts the appearance of the flag as well I found your earlier justification unconvincing The asset itself is in x px high I would have had to make two of the stripes px and the other eleven px And that would look super bad So its a design compromise sadly May I suggest instead of making some stripes px for x which would indeed look super bad that you instead simply omit the last two stripes which shouldnt be there anyway Flags cannot be made to fit into identical heights and widths because they have so many different aspect ratios and detail positioning I believe most users will prefer a px height flag thats correct and has the expected aesthetic over one that is a targeted px thats factually wrong and aesthetically oddlooking Here are the before and after of the proposed change at x Before US flag too many stripes stripes ndash wrong After US flag correct number of stripes stripes ndash correct This pull request has similar fixes for x x x and SVG Hope you like this Hi I have found that some below country flags are missing from list AC AQ BQ CP DG EA EH IC and TA thanks Moldova MD There are a lot of flags with linear gradients which are give ids like linearGradient linearGradientn So lets say you have the AR flag followed by RO AR has two lineargradient elements idlinearGradient and idlinearGradient RO has idlinearGradient idlinearGradient and idlinearGradient In this case if they are on the same HTML page the RO flag will use the gradients and from the AG file AG RO AUS UK Add New feature Flag to Emoji flags Usage swift detailLabeltext flagemoji Limitation Some regional flag like califonia in USAUSCA not supported currently because depending on OSs supporting unicode However almost flags used in FlagKit covered added unit tests img width altwx x src img width altwx x src I wrote a quick lib to allow others to quickly use these icons in their web apps would like to add a link here so others can use it
