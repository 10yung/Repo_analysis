We are using transactions when we use UserManager alongside standard EF Core database updates We are considering options and for the idempotency issue however there is nothing in the article to explain how we can do that due to the fact that UserManager has its own SaveChanges which will not use acceptAllChangesOnSuccess false Can the documentation be updated to explain either how to avoid this issue or to clarify whether this will work when using UserManager methods within ExecuteInTransaction Document Details Do not edit this section It is required for docsmicrosoftcom GitHub issue

it mentioned anywhere that SearchBlogs is a Table Valued Function I dont find TVF use to be widespread in industry and the phrase SearchBlogs could just as easily be a noun table name blogs about searches as a verb function name search through blogs I puzzled for some time over how this magic syntax enabled EF to know which column to search within in the SearchBlogs table I request that you consider my order of preference Using an example that references a simple and well used table name like Employees Products or Orders eg ExecuteSqlRawSELECT FROM dbo Employees WHERE LastName
