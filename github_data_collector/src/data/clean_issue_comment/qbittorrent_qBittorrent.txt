Mostly minor changesimprovements Please provide the following information qBittorrent version and Operating System v alpha maybe affects too Windows x qB native interface not web What is the problem Cannot filter on all columns What is the expected behavior To be able to view a filtered list of any column instead of blank no results Steps to reproduce Enable columns Tracker Time Active and Save Path Enter part of what is seen into the Filter torrent list input eg number of days an item has seeded Result is nothing instead of an expected list of filtered items Extra infoif any With recent changes to the transfer list Maybe the filter system broke like the column ordering did Maybe filtering works correctly under Maybe the filter was never designed to apply to any column The input box reads Filter torrent list so the expectation to filter anything comes from that wording img src When renaming any torrent or its content F key I can only navigate the cursor with the LeftRight arrow I am missing the ability to use the UpDown arrow where the cursor will be placed at the left or right end respectively This is also the default behavior when editing file names on Windows Its very handy especially when editing files as pressing F will highlight the filename excluding the extension Being able to press the Down arrow in this case would place the cursor here Filenameext and let me quickly edit from the ending of the filename Right now I can press the Right arrow key which places the cursor to the right at the period Filenameext Im requesting some tweaks to two different but related features The Graph Period resolution appears to be arbitrary relative to the period options given m m m h h h but dont actually reflect these periods in any obvious way The graph does have vertical divisions so I would like to request that each division be made to reflect period in length On a full p wide screen about divisions are visible so periods or days would be represented at the h resolution UpDown speed sampling is fixed at some arbitrary period which cannot be adjusted Note Under Advanced Transfer List Refresh Interval this value can be increased and will slow down how frequently the UpDown speed values are visually updated everywhere including in the graph but it does not adjust the sample period or decay of the value I propose that adjusting this Refresh Interval will define the sample period and average out the value over that period Alternately a separate user option can define this value instead of using the refresh interval value Experiment Set the refresh interval to ms and you will see no smoothing effect The value shown every seconds is only representative of a one second sample period from the last ten seconds Thoughts questions I want to point out a security vulnerability but I would probably prefer to not directly explain it in an issue How do I contact you privately Please provide the following information qBittorrent version and Operating System window V If on linux libtorrentrasterbar and Qt version type here What is the problem qbittorrent wont start downloading until I restart pc What is the expected behavior type here Steps to
