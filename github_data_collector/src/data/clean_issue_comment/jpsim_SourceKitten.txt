Used SPM for and worked ok tried swift package update caused build errors Yamlh header not found Tried to use PM inside Xcode now getting Framework not found Yams Prefer to use SPM from CLI as seemingly more mature but no joy gets parsed as swift func violationRangesin file File kind KindType instead of swift func violationRangesin file SwiftLintFile kind KindType dictionary SourceKittenDictionary NSRange Im super new to Swift and Xcode and fairly inexperienced with programming But Im trying to learn Swift and since Playgrounds are unbearably slow on my old MacBook Air Im experimenting with Swift in Sublime Text Not to build anything just to get the syntax straight I figured code completion would be nice to learn more about the available methods and came across SwiftKitten However it offers no completions and upon investigating a bit I found that I cant seem to get completions to work via the command line tool Running any kind of sourcekitten complete command bash sourcekitten complete text offset returns sourcekitten complete text let hello hell offset returns sourcekitten complete text import UIKit UIColor offset target arm appleios sdk ApplicationsXcodeappContentsDeveloperPlatformsiPhoneOSplatformDeveloperSDKsiPhoneOS sdk returns just returns an empty list This is probably due to my own stupidity however I cant seem to get to the bottom of it Im using Xcode Version and running xcodeselect p returns ApplicationsXcodeappContentsDeveloper Id really appreciate any help Hi Im using sourcekitten to generate docs for a project with multiple modules However the vast majority of modules depend on a couple similar modules Is there a way to run the build to reuse the previously built dependencies Maybe the xcodebuild options could change to not do a clean For example modules Foo Bar Baz dependencies Bar Foo Baz Foo I want to generate docs for all modules but dont want to rebuild Foo for each module I have a file with the given content public class Entity And I do this let url URLstring Path for the file printSwiftDocsfile Filepath urlabsoluteString arguments j urlabsoluteString I have got information about my code but there is no keyparseddeclaration value Path for the file keydiagnosticstage sourcediagnosticstageswiftparse keylength keyoffset keysubstructure keyaccessibility sourcelangswiftaccessibilitypublic keyattributes keyattribute sourcedeclattributepublic keylength keyoffset keybodylength keybodyoffset keykind sourcelangswiftdeclclass keylength keyname Entity keynamelength keynameoffset keyoffset keyruntimename TtC main Entity Do you have any ideas why I cant get keyparseddeclaration value Getting following errors I have tried latest version let task Process Use of unresolved identifier Process if availablemacOS options prettyPrinted sortedKeys else options prettyPrinted sortedKeys is only available in iOS or newer I am not able to use sourcekitten doc on ubuntu using Swift I get this uninformative crash Parsing Dimensionswift fish sourcekitten doc spmmodule N terminated by signal SIGILL Illegal instruction Is it possible to use the sourcekitten framework in an app submitted to the App Store Obviously App Store apps need to be sandboxed Unfortunately simply turning that on doesnt work I get xcrun error cannot be used within an App Sandbox So I found this issue that suggested wrapping SourceKitten in an XPC Service I did so turned sandboxing on in my app and it worked as intended So I submitted to the App Store and it failed upon upload because The XPC Service needs to be sandboxed too So I turned sandboxing on for the XPC Service and was confronted with xcrun error cannot be used within an App Sandbox again Is this just impossible Or is there more to it to get it to work Im using SourceKitten to improve syntax highlighting and add code completion for my app Swift Coder Ive managed to get code completion suggestions through SourceKitten so far but it gave me an idea Seeing the docBrief oneline descriptions made me think about implementing something like this img width altScreen Shot at AM src Or basically Xcodes Quick Help inspector Im not sure where I should be looking to get this information through SourceKit or if its something I can get at all I cant figure out how to get a cursor offset request to work properly or even if that would be helpful I dont need this to be super indepth maybe just showing the summary section would be enough with maybe also a link to the full documentation I think itd be pretty helpful for people learning Swift This pattern is repeated enough times to be worth a small helper If its internal to SourceKittenFramework we can still use it from tests by using testable import SourceKittenFramework without polluting our public API Originally posted by jpsim in
