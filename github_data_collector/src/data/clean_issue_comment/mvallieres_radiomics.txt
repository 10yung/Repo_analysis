Based on this question I used is this code volume doublergb grayimread mask onessizevolume sizevolume ROIonlylevels prepareVolumevolumemaskOther MatrixUniform GLCM getGLCMROIonlylevels DataGLCM getGLCMtexturesGLCM I do not know what is the pixelW so what will be the value In the case of this png file what shell I use as Numerical value specifying the inplane resolution mm of volume I used a random number of What shell I used in scale as it is related to pixelW When I will use it on eye images I will use the full image like in the case above where mask and volume are the same Thanks a lot Lluis Hi thanks for posting the data out for everyone to access I downloaded the mat files containing the radiomics features I noticed that the four modalities combined total upto files Out of these are in T CE are in T W in T W and in T F Is there any reason behind the difference in the number of mat files in the four modalities This also doesnt tally up with the info mentioned here Hi mvallieres Thanks for your codes When I use the function prepareVolume with a D data I got a error like error wavedec line sizeslevel sizeX error waveletBPfilt line wDECwavedec volume wavelet error prepareVolume line ROIbox waveletBPfiltROIboxRsym I think thats because the sizeX has while the sizeslevel has You said the function prepareVolume is compatible with D analysis But it looks doesnt work for D analysis How could I revise it Thanks I run LGGstudy masterScriptLGG on OS matlabR a run as your INSTRUCTIONSit goes on well untill A PERFORM FEATURE SET REDUCTION FROM TRAINING SETS tic fprintf n PERFORMING FEATURE SET REDUCTION FROM THE TRAINING SETS WITH u CORES nBatch calcAllFeatureSetsbatchLGGpathMINEpathLRsetSizealphadeltanBootnBatchmatlabPATHseeds Matlab Window PERFORMING FEATURE SET REDUCTION FROM THE TRAINING SETS WITH CORES Undefined function or variable batchExperiments Error in calcAllFeatureSetsbatchLGG line param batchExperimentssetNamesoutcomesnBatch nBatch lengthparam Could you please give me a help thanks Hi mvallieres I have to process some fundus images and i dont know the number of pixelW and sliceS So how to solve this problem Thanks Hi first of all thank you so much i tried to test the code with samples I got features Id like to add wavelet based features eg multiscale textures of variance five features LHL HHL LLH LHH and HHH entropy ie five features HLL LHL HHL LLH and HHH and energy ie two features HLL and LLH What i want is all features features How can I get all features thank you Is it run directly I can not run it with matlab bwhich just shows a figure without functions Soany idea
