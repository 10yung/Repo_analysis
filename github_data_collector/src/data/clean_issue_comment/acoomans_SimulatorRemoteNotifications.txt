Hi thanks a lot for this library didReceiveRemoteNotification fetchCompletionHandler is called even if the app is in background when I send a notification from your iOS Simulator Notifications on s In your documentation you said Note that if you send a notification while the app is in the background applicationdidReceiveRemoteNotificationfetchCompletionHandler will only be called when you bring the app to the foreground How to call it only when I bring the app to the foreground My application is written in React Native How should I bind this library with my app Any clue Im getting this error ld library not found for lObjC img width altscreen shot at pm src Is there a CordovaPhonegap available How easyhard would it be to use it in Cordova apps Hello First of all Id like to thank you for this nice tool Im trying to simulate some notifications on an iOS device which supports a new payload size limit of either KB or KB However SimulatorRemoteNotification seems to truncate the payload after a certain amount of bytes which results in the following error SimulatorRemoteNotification error Error DomainNSCocoaErrorDomain Code Unterminated string around character UserInfoNSDebugDescriptionUnterminated string around character I tried multiplying the values of the following constants by but this seemed to have no effect UIApplicationSimulatorRemoteNotificationsm SimulatorRemoteNotificationsBufferLength ACSimulatorRemoteNotificationsServicem SimulatorRemoteNotificationsServiceBufferLength How can the code be modified to support the increased payload size PS I know the payload Im testing is valid because it gets delivered successfully through APNS when testing with a real device Edit updated the link to the documentation where the payload size is discussed Currently the NSTextView replaces any input quotes with quotes that break the JSON validation So keyvalue becomes key value This just disables that in applicationDidFinishLaunching
