I have a PSAMSi server being run on a Kali VM with the Client being run on a VM PSAmsi is properly finding the flags when using the FindAmsiSignatures switch but is simply returning the original script with no modifications when the GetMinimallyObfuscated flag is used The obfuscation functionality fails and this line is reached ps If weve run through all the strings and the string is still flagged obfuscation fails If TokenIndex ge MatchingTokensCount DoneObfuscating True
