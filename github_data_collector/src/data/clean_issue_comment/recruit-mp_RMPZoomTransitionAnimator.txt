Is it possible to have the update for Swift and Xcode fixing issues when go back to previous view controller when using push navigation controller Issue The pod file is outdated while doing Pod Install it shows errors After modifying pod file issue got resolved Follow the link below Issue No podspec found for RMPZoomTransitionAnimator in could not find a fix for this Can you please update the description or please the project i request you make it work Hope the needful Thanks in advance I have the following structure Navigation Controller TableViewController TableViewController CollectionViewController CollectionViewController RMPZoomTransitionAnimator is applied on segue If I press back button in the middle of the animation nothing happens and it goes with the animation back as expected And the following message appears nested pop animation can result in corrupted navigation bar Finishing up a navigation transition in an unexpected state Navigation Bar subview tree might get corrupted And after that I have to press several time back button in order to go to TableViewController I think readmd needs to be changed if you use cocoapods I have a problem using this library on a navigation controller with an opaque navigation bar It seems the final frame is not calculated properly and the top side of the view is hidden by the navigation bar An example to reproduce this is just adding the following code in the viewDidLoad method in the NavigationController class in the provided example voidviewDidLoad super viewDidLoad Do any additional setup after loading the view selfdelegate self selfnavigationBartranslucent NO Any workaround for this Hi all The scenario I have is that the collection view has a few images and when tapped the images are shown full screen The first screen with the collection view has the status bar showing but the full screen image viewer does not The animation to go forward works fine as does the animation going back but the views no longer look write because the top layout guide is not correct If I show the status bar on the image viewer it all works fine My problem looks very similar to this one Is anyone else having this issue Thanks Mof Can we get a Swift example with autolayout For some reason when I close from a modal presentation my red navigation bar flashes white before switching back to red Do you have any ideas on why this might be happening Hi Im trying to implement this animation in a Swift project The problem Im facing is that whenever my destinationController or sourceController is checked in RMPZoomTransitionAnimatorm for conformity to the RMPZoomTransitionAnimating protocol the check always fails even though I implement the protocol in the controllers What is there that I dont know
