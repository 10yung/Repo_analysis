receive only lockfile updates if desired Security updates receive only security updates if desired details There was recently a discussion on reddit not started by me about this gem here The discussion can be seen here The problem described was e g to have a binmake entry that may be installed at the locally existing make I personally dont think it is a big problem I tend to use userinstall anyway and then just manage the bin files in my home directory But it got me thinking Would it be possible and useful to add an entry to an individual rubygems page and give users a way to display the content of that particular gem online In particular bin entries a bit like github navigation but just simpler the information can be obtained from the gemspec file I assume or wherever else the files are being stored so it does not need to be any live navigation as in github This is mostly for convenience IMO It could be a new entry on the bottom right area perhaps under the entry Reverse dependencies some entry such as Installed files or some such My primary use case for the description here is to let ruby users quickly see online which bin entries are installed It is not only related to the discussion on reddit though more of a general convenience feature to be had Not sure how problematic the issue description at reddit was but I think we can decouple that from the suggestion here since my aim is really convenience not preventing any user action or anything hence why it was filed here on rubygemsorg github rather than rubygems github Customers are still having issues awsawssdkruby Weve got the spec dependency But current status is when installing awssdk awssdksso is never fetched Is this some caching problem The gem is published Opening new issue for visibility When looking at just now I noticed that it also keeps track of gems that I have already removed yanked before So for example coloure On recommended Off Something seems strange I assume that the information about past owners of gem is kept which is fine but that information is also displayed to the former site owner on that notifier route which I think does not make sense since that site owner gem author already yankedremoved the gem So even IF the site owner could want to toggle this lets just assume this it would not make sense since the gem is already gone completely so even if set to On there would never by any notification anyway The notification would only be triggered if a gem would be yanked but if the last gem was yanked and the namespace past the days delay the site author could not do much with nonexisting gems So this seems like a no effect situation I would recommend to change the affected code here add a way to determine whether the gem has already been yanked or not And if it has been yanked before skip the display of it on the notifier route On a somewhat related note since we can already manually toggle onoff on a pergem basis here I believe it should be simple to add a new button for toggle all off which could be a bit of javascript doing all the manual action that wed do right now by pressing the Off checkbox there That way new code additions would be kept at a minimum Added chrome installation for js testing using selenium headless chrome This is part of the following pull request where js testing is required To aid detection of unauthorized gem changes we email you each time a new version of a gem you own is pushed By receiving and reading these emails you help protect the Ruby ecosystem Hmmm The problem is that I am actually subscribed to my own gems mostly because it gives me a way to sort stuff e g to find out when the last update happened e g when I went to bed wake up and dont remember what I did in the last hours or so With that change I now get spammed by my own activity I was looking for a way to disable this but there was none that I could find So whenever I push a new gem rubygemsorg sends me an email which I did not want to receive to begin with nor does it help me in any way really I also disagree that by spamming me I help protet the Ruby ecosystem I should clarify that I am all in favour of protecting USERS but NOT at the expense of usability We have had problems before in the past here e g with the levensthein distance match or something against typosquatting annoying people we also have seen discussion from requiring two factor authentification or so which requires a smartphone which I dont have and now this Please if you really feel a need to make such changes then CONSIDER EXISTING AND OLD DEVELOPERS who do not want to subscribe to all these changes I actually logged in here just to see whether there is a simple way to disable the notifications and I could not find any There is a an individual entry for all gems but I am not going to click through entries manually just to tick off all these email notifications Anyway now to suggestions how to change this Add a SIMPLE way to disable all of these email notifications in one go somewhere I guess a logical URL would be this one but it could go elsewhere too A simple form or so with a select check button or any other fitting form When the user has selected it to off that user will no longer receive any emailupdates You can of course say that this is useful which may be but to me whenever I am pushing new gem releases of my own gems rubygemsorg spams me with this which just is pointless Id rather add a filter to get rid of rubygemsorg than manually tick off the individual entries So please consider the UI of rubygemsorg as a whole Thanks PS I should also add that I do not often check emails in general this is largely due to the way how I work sorry Right now I am cleaning up all the gazillion emails in my gmail account in general which is quite boring and tedious that is not the fault of rubygemsorg of course but I can not change the infrequency of using emails in general I actually much prefer issue trackers webforum etc han oldschool emails in general The specification for the apiv dependencies endpoint does not define the format of the response when a gem has a dependency with a complex version requirement such as foo The de facto spec is that such a dependency will be represented as a single string separated by commas and spaces eg foo This is what bundler expects However the lack of codification here has contributed to issues such as with thirdparty gem servers and having an explicit spec would be helpful toward resolving differences
