Currently LEGOEXPERIMENTALCNAMESUPPORT has almost no documentation and lego does not show which DNS lookupsresponses it madereceived to debug a setup In addition it seems that only very few DNS adapters have implemented the lookup workflow properly matbaonet is one of the biggest DNS provider for vn domain vietnam but it does not have any acme provider Is there a reason not to have one How can we add a driver for it Should I contact matbao or you Thanks and best Hello I noticed the lego directory containing accounts and certificates get saved at the current working directory This might introduce inconsistency depending on the location you run it Saving the directory under HOME like many other programs might be favorable Regards cc see API doc I have been trying to create a certificate using letsencrypt and route the certificate im trying to create is for serversubdomaincom when trying to use route it I get an error saying that it can not find the host zone id for subdomaincom I belive that is a bug as the domain it should be looking for is domaincom and that does exist there is no issues creating certificates for that domain I have also tested it with cloudflare for another domain and that works perfectly so I belive that the problem is when the api call towards route After getting certificates for about domains caddy suddenly stopped and I got this error INFO mydomaincom acme Obtaining bundled SAN certificate http TLS handshake error from EOF ERROR mydomaincom failed to obtain certificate acme error POST urnietfparamsacmeerrormalformed JWS verification error url attempt challengetlsalpn INFO mydomaincom acme Obtaining bundled SAN certificate ERROR mydomaincom failed to obtain certificate acme error POST urnietfparamsacmeerrormalformed JWS verification error url attempt challengetlsalpn INFO mydomaincom acme Obtaining bundled SAN certificate ERROR mydomaincom failed to obtain certificate acme error POST urnietfparamsacmeerrormalformed JWS verification error url attempt challengetlsalpn INFO mydomaincom acme Obtaining bundled SAN certificate ERROR mydomaincom failed to obtain certificate acme error POST urnietfparamsacmeerrormalformed JWS verification error url attempt challengehttp INFO mydomaincom acme Obtaining bundled SAN certificate ERROR mydomaincom failed to obtain certificate acme error POST urnietfparamsacmeerrormalformed JWS verification error url attempt challengehttp INFO mydomaincom acme Obtaining bundled SAN certificate ERROR mydomaincom failed to obtain certificate acme error POST urnietfparamsacmeerrormalformed JWS verification error url attempt challengehttp http TLS handshake error from failed to obtain certificate acme error POST urnietfparamsacmeerrormalformed JWS verification error url Happens on all new domains I add Im running caddy Can I share a single legoClient across multiple goroutines safely I dont see any code saying one way or the other Lets assume that things like ChallengeSetHTTP Provider are only called from one thread before the concurrent area Depending on the lego Go module ends up causing your project to depend on dozens of other modules which implement the APIs for different DNS providers primarily While their packages wont bloat your binary size if unused it does cause your dependency graph to be larger and if you do use one of those libraries it can affect what version of the library gets used in your project even if you dont use the relevant piece eg when we added lego to our project it affected our AWS library version even though we arent using either AWS provider Would it be possible to split off providers into its own Go module cmd would also need to be its own module because it depends on providers That way projects consuming lego as a library that implement their own provider or use one of the dependencyfree built in providers wont end up with the provider libraries in their project Hi I have added the DNS Support for servercow some time ago to acmesh Could you please add this to lego I would try to do it by myself but I am not firm with golang
