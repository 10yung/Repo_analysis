I have a couple of questions about your paper Polynomial Regression as an Alternative to Neural Networks At point it is said that many authors recommend not using polynomial models of degree higher than or In which cases is it possible to get higher degree polynomials which fit well At point it is said that the degree of the approximating polynomial increases from layer to layer So if I get a polynomial of degree which fits well then the corresponding neural network will have three layers approximately Dear Normal Matloff I have been trying out your R package however I am having trouble

can perform PCA beforehand poly not Is there any more Does poly have some limitations that polyFit has not which I am not seeing The asformula and asdataframe came about from using polyFit and predict directly without FSR The asformula may have generated the reg exp tweak needed in FSR Run this against your tests before accepting so it doesnt break something else Cheers George When computing

Ok the same model is fitted but computing predictions r tablepredictpf kyphosis kyphosisKyphosis absent present absent present Accuracypredictpf kyphosis kyphosisKyphosis seems to be wrong Looking at the code you can see r glm case if isnullobjectglmMethod only two classes pre predictobjectfit plmnewdata pred ifelsepre objectclasses objectclasses IMHO the prediction returned is in the link scale see helppredictglm but it should be on the probability scale ie type response or if in the link scale pre However I prefer to resonate in terms of probability scale I have been trying to run working code from a colleague on two different ubuntu machines I cant get their code to run and I cant even get the xvalPoly example to run Here is the unexpected error followed by the complete R session in

the problem that when the second tuning parameter changes maxInteractDeg the model estimated with the same deg remains unchanged In fact from this example the design matrix remains unchanged x iris dimgetPolyx deg maxInteractDeg xdata dimgetPolyx deg maxInteractDeg xdata dimgetPolyx deg maxInteractDeg xdata dimgetPolyx deg maxInteractDeg xdata dimgetPolyx deg maxInteractDeg xdata dimgetPolyx deg maxInteractDeg xdata What could this problem depend on Currently I do not find it useful to vary the model according to the degree of interaction I just read and found it really interesting Any chance youre thinking about implementing a Python version of the package some time soon Id be willing to help as long as someone writes up a highlevel description of the functionality needed Hi Thank you for ths new methodology Was trying out and i realized that after modelling in glm mode there is no way i can output my prediction in probability I tried setting predictxtest type response
