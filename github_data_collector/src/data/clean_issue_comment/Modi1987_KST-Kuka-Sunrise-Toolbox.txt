Hi I follow the youtube video here really great work Our lab recently borrowed an iiwa R and would like to use it for some project However the original lab didnt buy the sunriseservoing module so we cannot control this robot from ROS as mentioned here For your package does it also need the module Thanks Hi Dr Safeea I m Tian After dealing with the previous problems we run the demos in the KST which are really wonderful However not every demo can be run successfully such as the KSTclassTutorialrealTimeImpedencePlotTorqueFeedBackm Our tool mass is kg the COM is mm The parameters are found in our gripper manual Firstly we use these parameters but some errors appear in the SmartPad and the matlab which said javalangIllegalStateExceptionLoad Mass Validation Failed axisTauExtMsr of LBRExtTorqueLBRiiwa R is should be less than The errors are shown below I have also tried to modify and use different tool parameters in the matlab code but it does not work Besides I also search the solution in Google and Github but I find no solution to this In addition about the KST gamepad demos we can run them successfully and we can use the left handle of gamepad to select different axis of iiwa but we cannot move the joints by using the right handle of gamepad We really don t know why We will appreciate your help very much if you can help us analyze these problems Especially the impedence control demo I m really sorry to disturb you so much and looking forward to your reply Best regards Tian Xu Dear Dr Safeea I m following your KST tutorials and I encounter some problems I m now trying to import KST to SunriseWorkbench Version But there are some error icons near the copied java files I have added the Direct Servo Motion Extension and Smart Servo Motion Extension in the StationSetupcat however the errors still exist The specific error messages are listed in the attachment below I have tried to select different media flange when establishing a new project and to use different KST version from KST to KST but they are no use Could you help me analyze the reasons of the problems that I have I really don t know how to deal with it Thanks a lot Tian Xu Error Messagespdf Hello there I was following your video tutorials because I am interested in the hand guiding system However I get an error Specifically with the PTPmotionClassjava file Sunrise tells me that it cant import comkukageneratedioAccessMediaFlangeIOGroup The exact message is The import comkukagenerated cannot be resolved I search everywhere on the internet but I cannot find any information about this module Do you know why the code is having this problem on my computer Thanks in advanced Hi May I ask you some questions about the configuration of iiwa Which software packages should I install in iiwa if I want to do researches about force and torque Did you use FRI in your researches I would appreciate it if you could help me Hi I ve already synchronized the MatlabToolboxServer But when I run itthe program doesnt work and the error is about lbrExampleApplicationsBackgroundTaskjava in line and some Unknown SourceI just add the KST iiwa R UniversalnoFlange in the old lbrExampleApplication in an old sunrise projectbecause my classmate says create a new project would cover others programAnd when I copy the KST iiwauniversalnoFlangeLTS and choose the software Direct and Smartthe PTPmotionClassjava has some problems that cant synchronize And when I establish the connection in Matlabit works and show the Connection establishedbut the next line show that Could not attach the tool to the Robot Someone says maybe the Java program has some problemsbut I watch the tutorials that you could workSo I just wanna seek some advice if it is our iiwas problems or I should change some softwares or so on Thanks a lot Hi I really like your toolbox Thanks so much for sharing this I was trying to run some of your examples and I found out that a function was missing for the SpaceMouse Teleoperation example script mouseSpeed speedMOUSE vector gave me an error If this is expected would you be able to share this speed function Thanks Andy I am going to test your toolbox The aim is to control the robots from a VR headset However right now I am struggling in synchronizing the MatlabToolboxServer onto the iiwa controller The project shows no errors but when the synchronization begins it fails in the middle with the following warning The child nodes of catalog elements RootItem pathcomkukaProject usageTopology selection Username Project and RootItem pathcomkukaProject usageTopology selection Username Project are not compatible between the projects to be synchronized Can you check what could be the reason I will try to check this on my own as well and update if I find a solution
