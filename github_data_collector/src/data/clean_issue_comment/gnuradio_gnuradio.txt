The import of engnotation was removed from flowgraphpymako in a c ad and so float parameter blocks were leading to flowgraph compilation error Since engnotation is still ultimately imported in the generated python script we can put the call to numtostr in the generated script instead of calling it during script generation The second commit of this PR simply removes a definition that seems to be unused and which also contains a call to engnotationnumtostr Fixes up cmake for grfiltersexamples to install a few files that were missing Renames channelizerdemogrc to be polyphasechannelizerdemogrc Minor tweaks to polyphasechannelizerdemogrc Sets QT layout for Freq sinks Adds Noise Source and Throttle Block Adds Labels to each of the Freq sinks Disables Autoscaling on the Ch Freq sink block polyphasechannelizer polyphasechannelizerrunning feature request hdlcdeframer should copy the tags from its input stream into the tags portion of the PDU it sends as output The metadata in the tags on the input stream may contain important information that is needed for later processing Hi This bug affect GRC not tested for GRC When a block was disabled in older GRC this block and its connections were greyed At present the block is completely removed we need ctrl Z to revert deletion Is this a bug Regards Christophe Hi As explained in the mailing list I propose aQTGUI eyesink GRC block this PR comprise a GRC example to see it in action I hope this can be included in GNURadio at present I was not able to construct this eyesink as an OOT module Regards Christophe Ready for comments as maybe it is a mistake somehow the first commit index is unsigned int Hi Currently the windows precompiled GNUradio installers found here GNURadio but only with Python My questions are Is there a currently precompiled Windows version of GNURadio w Python If there is not is there a relatively easy way that I could compile one myself If also not how could I interface my current Python codebase w the GNURadio Python output Thanks See issue calloc can also return NULL
