 The kernel sends the client an eperm when tc or iptables drops a packet In real packet loss the client wouldnt be made immediately aware that the packet didnt reach its destination The process Im testing responds to eperm by closing down the socket and trying again on a new socket See I worked around this by rerouting the packet to a port which hopefully isnt used this solution probably isnt ideal here That said if the intention is to run these scripts on a machine acting as a router then this isnt an issue when I use this command shell comcast deviceeth latency targetprototcpudpicmp targetaddr it is usefulbut if i add targetport like shell comcast deviceeth latency targetprototcpudpicmp targetaddr targetport it doesn t work system CentOS release Final Comcast version I know its easy to build one but Im just wondering if someone already built it Hi It would be great to see an exclusion parameter in comcast which will exclude the rules to a specific network eg Apply the delay to everyone but comcast deviceeth latency targetbw packetloss excludenetwork or to a specific CIDR comcast deviceeth latency targetbw packetloss excludenetwork Example of tc command for network exclusion of packets of with destination port tc filter add dev eth protocol ip parent prio u match ip src flowid tc filter add dev eth protocol ipv parent prio u match ip src flowid tc filter add dev eth protocol ip parent prio u match ip dport xffff flowid tc filter add dev eth protocol ip parent prio u match ip sport xffff flowid tc filter add dev eth protocol ip parent prio u match ip src match ip dport xffff flowid tc filter add dev eth protocol ipv parent prio u match ip dport xffff flowid tc filter add dev eth protocol ipv parent prio u match ip sport xffff flowid tc filter add dev eth protocol ipv parent prio u match ip dport xffff flowid Thanks Pavlos Hi im new to the GO environment and it would be very nice if you would include a howto for building it on debian jessie with the golang version of the repository I want to simulate updatebehaviour of various systems of virtual machines Thanks for your work Any idea on how I could use Comcast to provide a shitty connection to a mobile device via Wifi It would be nice to use it instead as its meant to replace tables Is there any way of making this work on Windows I have no idea how much of a job that would be bincomcast latency targetbw defaultbw packetloss I see that the incoming traffic is having no effect
