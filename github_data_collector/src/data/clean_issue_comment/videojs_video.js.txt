Description A proposed fix for Requirements Checklist X Feature implemented Bug fixed If necessary more likely in a feature request than a bug fix X Change has been verified in an actual browser Chome Firefox IE X Unit Tests updated or fixed Docsguides updated Example created starter template on JSBin Reviewed by Two Core Contributors Description During live playback the seek bar only has to be updated when the player is paused because we will always be the same period away from live while playing Specific Changes proposed Start updating the seekbar for the first time on duration change If the duration is Infinity only update when paused otherwise update how we do now Make sure visibility change only enables the interval if it was enabled before losing focus Requirements Checklist

Example created starter template on JSBin Reviewed by Two Core Contributors It seems we have never triggered change events on remoteTextTrack when we were using native text tracks This was a problem for VHS which exclusively uses text tracks This makes it so we do trigger the event Main issue with this change is that it creates a potential for a false positive where a change event was triggered from a nonremote text track but the remoteTextTrack list still received a change event This issue is mitigated by best practices of looping through the list looking for the modes that you care about Description Based on Specific Changes proposed Use the old liveui for live videos where seekableEnd seekableStart is less than s This is configurable with an option Requirements Checklist Feature

created starter template on JSBin Reviewed by Two Core Contributors helloI want to hide fullscreentoggle icon I tried many waysexample vjsfullscreencontrol displaynone or videojsmyvideo controlBar fullscreenToggle false but it still here my videojss version is thanks Description Currently the liveui has a few issues seektolive button to toggles off and on while playing and the seek bar moves around When playing behind the seek bar jumps around a lot Seekable interval is not consistent between videos Changes liveCurrentTime can run much faster than once every ms depending on how fast the interval is going This can put liveCurrentTime ahead of currentTime until a seekableEnd changes To Solve this we are going to use deltaTime rather than expecting a ms interval to run every ms pastSeekEnd is not being reset at the same time as seekable end is changed which can cause liveCurrentTime to report a value that is a segment length or more greater than what it should be To solve this pastSeekEnd needs to be reset to in its getter and all of the seekable end tracking needs to be done there isBehind is called two separate times this can cause different values to be returned A culmination of these issues caused the seekBar to jump every time seekableEnd changed because liveCurrentTime was so off from what it should have been Changed seekable interval to liveTolerance and set it to s This means that all videos will be live within s of live current time seekableendchange was removed it really wasnt needed QuestionsOther Problems Do we want the seekBar to stay at even though the user has seeked s into the past Is it just good enough to keep the seek bar at its actual percent but keep the seektolive button reporting that the video is live Currently creates weird behavior were seeking back s does go back in the video but the progress bar still shows and that we are live Other Pull requests Disable the new ui for short live windows s and when liveCurrentTime is Infinity like on Android native HLS Only update the seek bar when paused while live since we will only be changing our time when paused version videojs I use videojs in uniapp project and when use mp
