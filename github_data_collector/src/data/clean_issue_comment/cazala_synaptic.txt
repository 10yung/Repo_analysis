Im using synaptic in a thirdparty product on the client side basically a our code is being injected to our clients website We encountered an issue with a website that uses CSP ContentSecurityPolicy and does not allow unsafeeval Eval includes all method of executing string through javascript code evalvar x new Functionvar x It seems that the library is using new Function in couple of places After further investigation I realized that this code can be refactored to not use new Function but native code I can help fixing this issue I just want to know if there is a real reason for using this method rather than an actual code Mish is a new novel activation function proposed in this paper It has shown promising results so far and has been adopted in several packages including TensorFlowAddons SpaCy Tok Vec Layer Thinc SpaCys official NLP based ML library Echo AI Eclipses deeplearning j Hasktorch CNTKX Extension of Microsofts CNTK FastAIDev Darknet Yolov BeeDNN Library in C GenEfficientNetPyTorch dnet All benchmarks analysis and links to official package implementations can be found in this repository It would be nice to have Mish as an option within the activation function group This is the comparison of Mish with other conventional activation functions in a SEResNet for CIFAR Better accuracy and faster than GELU se Hello How to send an image as an input to make a prediciton For example If I want to make a neural network to know if an image is red how to send the image In this case it would be a buffer Thank you Hey clicking on this want you to install an addon which looks super fishy and plays sound Do you have plan to importexport model fromto ONNX standard Hi In Layer Connection I dont undestant the line ifthistype LayerconnectionTypeALLTOELSE from to because from and to are Neuron objects in two differente layers Maybe the code must be ifthistype LayerconnectionTypeALLTOELSE here there The original code was if thistype LayerconnectionTypeALLTOALL thistype LayerconnectionTypeALLTOELSE for var here in thisfromlist for var there in thistolist var from thisfromlist here var to thistolist there ifthistype LayerconnectionTypeALLTOELSE from to continue var connection fromprojectto weights thisconnections connectionID connection thissize thislistpushconnection Thanks Hi Ive been trying to save my network to a file so that i can use it without training it The toJSON doesnt seem to create a file in the directory where my files are Im doing this in the browser not via nodejs Im running the HTML file directly from my pc into chrome Im not using a server of any kind EDIT it is now also giving me the error fromJSON is not a function I was just about to test synaptic in a nodejs app for the first time so I copied down some of the basic code from the intro guide Stock code function Perceptroninput hidden output create the layers var inputLayer new Layerinput var hiddenLayer new Layerhidden var outputLayer new Layeroutput connect the layers inputLayerprojecthiddenLayer hiddenLayerprojectoutputLayer set the layers thisset input inputLayer hidden hiddenLayer output outputLayer The app runs successfully but when the app attempts to make a new perceptron it returns thisset is not a function Currently synaptic use Mathrandom inside the code like This means when you create a neural network it will behave differently when run in different computers different times It would be a good idea to maybe optionally specify a seed that get used for all randomness execution Currently I can just monkeypatch Mathrandom for that but this is not ideal i try get the iteration and error with this code let errors trainertraintrainingSet rate getParametersAnntipoparametroslr iterations errorgetParametersAnntipoparametroserror shuffle true log cost synapticTrainercostCROSSENTROPY schedule every do functiondata consolelogerrorsdata errorspushdataerror but never enters does not show the console
