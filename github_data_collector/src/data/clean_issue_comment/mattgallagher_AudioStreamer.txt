 Seeks to a specific time in seconds void seekToTimedoublevalue When using this function when streaming music from the dropbox The delegate function void audioPlayerSTKAudioPlayeraudioPlayer unexpectedErrorSTKAudioPlayerErrorCodeerrorCode errorCode STKAudioPlayerErrorCodecError Is possible do such things with the library start playing mp from url immediately like streaming or streaming cache it and track caching progress during its playback save cached file to local storage I want to switch rate when I play audio Thanks Hi thank for your library I want to know if it can run on iOS or not Thanks I built a audioqueue framework which can play local and online audio However this framework is used lots of your AudioStreamer code Can I publish my code onto github I will mark your copyright signs on parts of your code of cause If you have any questions please contact me Thank you AudioStreamer is really a good software Hi I wonder if it is possible to stream two HTTP sources and mix them Thanks a lot Support for CocoaPods Support for ARC Project fixed some warnings This literally pulls the original blog posts in and should be cleaned up to reflect the code base as it is today Though it would be nice if the original code bases for each of the blog posts was available For a learning tool it would help reflect the changes made over time to the design With that in mind this might make a better Wiki page if the original code bases were added Also cleaning up redundancy in the conditional that determines what to do with if discontinuous and moving it to a more clear guard style Is this possible I cant find a feature that would allow this Precision was lost when summing up all the bitrates together and then dividing it with the count in the calculateBitRate method So the bit rate looses couple hundred bits and thus shows wrong duration for long files also give wrong progress Can be tested with this minute voice sync file given below run it on VLC or some other player its total duration is actually hour second but without the fix of bitrate it shows hour second or something And after every seek it shows some extra seconds as current progress Also added a small method for break down the seconds to HHMMSS so that we can take a better look at duration and progress time Download the test file from here
