versions with old endpoints thats it versions older than Old endpoint remotephpwebdav br New endpoint remotephpdavfilesuser Upgrading matrix was totally correct FromTo OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK OK An specific upgrading scenario was reporting here So the scenario of upgrading from to was also recorded The final result is OK In the video you will see the following steps using the creation of a folder as operation In device version is installed you will see in the UserAgent Creation of a folder called Test MKCOL operation by calling the old dav endpoint as you can check in the mitmproxy flow Upgrading to Creation of a folder called Test In this case the endpoint is the new one upgradeFrom zip I noticed one issue Install an oldendpointsupportedversion No matter the server version Upgrade to Current app crashes but after restarting it works properly Expected no crash Time difference between release latest oldendpointsupportedversion and is months so it will not be a usual case to upgrade from one to the another one Does it worth to check and fix the issue for the following versions michaelstingl Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Currently one of the photo apps on my phone are not able to store the picture on the folder which is used from owncloud client and the other photo app to sync with my server Therefore tasker is coping the pictures to the correct folder but a sync is not started I would like to tell the client do a folder sync or a new picture is stored Sync it Describe the solution youd like I would like to have a trigger which can be used from tasker to start a folder sync I would like to tell the owncloud client do a folder sync or a new picture is stored Sync it from tasker TASKS Research if needed Create branch featurefeaturename Development tasks Implement whatever Code review and apply changes requested Design test plan QA Merge branch featurefeaturename into master PR App Library if needed Hi Were working on the release of to our CERN community and there were a couple of issues that we found Please keep in mind that we have our own implementation of the backend REVA which differs from the OC server so some of these issues are not bugs per se but what we see as limitations I can open some of them in separate issues if you prefer App crashes looking for parent If I have a folder I would expect dav to return httpdunixdirectory as dgetcontenttype This is actually something that is present in the new REVAOCIS propfindgoL But if I return this the app crashes here with parentPath null App fails to load shares Due to our storage infrastructure where files might live in different storage instances and fileIDs are not shared between them itemsource and filesource have the format InstanceNameFileID for example home This works for both the web and sync clients But on the mobile app when getting the shares of a file GET ocsv phpappsfilessharingapiv shares the app gives an error and displays nothing This happens because it tries to convert fileitem source into Long ShareXMLParserktL and ShareXMLParserktL App uses the old webdav endpoint When we released into our beta channel our testers including me were updated from the version Everything seemed to be working fine until someone tried to install the app in a fresh device and when I removed my account and added it again What happened was that the people who updated still used the old webdav endpoint remotephpwebdav and the people who started clean used the new one remotephpdavfiles which was not compliant After discussing this in the OC chat I was informed that the app should always use the new endpoint and is not compatible with the old one So this is a Bug that need to be fixed before we release the update to everyone else App freezes when app switching If I opened OC switch to another app and tried to return to OC the app froze and I had to close it and open it again I cannot reproduce this problem anymore maybe there were some leftovers in the device like the ones reported in Maybe it was caused by the fact that the app was using the old webdav endpoint Im not sure Ill report back later if I manage to reproduce it again Environment data Android version Device model OnePlus T Stock or customized system Stock ownCloud app version ownCloud server version CERNBoxREVA Not sure if this app is supported anymore I can probably put up a PR for this after digging into it Creating the ticket anyway Actual behaviour App crashes when trying to connect to server secured with self signed
