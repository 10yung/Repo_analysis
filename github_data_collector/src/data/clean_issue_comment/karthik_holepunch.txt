Often the repository itself might contain packaged functionality in which case it needs to be installed itself Currently in this demo research compendium repo all dependencies are installed correctly but the additional functionality contained in the package itself is not and rendering of paperRmd fails It would be great if there was either an option or even autoinstallation of the repo if a DESCRIPTION file is present Hello Id like to create a project session with some bioconductor libraries But Im having issue I see this as a point in the roadmap What is the problem exactly Maybe I can help Thanks Carlos Vivar Rios Currently writecompendiumdescription writes all dependencies together It would be more useful to separate out remotes and imports It would be good to mention that people can already run their work locally before making it public or when they need more resources by using which is the tech used on a BinderHub The advantage is that you are adding reproducibility from day one not as an after thought when everything is done now just need to make it reproducible holepunch is magical I am using it for and it makes the workshop materials so much more accessible The setup was mostly smooth but I hit a snag because of the dependency on TensorFlow rockerbinder omits TensorFlow and rightly so so learndrakes own Dockerfile borrows heavily from rockertensorflow It works now but it took some micromanaging to go through aptget and pip and make sure to invoke the correct user for each I an wondering if we can or should do anything in holepunchs API to abstract away this sort of thing Maybe have arguments in holepunchwritedockerfile to supply apt and python dependencies Or maybe a holepunchyml file that borrows from travisyml
