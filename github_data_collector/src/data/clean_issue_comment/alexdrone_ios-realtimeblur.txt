Is there any way to change how strong the blur is Thanks Im new so I cant really offer much more than that Does this still work When i change frame size after initializing the view it renders a black background and no blur effect even with less frames if this is applied on a view which contains a tableview everything is extremely jerky Good try though thank you for your work I tried everything nothing works on iOS tintColor backgroundColor you cannot change it its always white my app has a dark theme and the blurred view needs to match the app but you cannot change it This errors happens when the visibleArea width or height are zero The performance of this library could be greatly improved below is a list of recommendations to take to increase the performance To capture the raw pixels you can utilise a CGBitmapContextCreate with your own memory buffer as the first argument This allows you to skip compressing it to a JPG and then an NSData object just to unpack it back into raw pixels using the image provider methods You can use the vImageBuffer as both the source and destination to avoid using more memory than necessary Both of the above recommendations can be found here I didnt create a pull request because the code is not heavily tested In the simple testing I did it resulted in a speedup of about x Did you want to create the pull requestissue on CocoaPodsSpecs to add this to the list Or would you like me to go ahead with it Looks like this doesnt work correct Trying to build something like the control center in iOS So if I try to present a blur view modally from the bottom of the window the blur view isnt real time Just statically contains its background and doesnt change as its animated Any ideas how to implement this I have a moving transparent view on top of the blurred view and I can see it in the blurred view
