thousand document additions the server stops responding to all queries Using the above code I can kill and restart the server and it resumes adding documents The data directory is MB STracing the

FUTEXWAIT NULL Since in all our example we chose the name of the UID ourself we already create a human readable field because of that and because there will probably not be a case where the user needs an infinite number of indexes with random generated uids I think the name should simply be specified as unique Like in SQL and most databases We thrive for simplicity of use and this double parameter each time we create an index is weird qdequele Kerollmops Tried on latest release v And current master Both have same behavior When doing this search query q woman filters titleAfter

In conclusion When attributesToRetrieve has more than one attribute to retrieve all parameters are ignored and all attributes are present in the returned documents as well as the offset is back to his default value When making a request with bad query parameters it should throw an error but instead the parameter is ignored and the request completes normally bash curl X GET jq bash curl X GET jq Both requests are successful and both requests have the same response as if no query parameter was given It should send back a Bad request or a Unprocessable Entity Hello Im not sure of your roadmap
