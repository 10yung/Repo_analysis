Hi First of all love this project Using it to teach matrix indexing and finally simulate and animate an epidemic One thing I find a bit confusing though is your choice of indexing which is different from numpy eg python grid BlockGrid blocksize printgridshape grid As opposed to numpy python grid npzeros printgridshape grid current ipythonblocks draw grids whose topleft corner is on sometimes we will use for example grid who occupy so it will be convenient if ipythonblocks support to custom this parameters this is actally questions can we show the coordinate axes with arrow ie xy when we call show I noticed that in ipythonblocks xaxis is from left to right yaxis is from top to down But it is also common to use at least yaxis which is from down to top Thnaks Hi All this is an interesting bug When i attempt to render a grid using ImageGrid i get space where the grid should render in the console BUT no grid Or i get a series of lines one line for each cell with the appropriate assigned colors however no actual cells this issue is a bit baffling because it works perfectly in notebook doesnt it all just use the ipython renderer for example this code doesnt render from ipythonblocks import ImageGrid grid ImageGrid gridshow This code renders lines row ImageGrid row no color black row all colors white row all red row all green row all blue row red and green row red and blue row green and blue rowshow Everything works perfectly in notebook so i understand if this is a notebook focused package thank you Leah It will make everybodys life slightly easier if we call clearoutput first instead of last when flashing Hi Ever since I first saw ipythonblocks a few weeks ago I started to wonder about the extent to which it might be useful as a way visualising the structure of pandas dataframes and the results of applying various transformations to them Ive started sketching some proof of concept ideas out here If anyone else is interested in chatting through ideas about how to push pandas DataFrame visualisations using ipythonblocks or is already further on than my experiments are or has taken a different approach to the same or related issues please let me know Itd be cool to be able to do NumPyesque things like python grid gridrgb colorsRed colorsBlue Make red green and blue properties for the grid classes maybe just BlockGrid if it can be designed right These should return a monochrome grid of the right class representing the color intensities of the corresponding property These will also support setting either by a single number or another monochrome grid Monochrome grid support requires Exactly the same as the existing grids but monochrome Considerations Do we need a mode keywordattribute or does it suffice to support single int color specs and let the mode be implied Is the internal representation single digits or do we keep the the RGB tuples and make them all the same Keeping the tuples has some advantages when it comes to the HTML repr since thats expecting a triplet
