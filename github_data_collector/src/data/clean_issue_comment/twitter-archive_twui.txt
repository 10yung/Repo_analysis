The imageName method in TUIImage could not accept the image name without ext The NSImage or UIImage could auto complete the image name with png and x according to the environment I suggest the following change It works well for me objectivec TUIImage imageNamedNSString name cacheBOOLshouldCache ifname return nil static NSMutableDictionary cache nil ifcache cache NSMutableDictionary alloc init TUIImage image cache objectForKeyname ifimage return image NSImage nsImage NSImage imageNamedname ifnsImage return nil NSData data nsImage TIFFRepresentation ifdata image self imageWithDatadata ifimage ifshouldCache cache setObjectimage forKeyname return image Suppresses warnings from mismatched string formatters When using a touchtrackpad the scroll indicators are not visible while dragging The only way to make them appear is to flick the scrollview They become visible as soon as you stop touching the touchtrackpad Otherwise we get strange artifacts when redrawing TUILabels on Retina displays Hi These changes adds a subclass to TUIImage that is backed by an NSImage instance not CGImageRef The benefits are Supports PDFbased images Brings in NSImages support for multiresolution image resource files eg retina display x files Thanks Im trying to track down a crash that occurs when a window is closed and released that contains a TwUI view hierarchy From what I can tell while a NSWindow is being deallocd the TUINSView tries to clean up the hierarchy which ends up accessing the window and causing the crash Im not familiar enough with the TUIView internals to know the proper fix but if I set the rootView of my TUINSView to nil before the window is released it doesnt crash and every thing seems to work correctly Heres a sample project that reproduces the crash but you can also reproduce it in the example project by commenting out the setReleasedWhenClosed calls in ExampleAppDelegatem In the past I could draw a text inside a table view cell with a different color depending on the cell state selected or not by using a text renderer object With the current master branch this is not possible anymore since the table view cell drawing is not updated correctly Example Ive updated the Example project to reproduce the problem here The text renderer should draw the text in white color if the cell is selected otherwise the title should be black The problem is that the title color gets not updated correctly after deselecting a cell the title is still white and after selecting the title is still black I believe that you would do a great favor to potential users of your framework if you wrote a short getting started guide Currently one has to dig into the source code and be quite familiar with Cocoa to understand how things work Looks like a lot of new commits entered time to spin a release
