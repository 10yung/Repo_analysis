When I run deploys I get the start of the deployment in the logs windows but none of the logs I have create come out The last thing I see is below and deployinator is unable to detect that the deployment has completed I am using logandstream and the nobodyworkbenchbotuatdeployhtml is filled as expected My environment is always building from the lastest Gem and is running in Docker with ports open I can see the WS connection open in the browsernot sure how to inspect the traffic The deployment its self is some json posts to various services and takes approx secs Thanks Mark Any ideas LOCKING workbenchbot Push started at Calling workbenchbotuatdeploy Running ln nfs optdeployinatorrunlogs nobodyworkbenchbotuatdeployhtml optdeployinatorrunlogscurrentworkbenchbot Time If you want to use deployinator to deploy itself currently you have to call it something different like deployin or to avoid namespacing issues This can be fixed by changing the way view classes are called to be DeployinatorView instead of Deployinator the exact stack name i had the same problem ruby We currently ignore the status of the gitclone command in this can lead to annoying troubleshooting if the permissions are wrong on the checkout folder for example We should stop shelling out and use a proper git library for our git operations
