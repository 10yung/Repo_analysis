jdanyow would it be possible to offer utterances also for GitLab Pages Many thanks for your help Hi mates I looked at clientjs but I think to recreate a scriptTag in an SPA env is not the preferred way So I came up and drafted an Utterances Vue Component which actually should do the same as the clientjs but in the Vueway More precisely it generates and updates the iframe Pls have a look at If you find any frictions please let me know Perhaps we could transfer this Component into your Repo or create an official one in your org Or we develop an entire VuepressPlugin for utterances PS the project name is not very googlefriendly D Hi I wonder if you thought about a thread feature where ppl can answer to a specific topic So the idea is that a thread is an Issue with custom topic and assign to a page using labels In addition we could mark a thread als solved by closing the issue I use Gatsby and love utterances on reactwithutterances I have implemented useDarkMode in my site and would like to know of some way to switch between light and dark with this module and others This could be done with useState in React hooks but not sure how to do it any clues I would like to add the utterances discord server invite link to the site Closes Added options to reverse order of comments and put the input form above comments instead of below As most of the time I expect either both or none of them to be used they are handled by a common checkbox in the config generator Overall it seems to work but I have not tested it on cases with hidden pages I have not seen any Example config from the configurationcomponent html script src repo ENTER REPO HERE issuetermpathname themegithublight reverseordertrue inputpositiontoptrue crossoriginanonymous async script Fixes html script src repo ENTER REPO HERE issuetermpathname themegithublight crossoriginanonymous sortnew async script sort is not mandatory And is default to old It seems theres an unnecessaryIMO horizontal padding on each side of the rendered comment box Currently this slightly breaks my blogs layout Is there any option to remove this padding What is different about the github API for public and private repos that makes utterances not work for the latter Even if a public repo was used to collect issues separately for a private repo its entirely possible that comments in the public issues could leak sensitive information about the private repo Thanks This is the one of the last two things that Utterances needs to beat Disqus friends
