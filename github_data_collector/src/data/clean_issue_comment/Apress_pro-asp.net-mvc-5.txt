 Added missing ignore file Temporary files removed from reposiitory Updated nuget packages to fix broken projects This is an errata file Please take as reference the printed book ISBN On line and line based on the variables cartTotal and arrayTotal it seems to imply that author intends to show difference in getting total value from a ShoppingCart instance that also implements IEnumerableProduct VS an array of Product objects In the original method both cartTotal and arrayTotal are assigned with same set of products from IEnumerableProduct products This seems to contradict with the idea of comparison Thanks for the source code though it has been helpful
