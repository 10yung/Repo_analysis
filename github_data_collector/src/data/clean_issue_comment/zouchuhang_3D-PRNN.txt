Hi I want to retrained the network on my own data and I notice that each array entry in primgt folder is of shape numofparts Can you explain what do these parameters mean Also whats the use for primrnnbatchnzalltrt and primrnnbatchnzallvalt Thanks in advance Thank you for releasing the code There are few error that I am getting while using the script scriptparseprimitivem The VoxelPlotter function is not there However I found out the code on the internet Similarly there is a missing source file in minFunc That too I found online Loading previously parsed primitives is not working that is rerunning the script scriptparseprimitivem with previously parsed primitive because of the following reasons a In the script scriptparseprimitive there is error Reference to nonexistent field primall for line b In the same script at line thetaprev primparamvoxnumq there is an error about exceeding the dimension I guess this is because it is trying to access th index which is absent It seems that the pipeline is broken in between different script eg scriptparseprimitivem scriptrefineparseprimitivem and scriptparseprimitivesymmetrym If you can provide solution to the second point that will be great
