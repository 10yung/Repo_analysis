Dear Canlab team When I try to run the canlabglmsubjectlevels function I get the following error undefined function canlabspmfmrimodeljob for input arguments of type cell The problem seems to be that this function is missing from the matlab path However upon checking I cannot find this function as well as the function canlabspmcontrastjobluka in any of the canlab repositories Is this correct I added a screenshot of the DSGNmat variables in case the error may come from there Many thanks in advance Jelle DSGN Hello there I was recently trying a glmfit I tested the example given in the help for the function glmfitmultilevel and I get the following error It seems that the error is rather deep in the code and I am not good enough with statistics to determine how to fix this Has something changed since the example was written and tested Undefined operator for input arguments of type cell Error in glmfitgeneralgetweightsbasedonvarcomponents line SSW dfwithin s within x nvars

data as defined in lines of the glmfitmultilevelm I receive the following errors Undefined operator for input arguments of type cell Error in glmfitgeneralgetweightsbasedonvarcomponents line SSW

figured out the boundary conditions of when this happens and when it does not happen Here is an example of when it happens The top is the original image The bottom is resampled to a new space notice how the image has been shifted right In my testing this occurrence of this bug may depend more on the target space being sampled to rather than the resampling algorithm but more testing is needed to better understand this Here is the code to recreate the bug limbicmask fmridatafullfilerepodir data Etienne modulesnii limbicrs resamplespacelimbicmask gbt nearest orthviewsmultipleobjslimbicmask

addbrainsurface left or addbrainsurface right returns I need the file LpialMSMAll d WRNDeDrift kmat From the documentation this is the template from Glasser et al Nature based on the Human Connectome Project Is it intended to be included in CanlabCore Upon running the canlabtoolboxsetup I get this warning Warning Function vecnorm has the same name as a MATLAB builtin We suggest you rename the function to avoid a potential name conflict In path line In addpath line In canlabclonegithubrepository line In canlabtoolboxsetup line Might be worth renaming it to avoid namespace collision Resample space incorrectly transforms data if written in any order other than x y z dimensions The transformation assumes this order but it is not necessarily the case Hi there I m trying to verify that the results I get from glmfitmultilevel and that I get from lme and nlme in R are the same but I am finding that they are not My model has one continuous predictor and one categorical predictor both on level and I can include a continuous interaction as well I m new to using glmfitmultilevel but have been using R for years so am wondering how glmfitmultilevel computes betas and SE that is different from the R packages I ve attached a reproducible example Any clarification on this would help Thanks in advance Liz GlmfitmultilevelvsRzip Dear Canlab group thank you for this great toolbox I am using your scnsessionspikeid function and it works very nicely However using the default MADs value of quite many of my volumes are identified as containing spikes up to from one session This made me wonder what your rationale was for setting this default threshold I first thought that I could simply find the correct threshold by determining the critical chisquare value for a desired probability level and the degrees of freedom Then I saw that in your function the MADs threshold is not applied directly to the calculated mahalanobis distances in d I guess given the degrees of freedom it would also have to be much higher than in this case anyways but rather as a cutoff for deviation of these d values from a moving average Can you give a recommendation what criteria to use if one wants to change the default MADs value Many thanks in advance Teresa
