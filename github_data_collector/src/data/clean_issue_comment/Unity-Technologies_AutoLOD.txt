in place of WorkingMesh Current document is limited do you have any video tutorial or step by step approach It will be helpful The old version is working in f but the new version Thank you A LoD group of levels was generated from Simplygon on local grid The resulting prefabs were copied into a basic scene The LoD Group prefab was attached to the HLoD Root public input of the Volume Script which is attached to the automatically added LODVolumeNode object The Enable HLOD button was clicked No geometry renders during play in the editor with a basic FlyCamera moving in the scene Im not sure if the LoD prefabs were connected to the AutoLoD system in the correct way by attaching the group prefab to the HLoD root AutoLoDTest Hi trying to use AutoLOD with lowpoly project but generating mesh with the default QuadricMeshSimplifier results in smoothed mesh I spent hours trying to learn the code and trying to pinpoint the exact part where the smoothing feature is done but couldnt find it Removing these files from the QuadricMeshSimplifier script results in sharp mesh but all the colors of the model are lost meshSimplifierUV inputMeshuv outputMeshuv meshSimplifierUV Hope that helps to solve the problem Loving these plugins so far but running into some issues with SceneLOD on one of my projects Its a relatively large project and is split into multiple scenes that are loaded additively on top of each other using the plugin though I suspect the same issue would be present just using Unitys builtin additive scene system As far as I can tell SceneLOD doesnt handle multiple scenes appropriately Ive tried to make some local changes to the code base to get it working properly but havent been able to get it fully functional yet Is multiple scene support something that might be handled at some point or should I start considering coding our own HLOD system As an alternative to an automatic LOD generation for individual assets could Imposters perhaps be implemented in their stead With the advent of the new ShaderGraph situation I would think this would be in the cards for LOD right D PS I just wanted to yell from the top of my lungs that YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME Thanks for looking into this LOD stuff Ive been wanting to make larger worlds but Unity has been very adament about crushing my dreams on this Demo Please Dont Know How to use Scene LOD at all might it be possible to atsomepoint think about linkingreaching out to some timeserved battletested UAS solutions and making sure they know about the project It would seem to be in Unity ecospheres ethos and gives them every chance to get involved For examples I think HLOD is most important part of Game Making Because perfomance is most important part of Game Unity lightmap are belong to scene How can I bake lightmap in HLOD andor default the Quadric simplifier to preserve borders
