fulfill my promises Fixes rstudio This version builds on original suggestions from chrisvwn It creates a function that reads multirow headers into an array of arrays where each arrary row is a header row Further it updates csv copy pdf excel and print to process the multirow header object For excel it merges the cells as shown on screen It does not update the flash counter parts of html functions I am working on a bookdown project where we have large tables that also contain citations We are outputting in both html and pdf The problem is that I cannot find a way to make the citations render in the tables I have also asked on SO For PDF output this latex workaround works if I use kable However for the html output I have been using DTdatatable and I cannot figure a way to make the references render Is there a way to get the markdown parsed citation in the table markdown example title Untitled output htmldocument bibliography referencesbib In text citation chambers A plan dataframe can

global bootstraplib theme exists which will be set automatically by rmarkdownhtmldocumentbase as a part of which allows us to set defaults for datatables SASS variables based on sensible Bootstrap SASS variables In other words we can now provide much better default styling for DT when using Bootstraprmarkdownhtmldocumentbase that will respect to custom user themes as well For nonBootstrap cases Ive added a datatableThemeVariables which allows you to control datatables SASS variables without any other dependencies other than the sass package Hello I dont know if I should tag this issue as a Feature Request As I already asked on StackOverflow with no answer I would like to implement a custom formatXXX function to format datatables columns the same way DTformatCurrency DTformatDate I implemented all the R logic following the same structure than DT formating functions so in the end I need to call a DTWidgetformatXXX javascript function I created the javascript function but I dont know howwhere to add this new javascript code to be executed properly I saw that the DTWidget formating functions in insthtmlwidgetsdatatablesjs are wrapped into a function in which a global var DTWidget object is decraled but Ive not manage to reproduce a similar logic with my custom function I really have no idea how to do this any help would be appreciated Thank You Please keep the portion

that my issue may be closed if I dont fulfill my promises Is there a way to fully disable the cells so that clicking on them does not display them in an editlike cell Currently using editablelisttargetcell disablelistcolumnsc results in column being shaded and labeled as readonly but it still is displayed in an editlike cell and any formatting is lost For example if a column is disabled but has formatSignif applied then when doubleclicked it is redisplayed with full display of digits Or if the column is not escaped because it contains an HTML icon the cell is shown with the HTML even though its not editable Maybe theres a way to truly disable editing so that double clicking on a disabled column does nothing Now datatables library has the official Select extension Due to historical reasons DT implements the selection functionality separately Replacing the current selection implementation with Select extension can be beneficial Fewer conflicts with other extensions Reduce javascript codes so easier to maintain Consistent styles like bootstrap or other table themes I have wished for this for a long time Took a look at the last weekend and it should be technically possible
