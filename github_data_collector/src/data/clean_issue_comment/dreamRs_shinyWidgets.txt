I hope it is okay that i post this question here Ive been looking for a solution for some time now posted this question on servereal other sites and thus far i have come of short Im having some

display when the user open the app Im wondering if something similar is going to be developed for selectizeGroup I already posted a question on stackoverflow Hello Victor I would like to use pickerGroup widget in my shiny app but I cannot do a multiple selection within one or several filters It is useful to cumulate different elements in an analysis I tried something like that shinyWidgetsselectizeGroupUI filters params list year listinputId year label Year multiple TRUE For now I switched to selectizeGroup would it be possible to implement this feature Hi I m developping a Shiny App with the shinyWidgets package for doing my selectInput I have many modalities for the inputs variable which cause some bugs I want to optimise this by reducing the size of the picker size argument and if possible show only first options of variables and activate the liveSearch option But not seems to work pickerInput inputId synidpart label Id part choices uniquemonidpart multiple T selected options pickerOptions actionsBox TRUE liveSearch TRUE virtualScroll size Thanks for the great package Im using sliderTextInput which works well for my purposes except that when there are a lot of labels they either get way too small or if the text size is increased they start to overlap and become unreadable With sliderInput some of the values would have their labels removed automatically but this doesntcant happen with sliderTextInput because they conceptually dont have a numeric value so the unlabelled data would not be obvious Perhaps a different answer would be to have a way to hover over the input to see the labels at different ticks Therefore it would be useful to be able to change the orientation of the labels so they are or degrees rotated and therefore not overlapping Ive got a SO question about this that includes reprex here Thanks Im interested in having a selectizeinput that allows copypaste in both directions into the selectize field and out of it I thought this project might be a good place for this See these questions for context Copy and paste text in selectizeInput in a Shiny application Pasting multiple items into selectizeInput The current solution doesnt seem to interact well with shinyupdateSelectizeInput Thank you for all the widgets Is it possible to have a dragselect multiple options in picker input So I dont have to click every single option I know there is Select All button but I dont want to select all only a continuous subset of options Or maybe shiftselectlike feature to emulate selecting files in file explorers Thanks Hello For some reason I need to set the CSS property overflow hidden to an element which contains a dropdown I really need this CSS property I cannot remove it But then the dropdown panel is clipped by the container Do you have an idea how to solve that Maybe I could solve this issue if it were possible to know whether the dropdown is open by doing something similar to this for the Bootstrap dropdown Is it possible to know whether the dropdown is open Thanks for the great package Im using a selectizeInput inside a dropdown Id like the dropdown to close only when clicking the button However when selecting an item from the selectizeInput the dropdown closes Weirdly enough this happens only in the browser not in RStudio viewer and only when selecting one of the last two items
