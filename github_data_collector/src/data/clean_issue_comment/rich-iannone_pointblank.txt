Currently this doesnt work for tbldbi objects tested on SQLite and MySQL but its fine for dataframe and tbldf Love this package Im setting up all sorts of validations and one thing I think would be useful is to enable a direct comparison of one column to another For example if we wanted to validate that column a is always greater than column b we should be able to use colvalsgtvarsa varsb What do you think Again this package is incredible Thanks Right now its a pretty barebones report This is needed to simplify the model for validation steps With a list column we can accommodate any type so any values put in value set and regex would simply go into the values list column This also makes it easier to have nonnumeric comparisons so dates or datetimes could then be specified and used This is necessary for creating any schematics of the validation plan and for reporting postinterrogation It should indicate the settings for the object returned by the actionlevels helper function and applied to the validation step These will need to be SVGs It also has to fit in nicely with the SVGbased function frame This function is just to display simple instructions on how to do the basic things la We need a standardized test suite that exercises all of the validation step functions with a variety of database types The databases and their drivers should be MySQL with RMariaDB PostgreSQL with RPostgres SQLite with RSQLite Right now date and datetime column values cannot be validated and that s a shame I intended to check keyproperties of sfcobjects making use of rowsnotduplicated The check was supposed to ignore the geometry column of the object cf nd example in reprex It seems that interrogate ran into an error because of the way summarize works on these objects Reprex example r librarypointblank librarysf Linking to GEOS GDAL PROJ Geometry object with features g repstsfcstpoint vector with entries v ca b object including both objects mixedobj stsfvector v points g mixedobj Simple feature collection with features and field geometry type POINT dimension XY bbox xmin ymin xmax ymax epsg SRID NA proj string NA vector points a POINT b POINT agent createagent agent focusonmixedobj rowsnotduplicated interrogate Error Cant coerce element from a list to a double It already happens when I only check if column vector is duplicated likely because sfobjects have sticky geometries agent createagent agent focusonmixedobj rowsnotduplicatedcols vector interrogate Error Cant coerce element from a list to a double supCreated on by the reprex package v sup I think it happens at the following chunk in interrogate in the section Judge tables on expectation of nonduplicated rows r Get total count of rows rowcount table dplyrgroupby dplyrsummarizerowcount n dplyrastibble purrrflattendbl My expectation would be that in the first case of the reprex rowsnotduplicated without specifying columns each whole row including the geometry column would be compared with the others in the second case rowsnotduplicatedcols vector the check would be done only for the column vector Perhaps a solution might be to call astibble before groupby and summarize CC krlmlr Howdy Not so much an issue but a request Would it be useful to create a vignette detailing how to use this package for data testing prior to retraining a machine learning model pb
