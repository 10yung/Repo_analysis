I would like to have a save button that would download the markdown file with an md extension onto my computer Thank you Hi Im working on an Electron app and Im using Showdown as my renderer because I can customize on it as I like I like SimpleMDE but the only problem is the renderer how can I change it I related that theres a bug when applying bold on more than one line The bug occurs when you break line by pressing enter and not the text breaking automattically When you press the toolbar button to bold and then press it again to cancel the effect the entire line appears selected Look at the pics bellow In the editor on the preview page you can simulate it too Captura de tela de Captura de tela de In the css file no matter what value I put into CodeMirror height px it never changes However changes like direction rtl work so its not a problem with import or something Anyone knows what might be the problem Thanks Only one Chinese character can be entered at a time on mobile Allows installing the package using the PHP package manager Composer As the underlying editor is codemirror would you provide a means to set the keymap Example using sublime mapping See how ctrld selects multiple items see how ctrlshiftdown moves a line down and a ton of other useful key shortcuts It would be great if it was possible to allow content in the non preview editor to be replaced I want to allow users to add a placeholder like image And then I can use the change handler to analyse the content and if it finds a placeholder it will swap it for an uploaded image The images will be uploaded outside the simplemde editor What I need is a method that will allow me to insert all of the content back into the editable non preview area of the simplemde editor
