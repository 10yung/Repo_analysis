is the extension trying to connect to Both the GitHub website and the command line tool work perfectly Background Our auditors are looking for specific approval wording on the approval comment Request It would be nice to use a keybinding or other macro type feature to enter a predefined comment We are doing this today via the Saved Replies option on the web I am just using the GH PR extension and

Extension version VSCode Version OS Linux Mint Steps to Reproduce Check out a PR Im on the correct PR branch Now I am unable to open the actual file to edit it The only option I have is to open it in GitHub Ive seen screenshots where there are options in this contextual menu to open it The PR for that has been merged Not sure exact steps to get into this situation but I had an old PR branch locally the author added commits rebased the whole thing onto master then force pushed I checked it out and saw that the files were still in the old state I got a notification saying This branch can be updated or similar but when I clicked pull I got a bunch of merge conflicts the old changes conflicting with the new changes when the new should have directly replaced the old but didnt probably due to the forcepushrebase I ran git pull abort to get back to the old state than ran vscodes git sync which for me does rebase not sure if thats relevant and ended up in the correct state Perhaps the Pull button should trigger a git sync Though that might push bad commits so Im not sure Related to It feels like the message box that shows Your local repository is not up to date so only partial content is being displayed could be improved to add a button which does a fetch on the base branch and reloads the document I would be willing to try and contribute a fix for this if the team is open to this Issue Type bBugb In the GitHub Pull Requests tree expand a PR that has images or gifs in it and open one of these files Error is shown and image is not opened Also happens when the PR is
