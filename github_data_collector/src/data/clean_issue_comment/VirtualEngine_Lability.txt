When I use Lability I use a custom resource to copy entire folders of modules over to the created VMs and this works pretty well But in some other places I want put single scripts somewhere on the filesystem In my specific case its a startup script that will be scheduled for ONSTART during CustomBootStrap but is not available for download and writing it out myself in CustomBootStrap becomes really long and a PITA escaping I could put it somewhere on the local filesystem but then not bundling it with the DSC is irritating It would be cool to be able to use a Content tag on the Resource type instead of a Uri If this exists it writes out Content to the Filename on the VM in UTF no BOM instead of trying to download the file or use one locally What do you think I am new to Labilty and still have some troubles with initial useful setup These troubles are lightest among other lab bootstrapping tools but still there are present Id like to make use of this excellent engine But Id like to taskify the internals of StartLabConfiguration too What do you think about it ing out line enables this configuration to work ing out line allows the configuration to run successfully When running this configuration this error occurs At line char PrefixLength nodePrefixLength The member PrefixLength is not valid Valid members are AddressFamily DependsOn InterfaceAlias IPAddress PsDscRunAsCredential CategoryInfo ParserError ParentContainsErrorRecordException FullyQualifiedErrorId InvalidInstanceProperty ing out line enables it to run without error Lability currently only supports the PS Gallery Github and Filesystem module providers If using an internal repository eg ProGet or PSPrivateGallery it would be great to be able to download modules from there too Im not sure if its not possible but I wasnt able to find a way to set Vlan ID on virtual switch or on VM NICs during the deployment Also setting the CompatibilityForMigrationEnabled on vCPU or other VM settings would be useful Ideally it could be set through Lability metadata properties A little side question as there is no Contributing guideline yet is there a way to ask more specific questions regarding contribution Like Slack group etc Because if Id like to help with this functionality for example I could search the whole module or I could ask somebody where exactly this metadata properties code is placed and develop it further from there We need an option to set the High Performance power setting on the Lability host I always forget to do this and it makes things noticeably quicker Consider adding support for bootstrapping only the metaconfig into the VMs so that the configurations and all others settings credentials global variables etc can be dynamically retrieved from Azure Automation Using the Azure Automation module a metamof is created like this First the node must be registered DscNodeParameters AzureVMName DC AzureVMResourceGroup DC NodeConfigurationName ServersWMF DC ConfigurationMode ApplyAndAutocorrect RebootNodeIfNeeded true RegisterAzureRmAutomationDscNode DscNodeParameters Also the specified NodeConfigurationName must exist regular DSC configuration uploaded to Azure Then the metaconfig can be generated like this GetAzureRmAutomationDscOnboardingMetaconfig ComputerName DC OutputFolder DSCMOFDirectory Azure Automation DSC will generate the certificate for encryption so no need to injecthandle that in this scenario This will require internet connectivity and DHCP in the virtual network though but it would be a cool scenario Supporting only metaconfigs could also mean supporting a regular DSC Pull Server but in that case the certificates must be handled In Windows and Windows Server Microsoft have introduced a set of new capabilities around managing virtual network adapters more info here This feature can be leveraged to mitigate the network adapter naming issue which often occurs when working with DSC configurations where network adapter names is hard coded For example in the bootstrap file it could be added a few lines to check whether the property HyperV Network Adapter Name has a value and if so rename the network adapter inside the guest operating system to the same name Another possibilty could be creating a separate DSC Resource for this Im open to contribute but Id like some views on the best way to do this We must also remember to enable Device Naming when creating VM network adapters in the Lability module
