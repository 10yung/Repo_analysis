I just added some missing imports and a comment about how to use view with a different backend eg PyQt Hi all Ive tried running the P notebook with a Muse using Python and muselsl on a Linux machine Besides a couple fixes on imports that I can add with a PR I couldnt get the stimulusstart recordingstart section to work The Muse is correctly working and I can view the stream but when I get to that section it either fails with a Cannot find EEG stream message or if I invert the order of the calls with an exception related to an empty list sorry I dont have the full exception handy at the moment but I can attach it later The interesting bit is that if I start the stimulus and press Esc within a couple seconds the EEG stream will actually be found the markers will not be found anyway but the recording will go on Any ideas on what it could be Hello I was able to get the scripts to run such a cool project thank you I tried to get a video presentation to work but I failed After overcoming psychopyvideo difficulties I am able to run a videopresentation script essentially the version that is in psychopys examples but when I try to interface that script with the runexperimentpy files which call the multiprocessingpool functions then it fails I tried to refactor the code but it seems that the video multiprocessing doesnt work i have an intuition why that might be the case but couldnt find much on the web Does anybody have deeper insights or ideas for how to make it work best r SSVEP stimulus presentation crashes on Windows due to the mywingetActualFramerate function returning None Unfortunately even increasing the nMaxFrames parameters doesnt seem to allow the function to resolve with a return value This may likely be a surface pro related issue due to unusual display properties Issue encountered on Windows using a new Python Miniconda install Installing HDF tools didnt solve issue and required a bullshit account registration Switching to Python has allowed us to bypass issue As we gather more and more data itll be important to have a clear specification for how itll look Fortunately the hard work in designing a structure for orgaizing neuroimaging data has already been done by the BIDS project I propose we refactor our current data folder to the BIDS format shown here in this template Well also have to change the notebooks to record data in the appropriate dirs Psychopy loads and the entire screen fills with the grey background but none of the images in N P etc are displayed Running into a critical error in the psychopy stimulus generation scripts related to setting the screens gamma values RuntimeError Gamma ramp size is reported as Apparently this is currently unresolved issue that the team is aware of The quick fix in the forum thread above works setting the winType paramter in psychopyvisualWindow to pygame
