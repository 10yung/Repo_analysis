am not able to detect this MS with the script Thanks in advance Recently came across a windows SP which was vulnerable to this attack Windows exploit suggester however didnt seem to notice it even tough it was represented in the Microsoft xls db so i tought id add it I hope i added it right I love this tool but Microsoft will not update bulletin search spreadsheets anymore It would be great if you can update windowsexploitsuggester A little bit info about new security guidance A similar spreadsheet can be exported from guidance however it does not contain the update replacement information I verified that the information about supercedence can be found in the api response Hi i have windows and Python When the script read the systeminfo file this error show me python
