I had made a Flask application which wrapped a scikitlearn SVC and deployed it to GCP for a hackathon project before hearing of interpret and wanting to port my project to use interpret instead of scikitlearn After switching to an ExplainableBoostingClassifier I was successfully able to run the entire thing locally from training to application but when deploying to GCP I found that when training the model initially there was seemingly an issue when running fit It looked like the model was failing on training in parallel causing a system exit The line of code on my end where this fails where clf is initialized as an Explainable Boosting Classifier from interpretglassbox with traingithubvecs as X and trainresults as Y is clffittraingithubvecstrainresults while the error message is as below File srvboredboypy line in trainmodel clffittraingithubvecstrainresults File envlibpython sitepackagesinterpretglassboxebmebmpy line in fit estimators providerparalleltrainmodel

ctbyrefmetricoutput ctypesArgumentError argument class SystemExit Any idea as to whats going on here First thanks to everyone who is building interpret It looks live a valuable package for pulling together model interpretation methods into a single package The only documentation I see is the READMEmd and from that its hard for me to tell what methods interpret has that might help with deep learning models Presumably the blackbox portion of the package is most applicable but its hard to tell from the README what all the methods for blackbox are In particular does interpret or any of its dependencies include any utilities for performing the Integrated Gradients approach to explaining neural networks paper repo ERROR intlgntsysmlscdoisraelstartnotebook has requirement urllib but youll have urllib which is incompatible Im trying to train an EBMClassifier on a large dataset M samples features with no interactions and am finding that the function crashes during fitting I have tried training on smaller subsets and it seems like around k is where things break even a forward call on k samples breaks things Im running on a very large machine in the cloud CPUs GB so running out of memory shouldnt be an issue Are there any potential workarounds here or have I just hit the limits of the current implementation Hi I am using ebm for regression and it is amazing I am wondering if the model can add constraints as the prediction should be positive Thanks is it possible to provide a vignette for R for the jupyter notebooks written in python When running from interpret import show from interpretperf import ROC blackboxperf ROCblackboxmodelpredictprobaexplainperfXtest ytest nameBlackbox showblackboxperf I have the following error RuntimeError Could not find open port Consider calling interpretsetshowaddr first Even calling the setshowaddr I cant see the results How can I handle with that when I train a ebm model and use explainglobal method to show but there just a summary graphwhatever I choose the component nothing to change I don not know where has problem I have a question how to change the colormaps limits when showing the heatmap of interactions Thanks Im getting
