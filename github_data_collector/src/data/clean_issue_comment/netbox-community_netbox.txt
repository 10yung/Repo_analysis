typos etc Proposed Changes We should extend the installation instructions to propose the option of installing NetBox in a virtual environment Although the process is not unique to NetBox some users may not be aware of the option Environment Python version NetBox version Proposed Functionality Similar to regions tenant groups should be nestable in order to represent organizations with more than two levels For example IT Infrastructure Network Support Use Case This allows companies of any appreciable size to share one NetBox instance while tracking organizational and team level ownership

now matches the form validation In order to achieve this I made it so the dataadditionalqueryparam is now a JSONencoded list Allow multiple values by calling addaddtionalqueryparam multiple times over the same key before it would overwrite whatever was there It works well with jQuery data as it attempts to cast the value to JSON by default When testing this do a reloadfromsource else you may get a cached version of formsjs This is a follow up to Thank you for your interest in contributing to NetBox Please note that our contribution policy requires that a feature request or bug report be opened
