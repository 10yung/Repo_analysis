As reported by cTheDragons with minor edits On the website in the new messaging area when I send a message to a player my avatar shows not as I am now but as I was before in my last message If I leave and go back the avatar is then correct as I sent the message Steps to Reproduce Send a message to someone Exit the message screen change your Avatars costume Send another message to the same person in the first step The avatar of you will be displayed the same as the last image not the image currently The expected behaviour is that as soon as you send the message the avatar you see next to the message is your current avatar Note See for more info Put Issue here if applicable This will automatically close the issue if your PR is merged in Partial fix for Changes Describe the changes that were made in detail here Include pictures if necessary Allows appvue to receive a new event habiticadismissmodal When emitted this event deletes the passed modal ID from the modal stack ensuring that the modal stack handler wont attempt to reshow it after a later modal is closed Note that the BootstrapVue hide modal event still needs to be emitted or a router push initiated to change the view to actually close the modal I found two places where I could reproduce the original issue and where emitting the new event resolved it Creatingupdatingawardingdeleting Challenges Sending a gift to another user I wasnt able to reproduce the specific scenario described in the issue ticket with pet hatching user profiles so Im not counting this as a complete fix Also corrects one place in the Challenge flow where we unnecessarily used a hardcoded English string instead of a localized string Put User ID in here found on the Habitica website at User Icon Settings API Not so much a bug as it is a formatting issue but I just noticed when I reached level woo and put my th stat point into intelligence that the pts text after the number gets pushed out of the box and moved underneath it I assume this is because the number has become three digits and the entire pts text doesnt fit in the box Reported by JohnJSal in Report a Bug If you visit a guild and click on its Member List badge you see a list of the guilds members If you then immediately visit a different guild and click on its badge you see the SAME list ie the list for the first guild You have to reload the website to see the second guilds member list The desired behaviour is that a reload should not be necessary When you click on the Member List badge for a guildparty or the Participants list for a challenge all players names are grey regardless of their contributor tier The desired behaviour is that each players name should be formatted with the same colour and icon that appears on posts made by the player Bumps

security updates if desired details Note See for more info Fixes Changes We noticed that when we loaded a page the top nav item of that page had the class down added to it This caused the function for the mouse enter and mouse leave events to close a navigation dropdown menu that needed to be open and open a dropdown menu that needed to be closed We replaced this with two functions one to open dropdown menus and one to close them We also removed the code that added the down class to an item on loading the page This fixed the issue causing the navigation to stick After fixing this issue we noticed that the dropdown menus had transparent backgrounds on their initial hover We updated the background color of the dropdown menu to be the correct color Put User ID in here found on the
