Describe the bug Reproduction Live Reproduction codesandboxio Steps to reproduce the behavior Turn on Devtool and open mode screen smaller Drag item Item copy still keeps its initial size Expected behavior A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen Screenshots img width altScreen Shot at src Hello Im having performance issues when starting to drag a source with multiple drop targets that use monitorgetDifferenceFromInitialOffset Reducing the number of drop targets or not using monitorgetDifferenceFromInitialOffset on them will increase the performance a lot Using reactvirtualized will too But non of these solutions is ideal in my case I was wondering if I may be doing something wrong or if it seems normal to you that such a case has performance issues Btw please note that Im in version and not planning to upgrade yet I cant use hooks yet Thanks Describe the bug DragSourceHookSpecend is declared as dropResult DropResult undefined monitor DragSourceMonitor void whereas its source documentation presumes that dropResult is obtained via DragSourceMonitorgetDropResult Documentation page declares signature as enditem monitor Actual behaviour is as specified in docs and not in source code There is also one place that looks like invocation of similar function but not sure if this is relevant Reproduction Open links line line See Expected behavior DragSourceHookSpecend function must have first argument item and not dragSource Does it really need to have two arguments if both are obtainable via monitor Screenshots Not applicable Desktop please complete the following information OS Any Browser Any Version current master Additional context None Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe The project I am working on uses an older version of reactdnd and at the moment it is impossible to upgrade There is no versioning of the documentation which makes working with older version harder Describe the solution youd like Would be nice is documentation was either a part of the repository or had the versioning on the website I have included these two packages in packagejson of my application reactdnd reactdndhtml backend Once I add to my component I get below build error Module not found error Cant resolve reactdndinvariant in D code test nodemodules reactdnd dist esm common Es version Let me know if we need further information to look into the issue Im doing a project about filemanager so just like the pic the file card can drag use dnd DragSource and the parent need add feature about selection draw a box to select files so I added the mousedown and mousemove and mouseup in parent dom issue because of the parent DOM add mousedown event the child DOMfile card begin cant drag will also draw selection box sorry I add stopPropagation on mousedown due to can not drag and i add the etarget in mousedown for file card resolve also draw selection box issue On the docs here at the HigherOrder Components and Decorators section this code doesnt work import DragSource DropTarget from reactdnd import flow from lodashflow class YourComponent render const connectDragSource connectDropTarget thisprops return connectDragSource connectDropTarget export default flowDragSource DropTarget YourComponent The problem being the return connectDragSource connectDropTarget What did work was nesting the two functions something like this worked return connectDropTarget connectDragSource Where represents the jsx code for display Using the set up in the docs renders nothing on the page but also throws no errors In this section of the docs it refers to the param passed in as monitor when I think its actually the item Could you confirm Hi I got an issue with reactdnd library when I did a drag drop from a dialog When I drag the item without scrolling to the end of the dialog every thing works fine But when I scroll to the end of dialog the item cant be dragged Also another thing strange that the problem doesnt exist in Firefox browser only in chrome Note I did put a consolelog in beginDrag and endDrag I found that endDrag is called directly after begin ScreenShot Description For my project I have to create a nested sortable list When the item that is being dragged it cannot move left or right only top and bottom Additionally it can only move top and bottom within its parent container I have created a code sandbox for you sorry this is a work project and cant share any code with you therefore I have created sandbox I want to try and make this as a reusable component so it should be able to handle the dragging constraints as well as single nested triple nested scenarios The link I have provided works but I feel its very laggy and not as smooth as the other reactdnd examples I have seen Am I doing something wrong Can I improve In order to deal with nested items I have created two item types is this the correct move PS Im sorry this isnt a bug or enhancement I just wanted to reach out to the reactdnd team for guidance Thank you very much in advance for any help Happy holidays
