Is there a changelog somewhere to show whats new in Requesting support for SELECT INTO Statement Thanks Currently if I want to check only for the existence of some records I have to fetch the records and test the count while we can do the check directly on the db and save some network traffic Suggestion var isFound dbQueryTableWhereSome Conditions hereExists var isNotFound dbQueryTableWhereSome Conditions hereDoesntExist Similar to Its pretty easy to just add this method via extention but I was curious why this method signature isnt in the query builder public static void OrderBythis Query source bool ascending params string columns if ascending sourceOrderBycolumns else sourceOrderByDesccolumns Reasoning is that SqlKata is used for programmatically building queries having this method compacts lines into one or a single messy line into a cleaner one if you dare to use the discard var for a ternary since query is a mutable ascending sourceOrderBycolumns sourceOrderByDesccolumns Hello everyone I am trying to insert multiple records from a local database to an online database the local database is firebird and the other one is mysql I tried this var baseQuery connectQuery var data baseQueryCloneFromCAIXA connectOnlineQueryCAIXAInsertdata connectOnline online database connection connect local database the tables are the same the only difference is that the online database table has one more column called idon Can someone help me I would need to do this with update too I am using the following line of code to insert a record into DB employeesInformation parameter is of type Dictionarystring object and has parameters await sqlKataDBQueryTBLEMPLOYEESINFORMATIONInsertGetIdAsyncintemployeesInformation I am getting Parameter count mismatch error As far as I have seen online this error occurs when you Invoke a delegate function with wrong parameters I am not sure here I tried making the fuction sync instead of async but that didnt help I saw an open StackOverFlow ticket with the same error but with no answer the OP was intructed to get RawSql and Bindigns I can get you that if that helps But I dont know how instructions would be great Any suggestions SqlKata Version NET Framework Observed Behavior After compiling a query that contains multiple clauses and nested query the final clause which is a group by is silently removed from the clauses collection Expected behavior The group by clause is added to the resulting SQL and not removed from the clauses collection Additionally if the compiler cannot add it an informative exception is thrown clause before after Suggestion for enhancement for AsDelete and AsUpdate It would be nice to support TopLimit to explicitly set how many records to update or delete if multiple matches are found based on Where I also like to use TopLimit to make sure only record is affected if others were added immediately before I ran the query just to be safe Sql Server supports DELETE TOP MySQL supports DELETE LIMIT
