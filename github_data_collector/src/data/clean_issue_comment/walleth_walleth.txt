 Hi I hope you are doing well You might be interested that Gradle introduces incore dependency verification The documentation can be reviewed here From what I know Gradle would cover more cases when compared with checksumdependencyplugin For instance it will be able to verify pomxml which are implicitly fetched by Gradle when resolving transitive dependencies and probably other cases Some bits can be previewed in the current release candidates release nightly builds and master nightly builds see It would be nice if you could preview the feature and provide your feedback If currency X is used in your account but you press the receive button add value select currency Y and then go back to your account Y will be used from there on until the next change on any interface Id say keeping the selected account currency regardless of what you do elsewhere in the app would be desirable ligi Hi Im working with Ramp Network on mobile SDK which allows users to convert their fiat into ETH or DAI safely by simple bank transfers The SDK is in alpha and it would be super cool if we could release it within Walleth Let me know what do do you think about it and if we can go ahead Well be doing the integration locally and testing it but we will also create a PR with the integration for other people to test it Thanks PS The SDK code is at currently a usual onboarding flow is like this create accountthe see account has ETH in it until balance is fetched then see balance is ETH even worse if we are offline then the balance stays at ETH but when creating a new account we know the balance will be ETH at first so we can just set this link could be displayed all the time QR after click on details iconbutton but lets wait until this EIP gets finalized once this upstream issue is solved UI tests should just be executed in the offline flavor when executing them in online flavor we should print a nice error message
