request for automatically positioning the attachment based on available space The option could be attachment auto or attachment auto auto for fully automatic positioning Or for finer control attachment auto left to position the attachment on the left but depending on available space shift between top middle and bottom We can then use this util in Shepherd as well for tetherOptions There

TrevorBurnham do you think it would be possible to get tetherio transferred to us as well As we iterate we will want to update docs Hi I found a weird issue while using tether in combination with content in iFrames If you have clickable content in iFrames and are using an iPhone the click event dont trigger because the binding of the touchmove event if typeof window undefined typeof windowaddEventListener undefined resize scroll touchmove forEachfunction event windowaddEventListenerevent tick You need to hold at least ms on the button to execute the event because of this if typeof lastDuration undefined lastDuration We voluntarily throttle ourselves if we cant manage fps lastDuration MathminlastDuration Just in case this is the last event remember to position just once more pendingTimeout setTimeouttick this is the problem return Could someone please look into this Best regards
