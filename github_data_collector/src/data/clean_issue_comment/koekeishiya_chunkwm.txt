If I call chunkc set ffmbypassmodifier cmd in my chunkwmrc then call chunkc set ffmbypassmodifier ctrl from terminal because I need to cmddrag something for example the modifier does not change Added the ability to run rules on windows that are under a certain height and width constraint For easier debugging this merge also prints a windowss height and width when running the query chuckc tilingquery desktop windows I dont expect this to be merged as I hear there are plans for a fullfledged query language to help filter rules Nonetheless if someone else wants to use these changes temporarily until this feature is implemented its pretty easy to swap out the tilingso file into your brew installation Totally missed the addition of this desktop flag Has anyone found a solution to Photoshop setting focus to another monitor when clicking on the canvas I have to turn off chunkwm every time I work in it This is Photoshop CC I have a feeling this is due to a hodgepodge UI of theirs even the OSX buttons dont show up in the frame so they must be doing something custom there Dragging a file from Finder onto Discord doesnt focus Discordapp as it does when chunkwm is not running I guess this is part bug report and part feature request For some reason certain applications handle their alpha values differently than the rest Eg Firefox is more opaque than other applications I dont know whether this is a bug or not but in any case perhaps a useful addition would be a rule to set the value for windowfadeinactive With that it would be easy to correct the alpha value for apps that for some reason render it differently And thank you for making chunkwm its such a solid wm If I make Safari full screen everything is fine Until I make a new window N or N and then i cant access the Safari url bar for some reason Problem tilingwindow focus can focus windows from different desktops while tilingwindow warp cant move them between desktops Is there some config option that I miss or this behaviour is simply not supported This is the only thing I miss from i wm Fixes Also changed the case of Makefiles because thats how it should be for other software to find them So floating windows arent staying on top which is can become rather tedious when I bump my mouse and my floating window loses focus I disabled SIP and ran sudo chunkwm installsa but Im not sure if it installed or is working correctly I have chunkwm loadsa at the bottom of my chunkwmrc file But I noticed when I enter the command manually I get the following warning which then says successfully loaded chunkwm warning failed to get scripting definition from SystemLibraryCoreServicesDockapp it may not be scriptable chunkwm successfully loaded sa Another reason that leads me to believe chunk sa may not be working properly is that the following commands dont do anything at all chunkc tilingdesktop focus chunkc tilingdesktop create chunkc tilingdesktop annihilate neofetch OS macOS Mojave D x Host MacBookPro Kernel Uptime mins Packages brew Shell zsh Resolution x x DE Aqua WM chunkwm Terminal kitty Terminal Font Meslo LG M Regular for Powerline CPU Intel i HQ GHz GPU AMD Radeon R M X Intel Iris Pro Memory MiB MiB
