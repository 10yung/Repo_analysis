 online version Playing on chrome DCSS version I have managed to repeat it a few times on Rupert I would be travelling through the dungeon and when I encountered Rupert I would use a Phantom Mirror and then I would try to use Force Lance to keep the two of them fighting each other The problem occurred when the original Rupert was hit by the Force Lance spell and crashed into the copy of Rupert The game would then crash and I would be booted from the game It then reset the game back to when I last entered that level I was able to reproduce the issue a few times I stopped trying once I confirmed jic it would ruin my save I initially implemented this for code coverage support which is included But using GA for all CI tasks has several advantages over Travis Simpler configuration language Easier composability of steps from third parties The steps can be published as Docker images or Node modules and are fully versioned Better integration with GitHub one status check per build job rather than one for the whole CI system Requires CODECOVTOKEN set up as a GitHub repo secret from codecovio AppImages are an approach to multidistro distribution that puts the control in the hands of the developer as opposed to demicentralized approaches like flatpak and snapd Since Crawl uses Travis CI the cost of creating an AppImage is relatively low there is a semiofficial method to generate them inside of Travis This would allow users to have a more authentic experience bypassing distribution maintainers and remain up to date assuming publication is automated and update data is embedded as per specification This would also simplify the downloads page for linux For an example of a highquality AppImage producer please take a look at KeepassXC though they do not utilize Travis to generate theirs The UX of using their official AppImage is great however This is my first stab at vaults so criticism is welcome I started with arrival vaults as the docs said that was the thing to do I built the game from source and tested out all my vaults multiple times in Wizard mode I considered both arriving and player tactics I also fixed a comment error in smalldes Reimplement features from webtileschanges that CPO makes use of Ultimate goal is to move CPO off webtileschanges x Add env var to Crawl execs x Load games list from confd directory x Reload games list dynamically x OPTIONAL Firstclass dir support for Crawl execs Integrate sling bullet arrow and bolt into bullet Each of these bullets has a different appearance but the given role is the same and there is no tactical difference between the three The difference between them is not in themselves but in weapons that use them The regeneration spell returns with changes Doubled regen bonus HP rot on cast This additionally prevents use by Gargoyles statue form and demonspawn with rot immunity No special interaction with Trogs Hand Because this variant of the spell is far more situational the book changes were partially kept Ozocubus Armour stays in the book of battle but Regeneration remains in the Book of Necromancy This partially reverts e dd d b f e cc b d f ae None This attempts to make formattedstring a closer fit to the textual colour string format nested colours are now encoded and parsing a colour string and then converting to a string again should in many cases now be a noop parsestringtomultiple is also changed so that the colour nesting is preserved across newlines ie the colour stack is unwound and then rewound at each newline Not sure if anyone else has a preferred unit test style eg BDD Catch does support that but I stuck with the existing style from testenglishcc Fixes Fixes macOS provides BSD sed which lacks r Allow the user to override the sed binary name so they can specify eg make sedgsed macOS also provides BSD find which lacks o as an alias for or Use or instead as its also supported by GNU find
