Although both title and description does it the same way but title is extracted with SiimplePie having the encoded symbols double encoded unlike the way it is for description you can test this in the demo and you will see that the title is displayed with these symbols encoded while in the description they are displayed decoded Which is because title was double encoded by the package I investigated the issue deeper and found out that simplepieitemgettitle returns the title double encoded while the simplepieitemgetdescription gets the description decoded and displaying all symbols naturally I find it weird that you are treating title and description differently while both are coming from the source feed with same symbols encoded in the same way Description When using Redis Cache there is

doesnt exist in the release tarballs so I thought it didnt exist at all until I found it in git master So I would think either the compiled form should also be available as a download on the website
