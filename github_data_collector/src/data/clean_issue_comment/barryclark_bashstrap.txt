I think this is a fun project and since the author seems to have moved on to other things Ive gone ahead and forked this repo with the intention of taking up active development if anyone would like to submit issues or PRs Currently working on resolving issues and PRs from this repo Will update once completed The prompt was working as intended since long But lately its showing the indication for clean repositories too Behaviour is recurring even on a fresh OS install Details OS Mac OS Sierra Was also happening on El Capitan recently Git status message changed from nothing to commit working directory clean to nothing to commit working tree clean Hey there I find myself using the following git aliases quite often so I figured Id contribute back to the project The changes do include some changes to the existing git aliases namely git add no longer automatically adds all of the changes and git commit no longer automatically requires a commit message useful for using the default commit message when resolving merge conflicts etc Ive added some support for mercurial I wasnt able to see the current mercurial branch in my terminal in contrast to git So Ive added some rules to support mercurial as well
