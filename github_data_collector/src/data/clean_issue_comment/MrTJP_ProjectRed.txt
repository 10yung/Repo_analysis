Using project red version and ic classic version using the interface pipes and chips works as well as using the filtered importer just the item importer doesnt do out put items Observe the higher resolution and shading does not match the visual style of vanilla and other mods blocks I am not an artist but I can throw together a quick x texture crop CCL Version FMP Version MrTJPCore Version

items and the other does not While opening the backpack that contains the items press the corresponding number key of the other backpack and then take out the items in the GUI there is a chance that they will leave a copy in the original backpack Im a server administrator and I find that some players are using this method to copy items Ive tested it It works Versions Minecraft Version Minecraft

stacks of of one type of item and display the item stored on its sides After placing a stack of something in the barrel with right click it does not display anything on its side and does not accept more than one stack The item stack can still be removed with left click As reported in my modpack here and also apparently reported in FTB Revelations here Versions Include versions of the dependencies And since youre looking at it make sure ProjectRed is up to date Dont submit bugs for old versions as they could have been fixed CCL Version FMP Version MrTJPCore Version ProjectRed Version Since making redstone signal strength based contraptions on its own is complex and bulky ProjectRed makes this harder to manage with the fact that the strength is way more stronger then conventional redstone I recommend adding logic gates to ProjectRed and maybe even in the IC chip workbench Strength Controller Gate This gate would act like a OR gate with the ability to control incoming signal strengths Example a input with a strength of going into the gate can be reduced to but can only reduce the signals strength to and amplify it to with addition to changing its inputs with a screwdriver like all other project red logic gates This could be useful for analog based redstone items in other mods or with vanilla redstone machines Example this would work well with Analog controller signal box in railcraft where it communicates with other railcraft items based on a redstone inputs strength Strength Detector This gate would have the ability to take redstone inputs and give an output based on a set limit Example if it you were to put in a signal strength of for the input but the minimum was or the max is it wont give any output but say if it gives a strength was and the minimum was and the max was it would give a output take note that it would have restrictions such as making conflicting signal strengths like a limit of and a max of and obviously will only work with the maximumminimum strength possible so no minimums of and maximums of this would be very crucial for redstone machines using storage or other item based things things like auto shutdowns for mobfarms can be possible with this gate where the mobfarm can shut off if a strength detector is activated Describe the bug Upon placing a ProjectRed gem Ruby Sapphire Peridot into DankNull they are replaced with Circuit Plates from project Red To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Acquire Gems Open Dank Null Insert Gems Dont profit the expensive gems are converted to Circuit Plates Expected behavior Gems do not transmute upon storage Crash Log NA no crash Versions Include versions of the dependencies And since youre looking at it make sure ProjectRed is up to date Dont submit

transports interfaces and more however after relogging on a public server part of my piping is now invisible and I cannot get it back I cant place a block in the area that the invisible pipes are in and I cannot move there either Furthermore I cannot access the GUI of the pipes meaning I cant replace them or try to set them back up again I was told to try ghost Not sure what that does but it sadly did nothing We are using FTB Revelations running through Hamachi with some mods added We are using the latest version of ProjectRed Its an oddly specific bug and seems to only work with only one of three players using the server After a lot of testing with multiple mods and fixes we determined that the cause was the rapid switching of lamps from on and off I had a light cycling effect in my base and he only DCd upon coming close to it Testing with single blocks and spamming a lever also caused him to DC Considering we share the base its kind of annoying that I cant use the coloured lamps in it Only the block lamps cause the issues Cage lamps and other variants are fine after testing So are lamps that remain placed though placing them in larger amounts would disconnect him just as switching their state The error he was getting is Internal Exception javaioIOException An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine Subj Sometimes your big ship is stuck
