Thank you for this project I absolutely love the simplicity of hookbased knobs I would like to be able to use this to debug different components simultaneously I tried first by naively attaching a nonportal Inspector to each component I want to inspect but then found that hooks begin to mix between them Is this usage supported in the roadmap or intended at all createreactapp testproject cd testproject yarn add retoggle then import retoggle somewhere in the app yarn build serve s build it return an error Uncaught TypeError Super expression must either be null or a function not undefined at indexjs at indexjs at Objectanonymous indexjs at t indexjs at Objectanonymous indexjs at t indexjs at Objectanonymous indexjs at t indexjs at Objectanonymous indexjs at t indexjs these are the two lines i added to a new CRA template import React from react import Inspector from retoggle return Inspector usePortaltrue Its quite hard to work with when you need to collapse and uncollapse this thing all the time if you have some UI on the right side that you want to interact with Also make its zindex or something like that so it overlaps all possible UI in any scenario Tests Does anybody know if there are testings under development in this repo Love the project so Im sad to find out this does not work for me because it fails for me when building with gatsby build WebpackError ReferenceError window is not defined but you can easily test it yourself with js failretogglejs requireretoggle ssh node failretogglejs And get ReferenceError window is not defined I tried searching for references to window in this project but could not find any which confuses me Anyone else bumping into this problem Are there any plans to be able to generate code Would be cool to visually tweak a component and then grab and use that code in some way
