When doing an interactive git rebase the VCS segment does not show the state of the rebase but just the current commit hash When doing larger rebases this not very expressive Example git clone cd powerlinesegmentscommonvcsbranchrebase git rebase i HEAD and set the topmost commit to edit Output with powerline ce aa which is the hash of the commit being edited Without powerline my Bash config defaults to PS e w a n e m u h e m w e m e m gitps e m n which results in masterREBASEi after PWD which is more descriptive I uses Vim in windows and using Chocolatey to install it and powerline didnt work in Vim I added let gPowerlinesymbols fancy in vimrc file Is there any way for example custom segments to call vimscript function I need the information on kitestatusline to be displayed Maybe I should write a similar python plugin like the following replace the vimevalCapsLockStatusline to vimevalkitestatusline Close Adding the following to the config json Im running it with lemonbar but I guess it should not matter function powerlinesegmentsi wmmode args names default default results in the following error ERRORwmmodeFailed to set highlight group uHighlighting groups not found in colorscheme mode Traceback most recent call last File usrlocallibpython distpackagespowerlinesegmentpy line in setsegmenthighlighting segmentgetgradientlevel File usrlocallibpython distpackagespowerlinecolorschemepy line in gethighlighting raise KeyErrorHighlighting groups not found in colorscheme joingroups KeyError uHighlighting groups not found in colorscheme mode As far as I can see the issue is that it is missing from configfilescolorschemesdefaultjson For test purposes I copied the mode line from the vim config so it now displays default but changing modes doesnt have any effect it display default in all modes which suggests that mode information from i never reaches powerline I added the the following line as suggested in the documentation sh usrlocallibpython sitepackagespowerlinebindingszshpowerlinezsh Im getting the following error when I open a new terminal sh Config file not found in search paths UserssboczLibraryPython libpythonsitepackagespowerlineconfigfiles Userssboczconfigpowerline configjson Config file not found in search paths UserssboczLibraryPython libpythonsitepackagespowerlineconfigfiles Userssboczconfigpowerline configjson Im not sure why UserssboczLibraryPython is being used sh which python usrbinpython which powerline usrlocalbinpowerline echo PATH UserssboczbinUserssbocztoolboxbinusrlocalbinusrbinbinusrsbinsbin Ive tried uninstalling powerlinestatus and python but got nowhere I have been trying to get powerline working in qtiles builtin bar All the powerline documentation says about it is Add the following to fileconfigqtileconfigpy Python from libqtilebar import Bar from libqtileconfig import Screen from libqtilewidget import Spacer from powerlinebindingsqtilewidget import PowerlineTextBox screens Screen topBar PowerlineTextBoxupdateinterval sideleft Spacer PowerlineTextBoxupdateinterval sideright width Following this I got an error until I also added a text argument So the relevant section of my configpy for qtile is Python PowerlineTextBox updateinterval the documentation says to use this but I dont understand what it does side left whether this is set to right or left doesnt seem to change anything text left barcolours is defined earlier in my config file foreground barcolours background barcolours Now there are no errors but all I see in my panel is the word text on a coloured background I have tried adding various other instances of PowerlineTextBox and Spacer in different places but this makes no difference I havent messed with any powerline configuration files at all and Im using the standard qtile and powerline packages from the Arch repos Issue seems to offer an alternative method but I cant work out what to do with the code snippets I guess this is a feature request I jump about with my laptop quite a lot so its important for me to see what wifi Im connected to but I havent found a segment that can do that I actually looked into segmentscommonnetpy to see if I can add it myself but its a bit over my head without any help From tmux man page status off on Show or hide the status line or specify its size Using on gives a status line one row in height or more rows I dont think powerline currently supports that A relatively recent major update in i ipc v breaks some of our segments and listers here I discovered it today while updating all my python packages for python In essence the python class wrappers around i ipc JSON responses that our code deals with have changed so that reply attr is no longer valid and replyattr or getattrreply attr must be used This is relevant in powerlinelistersi wmpy and powerlinesegmentsi wmpy
