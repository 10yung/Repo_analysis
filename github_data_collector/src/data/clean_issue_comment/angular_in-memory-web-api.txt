added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended

array back to collection it adds an array to the collection instead Our API back ends work with batch update flow instead off updating individual items so i need to be able to post an array of items Does anybody have any suggestions Thanks Please provide a simple example of constructing a valid response in a method interceptor The ticket refers to something that apparently has been moved and the example in the README is very general succinct and I find it not helpful at all Im constanly getting on requests like GET myfruits THis is my class export class FakeMemoryDbImplService SERVERURL string constructorprivate httpClient HttpClient public getLocations ObservableLocation return thishttpClientgetLocation thisSERVERURL locations and when i am trying to call it using export class LocationComponent onLocationsDisplay thisdbservicegetLocationssubscribedata Location consolelogdata it creates me a new object What could be the issue I used to be able to write the imports like this imports CommonModule HttpClientModule HttpClientInMemoryWebApiModuleforRootMockDataApi dataEncapsulation false Now since version it has to be written like this which when done you can no longer use the passThru option because now the standard WebApi wont exist while mockingtrue imports CommonModule envuseMockData HttpClientInMemoryWebApiModuleforRootMockDataApi dataEncapsulation false HttpClientModule If I try to do the first way above I get this error every time Cannot instantiate cyclic dependency HttpClient ERROR in NgModule AppModule in AppModule
