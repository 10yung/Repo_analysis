target Windows via UWP React Native for Windows is under active development by Microsoft Most recently the platform has been updated to leverage highperformance C known as RNW vNext Now that the RNW vNext supports native modules as a platform we have identified several key native modules to add Windows support for including lottiereactnative to help validate that the platform has the right set of capabilities and to bootstrap the community of modules that target Windows Microsoft devs are signed up to help build out this implementation but we wanted to track this work here as well to help provide some transparency that were doing this work and hoping to contribute back to the repo Steps to Reproduce NA Expected behavior ReactNativeLottie works great on Windows Actual behavior No support yet Versions You can get this information from executing npm version Description When animation is running in Xcode I see CPU jumps from to And it doesnt depend on animation If animation is running every one second I also see the same CPU load Sometimes it jumps to In Android everything is good The CPU load is about sometimes even less Expected behavior CPU load optimization in iOS Actual behavior The CPU load optimization in iOS is very poor The CPU load in Android is OK Versions iOS version reactnative lottieios lottiereactnative Description It looks like a conflict between two native modules I want to exec a long time task and give a animation to user at the same time The task is simple just encrypting but i use a native module Steps to Reproduce I start a lottie

lottieios lottiereactnative reactnative How do you mock the lottie library in jest THanks Description I have created a run cycle animation in After Effects using the Duik extension to rig the character created in Adobe Illustrator I have then exported this animation using Bodymovin with Guides and Hidden layers selected in the settings The result of this is a JSON animation which DOES work in Lottiefiles web preview However the animation does not work on either the Previewer in the Lottie app Android or when loaded into a LottieView Object in ReactNative Also Android Im confused because Ive read elsewhere that Duik animations work with Lottie If it is the case that they dont work with lottiereactnative then this should be outlined in the documentation clearly My Lottie preview app gives a bunch of warnings about not supporting layer effects and so on but I wish this was warned about before Steps to Reproduce Create animation in AE using Duik Render to JSON object with bodymovin and confirm that it works in Lottie preview on web Load Json object into LottieView object in ReactNative or Lottie mobile previewer Expected behavior The animation to perform similarly to how it did in the web previewer Actual behavior The rigged animated layers were static and broken Versions lottiereactnative npm reactnative Description When I use specific Lottie Animations I received from our
