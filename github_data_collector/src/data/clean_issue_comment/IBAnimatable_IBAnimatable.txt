Ive created a new project and just add IBAnimatable from swift package nothing more nothing less and i have compilation errors img width altImage src It is targeted for iOS but same for iOS Any ideas Thanks For example I have a button say width of height of The parameters change by type of device So for wR hR its say by Now I can use corner radius and compute it based on the height and set it in viewDidLayoutSubviews but I was wondering if theres already a way to do this and Im missing it Just asking the question that many of us may have any tipshintsprojections of whether this library can be usable in SwiftUI in any way For example SwiftUI leverages UIViewRepresentable custom ViewModifiers and other constructs that might provide a path to integration Just curious to know Segues set using storyboards such as PresentSlideSegue seem to failed to present I see that iOS add new navigation stack and automatic modal presentation style Before fullscreen was the default one If I debug I am wondering If IBAnimatable must force to fullscreen the modal presentation style like I do in my PR when the segue is used to make it work or document and say you must select Presentation Full Screen or current context if previous was also full screen etc Screenshot at xcode screenshot must not be available in xcode Hello guys I want to ask a question here So I have ViewController A and I am presenting a halfsize of an AnimatableModalViewController on top of the ViewController A By default it will block the userInteraction of the viewController A Is there any way to show the AnimatableModalViewController with userInteraction enabled for ViewController A In my case ViewController A is a scrollView So I still want to let the user able to scroll through the ViewController A while the AnimatableModalViewController is being presented Thank you and many thanks for this great library Is it possible to remove the NaN default values from the classes Each time I import the library I have to reset them to valid values so that when initializing it it does not crash May be i made something wrong but inserting thenline changes nothing I need to hide the view after moving smoothly When I update the constraints on a view programmatically the shadowLayer of the old frame is still there Every time the view is updated to a different frame a new CALayer is added Steps to reproduce Create a view with autolayout constraints Set a shadow via IB Update a constraint ie height of the view to make it smaller You will have the shadow correctly applied but the layer from the old frame visible as well I did some debugging the layer is not removed when this is done Remove any previous shadow layer viewlayersuperlayersublayersfilter name shadowLayer UnmanagedpassUnretainedself forEach removeFromSuperlayer The reason being that the actual name of the layer in my case was shadowLayerUnmanagedAnimatableViewvalue IBAnimatableAnimatableView x fb c a frame autoresize RMBM layer CALayer x cae but the updated one had the following name shadowLayerUnmanagedAnimatableViewvalue IBAnimatableAnimatableView x fb c a frame autoresize RMBM layer CALayer x cae The name contains the frame so if you update the frame it will not find the layer and thus not remove it Any suggestion on how this could be fixed Just want to discuss about a potential feature Unfortunately I think we cannot do Trait Variation for User Defined Runtime Attributes So when we define something it is for all ipads and iphones I make a little PoC using NSDataAsset that can be variated A data asset named mask img width altscreenshot at src Inside I put just some text file with the wanted value of a maskType iphone file contains circle ipad file contains ellipse Then in MaskType I add a code to parse NSDataAsset swift public extension MaskType initstring String case dataAsset if let name params safe let dataAsset NSDataAssetname name let value Stringdata dataAssetdata encoding utf selfinitstring value else self none And finally I use it on my view in storyboard like this dataAssetmask on iphone a circle img width altscreenshot at src on ipad an ellipse img width altscreenshot at src Setting a leftView of an AnimatableTextField or trying to specify insets otherwise is broken and does not produce the desired leadingtrailing padding
