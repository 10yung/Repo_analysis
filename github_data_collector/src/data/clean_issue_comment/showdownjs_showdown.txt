It will be nice to add a Copy button next to the generated code block such that clicking the button will let user copy the raw code inside the block Id imaging something as shown below Im looking for

defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion

Fixed outputModifierssplicej links without protocols like googlecom are not treated as link while wwwgooglecom is treated as link is there any option to allow all this I know this issue has sort of been raised in issue and more explicitly in but is there anything in the pipeline for separating emojis into a completely different file As ShowdownJS can be imported using require or even ES import it would be great to have emojis as a completely separate module that can independently be imported such like js import showdown from showdown No emojis or js import showdown emojis from showdown Has emojis That would give much more control over those who dont needwantrequire emoji support and can give much more ability to keep ShowdownJS as customisably streamlined as possible for the speedconscious folk In the longrun it would be great to also be able to break down the eg flavours and other options into modules too to really allow people to further streamline their bundles something like js import showdown tables specialChars emojis from showdown new showdownConverter tables true specialChars true emojis true or js import showdown github from showdown And github automatically imports tables specialChars etc Also have github and githubNoEmoji new showdownConverter tables true specialChars true emojis true Would be a really sweet addition to the library The
