I saw the recent update and all I got to say is please keep this beautiful engine alive and actively developed needthis please Hi First of all thanks for developing superpowers We tried following this intallation tutorial Everything seems to work fine we get the interface allowing us to start creating our game While clicking build however we get the following bug runtimejs Uncaught SyntaxError Invalid or unexpected token SupEnginejs THREEWebGLRenderer runtimejs Uncaught TypeError Cannot read property Scene of undefined at ObjectcreateOuterAsset runtimejs at PlayergetOuterAsset SupRuntimejs at ObjectlateStart runtimejs at asynceach SupRuntimejs at SupRuntimejs at ObjectasyncforEachOfasynceachOf SupRuntimejs at ObjectasyncforEachasynceach SupRuntimejs at PlayerlateStartPlugins SupRuntimejs at asyncseries SupRuntimejs at SupRuntimejs What are we doing wrong there Salut Bravo pour ce bijou je d couvre aujourdhui apr s moultes recherches dun editeur RPG en htmlJS Ca tourne super bien Dommage que a nai pas plus de visibilit La suite en anglais pour toucher tout le monde OK I tested running a game AND also the editor using glitchcom free NodeJS hosting with limitations and it works fine Only need to change add acron as npm package and remove it from nodemodulesbin using the console change ports in configjson to and and you have your own hosted server for your great game It solves multiple access issue I replied to someone on reddit before using glitch Online editor works but for any reason you cant access it using the standalone editor superpowersexe Best would be to rewrite passwords to env file and change serverjs accordingly Its just a little tight on the server since the engineeditor is of the allowed disk MB I didnt go into optimization May be nodemodules could be removed completely since glitch used local packages for all projects using pnpm based on packagejson Hope it gives you new momentum un nouvel lan Ive tried loading in d models and sprites but when clicking the upload button nothing happens Dragging the resource into the window brings it up in text form and then backing out closes the project file I also loaded up the included d platformer to find the same issues loading the preexisting assets just causes it to hang on loading I tried launching it from the terminal but there isnt any useful output Launching the bit version seems to cause no errors and everything runs smoothly Hi Im unable to create a new project after downloading the Super Powers program I have the previous version not the latest one that was released days ago I installed all of the systems and plugins but I am stuck at the new project step My error message says This server doesnt have any systems installed yet Please install one from the Server Settings tab first Anyone else getting this too The data path may point to the read only directory like appSuperpowerscore inside the flatpak sandbox So we added the path to the writable data directory which can be set with the rwdatapath option when running the server This is where sessions superpowers systems config plugins JSON files can be written Im not sure if the patch is complete but before continuing it would this effort be welcome By the way the flatpak for superpowers I was working on is here You can read about flatpak here We use it at endless to provide applications I also have PRs for the game and app will xref them there when filing Hi These file is Korean script file for Superpowerscore I hope it will be help to korean developers However there are minor problem A button has narrow size in server setting Please check an attachment files Thanks This PR is code for a proposed HotKeyManager to enable dynamic editing of hotkey definitions as I described in This is part of a part request The nd PR will appear shortly on superpowersgame repo Probably a simple fix but I get the error Only a single primitive is supported I made sure to only export the body of this helicopter from Blender and then convert to the gltf format I checked by reimporting my dae file to blender and there is in fact only a single prim Not sure what I am doing wrong here To be clear I found this asset on TurboSquid just to test with using Superpowers and from what I can see in blender it looks fine to me
