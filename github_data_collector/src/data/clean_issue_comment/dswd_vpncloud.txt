Hi Im connecting six servers over the internet some with public v IP some behind NAT VPN is only used for internal communication not routing traffic All interfaces are TAP in normal mode I started using ATAoverEthernet just for testing It works as expected but after some time the connection gets stalled aoestat tells the the connection is not up but kickoff If I start a ping from server target to client mounted volume the connection goes up immediately after the first ping Could it be that vpncloud is not learning from raw ethernet frames but needs IP to learn Hello everyone can anyone help me troubleshoot why vpncloud service wont start on startup but fails with timeout when trying to start service manually service starts without any problem After manual start on both nodes i can ping servers trough vpncloud IPs Both nodes are running Debian Buster autostart fails on both nodes I did set user and group under which it should run in background root Thanks for any help vpncloudvpslinkservice VpnCloud network vnet Loaded loaded libsystemdsystemvpncloudservice enabled vendor preset enabled Active failed Result timeout since Sun GMT min s ago Process ExecStartusrbinvpncloud config etcvpncloudvnetnet daemon logfile varlogvpncloudvnetlog statsfile varlogvpncloudvnetstats pidfile runvpncloudvnetpid codekilled signalTERM Oct server systemd Starting VpnCloud network vnet Oct server vpncloud INFO Reading config file etcvpncloudvnetnet Oct server vpncloud INFO Opened device vnet Oct server systemd vpncloudvpslinkservice Start operation timed out Terminating Oct server systemd vpncloudvnetservice Control process exited codekilled status TERM Oct server systemd vpncloudvnetservice Failed with result timeout Oct server systemd Failed to start VpnCloud network vnet For easier setting up This might be able to improve the performance even further RUSTFLAGSC targetcpunative Currently VpnCloud offers permessage security which protects each message individually but leaves some attack vectors open Strong security could include Publicprivate keys instead of shared secret This should make the system more robust and allow a more finegrained trust control On the downside creating and exchanging key pairs for networks with dozens of nodes is a pretty tedious task Forward secrecy This would protect the communication from an attacker who records it and spends lots of time or using cipher weaknesses yet to be found breaking the encryption after it happened AFAIK forward secrecy involves ephemeral keys for each node pair eg ECDH On the downside this defeats the current encrypt once send often strategy for broadcasts Protection of stream of messages Currently only single messages are encrypted which leaves us open for attacks on the stream suppressing messages reordering messages duplicatingreplaying messages Any scheme that somehow connects the messages should not require ordered delivery this cant be guaranteed in UDP with high rates or acknowledgments this would significantly affect performance As I am not an expert in this field I am putting my thoughts here for any expert to comment and offer solutions and maybe for developers to volunteer This is a tracking issue on building VpnCloud for other operating systems and other architectures Linux x x Compiles and links x Packaged for DebianUbuntu Linux x i unknownlinuxgnu x Compiles and links Packaged for DebianUbuntu Linux ARMv armv unknownlinuxgnueabihf x Compiles and links x Packaged for DebianUbuntu Linux ARM armunknownlinuxgnueabihf x Compiles and links x Packaged for DebianUbuntu MacOS developer wanted Problem dependency ring does not compile Problem tuntap is different on MacOS Compiles and links Packaged FreeBSD developer wanted Problem polling and signal handling Compiles and links Packaged Windows developer wanted Problem tuntap is different on Windows OpenVPN has a subproject tapwindows that provides TAP interfaces for windows Tutorial Compiles and links Packaged iOS iPad iPhone developer wanted Building an iOS App in Rust Compiles and links Packaged Implementation hints How OpenVPN handles TUN devices on different platforms select on different platforms
