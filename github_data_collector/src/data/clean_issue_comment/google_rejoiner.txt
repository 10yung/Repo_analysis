inconvenient because I cant define valid data to let the front desk staff know what the current error is what kind of error is because the current valid information is only message which is not good judgment I hope in When you execute responseObserveronError you can have some properties in the error message you can customize it and let the background personnel return their own defined errors Im feeling that rejoiner could be split into some modules which would make it more generally useful and easier to adapt to different usecases Im thinking out loud here so please tell me Im wrong before I start on a PR protobuf graphql schema conversion graphql schema modification now depends on protobuf annotations for binding with guice Splitting these into maven modules would allow to add these for example swagger graphql schema conversion binding with spring I think the hardest work would be to make the modification part independent of protobuf without losing efficiency cheers Hello I cant seem to find a way how to access current field parent arguments and getting the actual resolved Proto object For example we have this query query input Inputprotorequestparams search input input item specificProperty value Now field specificProperty is a SchemaModification kind of field and we need the input Inputprotorequestparams variable to be able to resolve it I found a way that by injecting DataFetchingEnvironment in the method we could get the list of parent arguments like dataFetchingEnvironmentexecutionStepInfoparentarguments but with this I get the LinkedHashMap not the converted to Proto class object I could create the Proto object manually but that means the same object is constructed two times Is there a way to get access to the parent argument but the already resolved Proto object one Thank you PS Love the library thank you very much for this awesome product Im sure there are a lot of people myself included excited to use Rejoiner but are rusty with their Java tooling knowledge Would love to see a very easy copypaste howto to get rejoiner up and running with vanilla Java A quick start guide would help immensely I think it would be useful to be able to analyze a GraphQL schema and produce a set of proto files describing services that when implemented could be stitched together by Rejoiner to implement the specified schema Im not sure that all possible GraphQL schemas could be supported by this but even a subset could be useful particularly if the analyzer also generated warnings about what was unsupportable I found that the cache you use is DefaultCacheMap but I want to set the cache in redis I dont know if you have any ideas or suggestions like that In the future would you consider adding redis to the project and adding redis to it I cloned master and follow the instruction here But got this error errors message Exception while fetching data sayHello javalangIllegalArgumentException argument type mismatch locations line column path sayHello data sayHello null Lets get the coverallsio badge to turn green
