Hi when I install proxychains like this I got different output when I input this configure prefixusr sysconfdiretc So I can not install proxychainng Could you please help me to install proxychain Thanks a lot Hello I would like to only enable proxychains for an ip ranges is it possible My requirement is that a program is receiving data and then redirects it to somewhere elese and I want to enable the proxy in the receieving process its a live stream so it needs to be done in a single command ffmpeg i rtmpsourceLiveAddr f flv rtmpdstAddr while the source address is static IP but the destnation address is domain names so thats why I need the whitelist mode Thank you I have VMs runs same OS Ubuntu LTS one of them has this issue ssh client cant work with proxychains such as proxychains ssh gitgithubcom proxychains config file found etcproxychainsconf proxychains preloading usrliblibproxychains so ssh Could not resolve hostname githubcom Temporary failure in name resolution Just like its no proxy at all But when I switch to root It works The other VM doest has this problem So weird Almost same VM same OS same user Is there anyway to debug Hello everybody I tried to find some more issues about this online but failed Sorry if it has been addressed already I found out about proxychains few days ago So far Ive been using the default proxychains deployment from Raspbian Debian for Raspberry Pi Buster which is I started working on some scripts in which I wanted to parse the responses from the proxified and direct connections in the same way so I realized that only proxychains actually has a q switch to help me achieve that easily I am currently running proxychains version Anyway everything else works fine except one important thing Since this is running on Raspberry Pi constantly connected to the internet via VPN I am using proxychains to renew my letsencrypt certificate via public IP assigned to me by my ISP I am running SSH server on another device in my home network through which proxychains tunnels the request outside I use dehydrated for letsencrypt renewal and it worked fine for more than a year via proxychains but when I try to use it via proxychains there is an error message rootraspberrypioptdehydrated proxychains optdehydrateddehydrated c proxychains config file found etcproxychainsconf proxychains preloading

proxychains I am currently trying to run it with FreeTube But the command to run FreeTube from flatpak is the following usrbinflatpak run branchstable archx commandappbinrunsh fileforwarding iofreetubeappFreeTube u u And I tried putting proxychains in there but it never worked lol Hi I have proxy server from luminatiio and issues Connections to port denied but OK Luminatiio allows both

websites and my IP is shown as I am not in US in a different country proxydns not working at all I think because of proxy server has port closed Please check luminatiio compatibility what is wrong
