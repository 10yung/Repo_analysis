to fix it NOTE This project is for Ruby version and older For Ruby versions please file an issue here What problems are you experiencing TLS not supported in the Ruby installer which is compiled with OpenSSL k I was wondering if it would be possible to release a installer which is compiled with a newer version of OpenSSL libraries I have been trying to compile myself with no success as of yet Steps to reproduce Try to open a URL which requires TLS Whats the output from ruby v ruby patchlevel i mingw What problems are you experiencing Unable to download the ruby source when the rake task

the output from ruby v NA I terminated the installer At present RubyInstaller RI versions have stopped at They also have various issues from ssl certs to package availability and maintenance Lars Kanis has put a lot of time into the RubyInstaller RI system thanks again and is building versions Ive been using my own MSYS MinGW build system for a while and I include the RI runtime Although Ive mostly concentrated on testing trunk I added building of and I recently uploaded a build to BinTray I believe it would help the adoption of RI if a build was available I would like to propose adding it to the OneClick web site BUILD INFO Since there were a few issues posted in RI that involved gem update install problems its obvious that many users are updating gems and also default gems Hence the build has the following RubyGems updated to Bundled gems all updated Default gems BigDecimal JSON OpenSSL Pysch and RDoc are updated so files stripped and all pushed back into the build Bundler added Full build test logs here Includes prepare build package and several tests The file ruby infolog shows test results on the upgraded default gems Build z here and sig file Built with readline but also has rbreadline installed Default is rbreadline All standard tests done with the extensionso version BUILD SUMMARY UTC Appveyor Ruby ruby p revision x mingw Build TypeInfo RubyInstaller vers

nettelnet psych powerassert rdoc rake testunit Misc Ive been logging my trunk test results here First results shown are from Apri I was building before that but not logging My trunk build is used a few places for testing RubyGems just found a bug with it I have been using MSYS MinGW for a while so when working with it I work in its shell Hence I havent used ridk much The DevKit only ships with makeexe but eg rakecompiler gives precedence to gmake If other tools like Strawberry Perl that provide gmake are in PATH a build of native extensions would fail as that gmake likely does not understand MSYS paths A way to fix this would be to provide an alias copy of make named gmake At least rakecompiler would also allow to override the make tool by setting the MAKE environment variable but thats probably harder to get right From Unfortunately I dont have the luxury of using RubyInstaller daytoday anymore So when there is a new release I have to make time to actually sit down and build it Ive tried to pawn off the build process to VMs but there seems to be a problem where hypervisor environments dont get the same results as a regular Windows environment I spent time on that rabbit hole until it exhausted me So at the moment it takes about hours to build test and package a version of Ruby Then adding the quirks like making sure we have the correct version of Innoinstaller getting HTMLHelp for the CHM and the rdocchm workaround for building docs for Ruby Most of my times is spent away from my PC these days and when something goes wrong the process just gets that much longer So while I sincerely enjoy doing this but Im unable to commit the time I used to or the time I want to make the project better because I dont use the project consistently anymore There are tons of things that anyone can do to make the process better but not without taking a deep dive into the project to understand the problems Im getting the releases out when I can but its a time consuming process that I have to actually make time for these days Expanding on that I feel like Im doing an injustice to luislavena and the rest of the community But these releases are time consuming and taxing Most of the time that Im not building new releases is spent trying to automate this process or make this process easier on myself usually to no avail Until this need is met Ill continue doing what Ive been doing but as a result the releases will be on a delayed schedule Especially the likely Christmas release of I added a way to specify the folder to place downloaded files You can share a downloads folder with multiple windows installer build instances without copying from one instance to another rake DOWNLOADSc downloads specify the folder to place downloaded files absoluterelative In addition above I added the ability to handle dependency files more properly in multitoolchain Download a set of dependency files from distinguished URL path and store them under the downloads subdirectory separately configcompilersmingw rb is just a sample Youll fail in downloading the dependency files since there arent such files knappath value is used for separation
