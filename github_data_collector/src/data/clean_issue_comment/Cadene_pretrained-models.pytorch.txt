I found mimetype bug Default inceptionv cant hand over numclasses to modelsinceptionv when pretrained False So I added argument numclasses when calling inceptionv win Q models Hi there This PR fixes the typo of the url of WideResNet My editor say Undefined variable normalize so i want to know where normalize is defined Hi I would prefer to store the weight file locally instead instead of downloading it as the download speed is very slow What is is the best way of doing this Specifically I would prefer to pass a path to inceptionrestnetv selfinception inceptionresnetv numclasses pretrainedimagenet weightpathtoweight The last pooling layer of SENet should be change from selfavgpool nnAvgPool d stride to selfavgpool nnAdaptiveAvgPool d so that the model can take different input size when i python setuppy install Processing dependencies for pretrainedmodels error torch post is installed but torch is required by torchvision Hi Cadene nice work Is there any efficient way to finetune these models on other datasets do you have a example with this note By default models will be downloaded to your HOMEtorch folder You can modify this behavior using the TORCHMODELZOO variable as follow export TORCHMODELZOOlocalpretrainedmodels Hi Cadene Thanks a lot for providing these models I am relatively new to PyTorch I am finding it difficult to generate Class Activation Maps for my trained model InceptionResnetV on XRay images When i see some tutorial I observe the following selffeatureextractor modelmoduledensenet features selffeatureextractoreval selfclassifier modelmoduledensenet classifier So here typefeatureextractor is torchnnmodulescontainerSequential as the above code is for Densenet model taken from pytorch vision library How do I generate features and classifier as the above code for InceptionResnetV from Pretrainedmodels
