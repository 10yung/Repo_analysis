When going into the diff view hitting space on commit in the map view the left side has the full commit message but the links arent clickable hyperlinked It would be nice if I could simply click on the link rather than having to manually select it and paste it into a web browser Lets make it both selectable and clickable GitUp is a great deal better than the git CLI for most things but these menu options can be difficult to use when there are many branches Rebase onto Set Upstream to In one of the projects Im involved in the list of branches is almost three times the height of my display The fact that the names are not alphabetized increases frustration Topping it off the branches appear in a different order for rebaseonto than for setupstreamto so theres no getting used to it For rebaseonto I see d q o For setupstreamto I see o d q Issue requests popping up a filtered list to find branches I think that that kind of interaction would probably work well for these operations too I also notice that stale branches appear in these menus even when the map view is configured to hide stale branches Im not asking to change that aspect but I would understand if someone else were surprised by it On quite a few projects we have commit hooks running multiple steps linting code formatting tests but when committing gitup just kinda freezes having a stream of the output would make it feel more responsive and give a better idea of how long might be left Being able to do other actions such as look at the tree view while waiting would also be great Hello after using GitUp consistently for the past three years one thing that I have always wanted was the ability to have the last committed message restored in the commit message textbox on undo of committing something I often accidentally commit something to master with a well written long form commit message and realize that I should have switched branches first or committed to originmaster and used git witch c After I realize my mistake I hit ctrl z and the commit is undone and all of my staged changes are restored but my glorious and well written commit message is lost and must be rewritten I propose that on undo of a commit the message should remain this would also be very useful for modifying a messed up commit message This is more of a feature request When Im in the Commit View after committing I have to go back to the Map View to push Id love for the keyboard shortcut to be active in this view Also if there was a Commit Push command that would be amazing Thanks GW The toolbar icon for Map View looks like a pair of handcuffs Just sayin Adding another node or edge would solve the problem in my view I have a bare not sure if that matters repo with a Keybase Git remote I am unable to fetch from or push to this remote in GitUp because I get this error Failed connecting to origin remote failed to resolve address for keybase nodename nor servname provided or not known The remote URL is keybaseprivatejfdotfiles and I have gitremotekeybase installed and on my PATH Is there any way to fix this In order to use the latest functions and fix some issues we need to update the gitlib library It would be lovely to include a quick shortcut to open the entire local repo folder with a preferred editor Ive got this in gitconfig text always push with ssh url gitgithubcom pushInsteadOf pushInsteadOf gitgithubcom It yields this for one of the projects Im working on text git remote v origin fetch origin gitgithubcomDanEbleLilyDevgit push upstream fetch upstream gitgithubcomfedelibreLilyDevgit push The problem I have is that when I try to push the local branch master to the remote branch originmaster GitUp prompts me to authenticate for HTTPS The way Im trying to push is through the menus click on master in the graph Edit Local Branch master Push to Remote origin The first prompt is Are you sure you want to and I click Push Branch Thats fine The next prompt is the problem The window title is Authentication Required and the URL shown is the fetch URL rather than the push URL see above After attempting to push with GitUp I ran git push origin mastermaster in a shell which worked fine
