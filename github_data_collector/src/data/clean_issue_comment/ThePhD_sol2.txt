Hi It appears that when we create a newenum and then iterate over it with Luas pairs it works fine but only when the enum is marked with readonlyfalse here is my reproducer cpp void testenum solstate st stopenlibraries sollibbase enum class color red blue constexpr bool ro true with false it works stnewenumcolor readonlyro color red colorred blue colorblue auto script Rlua print start for k v in pairs color do print tostringk tostringv end print end lua stsafescript script When ro is false I get start red blue end but with ro equal to true I get start end Is that expected andor am I doing something wrong Thanks I want to unregister an usertype for a solstate but as far as I know it would also unregister all for all the other solstates can I do this on only solstate I want to do it for safety in some instances using some data structures is UB Hi i wanted to ask this in gitter but i cannot find the channel anymore So i try here I use sol in an embedded project and in general it works really great The problem i have right now is that even small newusertypes with only one function binded seem to consume around kB of RAM when using Lua If the number of functions which are bound increase the memory consumption goes up to kB and more So my questions is is there a way to use sol more memory efficient in regards to ram usage I just use the collectgarbagecount function from Lua to measure the total memory with different bindings compiled Beside that im using Lua and the GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain armnoneeabig Thanks in advance for any comments Maybe sol will support the package Manager from the conan Hello users of sol This issue was made so that I could get a better idea of what you all use for Lua and how much you like dislike sol compared to what you used to use if anything and sol now If anyone could just reply to this issue with their thoughts perhaps answer some of the questions below or go on a tangent really anything Id appreciate it Im going to be writing a paper about sol and the Lua landscape so Id like to get to know what my users use sol for How did you find out hear about sol Whatre you using it for What Lua library did you use before you found sol What do you like about sol What do you dislike about sol Is it easier or harder from the last Lua library you used If you did use a library or the plain C API before this Is the documentation or examples helpful Anything else about the library you feel like adding or pointing out Thanks for much for reading and considering and double thanks if you do reply If you dont have a github nag me on twitter with thephantomderp or just shoot me an email or something
