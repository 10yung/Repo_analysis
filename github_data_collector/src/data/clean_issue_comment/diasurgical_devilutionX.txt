This adds an optional fix for the unique item generation bug as well as a header file to toggle onoff optional fixes I know that some people will want a pure vanilla experience so its disabled by default As an FYI the bug involves unique items where more than one item of the same base type exists The game will always pick the last occurring item in multi player making it impossible to find any item but that In single player the game records which uniques have already dropped so it is possible but it starts from bottom to top making it extremely difficult since you would have to find uniques of the same base in the same game How this should be fixed can be argued but interestingly there is an unused random call in the vanilla code I fixed it by making the game use this call so it picks one at random rather than the last one Below is a screenshot of me finding both Lightforge and Constricting Ring in multiplayer DIABLO Im on Windows Pressing Print Screen on the keyboard saves screenshots in some ancient PCX format If you spam the key quickly you get a disk space error message and the screen colors glitch out Seems like there are multiple issues here Format should probably be updated to PNG hitting the key too fast shouldnt trigger HD space errors and the colors shouldnt glitch after an error message MFILENONE does not correspond to the last item of misfiledata array and is actually greater than the length of that array causing outofbounds crash on iOS reproduced when applying rogues Disarm Trap skill Makes START a modifier key Main modifier actions are now displayed as hints while the modifier is pressed Mouse simulation now available on all controllers SELECT DPad to move mouse SELECT LeftRight should button to click START Action SELECT Menu UP Menu DOWN Map LEFT Character info RIGHT Inventory B Bottom Spell book Y Left Quest log This makes all actions available on controllers without sticks and ZLZR devilutionxcontrolscorners Alternative hint positioning devilutionxstart devilutionxretrofwipkzip This brings translation support to the game it will probably need a bit of adjustment on different platforms and for the handling of static texts Currently also only the strings from DiabloUI and appfatcpp are marked as translatable Fixes Sk rmbillede fra Vitexus AJenbo Im trying to build a DevilutionX in multiarch PPA repository So I made some changes in debian packaging rules file Ive added flag DEBHOSTMULTIARCH for autodetecting system arch amd compiles and generates debs without problem but in i building there is problem I dont know why maybe is bug in cmake or something missing in CMakeLists options Heres i build log Problem is in DEBHOSTMULTIARCH subtitution Search in log for more details obji linuxgnu and obji linuxgnu cmake sets build directory in obji linuxgnu and DEBHOSTMULTIARCH made obji linuxgnu subtitution so after trying copy devilutionx binary from obji linuxgnu instead but build file is in obji linuxgnu Why cmake set build directory in obji linuxgnu instead obji linuxgnu The PlayStation port had an option for running the game at two game speeds Normally logic runs at hz In fast mode the logic runs at hz The hz is governed by nthreadrecvturns ms and initialized by nthreadhandler When joining a multiplayer game this setting should be synced the same as difficulty and seed so possibly it should be added to gamedata This being some more touch friendly ui but it needs some cleanup before it will intergrate cleanly with the code for other ports
