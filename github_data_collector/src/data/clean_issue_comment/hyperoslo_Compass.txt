Id like you to release current master as or for Swift support Thanks How can I pass two or more parameters so that later they would be available using locationarguments param locationarguments param is it possible Or I should use only payload for this case For controllers need couple parameters Is it possible to pass parameters like userIduserId taskIdtaskId I am a bit confused as to how to actually use this if I have a route in the form of profile userId and I call Navigatornavigateurn What am I supposed to be passing in there I know how to use single word routes but not sure how to actually pass information in I have tried stuff like profileuserId and profileuserId and profileuserId and profile and so on but it always errors going into my catch We will convert Compass to be in Swift soon This is not really big changes but we can take this advantage to do some refactoring Some are breaking changes My proposals are Refactor Navigator to be used as instance And inject scheme and Router into it An app usually does not need many Navigator and use can just set it as the current one This also promotes the use of Router swift let navigator Navigatorscheme compass routers routers Navigatorcurrent navigator Right now Navigator and Router seem to confuse users Like we declare Router but also configure Navigatorroutes The above Navigator instance will make the composition clear Navigator Router Routable Refactor Router to be more flexible Not all routers depend on currentController some like preLogin prefers to switch rootViewController Remove ErrorRoutable as we can handle via try catch with navigate function What do you think hyperosloios Constructs the Locationpath based on the URLhost URLpath so that URLs such as schemecallbackpath are supported
