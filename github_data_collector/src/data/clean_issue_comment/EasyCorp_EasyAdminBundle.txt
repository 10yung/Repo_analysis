Describe the bug On Windows if there is a trailing in the config input an additional gets appended to the uploaddir path before being used elsewhere To Reproduce Use a trailing in the uploaddir config on Windows or any OS where the directory separator doesnt match I guess Workaround Just dont use a trailing slash The config input normalizer will append one for you OPTIONAL Additional context Both and are valid directory separators in Windows and can even both be used in a single path common on generated paths from portable software and to enable config to be portable to the production box that runs Linux I use for my config However the DIRECTORYSEPARATOR value contains the default Windows value which obviously does not match when the check for a trailing slash is made Probably the easiest fix would be to normalize es in the input to DIRECTORYSEPARATOR before performing the checks in FileUploadTypephp This would account for any case where it doesnt match what the user has in their config Might also take the opportunity to fix the hardcoded to be a DIRECTORYSEPARATOR on line as well for the oddball system that doesnt accept either for some reason Im sure there are some out there I upgraded to Symfony and EasyAdmin When I boot the application I directly hit the following error PHP Fatal error Class Symfony Bundle FrameworkBundle Controller Controller not found in datapimdevelopmentcurrentvendoreasycorpeasyadminbundlesrcControllerAdminControllerphp on line Which is correct since the Controller class was renamed to AbstractController in Symfony I dont know why Symfony is raising that error since I am not referencing AdminController anywhere only the new EasyAdminController It seems like the cache warmup of Symfony is running some postscripts which will result in the deprecated AdminController class being loaded Did anyone else run into that issue and know how to solve it Currently I see no other option than fork EasyAdmin and remove the deprecated AdminController class Describe the bug Using a custom bootstrap based template for an inline form it does not fit into its parent extends EasyAdmindefaultlayouthtmltwig block main formstartform for

legend I tried to add empty label but that didnt do anything I am using easy bundle Packages version friendsofsymfonyuserbundle v symfonysymfony v easycorpeasyadminbundle v The problem is that I loose the session on every request only in dev environment This mean that Ive to login on every click to see the administration Ive already checked that the sessionsavepath its writeable and in fact the session file is written The strange things its that the session cookie isnt only in dev This is the only difference that Ive found Maybe someone can help me After submitting a form with optional field of datedatetime and an invalid value in that field the Leave empty checkbox gets checked and the field is hidden Steps to reproduce Create an entity with a nullable datetime field Add it to easyadmin config Go to Add entity Uncheck the Leave empty checkbox and enter some incomplete date eg only the year Submit the form An error message is displayed but the date field is toggled off The variable data remains null because it cant get assigned an invalid datetime value so an additional check of data validity fixes this
