Update version to SNAPSHOT Remove binary incompatible suppressions no longer needed Weve had a few reports of users encountering no implementor when trying to import OpenAPI definitions without installing the OpenAPI addon We should at least ensure its installed on the docker images check if its available and install if not Perhaps we should also consider making it part of the normal bundle GAWeekly Hi I see little scope of enhancement in Wappalyzer Output The URLs which is set in context are wwwexample com testingexmplecom But the Wappalyzer API displays results with custom URLs naming system It removes https or http from context URL it adds port numbers to the URL Sequence of input is also gets changed in listall api call specially when HTTP URL is provided in context but OWASP detects its HTTPS version as well so Wappalyzer displays results for both HTTP and HTTPS version so it alters the sequence So in programming it becomes difficult to match the input context URL vs Wappalyzer output results So i request can you please use the same URL which is set in context for Wappalyzer output as well else keeping more generic will help to serve the purpose of matching input context URL vs Wappalyzer output Describe the bug After doing scans and collecting info on site it detected Application Error Disclosure Upon expanding and clicking on a link javascript file cant tell how large its instantly freezes and nothing else can be done it may recover after a few minutes wait In other parts of app Ive seen the Very large response body xxx bytes switch views warning but not in this situation I have to do a killall java to exit the app and restart On occasion it will recover after a few minutes but the app moves slow so I just restart it When it does recover the response is unintelligible see screenshot and navigating around is slow To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Have JS file size in Alert Application Error Disclosure Click on link App freezes instantly or moves slow Expected behavior To see the Request and Response data of the alert Screenshots Click on the GET AEDjs Screen freezes switching desktop and back shows gray app goesGray If it does recover Response window looks like ifitdoesrecover Software versions ZAP OS BlackArch x Java openjdk Hardware Happens on both VirtualBox and HD install on laptop Errors from the zaplog file Will update dont have currently Additional context Add any other context about the problem here The Insecure Component passive scan rule should be retireddeprecated It was a good idea however the db that makes it isnt maintained which is rendering the component less and less useful Dev refs And supporting classes in the same directory Related Messagesproperties and help content Insecure Component It would be beneficial if the output of the report could hold data similar to the output displayed on the terminal where one can view the test that have passed I am integrating such scan using the docker container to target internal sites and would like to have a better report to include in the cicd process as part of the approval gates Having the passed test visible would enable the test result to have a higher pass percentage as at the moment this is always fail Describe the bug I use a lot the requester tab to play with the parameters Usually I need to execute an active scan using the last request sent it for the requester tab but it isnt possible execute this action I have to send the request to request editor and after sent it I execute the active scan To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Select a request and send it to the requester tab Go to the requester tab and change some value and send it In the history tab select the recent request sent by the requester tab and select the option of the attackactive scan in the right click menu The previous action should show the active scanner panel but dont Expected behavior The active scanner panel should show in all the requests selected in the history tab Software versions ZAP Proxy weekly edition D I decided to start putting this together hopefully that wasnt a mistake Mergingfinishing can wait for I guess Really this is just the gutts so that we have something to talk about The handling of potentially multiple AlertMetadataRecords everywhere that AlertRecord is used is probably the next step Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Im constantly spending time copying and pasting times for each request request head body response header body to a text file because save raw saves only request or only response and at the same time it cant be used while selected multiple items in History Search Active Scan and Fuzzer Describe the solution youd like While Im at History Search Active Scan or Fuzzer I multiselect several requests Right click on selected item Click Save Raw multiple Select file name Full requests and responses are exported to txt file or I multiselect several requests Right click on selected item Click Run application Configure my application to take ids as commandline parameter containing comma separated list of selected items My script is called and fetches requests and writes them to a txt file Describe alternatives youve considered Not sure if a zestjs script can be created not sure if it can write to files Ive tried creating a pyhon script to acess the ZAP API but multiselecting requests disables all Run application items and there is no parameter to include multiple request ids Additional context java Relative paths to session file are resolved against the session directory located in ZAPs home directory default or specified with dir option This needs to change to fit the behaviour of all other software Relative paths are usually resolved against the current folder not a hidden arbitrary folder that the user is not properly informed about The current behaviour is not intuitive thus frustrating
