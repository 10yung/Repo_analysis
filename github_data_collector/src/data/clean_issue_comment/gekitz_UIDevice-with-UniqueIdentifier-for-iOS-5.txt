iPhone later return all the time Automatic Refence Counting Making UniqueIndentifier using the MAC ID not going to work on IOS Need some other technique if possible I understand that Apple are starting to restrict access to the MAC address too Is this going to affect the functionality If so has anyone got any plans as to how we can generate a unique ID for a device Hey Ive added Install app button into your README file Anyone could try your sample application right in browser Look how its working To learn more please look at Added a Static library target Made demo project use it Fixed possible low level leaks by using STL Provided more types consistency by using C casts Havent inspected the code in great detail but how unique is this identifier really MAC Addresses are not unique There is million possible addresses per manufacturer Given that Apple Sold way more iPhones millions than possible addresses is only a matter of time before you get same MAC Address for different users My understanding is that the Apps Bundle Identifier is also the same for all users that download the app which will not make it unique if two users that have the same MAC address use the same app Am I missing something As discussed in this commit comment the library asis poses a serious privacy leak issue and should not be used
