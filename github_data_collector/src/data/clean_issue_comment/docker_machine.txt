Im trying to run docker quickstart terminal on a windows home machine but I get this errr Starting default default Check network to recreate if needed default Windows might ask for the permission to

not visible This is a well known VirtualBox bug You might want to uninstall it and reinstall at least version that is is supposed to fix this issue Looks like something went wrong in step Checking status on default Press any key to continue Error with precreate check VBoxManage not found Make sure VirtualBox is installed and VBoxManage is in the path i am tired to search and solve the problem but i cant solve it Can anyone help me to solve the problem Itd be nice if there was an additional Machine driver similar to generic that could provision the local machine invoking the dockermachine create command Now that there is a docker run option to give containers access to GPUs if the Docker host has the correct configuration and install prerequisites itd be quite nice to have an additional dockermachine create option for the generic driver to automatically install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit on the target machine being provisioned It could just follow something like this installation procedure Thank you for your interest in contributing to Docker Machine Please note that the project is now in MAINTENANCE MODE meaning we will no longer review or merge PRs that introduce new features drivers or provisioners We will continue to consider and review proposed bug fixes and dependency upgrades when appropriate Thank you for your understanding Description I want to support tls client authentication for openstack it is a general implementation so Id be happy if you could merge it Related issues Include any issue from the tracker that this PR addresses or otherwise relates to Dear all Im currently doing some investigations with docker machine via rancher to be precise but Im looking at creating my machines in a given subnet From what I see in the documentation there is no way to do such a thing could you guys tell me if its intentional or if I missed something thank you Version running on Windows bit build newest build at the time of writing

project id See also This happens even though Ive set openstackauthurl to the v url but this just isnt used for the code above As a workaround you can pass openstacktenantid instead of openstacktenantname to dockermachine This Merge Request aim to add support for having the dockermachine operate on a project that is using a shared VPC Part of the support is already baked in like accepting full resource urls for the network and subnetwork parameters of the dockermachine but is lacking support when checking the presence of the firewall rule to connect to the docker port Until now the firewall rule will always searched created and updated using the project set for the VMs but this will break if the project is using a shared VPC hosted on another project and so can t contain firewall rules The smaller fix that this merge contains is to extract the project value from the network project link if contains the projects part and fallback to the project variable if not found and then using this new parameter for all the firewall requests and to construct the subnetwork link if is not a self link for the same reasons
