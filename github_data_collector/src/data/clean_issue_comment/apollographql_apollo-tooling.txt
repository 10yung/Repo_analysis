job log here Problem When you use the codegen tool to generate your types enums are by default ordered alphabetically I think this might be ok for the most cases but for example if you have an enum of months like this JS enum Month JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH APRIL MAY JUNE JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER And you want to use them in a dropdown or address them by index it is pretty useless to have it sorted by codegen like this JS export enum Month APRIL APRIL AUGUST AUGUST DECEMBER DECEMBER FEBRUARY FEBRUARY JULY JULY JUNE JUNE JANUARY JANUARY MARCH MARCH MAY MAY NOVEMBER NOVEMBER OCTOBER OCTOBER SEPTEMBER SEPTEMBER Expectation My suggestion would be to reflect the type definition in the schema by default and implement a possibility to set custom sorting via the config file So that the outcome will be by default JS export enum Month JANUARY JANUARY FEBRUARY FEBRUARY MARCH MARCH APRIL APRIL MAY MAY JUNE JUNE JULY JULY AUGUST AUGUST SEPTEMBER SEPTEMBER OCTOBER OCTOBER NOVEMBER NOVEMBER DECEMBER DECEMBER Workaround As a dirty workaround for anyone who is also experiencing this issue you can open npmnodemodulesapollonodemodulesapollocodegencorelibutilitiesgraphqljs from your global npm directory and perform the following replacement JS function sortEnumValuesvalues return valuessorta b avalue bvalue avalue bvalue return values But keep in mind that this will only work until you make the next update or this is solved Before opening a new feature request please check to see if a similar feature request already exists or has been closed before Feature

solution including which projects would need changing eg vscodeapollo apollolanguageserver If the feature changes current behavior reasons why your solution is better Itd be cool if vscode extension
