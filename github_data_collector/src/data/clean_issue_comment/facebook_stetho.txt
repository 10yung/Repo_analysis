To my surprise we can see quite a lot of banking apps that use Stetho This is very good since it shows that banks do care about good UI and do ondevice debugging But it is also pretty bad since developers release this on Google Play and as a result the entire content of the screen is broadcasted via the Stetho buildin server leaking very sensitive data accounts transactions passwords and PIN codes Please add visible documentation clearly stating that Stetho should be available on nonproduction builds only ideally in a specific UXdebugging flavor or the app I know that this is a bit patronizing for some developers but this improvement does not cost anything and might prevent some damages When trying to use the dumpapp script with some really long arguments exceeding characters I get the following error structerror H format requires number Example usage dumpapp setvalue valuekey valuebase exceeding characters Seems like the python scripts uses an unsigned short for encoding the argument length Is there any way I can modify the script to support longer arguments or is it a protocol limitation and requires the plugin update as well This is probably the same issue as which is closed and it seems nobodys going to reopen it But it still exists in v reproducible on emulator with an almost empty project Steps to reproduce Create AVD with any API image x x Google APIs ARM Launch sample app Open chromeinspectdevices in Chrome After minutes Stetho reaches filessockets and stops WSystemerr javaioIOException Too many open files WSystemerr at androidnetLocalSocketImplacceptNative Method WSystemerr at androidnetLocalSocketImplacceptLocalSocketImpljava WSystemerr at androidnetLocalServerSocketacceptLocalServerSocketjava WSystemerr at comfacebookstethoserverLocalSocketServerlistenOnAddressLocalSocketServerjava WSystemerr at comfacebookstethoserverLocalSocketServerrunLocalSocketServerjava WSystemerr at comfacebookstethoserverServerManager runServerManagerjava Wstetho IO error initialising connection thread Istetho Server shutdown on stethogmk teststethodevtoolsremote After that click on EditText in app App crashes The formatting was broken on the Stetho website this questionso many times Can you upgrade and solve it Fixes This enables people turning of jetifier when using Stetho Hi Im facing this issue only when Stetho is open I have a code where I replace some placeholders in a String If the placeholders are not found then I catch the exception and return the original String However when Stetho is open it seems like the trycatch block was ignored by Stetho and it is still making my app to crash by throwing the exception that is supposed to be caught Heres the code Im using Square Phrase library fun resolveApplicationLabeloriginal String String val applicationLabel resourcesgetStringRstringapplicationlabel return try Phrasefromoriginal putAPPLICATIONLABELNAME applicationLabel formattoString catch e IllegalArgumentException logeTAG No valid placeholders found in original e original Version of Stetho Return null if fragment is not added in getChildFragmentManager This library is one of the few that are preventing us from turning off jetifier which would be a big performance improvement Are there any plans to upgrade to androidx
