Hi First of all thank you for this module I made a few small changes to prepare it for PsGallery publication Because I think it worth to have this module in the gallery If you have a lack of time I can deploy on the gallery instead Please let me know in this case Best regards Dima I didnt realize that was a twitter handle I thought that was how you indicated who you were working for at the time If a process is being paused by PauseProcess the Powershell session that invoked PauseProcess needs to remain open for the process to continue to be paused Once the session exits the paused process is then terminated Added TestDebuggerPresent to the PauseProcess module and incorporated it into PauseProcess and UnPauseProcess functions
