The link to Bash Completion in the wiki is not found F T looks like a decent timestamp format to me but its not an ISO timestamp that would be FTT Suggest you remove the reference to the standard there in extent to the vi mode users I propose to add this readline binding in fact its annoying to press escape each time before L to clear the terminal Just wondering why HISTIGNORE is exported while none of the other variables are My inclination is to say HISTIGNORE should not be exported since it seems bash specific and subprocesses wont use it Just feedback it would be great to have an option to log cmd history to syslog Some options Feel free to close this just wanted to give some feedback CDPATH has no effect besides making cd print out the directory being changed to With only one entry in CDPATH this serves no purpose and is completely extraneous When I scp to a host that Ive added the sensiblebash to my bashrc I see bind warnings homemattbinsensiblebash line bind warning line editing not enabled I placed the binds in a TTY detection block like explained here if t then standard output is a tty do interactive initialization Enable history expansion with space Eg typing space will replace the with your last command bind Spacemagicspace fi Works well for this I love the idea of this project and appreciate the great defaults it gives me Thank you To make the project even better I propose to split the defaults into bashsensible and inputrcsensible for two reasons Avoid shadowing preferences set in inputrc eg I have set showallifambiguous off in my inputrc which is overwritten by bashsensible Thus I need to set it a second time in bashrc after loading bashsensible Make these great defaults also available to other programs that use readline python REPL etc As described here What about disabling scroll lock XOFF to avoid people puzzling why the screen is frozen having to find out about CtrlS and scroll lock and hitting CtrlQ to unfreeze Ive been using this for years in my bashrc but I dont know how portable it is disable terminal locking bind r Cs stty ixon
