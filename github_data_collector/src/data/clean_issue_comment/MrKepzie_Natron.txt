Hello everyone I corrected in Natron an exr multichannel file When I render it the image is different from the render view I tried to change the output colorspace in linear srgb and several others but still is not like it should be Also sometimes some pieces of the image are not rendered with annoying stripes on it Does anyone have suggestions Here the render view note And here the output image scena Cant be connected to on port I am beginner with natron I have issue with error like this Error while creating node frinriabuiltinWrite No plugin capable of encoding mp was found Natron OS manjaro How I can fix this issue All open issues were moved to is the official repository for the communitymaintained version of Natron and all of its plugins Problem Expected behavior Overwriting an already written output file with any smaller project output reformated size will result in a smaller data footprint of that written file over the already written file Actual behavior When writing over a preexisting file to a smaller size the data footprint remains the same which implies the overwritten file has trailing data from the previous write A file of size square with filesize of mb when resized to square will retain the same file size of mb When saving separately as a new file new name the data footprint changes to a smaller size Steps to Reproduce New Project set size to x Place solid image Place Radial Render as EXR at size x Notice Filesize of output file Open Project settings resize to x Insert reformat before Write node Reformat to size x Render again at size x Notice that filesize is the same Click write node and save as separate file new name Notice that new file has smaller data footprint Versions Natron versioncommit they can be retrieved from the About Window Natron version Release This software was compiled on Sep from the source code branch tags at version f f c using GNU C version with OpenMP targetting Intel x for Unix Environment The bundled openfxio plugins were compiled from version ebe The bundled openfxmisc plugins were compiled from version e f d The bundled openfxarena plugins were compiled from version f da OS version Windows bit
