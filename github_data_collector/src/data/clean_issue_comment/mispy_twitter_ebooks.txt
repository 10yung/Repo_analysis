dear maintainers i tried to install the bot on a fresh and updated raspbian stretch but ran into an issue i couldn t fix a nice fellow on twitter pointed me to the fact that besides ruby which was already installed also rubydev is needed so i m asking to give that information requires rubydev in the readme section to avoid that problem for other users thanks When running the bot via ebooks start about half the screen real estate gets wasted by these Building sentence of lines This fixes that Before the keyword function would leave in http and https They were in the stopwords file but they were never on their own just as part of a URL This is a little inelegant but it fixes the problem Not sure if it requires more changes on the Twitter API end but maybe this will add to the character limit Since twitter allows to write characters even if the tweet includes a photo tweet quote or mention to users the api by default sends a shortened version of the tweet so that it only contains characters and that is not something desirable for us because it removes some words I am running ebooks in production server using ebooks start But If I am killing the pid ebooks starts new process automatically I cant able to kill the process completely Is it any way to forbid specific words The bot always worked until I updated it today Not sure what caused it but somewhere in the period of now and months last time of restart something changed preventing it from logging in Before the restart it went just fine so the keys did not expire Any idea bot User information updated bot Loading model modeltweetsmodel bot starting tweet stream bot TwitterErrorUnauthorized usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemstwitter libtwitterstreamingresponserb in onheaderscomplete usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemstwitter libtwitterstreamingresponserb in usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemstwitter libtwitterstreamingresponserb in usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemstwitter libtwitterstreamingconnectionrb in stream usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemstwitter libtwitterstreamingclientrb in request usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemstwitter libtwitterstreamingclientrb in user usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemstwitterebooks libtwitterebooksbotrb in start usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemstwitterebooks binebooks in block levels in start usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemstwitterebooks binebooks in loop usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemstwitterebooks binebooks in block levels in start bot Sleeping before reconnect When running ebooks archive on Supervisor it cant find my ebooksrc and thinks its the first time running How can I provide it my ebooksrc
