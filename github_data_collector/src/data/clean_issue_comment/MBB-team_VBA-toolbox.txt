The two functions added allow the conversion between a gamma distributed precision and the distribution over the associated standard deviation in both directions for the more intuitive interpretationdefinition of posteriorprior distributions of the noise parameters The attached document provides the mathematical details Notespdf Analytical computation of the Dirichlet EP thanks to Joram Soch MFX cannot be used to invert multisession data As the multisession option is duplicating the priors the posterior and prior do not have the same dimensions This crashes MFX as it derives iteratively the prior from the posterior A potential solution would be to allow to specify priors for multisession data using the extended scheme priors on all parameters including sessionwise duplicates For multiple reasons the new display uses isYout which is not passed correctly ie truncated by onlinewrapper I broke the online display for hyperparameters my bad some suffstats are not passed correctly In particular as only one pointstate is inverted suffstats does not return any dx infos only dx I am creating a new branch fixonline to clean up the mess I induced by the change in display What is the expected behaviour All paramsHP are displayed as function of time VBAdisplayGroupBMC shows the exceedance probability of all models in the lower right panel Shouldnt it rather display the protected exceedance probability when available
