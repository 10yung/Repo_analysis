When searching for logins either in the app or via the autofill interface the last or so results always end up being covered by the keyboard Normally when I use similar search functions in Android apps the interface squishes up to accommodate the keyboard being on screen and to ensure that nothing is covered up by it Its a particular problem for those of us whose certain often used logins always end up at the bottom of a long list Say youre logging into a website and you use the autofill accessibility service but the app doesnt properly recognize what login it should give you for whatever reason Fair enough youll do a search for it instead Heres where the quirk happens If you type what you want in itll serve up anything matching that term which is aok But the problem is that on Gboard at the very least if one presses the entersearch key after typing in what you want the entire app crashes and restarts Its really strange and Ive noticed it happen on both Android what Im currently using and Android respectively Im using Bitwarden Android app on Android Huawei Honor The fingerprint unlock is enabled in the app When I launch the Bitwarden app for the first time I can unlock it with fingerprint successfully If I switch to a different app and then return to Bitwarden it shows the fingerprint popup Use your fingerprint to verify but it does not respond to fingerprint sensor The only workaround I found is to switch to Android app list and choose Bitwarden app again After that fingerprint unlock works It happens every time I switch to another app from Bitwarden I have an SSL error on Android which didnt occur in the app version Versions OS Android App installed from FDroid Official Bitwarden FDroid repo Repro steps The app hangs if asked to explicitly sync and when logging in the following error occurs Exception message Couldnt bind to method GetGetDefaultCipherSuitesHandler Then if I click Log In again the following error is shown once every button click Exception message Native method not found xamarinandroidnetOldAndroidSSLSocketFactoryncreateSocketLjavanetSocketLjavalangStringlZLjavanetSocket The only time when autofill works within the browser is when initially signing into an Opera account upon first launching the application Outside of that neither the autofill or accessibility service work for me It seems unusual that it would work initially then never again hence why I have wondered if it is an issue on my end iOS version BW version Lock setting immediately Touch ID is used for unlock Logout Login again Put app in background get it back to foreground should be locked now but its not Lock setting is still on immediately Problem can be fixed by killing the app once Buttons copy login and copy password should be in result list row not in an overflow menu There are enought space on screen My device info android MIUI Xiaomi Bitwarden I enabled those autofill services I kept the options of the two untouched I allowed the autostart permission of this app I disabled the batterysaving strategy on this app I locked the app in the memory so it wont be killed by the system With these settings this app frequently times per day causes ANR Hi Bitwarden devs I seem to have found a bug where when I name a password entry a certain name it crashes the iOS app When I enter Raspberry Pi as the name the app crashes entirely First off I swapped the Logout and Login Button on the LockPage to a more intuitive position This idea was based on a suggestion I saw on Reddit sorry forgot username Also I changed the Title of the Lock Page to something more fitting in German as the old Title is too large to fit on the screen cut off with Lastly I moved the Logout Button from the Settings into its Toolbar which makes it a lot quicker to reach and adds consistency with the Lock page ps This is my first opensource commit and the first time I had to to with Xamarin Please let me know if there are things I should pay attention to in the future thank you I hope you like my changes
