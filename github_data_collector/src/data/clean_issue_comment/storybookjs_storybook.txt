 What I did Addresses issue to reenable HMR console logging disabled after Storybook Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Im working on building an addon and when trying to pass graphqltag DocumentNodes through parameters data is lost stringified at a certain depth and queries are rendered useless Describe the solution youd like Id like to be able to set the max depth via register config Describe alternatives youve considered I also tried to avoid using the useParameter hook and to pass the parameter through the channel from decorator to panel But it seems to have the same issue since all data in coming from the same store An alternative would be to find a solution that has an extreme or infinite max depth Are you able to assist bring the feature to reality Not right now Additional context Issue What I did Moved babelpluginreactdocgen and babelpluginaddreactdisplayname from appreact to docs addon How to test Is this testable with Jest or Chromatic

perfectly fine in dev mode components utilizing React Styled Components also tried the new and Typescript with tsloader When built for static deployment things work fine except no styles get injected
