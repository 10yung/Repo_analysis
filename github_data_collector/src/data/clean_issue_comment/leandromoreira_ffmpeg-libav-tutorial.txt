Hello Thanks for the tutorial I would like to decode frame buffer encoded in MPEG TS H AAC data This buffer is received from socket And I would like to get an transform it as an RGB buffer How to achieve this with avformat void FrameDecoderonFrameReceivedconst QByteArray frame qDebug Ready to decode the frame frame Thanks for help Hello Leandro Thanks so much for this repository This account and your LinkedIn feed has contributed immensely for most of my knowledge about Video processing So as I understand this tutorial was born out of the fact that the other site was deprecated And since that tutorial ends with an explanation about the Video playback aspects involving a coarser version of ffplay utilizing libav and SDL do you intend to add the same to this tutorial It will be really helpful to understand the Video player end of the processing pipeline It will also help us how to leverage the ffmpeg libraries to build a custom player on similar lines as ffplay mplayer etc Thanks again Sanmathi Hi dear leandromoreira Thanks for your great documentation about ffmpeg I get stuck a problem with this library and I cant take it over Im developing an application by c and ffmpeg library to capture ip camera frames clearly the protocol name is RTSP everything is going well when the resolution of cameras is low but when I change it to higher resolution the memory consumption goes up suddenly So I need your help solve it is there any way to reduce the framerate or fps when I read the cameras frame I need only the last frame at the time of reading and the previous frames dont matter is it possible to reduce the frames width and height before calling avreadframe I mean that I set a parameter in AVFormatContext or AVCodecContext by which ffmpeg read the frame with the specific size for example x I will be very very thankful if you help me Hi I noticed this line of code in READMEmd c printf tCodec s ID d bitrate lld pLocalCodeclongname pLocalCodecid pCodecParametersbitrate in which pLocalCodec is not declared in the article before used which might cause confusion in my view Digging into the c code I found this line As for a guess maybe the author firstly write the c code and copyandpaste these important parts into README and lead to this issue By the way I think adding n afterward printfs could make output looks better Hope that useful UPDATE This line of code has the same problem c AVCodecContext pCodecContext avcodecalloccontext pCodec Maybe it will be better to replace pCodec with pLocalCodec Hi First I would like to thank you for the initiative I have few suggestoin for your project Add a section for FFMpeg compilation andor links for WindowsLinux For instance add links to Zeranoe builds Explain the limitation of codecmux and licenses issues the interest of the nonfree flag for compilation A small guidelinks explaining how to compile ffmpeg with specific options how to addremove a codec from a build Differenciate version of FFMpeg There are many API changes maintaining multiple version of the sample code can be great Add a small tutorial for synching audio video when there is no constant FPS input I already have some stuff for this one I can participate to some of these points Let me know if you are interested by a contribution BR Is it possible to have as output of the program a colorful frames not gray images and how to do it Hello Im using Ubuntu did a clean install in a virtual machine I downloaded libvpx from sources compiled and installed without any problems Then I downloaded ffmpeg source from git from git clone ffmpeg and compiled it passing enablelibvpx to it make compiled without any issues and did a make install When I try to make the helloworldc make gives me the following error you can

for any help While not relevant to explain concepts I think correctness should still be thought about In the Transmuxing section the image depicts h aac in a WEBM file In reality this does not work as WEBM only supports VP VP and VorbisOpus A container that can also mux H and AAC that is not MP would be MKV which is also widely adopted I use centos I use yum installed the following pakages sudo yum
