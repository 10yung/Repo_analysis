Hi asciimoo please take a look of this PR for the issue I made ctrlL as the shortcut for clearing all tabs to default I also checked the issue where the wuzz app cannot running because of Fails with Error Unknown command redirects I saw your PR about fixing it what i didnt write is the commands map string func for this one I wrote both the command and the config I hope everything is working perfectly Here is the screenshot Peek Use special ForceAttemptHTTP header to set the value on transport The header is not actually set in the HTTP request Hi This PR adds support for building a snap package of wuzz Snaps are cross distro Linux software packages One snap can be installed on Ubuntu all supported LTS and non LTS releases from onward Additionally they can installed on Debian Manjaro Fedora OpenSUSE and others Making a snap of wuzz enables you to provide automatic updates on your schedule to your users via the snap store If accepted you can use snapcraft locally a CI system such as travis or circleci or our free build system buildsnapcraftio to create snaps and upload to the store snapcraftiostore To test this PR locally I used an Ubuntu VM with the following steps snap install snapcraft classic git clone b snapcraft cd wuzz snapcraft Please note that snapcraftyaml has been implemented in such a way it automatically picks up wuzz version from a tag It can be installed with snap install dangerous wuzzamd snap the dangerous is necessary because we re installing an app which hasn t gone through the snap store review process Once installed the command can be executed wuzz screenshot from If landed you will need to Register an account in the snap store Register the wuzz name in the store Please note the name is already taken and it is offering your project but since you are the official upstream maybe theres something we can figure out please get in touch with us to solve that snapcraft login snapcraft register wuzz Upload a built snap to the store snapcraft push wuzzamd snap release edge Test installing on a clean Ubuntu machine snap install wuzz edge The store supports multiple risk levels as channels with the edge channel typically used to host the latest build from git master Stable is where stable releases are pushed Optionally beta and candidate channels can also be used if needed Once you are happy you can push a stable release to the stable channel update the store page and promote the application online we can help there Like the title says When we want to load request from the file When we input the keyword wuzz will search in the saved file and get the only resultIf there is many results display a dropdown list we can use the number to select or use the UpDown do move enter to select I would like to be able to define a default path other than home to access my saved request to not have to type full path to my requests every time F simply prints in whatever field I have selected Debian GNULinux I always feel bad about my first contact with developers being a bug report or complaint so I wanted you to know how cool I think this Thanks for your efforts Maybe add wuzz to homebrew repo
