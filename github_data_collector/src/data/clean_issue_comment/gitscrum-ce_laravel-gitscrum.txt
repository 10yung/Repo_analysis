Hey Are you guys going to create the feature which allows one to integrate their calendar with their GitScrum project calendars Cheers PB Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above Detailed description Provide a detailed description of the change or addition you are proposing Make it clear if the issue is a bug an enhancement or just a question Context Why is this change important to you How would you use it How can it benefit other users Possible implementation Not obligatory but suggest an idea for implementing addition or change Your environment Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in and how to reproduce it Version used eg PHP HHVM Operating system and version eg Ubuntu Windows Link to your project Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above When logging time the time at GitScrums headquarters in Europe is used rather than the users For example I logged time on a task for a couple hours this morning in the Eastern Time Zone The start and end time are listed as and Several hours later it is pm where I live This is a suggested enhancement It would be better to have no timestamps at all and only show the duration of time worked than to have timestamps from an irrelevant time zone Ideally the user could select their timezone from within GitScrum This would account for cases when VPNs or proxy servers are used Context Having accurate task timestamps would be useful to keep an eye on when team members are working on tasks It would enable a more holistic project management approach There isnt

suggestion request would you be up for using Dependabot to automatically create dependency update PRs for this GitScrum I ran it against my fork and it generated these PRs Ill port the renatomarinholaravelpagespeed PR over to this repo now Context I built Dependabot but Im honestly only suggesting it because I hope it can save you some time Id love any feedback and obviously having a repo like GitScrum using Dependabot would help boost its profile but if its not helpful to you then its not really worth anything The thinking behind Dependabot is that by doing lots of small dependency updates each time a new version is released the process becomes much easier to manage and safer to deploy Its basically a tool to make agile for dependency management possible Implementation You can install Dependabot from here or here if you decide to give it a try Error on login with git lab ErrorException in Builderphp line count Parameter must be an array or an object
