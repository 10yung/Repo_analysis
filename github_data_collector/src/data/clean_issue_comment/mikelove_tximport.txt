Alevin returns a whitelisttxt file add option to import only barcodes listed therein If you have a question about usage of the software do not post here instead post to the Bioconductor support site This GitHub repo is to facilitate browsing of the code and pull requests For nonminor pull requests its a very good idea to first post to the support site link above where we can discuss beforehand I probably will not accept major PR that havent been discussed beforehand because I would need to have time to ensure that it wont cause unintended consequences on the user base
