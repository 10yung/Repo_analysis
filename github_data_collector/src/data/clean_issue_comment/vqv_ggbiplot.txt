Could anyone please solve this issue for me I would be much obliged librarydevtools Loading required package usethis Warning messages package devtools was built under R version package usethis was built under R version installgithubvqvggbiplotforce T Downloading GitHub repo vqvggbiplotmaster checking for file C Users jada AppData Local Temp Rtmp aKj q remotes d def vqvggbiplot e DESCRIPTION preparing ggbiplot checking DESCRIPTION metainformation checking for LF lineendings in source and make files and shell scripts checking for empty or unneeded directories looking to see if a datadatalist file should be added building ggbiplot targz Installing package into CUsersjadaDocumentsRwinlibrary as lib is unspecified installing source package ggbiplot using staged installation R data bytecompile and prepare package for lazy loading Error converted from warning package ggplot was built under R version Execution halted ERROR lazy loading failed for package ggbiplot removing CUsersjadaDocumentsRwinlibrary ggbiplot Error Failed to install ggbiplot from GitHub converted from warning installation of package CUsersjadaAppDataLocalTempRtmp aKj qfile eaggbiplot targz had nonzero exit status Hi Is there a way i can get the equation if the ellipse that are formed through the ggbiplot function Thank you In R librarydevtools gives following error Error in librarydevtools there is no package called devtools How to fix it I have a problem in installation of ggbiplot and the error is Error Failed to install unknown package from GitHub schannel next InitializeSecurityContext failed SECECERTEXPIRED x The received certificate has expired please help me for resolving the error thanks Hi is it possible to compute this function with an object of phylpca The library allows drawing a normal data ellipse for each group Is there any way to choose to what group draws an ellipse and thanks a lot for this package Ive tried the experimental or not experimental versions of vqv richardjtelford and vangalamaheshh github ggbiplot sites without success Hi Does anyone know which parameter can be used to change the color of varname The dependency on plyr means that ggbiplot masks functions from dplyr This isnt too much of a problem if loading the package using libraryggbiplot as I can just reorder my imports but ggbiplot also loads all of plyr if you use the ggbiplotggbiplot syntax So currently there is no way of preventing ggbiplot from masking dplyr functions without ensuring that you explicitly import ggbiplot first Is there some way of changing how ggbiplot uses the functions from plyr to prevent it being fully loaded when you use the ggbiplotggbiplot syntax Hi Thanks for making a great package It saved me lots of time I work with highdimensional data Plotting all arrows makes the figure too crowded I modified your code to plot only a few arrows at a time toggled via the labelssubset argument Please accept this pull request if you think others might find this feature helpful too Cheers Thom
