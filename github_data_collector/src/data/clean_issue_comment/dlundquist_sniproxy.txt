Such as The configuration file is rewritten as table If no port is specified the port of the incoming listener is used examplecom examplenet Indicates that only addresses from and can access examplecom I am a C programmer Where can I modify this source code to achieve this function Can you give me some tips I use sniproxy for name based vitrual redirect for hundreds of hosts and for the most part it works properly I am having issues with one hostname in particular wwwbbccouk Here are the symptoms Initial Query parses successfully Subsequent Queries fail with with HTML body error Not found Please check your DNS Internal reference TA Wait s TTL for wwwbbccouk and it works Restart SNIPROXY daemon and it works before the s TTL expires Clear Cache on local web browser Its worth noting those workarounds will only work for one or queries to the hostname errors will repeat the cycle Also on the sniproxy server no DNS queries are being initiated to target recursor once entered into this error state A good start is to understand logically what data sniproxy holds on to during the DNS Cache period and what triggers a restart to fix the problem I have tried a myriad of configuration options without luck including Using a local resolver instead of public DNS ie googlecloudflare Fresh install of SNIProxy sniproxy git g fa ea Tested on Multiple Virtual Machines Tested

please Thanks There seems that at some point the Debian image Travis is using broke and now requires fakeroot Hi Guys maybe someone of you can help me Im currently experiencing some issues with FOX TNTDrama and Syfy On TNT when i try to watch AEW i have Problems with the Page tokenngtvio where i get a ERRSSLVERSIONORCIPHERMISMATCH Same for sbpngtvio Both are https Pages For Fox it seems to be caused by uplynkcom which is giving me Errors If i try to download something with youtubedl i get ERROR Unable to download webpage urlopen error EOF occurred in violation of protocol sslc caused by URLErrorSSLEOFError EOF occurred in violation of protocol sslc This PR changes the behaviour of permission dropping by inheriting users supplementary group if no group has been explicitely specified in the configuration file The reason behind this PR is that I need to connect from sniproxy to a stunnel UNIX socket Said sockets are created in Debian with permission and user stunnel which means only users in the stunnel user and group can connect to said tunnels I thought about adding the sniproxy user to stunnel group so it could access the pipe but it didnt work and I spent quite some time figuring out why it was getting a connection refused even though the groups were properly set This PR thus allows using more than one group in the sniproxy user which is more natural and behaves as in sudo or startstopdaemon where the supplementary groups are also setup Hi I have been using Sniproxy several months to proxy data tofrom a local TV provider to another network Everyting was fine under iOS Android and Android TV TV Box Last week I got a new TV with Android TV Sniproxy does not seem to work anymore There is a problem with HTTPSTLS requests In my wireshark protocol I can see that Sniproxy sends a reset command after my TLS request Is there anyone who has an idea why this could happen How can I contribute to a solution autogensh setversh line debchange command not found
