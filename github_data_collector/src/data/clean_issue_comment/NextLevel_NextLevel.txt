I have been having problems with audio falling out of sync because of multiple audio buffers being skipped frequently I am not sure what is the exact cause of the frames dropping since its hard to debug but I rewritten fix from this fork which simply stores buffers that failed to attach and tries to reappend them together with the next frame It seems it solves most of the issues with audio sync for me Is there something I am missing or can this be merged into master Would this make sense to do also for video buffers While video frame drops are more rare it still does happen at times Add ability to attach custom metadata to the writer output Useful if you want to attach eg CLLocation at the time of recording NextLevel release version Users of my app are reporting crashes when capturing photos I analyzed crash reports and it looks the crashes occurs only on iPhone s iOS Crash occurs after calling NextLevelsharedcapturePhoto and the message is AVCapturePhotoOutput capturePhotoWithSettingsdelegate settingsprocessedFileType must be present in selfavailablePhotoFileTypes My camera configuration code is pretty straightforward swift Configure camera let nextLevel NextLevelshared nextLevelcaptureMode photo nextLevelphotoDelegate self nextLevelphotoConfigurationpreset high I dont have iPhone s so its hard for me to debug it but perhaps you folks will know where the issue is coming from Edit my guess is that NextLevel sets codec to hevc on all iOS devices but its only supported on iPhone and newer iPhone s can process hevc photos but they cant capture in that format Is there any functionality or property to add watermark image over video NextLevelsharedcaptureMode photo NextLevelsharedphotoConfigurationisHighResolutionEnabled true NextLevelsharedcapturePhoto Returned AVCapturePhoto is AVCapturePhoto x pts settingsuid photo x time As you can see this is a x resolution Ive tried tinkering with other settings to try and get a output but to no luck What am I missing Thanks I only saw how to use the api to record video in the example but how to record photo Can you provide a example please help me I have a requirement wherein I need to use these inputs to calculate the distance I am able to fetch focal length along the X and Y axis but not sure how can I use this public func focalLengthAndPrinciplePointfocalLengthX inout Float focalLengthY inout Float principlePointX inout Float principlePointY inout Float Any input will be really appreciated Experiencing something odd when I record a set of clips and playback the saved video the video plays perfectly in the correct orientation when exported it is flipped upside down Ideas Im facing the issue flipCaptureDevicePosition to rotate the camera with font especially on iPhone Im using below code to change the mode of the camera NextLevelsharedflipCaptureDevicePosition By apply this its working fine with iPhone X all other devices but the same code is making an issue with iPhone to show font camera view I have also make sure Im using the very updated pod version but still having an issue to get the required output Kindly help me in this case First Thanks for this Libray I set deviceOrientation portrait and output the image by photofileDataRepresentation But when i take photos and show the images orientantion is equal iphone orientation I want the images orientation is portrait but i cant fix and all of imageimageOrientation are portrial how to set the nextlevel
