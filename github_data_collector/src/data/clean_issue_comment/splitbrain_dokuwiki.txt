In the release f Frusterick Manners the dates were displayed correctly in RSS feeds but after updating to b Greebo there are errors Types ATOM ATOM RSS always show date for feeds Types RSS and RSS show wrong feed time add time zone For ATOM ATOM RSS Greebo show time as T Frusterick Manners showed T For RSS and RSS Greebo show time as Wed Jan Frusterick Manners showed Wed Jan Apparently everything is in the iso and rfc functions in the file vendoropenpsauniversalfeedcreatorlibElementFeedDatephp In Frusterick Manners these functions were in incfeedcreatorclassphp and looked a bit different I returned them as before FeedDatephp FeedDatephp public function rfc return gmdaterthisunix date gmdateD d M Y His O thisunix date gmdateD d M Y His thisunix if TIMEZONE date

substrdate return date After that the errors disappeared but there is a feeling that this one is still wrong because the time zone can be not only a plus but also a minus PHP timezone set in phpini Microsoft Outlook as RSS client brought many improvements to the DokuWiki code base but unfortunately we also broke backward compatibility in some places where we didnt intend it This PR should restore that backward compatibility for DokuParser and a bit how DokuHandler is used by the parser In particular I hope that this PR makes the move plugin work again see michituxdokuwikipluginmove It also adds another method to the Debug class Im not sure if that is the best way to do it and would appreciate feedback or thoughts poke splitbrain phy and others Future remark we are going to want to extract the DokuHandler class into a new one that follows PSR That was overlooked in the original PR GooglePage Speed Insights rank up points Otherwise the browser render is waiting for loading and compiling big CDN script libraries async bugged so only defer in both places Hi I am from Indonesia and not a programmer I want to tell you there is a truncated translation in Indonesian Opera

converted to lowercase directly after getting it Trying to setup DokuWiki on a fresh Ubuntu Server LTS bit install Setupmethod apt Webserver apache phpversoin After installing I tried to run localhostdokuwikiinstallphp there was a long error list missing writepermissions on folders and files Following this guide all but one error disappears Remaining error usrsharedokuwikiconf is not writable by DokuWiki You need to fix the permission settings of this directory Consulting both varlibdokuwikidata and usrsharedokuwiki it results that the confdirectory has not been created at all during installation The installation apt did not report any errors Tried fixes negative manually create confdirectory and changing ownership to wwwdatawwwdata chmod R on dokuwiki directory desperate I know clear cache in browser It is not a strange thing that an admin would try to set up DokuWiki on an Ubuntu Server This should really work out of the box Can we please fix this Working in progress with issue idx functions in incindexerphp are encapsulated into singleton Indexer class former DokuIndexer all static functions in incfulltextphp are encapsulated into FulltextSearch class two methods in FulltextSearch backlinks and mediause those lookup metadata index and not related to fulltext search are separated into MetaSearch class introduce new namespace dokuwiki Search into which Indexer FulltextSearch and MetaSearch classes are moved For the moment all public functions in fulltext and indexer are modified to use relevant class methods in Search namespace and marked as deprecated but left for compatibility I am sticking to change only fulltextphp and indexerphp files in this work Further development must be needed I hope that I understand the issue correctly but I wonder these changes could get in goods with core development teams members Here are some points to consider prior to go further developments MetaSearchmediause former ftmediause could be defined in incmediaphp file as getUsedMedia MetaSearchbacklinks former ftbacklinks could be defined in inccommonphp file as getBacklinks If above two method can be moved to different places class MetaSearch can be removed Then The class name FulltextSearch can be renamed to Search New namespace Fulltext might be better that contains Indexer and FulltextSearch classes global constant FTSNIPPETNUMBER where should be defined after when incfulltextphp file will be removed Should we use namespace constants INDEXERVERSION and IDXMINWORDLENGTH instead of global constatnts Use the name of the current namespace for template value page instead of start when creating the namespaces startpage I was looking through the dokuwikiinccachephp and noticed that the function iosaveFile is called on line with iosavefile no capital F Also on line Also in the comment line in file inciophp Maybe it is right It looks odd to me Thanks for Dokuwiki
