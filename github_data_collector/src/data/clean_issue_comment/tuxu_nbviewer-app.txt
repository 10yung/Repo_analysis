This is a very interesting app I wonder if there is any plan for Windows users Im using QuickLook on Windows which supports plugins Id love to be able to link to nbviewerpathtonotebooknotebookpynb and have it open an instance of that notebook I believe this only requires setting a plist variable as defined in Apples docs here Please consider submitting the app to be notarized by Apple for Gatekeeper While users can get around it by telling macOS to open it anyway it would be nice if the app were notarized From looking at the developer ID page and the more detailed instructions it seems like a fairly simple step to add to a release checklist or even a script I often recommend the app to folks new to the Python data science ecosystem especially for the quick view functionality and this would eliminate one small hurdle for them When you include images in the markdown text they are not displayed in Nbviewerapp None of these methods work Image in same directory curseofdimpng Attached image curseofdimpng attachmentcurseofdimpng Image with img tag img srccurseofdimpng Attached image with img tag img srcattachmentcurseofdimpng See included file to reproduce the bug Bug Images is not displayed in nbviewerappzip Hello Could it be possible to embed external css and javascripts like prismjs files just in case there isnt internet connection When you are offline you get a white quicklook preview because of this Best When I open a notebook I just get a blank window quicklook works fine but not the viewer I is possibly a corporateenforced somethingoranother Is there a way to debug whats happening I do not even know what information you would need from me It happens on all notebook files Thanks Is there a way to change the font that nbviewer uses Is it possible to add LaTeX support Hello tuxu thank you so much for your awesome work on nbviewer Its a real time saver for me Is there any plan for adding Table of Content TOC support into nbviewer Like Table of Content It would be a really nice feature since many notebooks are kind of long and a TOC would be super convenient for navigating through notebooks Thank you again for your hard work and contribution Cheers For your convenience heres a trivial notebook Clicking the link takes you to Google but theres no way to go back to the notebook I think either a shortcut to go back like in Safari or opening external links in the default Web browser my preference would be good
