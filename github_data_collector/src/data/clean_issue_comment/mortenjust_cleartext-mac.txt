 I see tool on this list of common words Why is it not allowed version claims to be version when selected in the Finder These words are used fairly frequently by Trump and should be added It may also be a good idea to update the dictionary using some of his newer speeches Hey Morten first of all thank you for the project Nice work I have observed some mismatches between the given license of the project and the stated license of the code mostly the swift files In the swift files it is stated that all rights reserved whereas in the Licensetxt you pasted the GPLv My question would be under what terms i can improve and share your work Thanks again and best regards Tim If you type a contraction OS X automatically changes the upright apostrophesingle quote to a slanted one Cleartext recognizes Im as a valid word but not the corrected version I m notice the subtle difference in the apostrophe character This requires you to quickly type the space after the end of the word before OS X recognizes the contraction and changes the apostrophe which can get a bit annoying v crashes when switching to Jobs or Hemingway languages This is caused by the dictionary filename mismatching the language code This change corrects the mismatch and prevents the the app from crashing if a dictionary is not found Currently names are rejected Words beginning with a capital letter should be allowed Example Yesterday Patrick said to me Issue Patrick is rejected Proper names are rejected Desired result words that are capitalized should be excluded from the rejection behavior The English list is currently more than words to cover conjugations But if we use NSLinguisticTagSchemeLemma we can find the root word before we look it up in the word list I propose modifying the isSimple function in in the SimpleWords class and adding a lemmaForWordwordStirng function Heres an example to get you started swift var question We were lovers let options NSLinguisticTaggerOptions OmitWhitespace OmitPunctuation JoinNames let schemes NSLinguisticTaggeravailableTagSchemesForLanguageen let tagger NSLinguisticTaggertagSchemes schemes options IntoptionsrawValue taggerstring question taggerenumerateTagsInRangeNSMakeRange question as NSStringlength scheme NSLinguisticTagSchemeLemma options options tag tokenRange in let token question as NSStringsubstringWithRangetokenRange print token tag It returns We we were be lovers lover Once this is in place we can look into making the lists longer and providing the user with the option of writing with the most common words Similar to issue but not I think there is a lot of value in having the unacceptable words highlighted but allowing the user to easily continue without removing them Ive noticed that I can leave the word there by hitting the down arrow which jumps the cursor ahead by a few characters and disables the highlight Im not sure why that works but Im glad that it does Id rather the ability to just highlight the bad words and continue Then the choice to leave them is intentional but the app will continue to point the issue out
