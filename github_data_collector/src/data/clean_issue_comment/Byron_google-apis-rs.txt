We have been using pubsub and starting today Ive seen some serious issues stemming from undelying IO I find my application sitting in the following stack trace pretty much indefinitely x fc cb in recv from nixstore yaj n l xxfbcd gzqx dz idrnnglibc liblibpthreadso x d f a in stdnettcpTcpStream as stdioReadread x d f ccb a in hypernetHttpStream as stdioReadread x d f da f in

hyperclientrequestRequesthypernetStreamingsend x d f ef in hyperclientRequestBuildersend x d f f c in googlepubsub ProjectTopicPublishCallCAdoit which seems to suggest that there has been some change in how google handles responses for the worse and it is effectively DoSing me I would have just gone ahead and set some timeout but this library doesnt appear to expose that functionality FWIW noting the sad results from the sensible solution might be having these libraries not make the choice for http library at all and just generate Requests which people would then use with whatever version of whatever library they want I am trying to encrypt and decrypt a small text using the CloudKMS API provided by this repo I am able to encrypt using rust let req EncryptRequest plaintext Somebase encodedata additionalauthenticateddata None let res selfhub projects locationskeyringscryptokeysencrypt req selfsymmetricasstr doit However when I try to decrypt the output in the integration test I obtaint Error from Google API The Decrypt is done as follows rust let req DecryptRequest ciphertext Some Stringfromutf datatovecunwrap additionalauthenticateddata None let res selfhub projects

hardcoded into the code Same result ServiceAccount used in my testing has Project Owner role to make sure that it cannot be Privilages problem Any help would be much appriciated How do I read a part of a large file using googlestorage It looks like the only way is to add a Range fromto HTTP header but I cant find a way to do that in code generated using googleapisrs Can we somehow allow setting an arbitrary header in an HTTP request Thank you for the very impressive group of API examples In using the docs cli example I am able to create a new blank document However I am not able to insert data into the document using the batchupdate I have read through the google api docs but do not understand how to access the features of the api Could you provide an example that would Insert text into a blank document Replace text in a current document Thank you A lot of the examples show that to use googlestorage or any other google crate that you need to include the crate and the correct version of hyper and some other things in Cargotoml Would you consider doing something like pub mod deps pub use yupoauth so that consumers of the api could do use googlestorage deps and then we wouldnt have to exactly match hyper versions or have clients depend on crates that are part of the public api to be able to use them Running calendareventslist fails when it isnt given a scope rust let result hub events list calendarid timemin starttorfc timemax endtorfc maxresults singleeventstrue orderbystartTime doit fails with rust ErrMissingTokenStringError error Invalid Scope no description provided n However by adding addscopegcalScopeReadonly the call succeeds rust let result hub events list calendarid addscopegcalScopeReadonly timemin starttorfc timemax endtorfc maxresults singleeventstrue orderbystartTime doit It appears that the default scope if none is given is gcalScopeEventReadonly I wasnt able to figure out how to change the default in etcapicalendarv calendarapijson or even if the default should be changed Note My application only uses calendarcalendarListlist and calendareventslist the former works without specifying a scope the latter does not I once had an application running with something and it worked without adding a scope I believe something did not work without adding a scope I just updated to and found the scope workaround Given spreadsheet with the number on cell A the following request hub spreadsheets valuesgetspreadsheetid Sheet A A valuerenderoptionUNFORMATTEDVALUE addscopeScopeSpreadsheet doit unwrap panics with thread main panicked at called Resultunwrap on an Err value JsonDecodeError n range Sheet A n majorDimension ROWS n values n n n n n n Errorinvalid type integer expected a string line column srclibcoreresultrs This happens because with the UNFORMATTEDVALUE render option the API will return numbers instead of strings as the cell value however googlesheets ValueRange only accepts Strings as cell values Hope someone can help I am trying to rename a file on google drive using this library but I simple cannot get it to work From what I can read on in the documentation here and the official one from Google it should be something like this but the fucktion doit is private and cannot only called by update and uploadresumable but I dont want to overwrite the file I just want to update its name Rust type HubType DriveHubClient AuthenticatorDefaultAuthenticatorDelegate DiskTokenStorage Client fn renamehub HubType fileid str newname String let mut file Filedefault filename Somenewname let result hubfiles updatefile fileid supportsalldrivestrue doit infoRename result I hope someone can help because from what I can see this will also be a problem if I want to move the file The googlesheets Request structure is composed of an enormous number of fields however as indicated in the Google Sheets API Reference those fields are union fields so only one may be present for each Request As the number of fields seems extremely large I decided to lookup the stdmemsizeofgooglesheets Request which returned This seems really too unnecessarily expensive given that we will only use one field at a time I think this could be easily made much more efficient if those union fields were represented as a rust enum which also makes the only one variant should be used per request more clear to the users Is there anything in the way the code is generated that makes it hard to do so I genuinely dont know because honestly I dont really know how the API generator even works I dont think backwards compatibility should be seen as an issue because the current type is so big to the point of being almost unusable However if that is the case I see two other options Making the new enum type and impl Intonewtype for the old one the function could then accept Intonewtype as the parameter Make a new function that takes in a str with the structure as a JSON As an user I would gladly use serde represent the type in JSON myself and this way avoid the enormous memory waste If googlepubsub Error is used in a failure error as follows will be reported error E dyn stderrorError
