Miss types in TypeScript project hope to add regexp is a set what is from space key to wave key but visual result is wave key and split key set wrongly Thank you very much for this excellent tool I love using it it really helps I saw I cant use the negative look behind syntax Can you please add support for that Example find all strings py that are not prefixed by co copy Thanks amddefine must be removed from the lib Regulex works perfect for Regex not long enough you can easily visualize the generated svg against the expression However when it comes to fairly LARGE REGEXes it becomes really hard to dragscroll the webpage Is there any way to integrate a collapsible option to collapse the regions of the AST if possible XRegExp augments JavaScript regex syntax with additional features like named capture the x flag for free spacing and line comments and p for Unicode properties It would be awesome if Regulex supported these features as well Apart from XRegExp theyre supported in a variety other modern regex implementations Java Perl PCRE NET etc excellent tool btw it would be nice to have it on par with something like rubularcom for matching multiple patterns screen shot at am Support u u Regulex only conforms with ECMAScripts regex syntax
