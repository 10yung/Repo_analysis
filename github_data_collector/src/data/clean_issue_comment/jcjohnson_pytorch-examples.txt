 win Q pytorch examples Super Minor Typo error in TensorFlow the the act of updating the value of the weights is part of should be in TensorFlow the act of updating the value of the weights is part of And Thank You jcjohnson for this super helpful writeup Hey jcjohnson first of all thank you for these eternally thankful The issue th paragraph PytorchAutograd for example we usually dont want to backpropagate through the weight update steps when training a neural network This should be done when the network is being evaluated too right At that time we dont want extra memory to be usedto keep track if we arent going to update the weights dtype torchdevicecuda Uncomment this to run on GPU should be device torchdevicecuda Uncomment this to run on GPU In the first example Backprop to compute gradients of w and w with respect to loss should be Backprop to compute gradient of loss with respect to w and w Thank you for the nice writeup selfsavedtensors in custom backward function doesnt work hence cannot compute backward using the subclass method
