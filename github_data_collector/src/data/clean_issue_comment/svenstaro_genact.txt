desired details This is currently WIP Managed to get everything working so far the last thing missing is to properly print instructions Pulling instructions from a list like all other data wouldnt be the problem but I would also like to print generic output for instructions that run and are not cached Example RUN ls la should output something like total drwxrxrx kg staff Dec drwxrxrx kg staff Dec rwrr kg staff May editorconfig drwxrxrx kg staff Dec git rwrr kg staff Jun gitignore rwrr kg staff May travisyml but Im not sure how to implement this Any ideas Also hope the current code is not that horrifying I already implemented the Docker imagecontainer deletion but just had the idea of an even better module the Docker build process Building images with Docker usually takes a lot of time and theres many generic output docker build Uploading context bytes Step FROM busybox Pulling repository busybox e aa c MB MB endpoint Step RUN ls lh Running in c e ae total drwxrxrx root root K Mar bin
