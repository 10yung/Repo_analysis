 Using screenkey official repo as submodule Fix bug in mkcast shown in newcast Fix Modify Makefile Dont install but ln s Add an installation script for Debian I propose to package mkcast for debian and maybe fedora if it runs successfully on it I am a beginner and would love to package it Also I think of creating a docker image for mkcast What do you think It looks as though something is adding extra quotes to escape but doing it badly Running the newcast script with x I get the following right before it blows up ENDCMDexec bash c while kill do done echo ENDCMD exec bash c while kill do done ENDCMD exec bash c while kill do done byzanzrecord x y w h exec bash c while kill do done outgif Notice the extra quotes in the byzanzrecord commandline this is whats causing me grief I believe Any ideas Running ubuntu Thanks Gives error message whenever wmctrl is not installed and quickly exits the program Happy to debug if needed Just used the newcast command to test out On Fedora byzanzrecord doesnt have an exec argument This makes newcast inherently broken First I read and I liked the idea of having the option to make the screenkey screen not automatically hide I use a tiling window manager Xmonad by default and this enables me to use a small variant of mkcast there instead of flipping to GNOME This causes no changes on behalf of the user at the moment On the other hand the functionality is not viewable at the moment either Im only partially proficient at bash scripting embarrasing to say and Im not sure of the best way to take a flag given to mkcast or newcast and to pass it to screenkey But this should be easy I foresee the ability to type newcast n and have the n flag ultimately passed to screenkey nohide Get an error when running this on Ubuntu newcast xdpyinfo unable to open display usrlocalgooglehomeruslanobinmkcast line wmctrl command not found usrlocalgooglehomeruslanobinmkcast line syntax error operand expected error token is usrlocalgooglehomeruslanobinmkcast line syntax error operand expected error token is usrlocalgooglehomeruslanobinmkcast line wmctrl command not found Wrong option Cannot parse integer value y for x usage byzanzrecord OPTIONS filename byzanzrecord help Error persists after installing missing wmctrl newcast xdpyinfo unable to open display Cannot open display usrlocalgooglehomeruslanobinmkcast line syntax error operand expected error token is usrlocalgooglehomeruslanobinmkcast line syntax error operand expected error token is Cannot open display Wrong option Cannot parse integer value y for x usage byzanzrecord OPTIONS filename byzanzrecord help I use Tmux from within Terminator if that has any value I use the LXDE desktop environment My default terminal emulator is evilvte I changed gnometerminal to evilvte in newcast script and the program did record a gif The quality is good However it recorded the whole desktop instead of just the terminal I believe fetching the dimensions of the evilvte window failed This might be reproducible with any terminal emulator other than gnometerminal Can you please add support for some more terminal emulators other than gnometerminal Hello I think will be awesome if put the translations on Transifex and get contributions for another languages inclusive my language portuguese
