Hi as per your papers you directly use final centerpoint position given by the DCF tracker as observation of the current state Then how do you deal with the situation with large camera motion Thanks for your time Sorry to disturb you but I cant find where the Kalman filter and the adaptive filter weights are used in the program It seems that no consistence between the paper and the program Did I ignore anything
