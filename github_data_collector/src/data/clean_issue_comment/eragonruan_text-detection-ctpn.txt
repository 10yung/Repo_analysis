within the original image pixel coordinates How to get the bounding box cor ordinates of the original image size The image is resized and bounding box is applied on it but in final output the original image and bounding box of resized image is stored this creates lot of confusion while sending it to OCR as we have supply the image and coordinates but here since the coordinate are of the resize image we have to send the resized image to ocr but what should we do to get the coordinate of the original image itself since resizing the image causes text distortions and ocr is not able to read it clearly build folder has no so file when i searched manually any help on how to resolve this Query How the coordinates x y x y x y x y of the sample image gtimg txt was collected inorder to feed into splitlabelpy to get the correct coordinates of bounding box english english english when i opened paint tool in windows and checked the coordinates of this image none of the coordinates were matching the boundaries of the text line x x y y x y x y english How to get the coordinates for my custom image Query i followed the instruction shared in the prepare your own dataset I ran splitlabelpy with the same image shared in example and with same annotation file gtimg txt I was was expecting the output of final annotation with coordinates to be same with the annotaion values sahre in this link img txt BUT IT WAS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PLEASE share the exact guideline on how to get the coordinates for any image text which has to passed into splitlabelpy the final annotations and its coordinates that was given as output after running splitlabelpy is below coordinate values of img txt present in this file is totally different from the output that i got when i ran the splitlabelpy python

for TensorFlow We do not expect to update the x branch with features although we will issue patch releases to fix vulnerabilities for at least one year Major Features and Improvements As announced tensorflow pip package will by default include GPU support same as tensorflowgpu now for the platforms we currently have GPU support Linux and Windows It will work on machines with and without Nvidia GPUs tensorflowgpu will still be available and CPUonly packages can be downloaded at tensorflowcpu for users who are concerned about package size TensorFlow contains a complete implementation of the API in its compatv module It contains a copy of the main module without contrib in the compatv module TensorFlow is able to emulate behavior using the enablev behavior function This enables writing forward compatible code by explicitly importing either tensorflowcompatv or tensorflowcompatv you can ensure that your code works without modifications against an installation of or EagerTensor now supports numpy buffer interface for tensors Add toggles tfenablecontrolflowv and tfdisablecontrolflowv for enablingdisabling v control flow Enable v control flow as part of tfenablev behavior and TF BEHAVIOR AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions allowing users to write regular Python inside tffunctiondecorated functions AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tfdata tfdistribute and tfkeras APIS Adds enabletensorequality which switches the behavior such that Tensors are no longer hashable Tensors can be compared with and yielding a Boolean Tensor with elementwise comparison results This will be the default behavior in Auto MixedPrecision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to float for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with tftrainexperimentalenablemixedprecisiongraphrewrite Add environment variable TFCUDNNDETERMINISTIC Setting to true or forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and maxpooling algorithms When this is enabled the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic TensorRT Migrate TensorRT conversion sources from contrib to compiler directory in preparation for TF Add additional user friendly TrtGraphConverter API for TensorRT conversion Expand support for TensorFlow operators in TensorRT conversion eg Gather Slice Pack Unpack ArgMin ArgMaxDepthSpaceShuffle Support TensorFlow operator CombinedNonMaxSuppression in TensorRT conversion which significantly accelerates object detection models Breaking Changes Tensorflow code now produces different pip packages tensorflowcore containing all the code in the future it will contain only the private implementation and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflowcore and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow We dont expect this to be breaking unless you were importing directly from the implementation TensorFlow is built using devtoolset GCC on Ubuntu This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow Deprecated the use of constraint and constraint with ResourceVariable tfkeras OMPNUMTHREADS is no longer used by the default Keras config To configure the number of threads use tfconfigthreading APIs tfkerasmodelsavemodel and modelsave now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel kerasbackendresizeimages and consequently keraslayersUpsampling D behavior has changed a bug in the resizing implementation was fixed Layers now default to float and automatically cast their inputs to the layers dtype If you had a model that used float it will probably silently use float in TensorFlow and a warning will be issued that starts with Layer layername is casting an input tensor from dtype float to the layers dtype of float To fix either set the default dtype to float with tfkerasbackendsetfloatxfloat or pass dtypefloat to each of the Layer constructors See tfkeraslayersLayer for more information Some tfassert methods now raise assertions at operation creation time ie when this Python line executes if the input tensors values are known at that time not during the sessionrun When this happens a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked nonfeedable In other words if they are used as keys in feeddict argument to sessionrun an error will be raised Also because some assert ops dont make it into the graph the graph structure changes A different graph can result in different perop random seeds when they are not given explicitly most often Bug Fixes and Other Changes tfestimator tfkerasestimatormodeltoestimator now supports exporting to tftrainCheckpoint format which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible
