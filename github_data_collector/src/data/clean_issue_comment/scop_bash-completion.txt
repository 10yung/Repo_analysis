Adding a completion for cryptsetup luksChangeKey Since commit da bc e f b c a e ff d cb completions are no longer built by joining together the result of compgen f X and compgen d instead o plusdirs is used The problem is that the quoted ref were trying to complete wont complete directory names only filenames Test case mkdir p foo baronetwo touch foo barfile txtonefile txt compgen f X TXTtxt o plusdirs foo bar foo barfile txt compgen f X TXTtxt o plusdirs foo bar foo barfile txt foo bartwo foo barone if the final directory ending in has no spaces it works compgen f X TXTtxt o plusdirs foo barone foo baronefile txt if there is no X xspec then it works compgen f o plusdirs foo bar foo barfile txt foo bartwo foo barone Im not sure why bash returns results this way or whether its also a bash bug but its currently impossible to descend into subdirectories of a directory with spaces in the name when using a filedir xspec Tested on Arch Linux with bashcompletion and bash and verified by running compgen against bash and via shbot on Freenode so if bash is doing wrong here it seems like it has for an awful long time Would be nice to have opkg completion in bash opkg open package management is a lightweight package management system based upon ipkg It is written in C and resembles Advanced Package Tool APTdpkg in operation Bug report the upgrade bump relates to cc xeron scop Extensions sourced from mplayer The title says it all This is a breaking change but I would be surprised if anyone entered eg the text by typing Ctrlj twice This change allows to fully complete a hidden file name when there is only one hidden file besides and or at least to benefit from prefix completion such as with git and gitignore The argument to finds path option is supposed to restrict the search results to items that belong to the specified directory so let bashcompletion suggest directories to it Reported by Dan Jacobson This adds completion to the common invocation forms of bind set variablename value and bind keyseqfunctionname A little tricky because the whole argument is likely to be quoted andor has colons in it Supported completions works w or wo in COMPWORDBREAKS bind Crab Crabort bind Crab Crabort bind Con Control Control bind set ke set keymap set keyseqtimeout bind set keymap set keymap emacs set keymap vi The variable names and values are completed in a caseinsensitive and casepreserving manner I added some test but they seem to all be getting skipped unless I put the bind function definition first in the file not sure whats up with that Hoping to get a released with the following patches so I can fixup Homebrews bashcompletion formula The issue has been fully discussed here Suppose I wish to export an environment variable named MYPATH holding following paths fullpathtofileA anotherfullpathtofileB So I think it should be done like this in bash export MYPATHfullpathtofileAanotherfullpathtofileB The issue Im facing is autocomplete kbdTabkbd key works while writing path A in command but after autocomplete stops working so it is difficult to write path B in the console in absence of autocomplete
