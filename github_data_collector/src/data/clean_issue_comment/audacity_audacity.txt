hello audicity team my name dingpengyu I updated the Simplified Chinese translation of Audicity Major fixes Fix the bug that the Simplified Chinese characters are not unified The problem thanks Fix the bug that the Simplified Chinese characters are not unified Pull Requests none thanks Hello Here is the fix to Bug The fix follows the agreed behavior see emails from around October For the sake of convenience see the agreed behavior below first check the xmlfile If it contains illegal shortcut duplicates refuse importing Shortcut duplicates are LEGAL if default settings also have those operations with the matching shortcuts A refusal to import shortcuts must happen with the message that warns the user of a failure and explains the reason if the xmlfile looks ok import the shortcuts As discussed before because different versions of Audacity might have different sets of operations with shortcuts it is still possible to end up with illegal shortcut duplicates for a perfectly correct xmlfile This situation must be monitored In case of any conflicts the shortcut from the xmlfile is used and the preexisting shortcut is wiped clean When telling the user the commands which have had their shortcut removed I think it would be useful to tell the user the name of the command the shortcut and and name of the command which still has that shortcut I didnt find a clean way to intercept the imported content before it makes its way to the shortcut preferences so I had to jump through some hoops right in KeyConfigPrefsOnImport In general I tried to keep changes minimal MacOS HighSierra audacity version in the savingprojectas window when i try to use all the keyboard commands like copy paste or Commanda mark all it fail or screw things up when i try to paste something into the text it instead reset it and paste my thing INSTEAD of what was in the box already for example if i wrote some file name from today and i mark only the today or the spot after the word in either case when i try to paste something like it instead erasing everything up and putting just the over like so some file name from today aup turn to aup instead of some file name from today aup or some file name from aup as for all the other stuff like copy and mark all they just make some system sound and fail right click and choosing the options like copy and paste from the menu work fine btw its been really bugging me for a while now giving me so much hell and also so many times i forgot audacity do it writing some long name and then pasting something in the end only to get all what i wrote beforehand deleted and i cant undo ect coz the undo also fail like copy and markall and just do the system sound and undo dont even exist in the rightclick menu i tried to update right now from to in hopes you fixed it but sense you didnt then you might not be aware about this bug so please fix its driving me like crazy thanks for reading Currently on Linux Audaicty creates HOMEaudacitydata directory Please follow XDG base directory specification to avoid cluttering HOME Bug Description The Export Method from the macro scripting section opens an export dialog To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Go to Tools Go to Macros Click on New Enter a name Add a new Step Select Export Apply macro on Project See export dialog The bug also ocours if you trigger the method via scripting through the pipe Expected behavior The export should be done in the background without promting a dialog The method is documented here Additional information please complete the following information OS Windows Version Audacity Thank you guys for your work As discussed on audacityquality list Im trying to get the start and end times of the current selection for scripting purposes but I have only managed to set the time via SelectTime I am looking for some command GetTime which returns the information that is displayed in the audio position toolbar img width altScreenshot at src Coauthoredby pan pan gmailcom Pull Requests If you are submitting a pull request please read Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Scrollbars in dark interface themes arent dark colored an stay in the system colors Describe the solution youd like Id like the scrollbars to be themed with the rest of the interface Additional context macOS Capture d e cran a
