Hello does somebody know is this project dead or still alive Bumps handlebars from to details summaryChangelogsummary Sourced from handlebarss changelog v November th Bugfixes fix add noprototypebuiltins eslintrule and fix all occurences f f d fix add more properties required to be enumerable Chores Build fix use instead of c b f add chai and dirtychai and sinon for cleaner testassertions and spies deprecate old assertionmethods e e ba dad a Security The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th Bugfixes fix use Stringfield in lookup when checking for constructor d test add fluent API for testing Handlebars c ac c

actually refer to MASQ Node issues Dont click on the links theyre wrong Hi Your repo is referring to the undocumented AZPCACHINGTAR env var Were rolling out TARing as default with agent If this is what you want you can just remove this env var If you want to specifically not use TARing then set AZPCACHINGCONTENTFORMAT to Files Well be documenting this new environment variable CC fadnavistanmay Currently the CORES payload contains the originating Nodes public key so that the exit Node can use it to encrypt the response This means that the exit Node knows the originating Nodes public key which is more information than it should have Modify the code so that payloads coming from Nodes that are not direct neighbors of the originating Node are encrypted with an alias public key rather than the public key the originating Node uses as its identity on the network Network Settings does not save Gas Price changes unless you start the node for each blockchain network Gas price cannot be changed for the nonactive blockchain network while node is Serving or Consuming Linux builds on Jenkins frequently fail on mainspec tests due to timeout waiting for SubstratumNode to start Either the verify needs to wait longer or the verification mechanism is faulty Nodes should advertise whether or not they are able to fulfill blockchain service requests via clandestine traffic or not in their Gossip NodeRecords A boolean value will suffice we may not want to distribute a nodes actual blockchain service URL and may not even be able to if that URL does not point to a public IP address on the
