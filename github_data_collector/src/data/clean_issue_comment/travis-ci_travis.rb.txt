 This is horrifying that you require a username password of github just to encrypt some variables Its a serious security issue and should probably be handled by Oath with Githubs API instead is missing the path argument for the calls to envname Depends on When running the encryptfile command the travis client adds two encrypted environment variables to the project configuration for example encrypted abkey and encrypted abiv The prefix of the name of these two variables is randomly generated In order to specify this prefix we can now use this new envprefix option For example travis encryptfile envprefix myprefix will generate two variables named myprefixkey and myprefixiv The all completions in one file approach you use with travissh prevents it from being incorporated into one of zshs best builtin startup optimizations the ability to lazyload shell functions and optionally combine completion functions into a cached bytecode dump In order to make it compatible youd do as follows Put the zsh completion definitions into their own file Add compdef travis as the first line Name that file travis and put it in its own folder Inform users that they can let zsh autoload it by adding the folder its in to their fpath before calling compinit to initialize the completions system Users who want to reduce the time completions take during shell startup can Replace the compinit call in their zshrc with compinit C and call compinit less frequently eg nightly somewhere else compinit C skips the check for whether the completion cache is stale which involves a bunch of disk IO to search fpath for the corresponding script files Call zcompile U zcompdump after compinit to generate a compiled bytecode version of the completion cache that compinit C will prefer over the uncompiled version I can vouch for this working because I did it on my system Reversing the order of the fetchtoken function allowing users to login and use that token instead of the environment variable first Fix for Travis CLI tool will always disregard login if the environment variable is set This is causing some issues when users want to use there login but need to have the TRAVISTOKEN set The documentation for Windows users trying to install RubyInstaller under the Windows section The documentation for Installation does not work for windows Then run gem install travis v nordoc nori This did not work for me on windows but after installing the most current Ruby ruby p revision x mingw gem install travis did work fine and keys can be encrypted Please change the documentation so that Windows Installation is correct Also it would be wonderful if encryption was make much simpler to do using a web page similar to appveyor in order to make it much easier for Windows Developers and to save over gb of files taking up unnecessary space Thank you I installed Travis CLI on Mac OSX Catalina using the command brew install travis The installation is a success but when I attempt to run a basic command like travis version I get the following error usrlocalbintravis usrlocalCellartravis libexecbintravis SystemLibraryFrameworksRubyframeworkVersions usrbinruby bad interpreter No such file or directory usrlocalbintravis line usrlocalCellartravis libexecbintravis Undefined error Can someone please look into this issue See and recent master builds Job never starts
