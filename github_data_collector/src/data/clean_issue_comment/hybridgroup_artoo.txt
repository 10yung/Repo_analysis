I use HM Bluetooth card How I can connect it with artoo Also how I can use arduino libraries Example sensor libraries When you open file in Ruby using Fileopen with block file closes automatically Fileopen f f something You need to close file only if you use open without block It this case open is just synonym for new f Fileopen f something fclose Hi Im trying to run the blinking example with an Arduino MEGA These are the steps I followed gort scan serial devcuBluetoothIncomingPort devttyBluetoothIncomingPort devcuusbmodem devttyusbmodem So I changed the adaptor to port devttyusbmodem also tried with devcuusbmodem having the same result Then gort arduino install and it installed avrdude successfully Now I run gort arduino upload firmata devttyusbmodem b mega avrdude AVR device initialized and ready to accept instructions Reading s avrdude Device signature x e probably m avrdude reading input file varfolders l x l t s fzgvyfzdpr gnT avrdude writing flash bytes Writing s avrdude bytes of flash written avrdude verifying flash memory against varfolders l x l t s fzgvyfzdpr gnT avrdude load data flash data from input file varfolders l x l t s fzgvyfzdpr gnT avrdude input file varfolders l x l t s fzgvyfzdpr gnT contains bytes avrdude reading onchip flash data Reading s avrdude verifying avrdude bytes of flash verified avrdude done Thank you According to the output of that command the firmata software was successfully loaded So the only thing left to do is run the program ruby blinkledrb I T INFO Registering connection arduino I T INFO Registering device board I T INFO Registering device led I T INFO Preparing work I T INFO Initializing artooconnection arduino I T INFO Initializing artoodevice board I T INFO Initializing artoodevice led I T INFO Starting work I T INFO Connecting to arduino on port devcuusbmodem And it just hangs there Im running macOS Sierra and ruby version as needed by artooarduino dependencies I saw this same issue hapening in gobot They resolved it applying some changes Could Artoo be having the same issues Thanks Have you guys looked at GrovePi or Arduberry Any chance you might support either Is it possible to control an Arduino slave via RPi both of which can leverage your DSL Its unclear which Sphero models are supported Im specifically interested in the BB but it would be helpful if the Sphero page mentioned all supported and unsupported models If the answer is simply all models it would be helpful to either say all models as of XYZ date or else still list them individually since simply saying all models may become untrue at some point in the future with the introduction of a new model that breaks backwards compatibility Thanks So the GPIO documentation for the Raspberry Pi does not include sensors Why not Does the sensor interface not work for RPi Hi hybridgroup How can i make blink led robot same first video and running independently of the physical computer
