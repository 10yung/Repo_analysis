PR code comments show up in my notifications but the actual code comment doesnt show up table tr thBrowserth tdMozilla x F Macintosh Intel Mac OS X AppleWebKit x F KHTML like Gecko Chrome x F Safari x F td tr table We use labels heavily and are currently resorting to manually prefixing the titles with WIP etc Would be great if we could see the labels table tr thBrowserth tdMozilla x F Macintosh Intel Mac OS X AppleWebKit x F KHTML like Gecko Chrome x F Safari x F td tr table I would love a keyboard shortcut equivalent to the Mark all as read checkmark button Are you open to this idea I could try a PR if so a seems logical but I wonder if this action should require a little extra work as you dont want to hit it by accident Following the g p g e etc precedent how about m a curl header Accept applicationvndgithubmockingbirdpreviewjson source id actor login metavida id avatarurl gravatarid url htmlurl followersurl followingurl gistsurl starredurl subscriptionsurl organizationsurl reposurl eventsurl receivedeventsurl type User siteadmin false url createdat T Z updatedat T Z event crossreferenced First let me say I this tool I hate using email to stay uptodate with Github I find the notifications app much better UX Right now though the tool isnt usable to me as it is flooded with notifications from a repository which I had been removed as a collaborator img width altscreen shot at am src The requests to the Github API endpoints fail img width altscreen shot at am src Any ideas how to clear this I have already tried in incognito to see if it was a cache or cookie causing issue The permissions requested are pretty extensive zomgperms From the GH docs This is one of the most expansive configurations you can permit so accept it with caution Contrast permissions for Travis CI which are much more scoped travisperms I immediately notice how its much easier to understand what Travis can read or modify and Im nervous about authorizing githubnotifications with write access to everything Id be a lot more comfortable if the githubnotification permissions were scoped or at least if there were a explanation presented for requesting so much Thanks When someone replies to an issue with a new comment the issue is remarked as unreadbold but when you click on the issue it does not load the new comment You either need to open the issue on GitHub or reload the page I think this started recentlylast week or two If you switch the list of issues to all and then go back to the unread view the issues will no longer unbold as you read them Currently the left nav bar is too narrow and truncates repo names I would like to be able to resize it I would like to see a fourth issue category added called important or favourite It would list all issues from a set of repositories I have selected as important or favourite This would make it easier to manage the repositories I have access to and allow me to follow some of them very closely Currently I have to scroll through a long list of truncated repo names to hunt down the ones I want
