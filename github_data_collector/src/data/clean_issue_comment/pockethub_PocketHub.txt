Simplifying the lifecycle of the app to just be a single activity should help to significantly mitigate the prevalence of random crashes due to the entanglement of the fragment and activity lifecycles The use of a single activity is recommended by Google and the code should be migrated to use a single activity and multiple fragments Obviously migrating the whole app in one fell swoop to a single activity would be insanely difficult Im envisioning that we slowly migrate over until we eventually have migrated to a single activity Looks like all the other GH apps are not maintained for a while so Im looking for an active one PocketHub seems to be the one but I see its deep in the development yet so my question is what do you folks aim it for currently just a dev version anyone can compile but thats it or there are more regulal GPlay releases planned Currently GPlay has with comments that basic flows dont work reliably and the GH Releases list has as the latest so I wonder which one is it I read through the readme and contribution policy that hint at this being very early stage yet but just want to confirm and help others to understand and possibly prevent frustration if its not yet ready for prime time Description IssueActivity doesnt remember the state of its fragments Versions and device Android PocketHub v HUAWEI MATE Steps to Reproduce Go to a repository Click to new an
