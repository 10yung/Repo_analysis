For my game it needs the RTT to a client in order to roll back the hitboxes properly I noticed this feature is missing or not obvious to get It is common in many other networking libraries like in the old UNET transport and also Lidgren I followed the NetCode tutorial stepbystep When I build a standalone build the NetCode systems dont get started because of DisableAutoCreation Error log sorry if the issue submission is bad its my first time I found a small bug in Ghost Collection Authoring Component It use the project name as a name prefix for the code generation and my project name was Getting started with NetCode So yeah the code has space in the class signature and couldnt compile I solved it by simply changing the name prefix for GettingStartedWithNetCode Like I say nothing too big but I thought I should mention it Maybe a warning an error or change the space for a in generated code In the Installdescription are written you have to open the Editor from the Version f or later and then you can find the Package in the Package Manager under Unity Transport include the preview option I had look in the Version f and b of the packagemanger and cant find the Package Is it possible to edit the JSON File to include the Unity Transport or is it renamed Please add so you can specify priority instead or as well to the hierarchical rule that currently exists To add more worlds I have currently made a custom bootstrap extended the supplied one and with editorscript which clones the netcode modifies and adds additional simulation groups for new worlds I had to copy and modify to be able to modify the ClientSimulationSystemGroup or NetworkStreamReceiveSystem to add additional netcode in the client world so I decided to copy everything and put it under my own namespace I want to keep the netcode in my project to be able to check for updates and simply use my script to redo my generation of worlds but the ICustomBootstrap crashes since it has two of them that are not in hierarchy I would ask to add either some encapsulation of a define or another attribute to add that can have a priority This tutorial states Then in the Inspector add the Ghost Authoring Component to the Prefab In this component select Update Component List to update the list of components However pressing this button crashes the editor immediately with no errors I have replicated this on two separate Macs Pressing the Generate code button beforehand seems to resolve the issue It would be helpful if the tutorial reflected this Trying to use the new terrain tools version in this project and running into this issue I assume that it will be fixed in the future as terrain is outside the scope of the current feature set of NetCode ArgumentException An item with the same key has already been added Key UnityEditorExperimentalTerrainAPIPaintHeightTool SystemCollectionsGenericDictionary TKeyTValue TryInsert TKey key TValue value SystemCollectionsGenericInsertionBehavior behavior at ba d b fbab b ac SystemCollectionsGenericDictionary TKeyTValue Add TKey key TValue value at ba d b fbab b ac UnityNetCodeEditorGhostAuthoringComponentEditorGenerateGhost UnityNetCodeGhostAuthoringComponent ghostInfo at LibraryPackageCachecomunitynetcode preview EditorGhostAuthoringComponentEditorcs UnityNetCodeEditorGhostAuthoringComponentEditorOnInspectorGUI at LibraryPackageCachecomunitynetcode preview EditorGhostAuthoringComponentEditorcs UnityEditorUIElementsInspectorElementcDisplayClass CreateIMGUIInspectorFromEditorb at UsersbuilduserbuildslaveunitybuildEditorMonoInspectorInspectorElementcs UnityEngineGUIUtilityProcessEventInt IntPtr at UsersbuilduserbuildslaveunitybuildModulesIMGUIGUIUtilitycs I am trying to write LAN server discovery code to use for creating a mobile controller app for a Desktop unity project ReliableSequencedPipelineStageSend method is leak needUpdate true Memory Leak needUpdate false Not Memory Leak but if needUpdate is false it ssem not to work Reliable UDP I cant fix the Pipeline For users to seriously consider and adopt the new multiplayer stack better documentation is needed Having a minimal example and pingpong isnt enough and the full FPSSample project is too complex Documentation should be written for Common example usecases player movement shooting API documentation what features are available how do I use them Getting started more than just minimal example UNet transition concepts example migration for simple project The current Unity multiplayer landscape is hard to navigate as an outsider UNet is deprecated but its not clear that this replaces it since it is missing so much documentation and doesnt look like is being used at scale yet Additionally issues and pull request should be addressed faster Support is important for a core project like this
