line transcript below After installing redcar the program fails because the JVM installed is a bit Java and Jruby Also the install instructions are a little ambiguous In any case I installed the gem with Jruby as well but this also fails albeit at least the Java bit worked OK apparently The common complaint concerns the use of Config instead of RbConfig see below Jruby jruby S redcar blangrubyv

was using Config Files I needed to fix are redcarrb redcarquickstartrb runnerrb For these I needed to do a search and replace on Config RbConfig That worked good enough But then I had a problem with plugins So I think theres stuff in this version that still hasnt been committed in the gem jruby S redcar Redcar java NameError uninitialized constant GemSourceIndex constmissing at
