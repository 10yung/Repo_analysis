I wanted to be able to paste into chunks So I copied the implementation of the relevant methods from the TagCompoundDataNode Can also create tags in chunks as a result These capabilities were already in the Capabilities property so now does as advertised I realize it might be better to have some inheritance structure so no copying is necessary but I was unsure how easyhard that would be Before After The TextBoxes now resize according to the GroupBoxes width The last commit was from November If it is abandoned is there an updated fork Region files such as r mca cannot be opened and crash NBTExplorer Using v Crash log attached errorlog The Mac version is bit and as such will not be supported on the next version of macOS macOS Catalina Additionally the Mac version is not available to download from github only from minecraftforum hocuspocustaloncrossingcomriiNBTExplorerMac zip I tried expanding a chunk in a region file which was giving errors and that crashed the program and gave me this error log I have added the error log and the mca file down below the chunk which was giving the error is chunk x z errorlog mca file I know there was a version of this for Mac at one point in time but I dont see it here Where is it Im trying to make my player have an attack speed of instead of and it does work when i load in but upon death the values reset anyway to avoid this thank you schem is the file extension used by the Sponge Schematic format used by Sponge WorldEdit etc Theyre just gzipd nbt like any other so nothing else is needed to support them This just adds the file extension so they are recognized as nbt files by default in the UI Im pretty sure there isnt a way to delete tags with NBTUtil if there is its hard to find It would be very helpful for automating deleting the Player compound tag when switching between singleplayer and server
