Hello I have a problem opening Catalog files The Catalog files have been created with another PC I copied them from that PC Mac MATLAB R a to my Laptop Windows MATLAB R a and R a There is no loss of information due to the copying as the files have the same size When I load a file there is no reading of the variables and they remain empty img width altCapture src Running the Catalogtest I get the following error img width altCapture src I downloaded GISMO the Do you know where the problem could be Or do you have any advice for me Thanks for your answer I noticed a funky behavior today that was breaking my code If a waveform object has multiple waveforms then getwChannel returns a cell array that contains the string BH However if the waveform object has waveform then getwChannel returns a string array I suggest that this function call always return a cell array When looking at the return of a waveform that has objects vs a waveform that has we cannot distinguish a difference by looking at size alone since the string array for a channel is size x The user would need to test the type of the return I check the website in the download section The file is not found Hello Dr Thompson My name is Marlon and Im a MS Geophysics grad student at Boise State looking at an Alaska earthquake catalog Ive installed GISMO and its working great at helping me quantify the robustness at the earthquake catalog I am interested However I was wondering if there is a way of using GISMO to produce a map of bvalues map view not just the standard GR relationship which I know the older matlab package ZMAP can do And I noticed that the cookbook way to only parse out a catalog by magnitude type isnt working eg data Catalogretrieveiris starttime endtime magnitudeType ml maximumdepth maxDepth boxcoordinates region should just extract local magnitude ml events but all magnitude types are included in the catalog upon inspection afterwards Is there a work around for this Thanks for entertaining my questions Cheers Marlon Need to add the sample data into GISMO and also make sure the test suite works Plotting record section Glenn Thompson thompsongmailusfedu Wed Mar at PM To Mo Mou smousavi gmailcom Does not exist currently But Carl Tape has his own library of GISMO addons and that includes one I think that might be hardwired for Alaska data I can modify it so it works more generally On Mar PM SMostafa Mousavi smousavi gmailcom wrote yes a plot as a function of distance Do you mean such a function does not already exist in GISMO Mostafa On Wed Mar at PM Glenn Thompson thompsongmailusfedu wrote You mean a plot of waveforms as a function of distance from an event If so it would be easy for me to add to the Catalog class waveforms can be added for each event in a catalog Only missing step is to add station latLon info to waveforms On Mar PM SMostafa Mousavi smousavi gmailcom wrote Dear Glenn and Celso Is there any function in GISMO for plotting record section Regards Mostafa How can I use the function responseapply with a sac file of poles zeros I have also and script to extract the poles and zeros of this kind of sac files but I dont know use the function responseapply to deconvolve Has anyone else had this error when accessing data from a Winston inside a parfor loop The same error isnt generated if I run the same code serially for loop Ive had success using this method in the past so not sure where the problem lies Im running CentOS Java version and MATLAB R b Error using loadwinstongetFromWinston line Error using loadwinstongetFromWinston line Java exception occurred javalangArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at govusgsearthwormTraceBuftraceBufToWaveTraceBufjava at govusgsearthwormWaveServergetRawDataWaveServerjava Error in loadwinston line w status getFromWinstonscnlt t myDataSource Error in waveform line w myLoadRoutine makeDataRequestdsscnlsstarttendt Thanks John add tutorial Ideas from INETER stack subtract divide RSAM objects from each other same for mean frequency data as in Shishaldin paper plot Seisan catalog data on top of RSAM make example When using demo Seisan database which has locations but not magnitudes the color map is not set So just need to set to cmap in that case
