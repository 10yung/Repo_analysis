I have a UIViewController with an AVPlayerViewController in it I disable MPVolume Hud in the ViewController and it doesnt appear until I play the AVPlayer in the AVPlayerViewController I know that with avplayercontrollershowsPlaybackControls false the hud disappears but the problem is that every control disappears and I need controls and I prefer to use system controls instead of custom ones SubtleVolume works but when I play the Player controller both the hud and SubtleVolume are visible I tried to create a MPVolume and add it to the app window to the player controller view but the hud is still visible swift let volumeView MPVolumeViewframe CGRectzero if let appDelegate UIApplicationshareddelegate as AppDelegate let window appDelegatewindow windowinsertSubviewvolumeView at Ive tried almost everything but I cant figure out what is the problem I have nav bar and status bar does not want to slide up Added separate properties displayAnimationDuration and hideAnimationDuration that allow for more customization of the animation When trying to apply an accessory image to the volume bar I noticed that it wasnt displaying properly The code was basing the accessory frame on the bar height and since my bar height was quite smaller than the accessory image that was causing the issue I updated it so that the image size is used instead Hi I was tried to manual setVolumeLevel without animated false but app crashed Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSRangeException reason Cannot remove an observer SubtleVolumeSubtleVolume x bc d for the key path outputVolume from AVAudioSession x bc f because it is not registered as an observer
