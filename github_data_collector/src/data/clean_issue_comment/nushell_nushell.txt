Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe No just the ergonomics of shortened flags Describe the solution youd like Instead of having to type help or full it would be much more convenient to just use h or f respectively Outside of convenience this would mimic previous shells allowing easierfaster adoption by new users and also make it easy to port commands as plugins if a user desired Additionally the flags should be able to be contracted together so instead of having to type cmd a b c one could enter cmd abc providing yet more ergonomics and further mimicking existing shells Describe alternatives youve considered The only other option I know of would be to leave it as it is with just longform flags Problem When you end up with a table of primitive data it is not possible to sort it anymore Example ls get name value Cargotoml LICENSEmd Cargolock cli READMEmd gitignore git It is not possible to sort on the column value You have to wrap the data to make it sortable again ls get name wrap foo sortby foo Solution Adapt sortby to support sorting primitive data This can be done by allowing not specifying a column to sort by In this case it should sort on the first column of the data Note this will also work for regular tables in this case the table will be sorted by the first column which seems reasonable Alternative solutions Add a new command sort specifically for sorting primitive data But having a command sortby and sort which you should use depending on the kind of data you are processing seems confusing It would make more sense to eventually rename sortby to sort and provide an option sort by as proposed by jonathandturner on Discord When using ls command the list of files is numbered from instead of Fix the list to start from Describe the bug The parser panics if you try to parse f To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior type f Hit enter Expected behavior Parser should never crash Screenshots Configuration please complete the following information OS Windows Version Optional features Stable Describe the bug On Windows either the regular shell or Windows Terminal Preview none of the keyboardbased paste hotkeys work Only the mouse one To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Copy text to the clipboard Run nuexe Press ShiftInsert or CtrlV Expected behavior The text from the clipboard is written where the cursor currently is in the nu shell Configuration please complete the following information OS Windows Version Build Both ShiftInsert and CtrlV work in other shell on Windows Both in the default shell window and the new Windows Terminal But for nu it seems that the only way to paste is using the rightmousebutton Describe the bug If I run fromssv on an empty table ie only the headers are present it returns an error I would expect to see a table without rows To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Find a command that outputs an empty table docker ps in my case docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES Pipe it into fromssv docker ps fromssv error Could not parse as SSV shell docker ps fromssv input cannot be parsed ssv shell docker ps fromssv value originates from here Expected behavior I would expect fromssv to display an empty table docker ps fromssv CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES Screenshots NA Configuration please complete the following information macOS Catalina nu Describe the bug Changing directory to a folder with a dot in the name results in a parse error To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior mkdir tryingthisout cd tryingthisout See the parse error Expected behavior That the directory name is parsed correctly and the current directory changed Screenshots If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem Configuration please complete the following information OS OSX Version As in the workaround with enclosing the folder name in quotes works although not convenient eg cd tryingthisout works Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe When using bash or zsh on Mac running ls in a folder that contains symlinks will display the symlinks as such zprofile Usersjosephlyonsdotfilesfileszprofile nushell does not seem to show where the symlink points which seems to be a vital piece of information for a symlink Describe the solution youd like It would be great if nushell could somehow indicate what file the symlink is pointing to Describe alternatives youve considered I have no alternatives to this other than using ls la If this is already possible or there is an additional command I missed I apologize and would appreciate hearing about it Thanks Describe the bug According to clear should now work on Windows but it isnt available for me Screenshots Screenshot Configuration please complete the following information OS Windows Version Notes Cl does work as expected however Describe the bug We currently list every column name in inner row For long rows this can get quite large To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior open a tomljson file with large inner rows Expected behavior Abbreviate the inner row headers Screenshots devDependencies row
