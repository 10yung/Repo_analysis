Since we know that installing CUDA on newly created instance is a complex tasks because there will be many errors related to version conflicts Especially while installing NVIDIA drivers and cuDNN Also it is a big headache downloading files in cloud instance I have added CUDAINSTALLATIONINSTRUCTIONmd file which helps users in installing CUDA and setting up environment to run stylegan project I have tested this on Azure AWS and GCP Works fine Below md file explains everything about the installation Also added requirementstxt file since its useful while creating virtualenv on cloud VM instance tkarras Please review this PR And reply if you find it useful Why Adding a Docker image based on the Tensorflow Docker image to create the installation and setup process easy and breezy What Adding Dockerfilegpu which can easily be called using a Makefile that has the following commands make build build the docker container make example run the pretainedexamplepy in the container make shell open bash inside the container make jupyter to run jupyter notebooks inside the container would love to add notebook examples in a separate PR The setup uses the latest version of nvidiadocker and requires Docker or newer Including a SoTA badge for this implementation that highlights the performance of the paper and allows people to compare StyleGAN to alternative methods on CelebA HQ If the behavior of this function is to map to drange I believe there is a bug Makes it easier to control image generation from command line generate multiple images and use a local network file
