 rtfpessoa As per your comment Im considering using diff html in our product that in itself has a manual code reviewing tool based on diff patches diff html covers almost all of our needs however we would like to implement some additional functionality so anyhow my plan is to implement it in a fork if its not necessarily accepted to be an official feature of diff html I wanna make it possible to insert custom DOM between lines which would eg allow commenting lines of code and basically any kind of other content Ability to customize the gutter primarily for these purposes adding buttons for dynamic loading of updown lines around the diffed area like on github This would however mean implementing a separate functionality for inserting additional lines of code at arbitrary line numbers adding buttons for other custom functionalities related to individual lines of code url I have been trying to replace githubmincss theme with other highlightjs themes but without success The text color is taken but the whole result is a combination of some default styles and theme which looks weird bu Show no newline at end of file warning like in GitHub Step Describe the problem Often text editors add new lines at EOF to comply with UNIX standard as git expects When such newlines are introduced or accidentally removed to an already tracked file this diff viewer doesnt offer a visual clue about that missing invisible character Please note that gitdiff shows a warning for this case in the terminal and GitHub supports it on their diff viewer Steps to reproduce Create a text file that does not end with a new line character and commit it Add a new line at the end of that file and commit it Perform the diff with diff html CLI Observed Results The last line is correctly marked as changed but it is not visible what exactly changed in there Expected Results A no newline at end of file mark next the version missing it like the one GitHub shows on their diff viewer Allow line breaks in sidebyside view to see the code without the need to scroll horizontally Check for an example Thank for a quick response on and we do have word wrap working in default view but not in side by side view Wordwrap view has always been challenging in side by side view but I figure I would use this time to describe the problem Side by side view with wordwrap is challenging because when word is wrapped in one table that height needs to be applied to another table For example in below right tables words are wrapped and caused increase in row height but it cannot be easily be applied to left table as they are separate table img width altscreen shot at src Will it be easy to place them in a same table so we can easily do this without JS I feel like this will not be a trivial change and I think this maybe not be a critical issue Allow files to be collapsible Ideally this could be just CSS to avoid Javascript usage We could then allow an option to choose if the files start open or collapsed If enabled then the diffs will start as collapsed when there is more than one file You would then be able to click the header to toggle the collapse state of the different files Make diff type switchable in the rendered html page We can use GitHub as an example img width altscreen shot at src
