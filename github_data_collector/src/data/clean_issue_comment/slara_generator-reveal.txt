 See screenshot When doing yo revealslide DAG markdown it fails with the following error javascript TypeError Cannot read property push of undefined at SlideGeneratormoduleexportsSlideGeneratorwriting Usersbitbearnvmversionsnodev libnodemodulesgeneratorrevealslideindexjs at Objectanonymous Usersbitbearnvmversionsnodev libnodemodulesgeneratorrevealnodemodulesyeomangeneratorlibindexjs at Usersbitbearnvmversionsnodev libnodemodulesgeneratorrevealnodemodulesrunasyncindexjs at Usersbitbearnvmversionsnodev libnodemodulesgeneratorrevealnodemodulesrunasyncindexjs at Usersbitbearnvmversionsnodev libnodemodulesgeneratorrevealnodemodulesyeomangeneratorlibindexjs at runCallback timersjs at tryOnImmediate timersjs at processImmediate as immediateCallback timersjs If I change the command to yo revealslide DAG markdown it works Seems like the in the title blows things up Weirdly enough I was unable to reproduce this in a test so I cant submit a PR with neither a fix nor a failing test Sorry Ideas what might be causing this It would be nice to have the same semantics as in the revealjs repository Although nested slides are also named vertical slides in the revealjs repository they are described as nested slides in the demo and in the first line of their READMEmd Id like a feature where I can pass an index as a param that inserts the slide in the json manifest Even better would be supporting something like for inserting vertical slides This could even be used as a cool readme type thing but for now it would simply be cool to show off what you can do with this generator
