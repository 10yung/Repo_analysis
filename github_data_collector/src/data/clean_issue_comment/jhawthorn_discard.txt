Im trying to understand an issue we have on Solidus These are two specs that describe the behavior we had with discard ruby describe discarded value on callbacksvalidations do withmodel Post scope all do table do t tdatetime discardedat ttimestamps null false end model do include DiscardModel validate validatesomething if discarded beforediscard dobeforediscard if discarded def validatesomething end def dobeforediscard end end end letpost Postcreate it runs validations with if discarded do expectpostto receivevalidatesomething expectpostdiscardto be true expectpostto bediscarded end it does not run callbacks with if discarded do expectposttonot receivedobeforediscard expectpostdiscardto be true expectpostto bediscarded end end and in the validation spec fails with DiscardModel discarded value on callbacks runs validations with if discarded FailureError expectpostto receivevalidatesomething Post id discardedat createdat updatedat validatesomethingany args expected time with any arguments received times with any arguments specdiscardmodelspecrb in block levels in top required so the validations are no more called if you use if discarded differently from the previous version I think version is more consistent with what happens for callbacks like beforesave since in that case they are not called either Not sure if there is a specific reason behind that and Im not sure if this could be considered a regression since this specific scenario is not documented anywhere
