tokenstrategy as jwt it showed that I need authentication and then it went throug after I got a token from oauth server However when I set the tokenstrategy as introspection it just went through without a valid token Heres my config for oauth plugin name local oauthendpoints introspect preservehost false listenpath authtoken upstreams balancing roundrobin targets target strippath true appendpath false methods GET POST tokenstrategy name introspection settings useauthheader true authheadertype token jwt config is name local oauthendpoints token preservehost false listenpath authtoken upstreams balancing roundrobin targets target strippath true appendpath false methods GET POST tokenstrategy name introspection settings alg HS key secret Both of tokenstrategysettings maybe conflict Because I found that log is log apiname example error You need to set a JWT secret level error msg Error executing plugin name oauth time T n stream stderr time T Z Note This project is in maintenance mode There will be bug fixes but no feature development you guys not developing it anymore can I ask for the reason if you dont mind we are using should we look for alternative Short description of problem here I am thinkingjanus as an api gateway to proxy upstream api sericecan it proxy the total web page with sub request of css js png so on Reproduction Steps First Step Create an API Definition with Set the listenpath as something Set the upstream target as real blog site Second Step visit Other Steps got the page with single htmlbut the pages css js png got the response which are the request in the html some likecssblogcss jsjquery minjs imgfaviconpng Expected behavior proxy all the regular target just like nginxas so the css png js can also be proxied Describe expected behavior here can the upstream target can be set with the same rule as listenpathes Short description of problem here Reproduction Steps First Step I want my gateway to support https I refer to the configuration in janustls under example but my client will get the error message of ssl error protocol during the access process Second Step This situation is random can be temporarily solved by restarting the gateway I tried some methods on the Internet such as modifying the system time etc can not completely solve this problem Expected behavior Successful access to my api Observed behavior Browser randomness ssl error protocol error Janus version rc OS and version ubuntu Please help me solve my problem thank you I wonder if it should be possible to add two endpoints which have the same listen path but listen on different hosts for example the first endpoint listens on exampleorg and the second on example org As of now it doesnt seem possible When oauthservers is updated via REST API the changes are saved if using mongo provider but are not immediately loaded requiring a server restart or API Definition change to trigger configuration reload It should be immediately reloaded when it is updated Reproduction Steps CreateUpdateDelete an oauth server via REST API Expected behavior Changes are immediately effective Observed behavior Database is updated but janus does not reload the updated configuration Janus version Workaround Sending any API Definition update will reload OAuth Server configurations as well When a file change is detected via fsnotify janus reads only the changed file and loads the configuration ignoring the other configuration files Reproduction Steps Start janus using filesystem repository with configuration file Update a configuration file Expected behavior Janus should reload all the configuration files Observed behavior Janus crashes with segmentation fault Describe observed behavior here Janus version Janus daemon is crashing on hot reload when the etcjanusauth directory is missing That seems to be because on startup repo is not built if auth directory is missing and on reload the repo is used without any nil checks Apr mn janus

janus will crash Expected behavior Janus should not crash Observed behavior Janus crash Janus version master OS and version fedora Hi We have observed some random UDP port is getting started along with Janus Server Have already checked the code but not able to locate any such code who is opening this port We are testing with janus f fedorarobs APIGateway januslinuxamd version janus f with a sample janustoml as Global configuration port log level debug format text API configuration backend web port webcredentials The algorithm that you want to use to create your JWT algorithm HS This is the secret that you will use to encrypt your JWT secret secret key webcredentialsbasic A dictionary with the user and password users admin admin database dsn fileetcjanus Reproduction Steps januslinuxamd start c janustoml fedorarobs RCP ps eaf grep janus fedora pts januslinuxamd start c janustoml fedorarobs RCP netstat lanp grep Not all processes could be identified nonowned process info will not be shown you would have to be root to see it all tcp LISTEN januslinux tcp LISTEN januslinux udp januslinux Q Who is opening this UDP socket and Why and how can we close it I assume it is still in RC and not yet released one Q The other questions is we are planning to use Janus in our project but not sure how widely it is used and also as the project is moved to maintenance mode how about critical BUG support I appreciate currently how it is developed and all features it supports currently but eg TLS mode does not take the port mentioned in TLS field but from Global Config as listener seems to be created before this check like this one Thanks in Advance Swanand
