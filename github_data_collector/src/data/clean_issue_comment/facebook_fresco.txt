 Motivation Test Plan Code was checked by loading different images in showcase app Best examples are here and here Description Fresco failed to load images from EXTERNALCONTENTURI eg contentmediaexternalimagesmedia FileNotFoundException was seen from the logs Reproduction Loading images with EXTERNALCONTENTURI contentmediaexternalimagesmedia Solution I found that inside comfacebookimagepipelineproducersLocalContentUriFetchProducer given the above content uri it will fall to the call getCameraImage and which in turn getting the absolute file path of the image However due to scoped storage in targetSdk that wouldnt be allowed Probably getting input stream like ParcelFileDescriptor pfd mContentResolveropenFileDescriptorcontentUri r FileInputStream fis FileInputStreampfdgetFileDescriptor Additional Information Fresco version Platform version Android Description Im new to android and i just want to put a GIF in my layout without getting lag I added the most recent version of Fresco in my dependencies but when i try to do Frescoinitializethis it make my app crash Heres my dependencies implementation comfacebookfrescofresco For animated GIF support implementation comfacebookfrescoanimatedgif I initialize Fresco in my MainActivity this way protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState superonCreatesavedInstanceState Frescoinitializethis And my layout look like this RelativeLayout xmlnsandroid xmlnsapp xmlnsfresco xmlnstools androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheightmatchparent toolscontextActivitiesMainActivity androidbackgrounddrawablemain comfacebookdraweeviewSimpleDraweeView androidididmyimageview androidlayoutwidth dp androidlayoutheight dp frescoplaceholderImagedrawablesomething RelativeLayout Description A new feature in fresco which allow a user to change shape of each corner into a quarter of ellipse with parameters a width and a height of the quarter described by a user Work plan create a function to change a shape of the image into an ellipse with original width and height Examples here and here extend the function from previous point by custom width and height create a new function to round each corner with custom width and height based on similar algorithm to one used in functions above Please let me know if you have any thoughts comments or suggestions Description The latest release found here has no changelog However there are a lot of changes since the previous release too many for Fresco users to go through to get a grasp about what has changed whats new and whats now deprecated or obsoleted Reproduction Check the releases page see no changelog release notes for v Solution Add a changelog I prefer to keep a changelog in a CHANGELOGmd file in the root of the project which may be easier to find Or if this project contains many subprojects keep a changelog at the root of each subproject Additional Information Fresco version v Platform version NA Description I have some problems when I use SimpledraweeView for animate webp in recyclerviewI guess the reuse of animated webp cause app

drawable directory icboletodetailicon I try the method of but feel its not a good solution because the is display right display different in one mobile phone because find some crash in google play I want to update library version but has display problem may you solve my question thx for your help Description Any URI photos arent loaded on API Reproduction Open Showcase App on Simple Drawee tab Solution In log for this error you can read that it is connected to okhttp so I tried a solution from here this one but it didnt solve anything Next I tried first solution from here It also didnt fix anything due to problems with Google Service I even tried to manually add TLS and remove SSL from list of enabled protocols Even if last link isnt pointing a solutions it is probably pointing a core of the problem Older versions of Android are not supporting TLS or even if they are it is not turn on by default This issue can be probably used as a solution for API but it is not a solution for the oldest versions In Showcase App almost all photos are loaded in the way affected by this issue Maybe it is worth considering to change it At least for the oldest versions Additional Information Platform version API Description There is a vulnerability for libjpegturbo Does this vulnerability exist in fresco the libjpegturbo is used by fresco See details from Reproduction Solution Additional
