Something seems to have broken the messageRoom method which ends up calling send Using the syntax made the bot work again This also depends on to keep the disconnects from recursing Hi I noticed the latest version available on NPM is while on github the latest version has been bumped to By default in the latest versions of onprem HipChat XMPP is disabled Unfortunately the ability to turn on XMPP is something that Atlassian has stated will be removed altogether in the next version This basically means that simply turning on XMPP is not an option While attempting to connect to the HipChat server I receive a repetitive list of the following messages Fri Jan GMT EST INFO Connection went offline Fri Jan GMT EST DEBUG Disconnecting here The messages do stop after about seconds and Hubot fails to respond to anything other than a break command Just for completion purposes heres the output when executing the bot binhubot a hipchat up to date in s Fri Jan GMT EST DEBUG Loading adapter hipchat Fri Jan GMT EST DEBUG HipChat adapter options jid chatbtfhipchatcompasswordtokenroomsconfbtfhipchatcomroomsblacklistroomsjoinpublictruehostbosh Fri Jan GMT EST INFO Connecting HipChat adapter Environment file HIPCHAT export HUBOTHIPCHATJID chatbtfhipchatcom export HUBOTHIPCHATPASSWORD export HUBOTHIPCHATHOST export HUBOTLOGLEVELdebug export HUBOTHIPCHATXMPPDOMAINconfbtfhipchatcom export HUBOTHIPCHATBOSHURL export HUBOTHIPCHATRECONNECTfalse HUBOTHIPCHATJOINPUBLICROOMStrue HUBOTHIPCHATJOINROOMSONINVITEtrue HUBOTHIPCHATROOMS nocconfbtfhipchatcom HIPCHAT While I have seen a few others having password problems I did verify that the password for the user in question is indeed known and working Any ideas on how to resolve this issue Hi question regarding From your existing HipChat account add your bot as a new user Stay signed in to the account well need to access its account settings later Thats my first hubot on hipchat I cant find where to add the hubot inside the hipchat account didnt find hubot in the integrations page and the link in your page for adding new user is broken when Im trying to create new user I can only create user with a specific email cant see any place to create hubot user any idea thanks Hi everyone Im getting some troubles using robotenter Every time my bot joins the channel the robotenter code triggers times Any ideas If you tell hubot not to join public rooms it only applies at start up not when the bot is running this way the bot will only join a room whilst it is running if the room is not public Hi dev team I setup and deployed hubot on an ec linux instance and NOT HERUKO when running the bot it was able to connect and join the room however when calling the bot in the room I dont get any reply I allowed ALL for INBOUND OUTBOUND ports of the ec instance Can you help me what additional things i need to configure Also how does HipChat sends request to Hubot in the background if the HipChat API does not know where to send it Thanks See This needs to be somewhere in the README I think or hubot wont work on new Hipchat instances I have been trying to devise a way to get the HipChat Room ID from the XMPP JID I am using roomNameFromJid to get the quais room name but this is not the actual name of the room as far as HipChat is concerned The end goal here is to use a Hubot clone to determine the Room ID and therefore API ID so that the HipChat API can be used for a specific room This is not an issue per se but I would like to hear your suggestions hi In README file as below where to define it now the issue when I send info to bot in room no response but there is debug info on log output any configuration I have missed Scripting Gotchas robotmessageRoom syntax is as follows robotmessageRoom roomconfhipchatcom message when I test in room the debug info seems fine Tue May GMT CST DEBUG building message Tue May GMT CST DEBUG Tue May GMT CST DEBUG OUT message toxxxgrpconfhipchatcom typechat fromchathipchatcomhubothipchatinactive xmlns update commet below env var solve the problem this leave me wrong way so long time export HUBOTHIPCHATXMPPDOMAINbtfhipchatcom Best regards Hua
