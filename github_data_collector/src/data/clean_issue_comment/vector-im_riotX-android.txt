RiotWeb provides a collection of frequently used reactions above the usual reaction list Would be cool if RiotX could do the same As that usually is a frequently used action it might make sense to for example display a second row above or below the default reactions with those personspecific favorites instead of putting these into the big emojiselector for which you have to press the menu item to get into It would be nice to have the option to hide everything that is not a message Hide things such as joins exits name changes avatar changes etc Since updating to build dev the app crashes on startup the riot logo briefly shows before it crashes It seems that RiotWeb has changed some wording when profile element are setchanged img width altimage src nadonomy is it something we also have to report on mobile clients steps send spam into a room delete recent messages by user in riot web open in riotx it will refuse to load messages beyond this point None Im mainly going to be using Riot for work though even if Im not I dont want notifications over night Please could we have a setting in notifications to allow turning them off between certain times that we can choose When Im viewing the room list in dark mode theres a indicator bar on the side which generally indicates new messages However it also indicates when theres only joinsparts or other admin type information As a user I dont want to be going through the rooms thinking theres new messages just to find out that someone has joined or has changed their profile picture To calm down those alarming badges img width altimage src To reproduce jump to first unread message or clicking to a permalink Scroll to the live The SDK is forward paginating new events are coming from the server Well we reach the live chunk ie the gap is filled we observe that the list scroll to the bottom It can be super annoying if the live chunk was big The considered solution is to add a new SendState SYNCEDPAGINATION to distinguish if the event comes from the sync so is live and timeline should automatically scroll or from pagination so the timeline should not automatically scroll
