Its been a while since ES is renamed to ECMAScript I think that the terms that we should use everywhere What do you think Happy to create PR for this What this PR does Added Turkish translation Why are you adding given library Short description why do you think that this library is important This file could help to Turkish developers understand easier the roadmap Screenshots the part that you modified is enough Before After changes What this PR does Changes GIT to Git What this PR does Add ionic to mobile list Why are you adding given library Short description why do you think that this library is important Ionic is one of mobile framework using Angular ever but it is support to react and annouce release supporting react recently Ionic is similar to reactnative but it has some characteristic and difference with reactnative Ionic use standard reactdom system so It is easy to learn for react developers who web based Ionic support to PWAProgressive Web App basically so developers using ionic can multiple resource mobileweb and web app Here is annoucing ionic react url and if it is need to adding png file Ill add images and pull request again Screenshots the part that you modified is enough Before After changes img width alt src I have no idea how to reach you without opening the issue I am following the road map and I am curious to know some books that are best to learn Design Patterns and for Algorithms and Data Structures It would be great if you link those books in the map as well What this PR does Fix typos in READMEESmd Why are you adding given library Short description why do you think that this library is important Great resources Screenshots the part that you modified is enough Before After changes It might be worth mentioning features like hooks context etc outside of simply React as they solve some of the problems that recommendedtolearn technologies addressed previously Since these roadmaps are often used by developers learning a tech who dont necessarily know about its new or upcoming features it would be worthwhile to let them know that they dont always need to go outside of React to do for example state management Itd also be a useful hint as to what they are for Another issue is that these newer features are often considered to be optional when it comes to learning that technology For example most people probably wouldnt say that someone who doesnt know hooks is someone who doesnt know React So even if you are aware of the existence of these features you might not include them mentally in any of the points along the roadmap Any thoughts It would be nice if there was an official Website for the roadmap Kinda like what the daysofcode has I think it would be nice to design an ISSUETEMPLATE to standardize the discussions and requests of improvement in the repo Let me know your opinion and I would be able to draft an ISSUETEMPLATEmd to discuss it
