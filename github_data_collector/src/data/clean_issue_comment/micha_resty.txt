The default shell on the latest macOS is Z shell and it seem to have issues with Resty The problem is that when running under zsh the special characters in the JSON responses are printed as is so for example the new line character is actually printed to the terminal instead of being outputted like first line nsecond line JSON spec requires all control characters to be escaped so piping resty output to a JSON parser is impossible now Eg GET someapi jq will fail Given that curl works fine with Z the issue is probably on the Resty side Thank you When a subshell is created the resty functions are not exported That patch fix the problem on bash shell others shells can not have this kind of functionality It was brought to my attention today that the screencast has been been removed from the source at screencastcom so I updated by blog post accordingly As such I believe the link to my blog is no longer of interest in this README After upgrading to newest resty version my bash scripts stopped to work I found that aliases for example GETrestyget where not resolved I tested with type a GET For me adding a bash option solved the problem binbash shopt s expandaliases See also on Bernd In a somewhat more ambitious move provided that you have the api specification yaml eg tesla api Press tab to autocomplete the features that are implemented Hi Micha First of all thank you for developing resty Im trying to write a bash file to automatically execute some steps but if I execute each command in a terminal everything works fine but in bash all my POSTGET commands fail with the message command not found I read up online about PATH settings that could be causing this I read on github the examples and everything seems perfect to me and still its not working binbash PATHusrlocalsbinusrlocalbinusrsbinusrbinsbinbinsnapbin source sbinresty POST login username report password XXXXXXXX jshon e authtoken u I added the PATH manually just to make sure its correct and for security reasons I replaced the real password with XXXX If I would execute checkbensh the output would be checkbensh line POST command not found warning nothing to read If I would execute each command manually at the terminal the output would be djA MDUwNzc MzMtZjg OC YTdiLWI OGQtNGUzMDgzMjg ODVhOjM Oi c IvYnAvbG ncy kaXIvZ VpX JlcG ydC sb c MA Which is EXACTLY what I needed so it is working fine at the terminal prompt Im following the git instructions but I am unable to successfully load resty in the shell on a Mac I wanted to ask if Im misunderstanding the source syntax When trying to execute the following script it seems resty takes no action there are no errors being thrown on the target server nor in the Terminal Ive installed resty via the git install method The same POST command works on a single file I execute in the shell via resty so I know resty is correctly added to my Path and I know the command syntax is good Also the script below works to upload all files in the referenced folder if I replace the resty line with a curl command its just the resty source part that seems not to work Any help appreciated Id much prefer resty to using straight curl syntax binbash dirUsersbewheeleDownloadsImages for file in find dir type f do filenamebasename file echo file Load resty dont write to the history file and set the URI base Usersbewheeleresty W u adminadmin POST apiassetsmyfolder Fnamefilename Ffilefile done Fixing the scope of curlopt so that it does not leak between requests Before this fix if you issue a HEAD and then a GET you are still getting the I parameter and causes the GET to be treated as a HEAD This includes the fixes from and will wait for that to get merged soon and then rebase mine Not sure if I was doing something wrong but after git clone gitgithubcommicharestygit resty resty HOST GET URL The restyc was not created and the cookies were not saved I had to create restyc myself before the cookies were saved Also it looks like the previous code to create the cookie file only ran if the cookie file already exists and overwrote the host file but not RESTYHOST This allows to overwrite existing files on output redirect with Fixes issues and
