NOTE brynary and I have discussed and agree that wed like to merge the projects rackbug and rackinsight together rackbug panels work now in rackinsight let me know if otherwise please rackinsight is currently fully functional working with Rails as of version I forked LogicalInsight which was a substantial rewrite itself and rewrote it to be much better We are moving towards a kickass mergermigration between the venerable RackBug and the new RackInsight Spec suite has also been updated My next major goal is to spit each panel out into its own gem so the panels dependencies can be managed separately since they are very version specific and there is no need for rackbuginsight to be tied down to dependencies of dependencies Rather panels should support a specific versioned rackbuginsight panel API Hi I couldnt find out what I have to do to show RackBug in my App The toolbar is showing fine when i go to But I did not understand how to make it show up in my apps A clarification in the README would be helpful Thanks Fed on the sql queries tab the actions SELECT EXPLAIN Profile are not doing anything when i click on them nothing happends is something wrong or is that the way its suppose to be Fixes Hi My issue is as follows The rackbug plugin works well in my local system development environment but when I installed the same in our server staging environment the following is displayed without problems Toggle RackBug is displayed and when I click it it asks for the password but after that nothing happens it remains the same following are the steps I have done scriptplugin install gitgithubcombrynaryrackbuggit require ipaddr ActionControllerDispatchermiddlewareuse RackBug ipmasks IPAddrnew IPAddrnewmynetworksPublicAddressAsSeenByTheServer secretkey RgXEMzQVJkZ YKL YKhO EXR EkrXtoJyUekAVB ceAbccRGEOuCLN G gBe password touch tmprestarttxt From local browser now the issue arises as mentioned in the beginning Seeking your assistance regarding this Thanks Pastefriendly D git checkout master git checkout b rails git push origin rails git checkout rails git branch D master git checkout b master git push f origin master git push origin rails I used this a long time ago when still using Rails x and I liked it very much Now Id like to use it on my new Rails project but I see no updates its more than one year that Rails is out and the master branch still points to x version Ive tried it rails branch in a with Ruby project and I get this error EncodingCompatibilityError incompatible character encodings UTF and USASCII I saw that is the same error of which is still pending Is there any chance that this project will be updated to support recent versions of Rails Hi there Great work on this plugin I did find that when I have lets say sql queries going on in a page there is no way for me to scroll down the page past the initial or so queries that are displayed Heres a workaround In your web browser such as Firefox when viewing the page of sql queries select the browser menu option FileSave Page As By saving the page to a html file you can then open it It will look a bit ugly but all the queries will be there and timings Would be nice to fix this Regards Declan When I click the bookmarklet and type my password the toolbar does not appear Hardrefreshing the page makes the toolbar appear Digging in to the source I see that responseok returns false because the status code is Not Modified instead of One way around this I used was to strip HTTPIFNONEMATCH from the env before passing on the request so the etag would not match Hi The branch at contains some support for rendering the timings on rails beforeafteraround filters I understand that this may not quite be upto any rackbug standards so Im open to any feedback to help improve this patch Thanks for a great plugin Ketan
