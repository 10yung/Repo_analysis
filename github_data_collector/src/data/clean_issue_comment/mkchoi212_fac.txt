When a conflict is accidentally resolved such a pressing a twice there is no way to get back to it with p and reedit I tried to rebase on top of and got this First I tried to see the result of previous conflict resolution using p but it looked like result was not saved I use e and a for each change I edited conflict again and then the green line appeared at the bottom I edited one or more conflict before the crash happened c a d e b fea bb ef cebc Incoming Version githubresourcegithubreposi func resourceGithubTeamMembershipReadd schemaResourceData meta interface error githubresourcegithubreposi client metaOwnerclient githubresourcegithubreposi t n parseTwoPartIDdId githubresourcegithubreposi c a d e b fea bb ef cebc githubresourcegithubreposi githubresourcegithubt githubresourcegithubteam githubresourcegithubteam githubresourcegithubteam githubresourcegithubteamr wasde panic runtime error slice bounds out of range goroutine running githubcomnsftermboxgoPollEvent x x x x x x x x homeanatoligosrcgithubcomnsftermboxgoapigo x githubcomjroimartingocuiGuiMainLoopfunc xc fc homeanatoligosrcgithubcomjroimartingocuiguigo x created by githubcomjroimartingocuiGuiMainLoop homeanatoligosrcgithubcomjroimartingocuiguigo x Pressing does nothing with latest go get version Screenshot from Add shortcut b for selecting both incoming changes The marker isnt removed when the conflict is resolved and ends up in the codebase What about e to edit or o to open In case I manually want to merge the conflict I use yadm to manage my dotfiles and occasionally get merge conflicts which are moderately annoying to clean up Is there any chance that fac could be made to support fixing conflicts in any given file not just those in a Git repository yadm Hi Thanks for this great tool Ive tried to configure it as a Git mergetool git config global mergetool fac However Git ignores it and it runs vimdiff for me Previously I had opendiff configured to start FileMerge and it works Ive also tried various different merge tools like sublimerge and I was expecting this to work tool gitmergetool command should start the tool with arguments for each file with conflicts I understand fac is supposed to be run for the whole set of merge conflicts and not just single files However for starters it could start for the whole set and ignore the arguments passed to it Later it could automatically move to the file which was passed to it Do you think theres a particular reason why gitmergetool would not start fac with the above configuration Ive already checked that fac is in my PATH Thanks
