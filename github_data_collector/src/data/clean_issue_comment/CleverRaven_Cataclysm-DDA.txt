Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe What the game currently calls a flintlock rifle is clearly supposed to be a musket given its accuracy and lack of range Also see on the matter of range as they should have more dispersion and more range that is a smoothbore weapon not a rifled one Describe the solution youd like The name of the weapon should be changed to Flintlock Musket Describe alternatives youve considered Changing the stats more accuracy a lot more reload time to actually represent a flintlock rifle and adding an actual flintlock musket as a different item Or first changing the name of the current item and then creating a new item to represent a flintlock musket Additional context Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Most flintlock weapons impart a lot of energy on its projectiles and they can travel a long distance They absolutely cant hit the broad side of a barn at those distances but they can travel it and cause quite a bit of damage to whatever else they hit Flintlock weapons in the game have surprisingly high accuracy low dispersion relatively speaking but very low max range when it should be the reverse Describe the solution youd like Dispersion should be increased and so should range allowing for a gun that can theoretically shoot longer distances but will be wildly inaccurate at those and can only be relied to hit something useful if there are a large cluster of enemies there which given the noise it can cause would mean attracting said horde but thats what you get for using a flintlock at a range Describe alternatives youve considered Nothing seems viable Additional context for the archetypal flintlock musket Summary SUMMARY Content Adds a radio tower to Hub Purpose of change Makes sense for a highly important military research installation to have its own radio tower Describe the solution Its just a normal radio tower included into Hubs overmap special How to use Leave the headings unless they dont apply to your PR replace commented out text surrounded with and with text describing your PR NOTE Please grant permission for repository maintainers to edit your PR It is EXTREMELY common for PRs to be held up due to trivial changes being requested and the author being unavailable to make them Summary A oneline description of your change that will be extracted and added to the project changelog The format is ignore the square brackets SUMMARY Category description The categories to choose from are Features Content Interface Mods Balance Bugfixes Performance Infrastructure Build I N Example SUMMARY Content Adds new mutation category Mouse See the Changelog Guidelines for explanations of the categories SUMMARY Bugfixes Fixes small spelling errors Purpose of change If theres an existing issue describing the problem this PR addresses or the feature it adds please link it like If it fully resolves an issue link it like Fixes Even if the issue describes the problem please provide a fewsentence summary here Example Fixes XL mutants cannot wear armleg splints due to missing OVERSIZE flag If there is no related issue please describe the issue you are addressing including how to trigger a bug if this is a bugfix Dont put the backticks around the and issue or pull request number to allow the GitHub automatically reference to it Fix errors in flavor text Describe the solution How does the feature work or how does this fix a bug The easier you make your solution to understand the faster it can get merged Fixes small errors in spelling and letter cases Describe alternatives youve considered A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered Testing Describe what steps you took to test that this PR resolved the bug or added the feature and what tests you performed to make sure it didnt cause any regressions Also include testing suggestions for reviewers and maintainers Additional context Add any other context such as mockups proof of concepts or screenshots about the feature or bugfix here Is American or British spelling preferred Summary SUMMARY Features Adds steering indicator to remote controlled vehicle and allows to see through its cameras Purpose of change This change intended to make remote controlled vehicles more useable and controllable Describe the solution Lightmap processing was changed to use controlled vehicles cameras and mirrors Indication of turning direction was tweaked to account remotecontrolled vehicle position Describe alternatives youve considered Do not use remote controlled vehicles at all because in current state its almost impossible to drive it Additional context There is video of controlling tile sized remote vehicle inside of research facility building Summary SUMMARY Balance Buff cooked buckwheat fun from to Purpose of change Cooked buckwheat had extreamly low enjoaybility value brobably an oversight when using coppyfrom from raw buckwheat Describe the solution Adding one line of code with fun value of Describe alternatives youve considered Changing it to or as some people might enjoy buckwheat Testing Run the game everything works Additional context My first PR Please be gentle Summary SUMMARY Balance Razorclaws mutant fish drop mutant meat Purpose of change Fixes Describe the solution Added two harvest entries for mutant fish and shellfish and added Razorclaws and the mutant fishes to them Describe alternatives youve considered Making a mutantfish food item and related crafts Not changing it Testing Spawned and butchered razorclaws and mutant fish Summary SUMMARY Balance adjusts house food spawns Purpose of change adjusts the food loot in the SUS groups and house palette to remove duplicate spawns in multiple sources Describe the solution Taking the kitchen as a whole Ive removed duplicating item spawns So for example you dont end up with multiple jars of honey and jugs of oil scattered around the kitchen This will need more work but Ive caught the big ones Ive restructured itemgroups further down the itemgroup chain for spawn frequency and compatibility between the groups Finally Ive adjusted the spawn chances in the houses as well The pantry had a chance to repeat thats been removed and Ive adjusted the fridge from to until we can get more variations added In general now a house offers to days of food depending on its pantry spawns from the fridge and then additional days from the pantry A lot of the fridge food spoils quickly so this will drop off as time advances since the majority of food is fresh This makes house raids more valuable earlier in the game for the fresh foods and then youll need to push further in if you want to stock up on shelf stable goods Describe alternatives youve considered Not messing with the SUSfridge group but it had some overlap with the other groups Testing Used the debug itemgroup tests to look at results as well as random sampling from the game maps SUMMARY None Fixes Describe the bug After reading an areas Restaurant Guide it showed everything expected except there were additionally a bunch of Desolate Barns now on my maps Seemed wrong Steps To Reproduce Use Restaurant Guide Notice all the Desolate Barns Expected behavior Doesnt seem like Desolate Barns would be in a restaurant guide Screenshots Desolate Barns Versions and
