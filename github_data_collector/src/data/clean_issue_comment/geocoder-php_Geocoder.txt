Asking on behalf of tanthammar who posted this issue here General Information GeocoderLaravel Version Laravel Version PHP Version Operating System and Version OSX Issue Description I do understand that this might not be the proper place to ask but I was hoping that someone might have a solution Unable to get this to work with the Algolia geocoder provider No errors but always an empty collection returned I have it working with the Nominatim and GoogleMaps Steps to Replicate composer require geocoderphpalgoliaplacesprovider in configgeocoderphp js providers Chainclass AlgoliaPlacesclass myapikey myappid Nominatimclass en GoogleMapsclass envGOOGLEMAPSLOCALE enUS envGOOGLEMAPSAPIKEY GeoPluginclass Stack Trace if an error is occuring provide the complete stack trace here Im not sure if this is a good idea or not We will not notice this on PullRequests anyways Hi Adding provider ipfinder MapTiler maptiler just announced their new Geocoding API I didnt find the documentation yet but thought it could be interesting I think we should a a sectiontable to the documentation with all of the framework integrations Ill PR soon Relates to Would be interested in your thoughts geodeveloper Nyholm jbelien This allows the chain to execute as it does currently but adds the ability to handle the exceptions if they occured For example you could log QuotaExceeded exceptions and ignore UnsupportedOperation ones Example php chaingeocodeQueryquery if chaingetPreviousQueryExceptions exceptionsToLog arrayfilterchaingetPreviousQueryExceptions function Throwable e return e instanceof QuotaExceeded example adoption From BeforeAdoption a class Geocoder ProviderAggregator b method def registerProvidersarray providers c sample method call geocoderregisterProviders new Geocoder Provider GoogleMaps GoogleMapsadapter new Geocoder Provider Yandex Yandexadapter To AfterAdoption a class Geocoder ProviderAggregator b method def registerProvidersProviders providers c method call geocoderregisterProvidersnew Geocoder Provider GoogleMaps GoogleMapsadapter d method call geocoderregisterProvidersnew Geocoder Provider GoogleMaps GoogleMapsadapter new XXProvider e method call providers new Geocoder Provider GoogleMaps GoogleMapsadapter new Geocoder Provider Yandex Yandexadapter geocoderregisterProviders providers First of all thanks for this great php package I have a feature request for getting address information by id instead of doing a full search again I think many applications will store part of the geocoding response and eventually will refetch information for the stored part At the moment with GoogleMapsProvider and NominatimProvider you can only do a reverse lookup by latlng or redo the query However both of the endpoints have a dedicated API for lookup for google maps this even is the preferred way because it will not count as a request as far as I know For OpenStreetMap it looks like this It would be great if the providers would have a lookup method for this An even better solution would be to extend the provider Interface or have a nd interface LookupAwareProvider with a lookup action or the GeocodeQuery object with an id property and maybe also the Location interface If a provider defines an id for a location it could be used for a lookup call I know that I can easily achieve this by creating my own provider however if this feature is interesting for you we could discus an solution and I could provide a PR for this The following was submitted in the GeocoderLaravel repo by xSoulRootx but probably belongs here General Information GeocoderLaravel Version Laravel Version PHP Version Operating System and Version Ubuntu Issue Description Output language in reverse query dont work Resolve vendor geocoderphp googlemapsprovider GoogleMapsphp in public function reverseQueryReverseQuery query Collection before return thisfetchUrlurl querygetLocale querygetLimit querygetDataregion thisregion add if null querygetLocale url resulttypeurlencoderesultType else url languageenvGOOGLEMAPSLOCALE enUS or something like this
