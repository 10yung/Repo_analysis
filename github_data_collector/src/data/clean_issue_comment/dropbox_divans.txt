I believe that individual components of divans would already be very useful contributions to the crates ecosystem While the full divans package doesnt match my compression needs for instance a crate with the implementation of fse would be very useful to me Would it be possible to split divans into smaller crates Hello Thanks for good work One questionis there some kind of file compressdecompress example Because there are no documents it is bit complicate to test Thanks Formatting code using rustfmt will apply uniform code style for all Rust code and it may also improve code readability The crate contains a documentation link that is actually a link to a blog post A link to the API documentation would be useful too Is there any consensus for a divans file extension Is the divans ondisk file format seekable Ie would it be possible to start decompressing somewhere in a file or would one need to decompress everything from the start Or in rust terms could DivansDecompressorReader implement the stdioSeek trait The crate file before this PR du targetpackagedivans crate targetpackagedivans crate The crate file after this PR du targetpackagedivans crate targetpackagedivans crate
