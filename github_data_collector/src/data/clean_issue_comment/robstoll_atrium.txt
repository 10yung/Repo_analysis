This is a first draft and I am unsure about my implementation but I would need some help to be able to continue I am particularly unsure about the Spec part I started an OptionalFeatureAssertionsSpec but then I noticed there was already OptionalAssertionsSpec so I modified thos classes instead Now Im stuck with OptionalAssertionsSpec that doesnt compile still learning Kotlin syntax as well as this project Thanks I confirm that I have read the Contributor Agreements v agree to be bound on them and confirm that my contribution is compliant Platform jvm js android jvm Extension none kotlin jdk jdk
