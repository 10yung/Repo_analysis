I keep getting this error when use apple signin with scopes email name invalidrequest responsemode must be formpost when name or email scope is requested I believe that you need to pass responsemodeformpost as query string when you redirect to apple auth link OAuthio service and website are down Im not getting any response via support email hence my post here what is yourapppublickey in this case How do I get Twitter public key There is just consumer key but in case if I use it getting unknown key error I am using OAuthjs to share images on Facebook and Twitter However I am running into an issue where forcing clearCache and cache false doesnt seem to force users to relogin Ideally this is the flow am after user clicks share logs into twitterfacebook image is shared user goes back to start user clicks share user has to log in again to share See code below I force both but the credientails are still retained once the user authenticates Is this correct behaviour or have i placed the calls in the wrong place Code is exact to my working version but stripped of app specific messaging to the UI Thanks initialize OAuth OAuthinitializeXXXXXXXXXXX clear any previous logins OAuthclearCache logining into twitter OAuthpopuptwitter cachefalsethenfunctiontwitter consolelogtwitter twitter var formData new FormData add the source of the image needs to be raw binary with type added formDataappendmedia UtilsgetBlobimage upload image to get media id twitterpost data formData cachefalse processData false contentType false donefunctionuploadResult consoleloguploaded media asset to twitter uploadResult use media ID to post to user wall twitterpost statusesupdatejson data statusmessage mediaidsuploadResultmediaidstring donefunctionpostResult consolelogposted to twitter postResult ifpostResultid consolelogsuccessful submission to twitter else appshowErrorPost failfunctionpostFail consolelogpost to twitter fail postFailresponseText failfunctionuploadfail consolelogfailed to upload media asset uploadfailresponseText donefunctionloginResult consolelogsuccessful twitter auth loginResult failfunctionloginFail if the user denies log in consolelogfailed twitter auth loginFailresponseText in code resultpost statusesupdatejson in chrome console please help with the right url im confused why the slash get urlencoded I ran into an issue when trying to use the callback method as the example is incorrect It took me a while to poke around oauthjs before I figured out how the callback method actually worked Hopefully this update will prevent other people experiencing the same pain I wasnt sure if this is worth reporting to since probably I may just need to use the Googles identity provider platform for SSO from the frontend but just for a note it seems Google login does not work anymore with oauthjs which I heard was working a few months back I was just wondering if this is just a matter of utilising authorize parameter when I am calling a popup method to provide the clientid Hi Im trying to figure this one out The issue I can repeat every time now Sign in with Facebook Sign out Go back and sign in again login page or wherever they all use the same You will find you get the error Error The popup was closed Stack trace popupq Clear cookies reload the page and it works Log out reload page try again and the same error Very frustrating Any ideas Cheers Andy Hello I saw two other reports of this problem but neither other report seemed to address the popup working times and failing times with Error The popup was closed When a failure occurs I can trigger a new popupfacebook with no problems directly afterwards again with a chance that it will fail a second time Whitelist is setup correctly as evident that the popup works times Always triggered by a user initiated click Will attempt to use the raw FB javascript SDK login method to see if its an issue with Facebook or OAuthio
