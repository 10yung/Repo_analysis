Has someone already implemented this method using C Python or something like that and should share the code Thanks Dear author thank you very much for opening your code I have some questions about your papers experiment the time consumption of the algorithm is very low but I use my own data set program is very timeconsuming and it takes about s to complete a matching IT s much higher than yours Although I reduced the number of iterations and increased the minimum error to it still needs about s on the premise of ensuring the correct matchingSo may i ask you is there any way to speed up the operation I check the SDRSACm file and fond that maybe some problems when execute the plotPointCloudsm function In your program plotPointCloudsB bestRM bestT br the dimensions of bestRM is while bestT is And cant sum directly I changed this part as follows row col sizeM bestTrl repmatbestT col plotPointCloudsB bestRM bestTrl br and works well In solveSDP you set up the SDP solution as a varsdp object and then add a symmetric constraint According to the SDPNAL docs it looks like you could have used varsymm for the definition of Y in which case you can remove the symmetric constraint here Is there something that I am missing here Thanks for the implementation and I enjoyed your talk at CVPR this year Hello when running the demo code the matlab tell me that char ccpmodel so I guess there is no cppmodel function
