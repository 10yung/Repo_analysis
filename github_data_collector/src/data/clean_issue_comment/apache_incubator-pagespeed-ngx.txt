it stays at VirtualHost that unavailable from public net Any solutions to workaround this I tried a number of ideas to reduce my FCP time but still nothing happening first I was using Linode Virtual Machine with Apache then FCP was around Sec but when I started using Google Virtual Machine with Nginx FCP goes sec here is the screenshot of the website speed Anyone can tell is google telling right
