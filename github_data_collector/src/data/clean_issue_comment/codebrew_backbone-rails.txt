Hi I have rails application which contains railsbackbone And working fine However now I need to upgrade it on rails Everything broken and showing a lot of errors in the web console As shown in the attached screenshot Any help will be appreciated bibliosimjavascripterrors GitHub changed the way Markdown headings are parsed so this change fixes it See bryant readmesfix for more information Tackles bryant readmesfix When passing patch true to a model save typically Backbone should be sending only the changed attributes to the server Now when using the backbonerailssyncjs override using patch true does not send the changed attributes but sends the entire model to rails I am guessing during the override backbone may think that the entire model attributes have been changed therefore sending those values When I do not use backbonerailssyncjs Backbone sends the proper changed attributes I use github gem railsbackbone git in rails And use rails g backbonescaffold user usernamestring phonestring to generate some file But in chrome console show Uncaught TypeError thistemplate is not a function when I open I edit template JST backbonetemplatesusersindex to template JST backbonetemplatesusersindexx and index file name to indexx its fine so strange First its not updated on rubygems server so instead of this gem railsbackbone you should use this gem railsbackbone git Second Example usage isnt work either Thanks In backbonerailssyncjs the CSRF header is added to every request I dont think this is necessary The jqueryrails gem which is a dependency of this gem already does that See also Sorry to change the sync monkeypatch so much I didnt want to be more intrusive than necessary with this fix But because Backbones sync and save methods are so monolithic there wasnt a way for me to address this issue with a more targeted patch Line in backbonerailssyncjs reads data JSONstringifyoptionsattrs modeltoJSONoptions It looks like this variable is always overwritten in the next few lines if modelparamRoot data data modelparamRoot modeltoJSONoptions else data modeltoJSON So line seems to do nothing If Im correct Its a few CPU cycles gone to waste More importantly though optionsattrs is ignored Thats bad because it breaks calls like the following myModelInstancesavename example patch true The above should send only name example rather than the whole attributes hash in the HTTP request This is very important in Rails where strong parameters is the officially supported way to whitelist attributes In Rails you want to be able to set configactioncontrolleractiononunpermittedparameters raise to catch your own mistakes but it breaks when backbonerails forces you to send every attribute with every request
