I would suggest and request a text search box in the Resolvers screen to quickly sort through them It is sort of a hassle reading the names of all servers to find the slow ones listed in the query log Thank you Like the forwarding Some sites have DNS records only on resolvers in the specified country I cant seem to get time based filters working at all If I try to manually add them to the config file they are removed each time I apply settings Im sorry if this has already been asked before Ive searched through the issues and couldnt find anything on it With dnscryptproxy you have the ability to use Automatic Mode while still blocking the use of certain resolvers In my case Cloudflare Google and a couple others Is that possible with Simple DNSCrypt Because I cant seem to find any options for it Note I have to use the portable version mentioned here because for some odd reason UAC refuses to appear with the installer Ill literally sit there for around half an hour and UAC simply refuses to appear for the installer I first tried using automatic mode as is default which is supposed to automatically select the fastest resolvers But it just picked two resolvers dohcryptosx and qualitologycom the former not being very good and the latter being SUPER slow taking at least seconds to resolve and the domain is for sale so I dont understand how its even working and it used the slower one most of the time So I manually selected only cloudflare and that is working fine Cannot open any network industry after setting all it shows that the connection has been reset There are several issues with Forwarding Rules Forwarding rules are not displaying in the Simple DNSCrypt interface after their initial creation Creating forwarding rules Exit Simple DNSCrypt Restart Simple DNS Crypt No forwarding rules are displayed still in forwardingrulestxt Importing Forwarding Rules does not see to work at all Click Import existing forwarding rules Select a forwarding rules txt file Wait No rules are added forwardingrulestxt does not change After rebooting the contents of forwardingrulestxt is wiped Add forwarding rules Reboot forwardingrulestxt is empty User looses ability to perform ANY dns queries when the client is uninstalled Requires manually setting DNS settings again found in static IP configuration not checked against DHCP configuration Thats a nogo Expected The program window is resized to the size most comfortable for the user the size is remembered on window close and restored when the window is open next time Current behaviour The program doesnt remember its last window size when the window is open again its size is reset to default
