We received this feedback by email CodeMirror uses it to delete lines but it is not cool We can disable this one at least Hey Thanks for that awesome project I am just starting to get to know it but I already like it I have one question though how can I host monod on a Subdomain on my server I have forwarded traffic from examplecommonod to localhost and I get most of the page but the log says it does not find some parts since it is using the path without the Subdomain Am I missing something Thanks for your time The idea of this PR is to add a name to Monod documents so that we can avoid to give them a name when bookmarking them and also it should be unfurled in Slack That would be a huge improvement while searching info within Slack TODO x Basic feature Make it work in Slack Add tests Refactor document update maybe in a separate PR Hey do you think you still need to use custom version of offlineplugin Output of the CSS build WARNING Contrast ratio of f f f on fefefe is pretty bad

mechanism is currently broken with monod when a middleclick occurs the caret is moved at the cursor position and nothing more happens same as a left click I would expect the current X selection to be pasted at the cursor location and the caret not to move Tested on FreeBSD with Firefox Purpose Keep track of all the documents edited by a particular user Proposal A separate tab like hackmdio with a link to each document opened history When When designing a large table with many columns Outcome The PDF export through CTRLP doesnt respect the document scale and tables are cut off at the right margin A scroll bar appears but of course cannot be used in the PDF printpdf The table is scaled properly in the live rendering rendering This is not the case for plain text where too long lines are properly wrapped Environment Linux Debian stretch Chromium Monod version ff b d Template no template When When reducing one of the panel to go from a split view of the code and rendered document to a single panel or the other way around the cursor is not at the correct position Outcome Clicking in the text to position the cursor will end up writing on the line below above This only appears until some text is typed in The cursor can then be moved to a correct location by clicking in the text again Environment Linux Debian stretch Chromium Monod version ff b d Template no template For the last few months Ive been using a monod document to keep my daily journal Today I tried to load it up and was told We were unable to decrypt the document Either the secret has not been supplied or it is invalid We have redirected you to a new document The link I was using was a link that did include the secret that I have inside another monod document and it has worked consistently in the past When it failed I searched through my browser history to find the link as I used it in the past It failed in the same way I am now unable to access my journal which is pretty distressing All of the links to other monod documents that I have tried continue to work The document is removed the secret since Im posting to a public github issue
