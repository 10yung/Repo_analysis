Hi First I have to admit this is amazing However it seems that the app doesnt recognize this markdown when other markdown such as books would work Is it normal Any clue why Any chance that it would work with the app in the future Thanks and keep up the great work add a new user I would love it if the suffix could support strings of length greater than eg if I want to show that the bars maximum is and not I wouldve used out of as a suffix I hope this fixes There is a limit of for how big the progress value can be While I see that it can be a good thing to have such a limit I would appreciate if it could be made larger For my project would be enough but maybe even would be a suitable limit Background I have a project where my progress goal is over When my progress passed I was happy about that until I saw that the progress can no longer be displayed So this does not work Progress of tests passed I have a workaround but it feels a bit clunky and I would like do be able to use my actual numbers directly Progress of tests passed Progress of tests passed Id like to give you a PR about more parameters support like following but forgive me stupid that I cant even run the codes that you provided Maybe I will study Scala someday but Ill show you my idea because thats simple to implements them if you like them color request a fixed color no mater what progress is it suffix suffix is not support empty now but sometime users may need show without or other chars text a text param is for replacing the progress number like draw as but show text instead of not like title width a fixed width to draw I have no idea if this feature already exist but the bar is too short for my purpose if you could customize if the user could choose length of the bar that would be amazing Hi I used progressedio in one of my markdown scripts Its nice but its not showing negative or floating point numbers Example Progress Progress Progress
