profile of pasting the screenshot Details Trix version Browser name and version Safari Operating system iOS I ran into the problem described in this PR I think the solution in my PR should add the nested code tags as it worked locally Im not as familiar with coffeescript however and so am not entirely sure if this is the best approach would be great to get a second opinion on this actually Essentially this treats the code tags as a list item nested beneath the pre tags Ive updated the tests to take the new tag into account I noticed the following test would fail in an unrelated way it returned quote tags but expected code tags so Ive changed this as well I will see if this passes in Travis and try to change it back if it doesnt Block formatting backspace selection spanning and entire formatted block and a formatted block It would be cool to allow the user to highlight parts of the text and comment on them Im not sure how to do this in the current implementation of trixeditor The main suggested way forward here was to do HTML post processing but subsequent edits to the highlighted text would then need to be somehow mirrored back to trixeditor which seems difficult and also no longer takes advantage of trixs document updating implementation If this could be baked into the original editor that would be great but also happy to be walked through some suggestions on implementing this When I enable the attribute href with a link on some segment of text is there a way to allow the user to click on this text to travel to the page Currently it seems like the trixeditor eats my onclick events Thanks Same issue as but still occuring in When you use an input element to load stored HTML and it has an unordered list in it any text that comes after the
