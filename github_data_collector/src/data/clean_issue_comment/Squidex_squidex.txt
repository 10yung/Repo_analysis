My goal here is to be able to have a separate solution for my custom code from the squidex solution It will be needed to publish a new nuget package with every new version of Squidex SquidexExtensionsDependencies It will be needed to edit the dockercompose files to include a volume on the plugins folder eg current volume is etcsquidexassetsappAssets and new volume would be etcsquidexpluginsplugins Im not sure its a good thing to place the plugins folder in the root directory but Im also not sure its good to put it beside the ts files in app
