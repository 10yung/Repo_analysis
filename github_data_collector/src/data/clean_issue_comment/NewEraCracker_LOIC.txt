hello can publish console versions Some Like Tcp Tcpack RSTFIN Dns ICMP ACK Syn SynAck SSDP NTP SNMP CharGEN I was looking at the http request if it were sent to port and the request were shown as unencrypted so i was assuming since a lot of sites are getting SSL on their server then adding HTTPS would be a great idea I was also thinking maybe you should add like a proxy settings for the HTTP methods that would be cool Issue proposed adding SSL support It should be possible when IRC Library is updated A new version is available here This issue will now be used to track progress on changes Hey the argument parsing in LOIC is currently inefficient an seems to be dependent on the order of arguments Id like to add libArgument support to LOIC which would allow parsing arguments in a really nice and effortless way I am the author of libArgument and I released it to the public domain so I could integrate its source into LOIC without introducing more external dependencies I could also add the nuget package as a dependency instead of integrating the source into LOIC Just tell me what you think I should be able to provide a pull request within two days it will be good to make support for it into LOIC What about update feature for loic
