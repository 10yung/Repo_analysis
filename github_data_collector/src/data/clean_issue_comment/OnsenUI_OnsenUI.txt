with as much detail as possible Environment Onsen UI Version Framework eg Vue react Framework binding eg vueonsenui reactonsenui Additional libraries eg jQuery Platform eg Android Cordova iOS Safari Windows Chrome cordovaios Encountered problem Outline the behaviour youre seeing and what you would expect to see I build a smartphone app with onsen react on cordova for iOS and Android On all iOS devices I encounter very bad touch sensitivity when tapping on any HTML input or textarea element Meaning you need to tap multiple times times on the inputs to focus them in order to type On Android it works like charm When calling my app via iOS Safari not in the cordova container it also works nice and smooth As a workaround I added touch handlers on the inputs parent elements to extend the hitbox of the inputs This works OK but has horrible side effects on certain devices also new iPhone on iOS I didnt find any similar issue and also nothing in the docs how to use inputs properly for a touch device How to reproduce Write a detailed stepbystep on how to reproduce your issue Setup a sample app with the library versions from above Insert an input field open the app on mobile safari or better build a cordova app and run it on an iOS device I build an application with osen and Angular and after packing on Cordova I am having bad display problem with the following devices IPHONE bad IPHONE bad IPHONE S bad IPHONE S bad IPHONE bad IPHONE bad IPHONE bad IPHONE bad IPad bad IPad AIR bad bad In the devices below it works perfectly ok IPHONE X OK IPHONE XS OK IPHONE XS MAX OK IPHONE

The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

added since postcsspresetenv does not support the apply rule Hi Just something to be aware of If you substitute classbased state for useState in react and attempt to use it to store your routeConfig youll get an outdated version of the route stack resulting in a page stack is empty error and a blank page when trying to pop a page This can be fixed by using a functional state update but its quite a difficult issue to reason out eg this will fail javascript const routeConfig setRouteConfig useStateRouterUtilinit component Home props key home pushPage args pushPageargs const popPage options const config RouterUtilpop routeConfig options setRouteConfigconfig However changing the popPage function to this will work javascript const popPage options setRouteConfigrouteConfig const config RouterUtilpop routeConfig options return config Bumps angular from to details summaryChangelogsummary Sourced from angulars changelog pollutioneradication Bug Fixes angularmerge do not merge proto
