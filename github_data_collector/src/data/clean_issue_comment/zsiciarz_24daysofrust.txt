The method fromfile for Writer from BurntSushis CSV crate has been deprecated a while ago and replaced by frompath As a relatively new person to Rust this kind of got me stuck with the presented examples for writing into a CSV file until I dug into the documentation Instead of let dollarfilms vec A Fistful of Dollars Rojo For a Few Dollars More El Indio The Good the Bad and the Ugly Tuco let path westernscsv let mut writer Writerfromfilepathunwrap for row in dollarfilms writerencoderowexpectCSV writer error The following works just fine using the current version of CSV crate let dollarfilms vec A Fistful of Dollars Rojo For a Few Dollars More El Indio The Good the Bad and the Ugly Tuco let path westernscvs let mut writer Writerfrompathpathunwrap for row in dollarfilms writerwriterecord rowexpectCSV writer error writerflush bo brakuje dobrych stron o ruscie dayspostgres dayspostgresblog Hey thanks for writing up these tutorials I found that using the autounmount option with FUSE was a real timesaver in development since it lets you c the program and then rerun it without running a separate fusermount u path in between It doesnt seem to be documented very well and this is probably the best introduction to the crate so it might be nice to demonstrate its use in this book fusemountJsonFilesystem mountpoint oautounmountasref Tracked in the serde branch Waiting for It may be worth switching now that serde is so popular See json The package you mentioned already says that they implement In that regard that wording is misleading Note that I said some variation CSV itself isnt standardized and there are lots of quirks in different implementations That being said I understand what you mean there are many implementations which just dont follow the RFC and provide a naive implementation which does not handle delimeters or escape characters properly
