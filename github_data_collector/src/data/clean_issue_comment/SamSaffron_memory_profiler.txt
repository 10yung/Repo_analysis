Using MemoryProfilerstart on one of our jobs and then waiting to dump MemoryProfilestop prettyprint took a job that uses gb of memory to gb of memory Is there a way we can prevent this kind of memory usage Even running memory profiler for a few short seconds causes it to jump to exponential levels Followup on I believe why calling it times seemed to work is that it increase the chances to trigger a fullmark but if its the intent might as well as for it directly Please correct me if Im wrong SamSaffron william Allocated is usually not all that important to optimize and the output is really verbose so option to cut it in half would be much appreciated especially since theres no simple grep can get the more relevant part hi guys i have a problem on youtubedlrb gem when i want download a big video gb from youtube my ram is crashed i have gb ram on server because after download video i see ram graph and up to gb after download again ram up to and again and as a result server crashed now i use memoryprofiler gem this awesome but after download video ram up to mb and again mb and again up to and again crashed also after complete download ram buffer not start to flush buffer I noticed today I also updated my Gems today so it might be related That memoryprofiler now reports its own footprint as a part of the analysis report I believe this wasnt the case before and it creates a false top level analysis metrics See the example here Most of the memory report is actually caused by memoryprofiler Total allocated bytes objects Total retained bytes objects allocated memory by gem memoryprofiler chilihunter app activesupport
