re pod p OAuth The documentation says PKCE support is controlled by the useProofKeyForCodeExchange property and the usepkce key in the settings dictionary It is disabled by default When enabled a new code verifier string is generated for every authorization request I have added let oauth OAuth CodeGrantsettings clientid clientID clientsecret clientSecret authorizeuri tokenuri code grant only redirecturis redirectURL scope scope secretinbody false keychain false usepkce true as OAuth JSON I have no idea where Im supposed to use useProofKeyForCodeExchange and when I search the pods code I cant find either useProofKeyForCodeExchange or usepkce referenced anywhere Im getting the error below after a successful OAuth login and token exchange It seems to happen when the token is being written to the keychain The token never gets persisted It seems like it could be related to code signingpermissions but Im not sure Has anyone else experienced this Im on macOS and its a pretty simple menu bar app Debug OAuth Did exchange code for access true and refresh true tokens Debug OAuth Storing tokens to keychain bar for YNAB loggingpersist cannot open file at line of ae f bar for YNAB loggingpersist osunixc openvardbDetachedSignatures Undefined error Warn OAuth Failed to store tokens to keychain Error Domainswiftkeychainerror Code null Since iOS ASWebAuthenticationSession requires that a presentation context is provided in order to present the authentication UI This context ASWebPresentationAnchor is typealiased to UIWindow on iOS This PR implements the necessary provider by returning the authorizeContext from OAuath Config I also return the errorasOAuth Error in the completion handler as without it the web authentication session was failing silently on iOS Added to WatchOS target using swift PM but getting Use of unresolved identifier OAuth AuthorizerOAuth CustomAuthorizer error OAuth SourcesFlowsOAuth swift Use of unresolved identifier OAuth Authorizer OAuth SourcesFlowsOAuth PasswordGrantswift Use of unresolved identifier OAuth CustomAuthorizer We have just uploaded one of our apps with p OAuth to AppStoreConnect and got the following warning from Apple We identified one or more issues with a recent delivery for your app Your delivery was successful but you may wish to correct the following issues in your next delivery ITMS Deprecated API Usage Apple will stop accepting submissions of apps that use UIWebView APIs See for more information After you ve corrected the issues you can use Xcode or Application Loader to upload a new binary to App Store Connect A quick Xcode search found that the only usage of UIWebView in our app was in p OAuth We currently use version Is it possible to leverage the new Swift Codeable JSONDecoder with responseJSON In the password grant username and password should not be persisted in memory after using tryCredentialsusernamepassword In the case of short lived accessrefresh tokens the grant instance uses the username and password persisted in memory to request a new access token instead of presenting the login controller for the user to reenter credentials The client should not persist these for future use according to RFC Even though this grant type requires direct client access to the resource owner credentials the resource owner credentials are used for a single request and are exchanged for an access token This grant type can eliminate the need for the client to store the resource owner credentials for future use by exchanging the credentials with a longlived access token or refresh token Debug OAuth Forgetting tokens and removing them from keychain Warn OAuth Failed to delete tokens from keychain Error Domainswiftkeychainerror Code null still not working for me if any one have solution please send me I tried to add p OAuth via Xcode s new SPM support That didnt work because SwiftKeychain So I created this PR and Seems to work Greetings I have a request With all of the updates with Swift and Alamofire I was wondering if we might get an updated example of the retrier for Alamofire Thanks Mark
