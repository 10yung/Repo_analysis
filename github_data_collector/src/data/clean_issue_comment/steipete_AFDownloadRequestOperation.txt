found if i got wrong url the failureBlock cannot callback because of the selferror is set by superresponseObject Changing import to allow AFDownloadRequestOperation to be built as a framework This method was not implemented so caused a compiler error Im using AFDownloadRequestOperation on my project but when it receives HTTP status Requested Range Not Satisfiable the success block is being called So I created this fix every time responseObject is accessed it validates the response using the default responseSerializer which checks acceptable HTTP status codes Adding to that I removed acceptableStatusCodes method that is not called on AFNetworking I hope this helps he setter of targetPath and do all the stuff related to targetPath in the custom setter instead of initializer overriding the designated initializer of superclass I am still thinking on the best place to assert targetPath nil before the operation is enqueued
