I am using the transform with this setup update tasks transform normalize updateinterfaces path Wynton defaultToBase true ignoreEmptyStrings true unstripped false updatecode codePath Wynton localizablePath defaultToKeys true additive false unstripped false updatetransform codePath Wynton localizablePath WyntonLocalization transformer swiftgenStructured supportedLanguageEnumPath WyntonLocalization typeName BartyCrouch translateMethodName translate updatenormalize path WyntonLocalization sourceLocale en harmonizeWithSource true sortByKeys false lint path WyntonLocalization duplicateKeys true emptyValues true Now when i create new localized text like this textViewtext BartyCrouchtranslatekey something went wront translations english Something went wrong comment Something went wrong message bla bla Then this value only shows up in the english translation But is it possible to make a default text to all other languages or to use the base langauge like en here for all languages For QA its a bit strange if the text is empty and not something obviously wrong Because if they test the app then they just dont see a label eg and think the screen is fine But if there would be a default string like untranslated or just the english translation eg in an chinese app then they would instantly see that something is buggynot yet translated Is there a way to set a default string when generating a new entry in the strings files Support strings to ignore in the translation Ex May want to not translate certain substrings in a localization like Company Name Person Name swiftVar d etc This could also potentially be accomplished by allowing the developer to extend the beforeafter parse of the translation Ex give a callback function for the string before it is translated for mutation andor a callback function for the string after it is translated Thanks for any help I use a Pod called MapboxGeocoderswift When running BartyCrouch this seems to break the update code task since extractLocStrings thinks the folder is a file bartycrouch update Starting Task Update Interfaces ABCBaselprojSubscriptionViewControllerxib Successfully updated strings files of

interfaces code translate updatetranslate path secret XXX sourceLocale en A lot of custom project setups contain Different targets in root folder Frameworks External included subprojects git submodules and so on With this config all of them are scanned updatecode codePath Instead of adding support for multiple pathes like mentioned here Use multiple codePath locations I would prefer another approach The git ignore way If one could either add an empty bcignore file to each folder that shouldnt be scanned recursively OR add a bcignore file at root level with pathes to be ignored Is there any way to set multiple codePath locations My project structure looks like this Project FrameworkA FrameworkB App Pod I want bartycrouch to update the localization file in APP and include the folders FrameworkA and FrameworkB but the Pod should be ignored Is this possible It didnt find a working solution Happens every time I build I have to perform a clean build folder before building in

installed download it from fi When theres no comment extractlocstrings will generate entries like No comment provided by engineer all over the place These comments should be removed by default on normalization There might even be an option to remove comments alltogether I have an app which supports Siri Shortcuts therefore I have a intentdefinition file This file is also translated but it looks like BartyCrouch ignores this file Handling long list of arguments for extractLocStrings by writing them in a arguments plist file This solves errors that causes crash with Exception Couldnt posixspawn error Fixes FlinesoftBartyCrouch This PR with minor modifications can also fix FlinesoftBartyCrouch
