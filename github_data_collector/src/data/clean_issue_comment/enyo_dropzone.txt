Question is there any option for minimum upload file in dropzone parameters currently I just found the maxFile Thanks I cant figure about what i should pass to this method to get everything work Now I have let mock name itemoriginalname size itemsize dataUrl itemrelativeurl type itemmimetype drop dropzoneaddFilemock and have folowing errors Uncaught TypeError Failed to execute readAsDataURL on FileReader parameter is not of type Blob at DropzonecreateThumbnail dropzoneamdmodulejs at DropzoneprocessThumbnailQueue dropzoneamdmodulejs at dropzoneamdmodulejs Uncaught TypeError Failed to execute append on FormData parameter is not of type Blob at DropzoneuploadData dropzoneamdmodulejs at dropzoneamdmodulejs at dropzoneamdmodulejs at DropzonetransformFile dropzoneamdmodulejs at loop dropzoneamdmodulejs at DropzonetransformFiles dropzoneamdmodulejs at DropzoneuploadFiles dropzoneamdmodulejs at DropzoneprocessFiles dropzoneamdmodulejs at DropzoneprocessFile dropzoneamdmodulejs at DropzoneprocessQueue dropzoneamdmodulejs Uncaught TypeError Failed to execute readAsDataURL on FileReader parameter is not of type Blob at DropzonecreateThumbnail dropzoneamdmodulejs at DropzoneprocessThumbnailQueue dropzoneamdmodulejs at dropzoneamdmodulejs I want to give users the possibility to choose a different file after they already have chosen one In its default state only the space around the thumbnail is clickable and allows a new file selection I know how to make the thumbnail clickable but I dont know how to make that click open the file explorer again Is this even possible In init i will be setting following var mockFile name dataimagename size photoIddataid dzClosurefilespush mockFile dzClosureoptionsaddedfilecalldzClosure mockFile dzClosureoptionsthumbnailcalldzClosure mockFile it works fine The problem is when i upload multiple files to server and after success if i click remove file then i dont get name of the server file and photoid Is there an option to set image name and additional mockfile detail upon success of file Hi I have been trying to pause my overridden Dropzoneconfirm in an attempt to eliminate the ugly native browser confirm dialog but nothing works the only way I can pause the execution for a cancel upload confirm is to stick a native browser confirm in Dropzoneconfirm and that pretty much defeats the purpose of this I am sure the intention of Dropzoneconfirm was to allow the use of things like bootboxjs or others or even bootsrap modals Maybe for the next version make the confirm event a promise like they do with fine uploader Hello I am using Dropzonejs to upload files in my application using chunked uploading with a Nodejs background Locally everything works fine but in production uploads are extremely slow If I upload chunks one by one it is really slow and if I use parallel uploading it completely blocks for large files Any idea of what could cause this difference between development and production Thanks I setup Dropzone according to the docs and it keeps trying to make a GET request to the page it is setup on Not clue why this is happening as Im using basically completely barebones div iddropzone classdropzone div options url thishttpdefaultsbaseURLuploads withCredentials true maxFiles I see many topicsthreadsdetails on ways to fix the exif issue but nothing Ive tried works Maybe Im doing it wrong or missing something easy Can someone provide the steps to implement and where to change the code Thanks I want to get the queue length after the user has finished adding files Im able to do this with the undocumented addedfiles but it only works correctly if the user adds files with the file picker If user drags drops then addedfiles is called before addedfile and the returned queue length is zero Think this is same issue but doesnt look like it was ever merged I am using dropzone dropzone uploading and removing functionality is working but show an error Error Dropzone already attached this error effecf on my js functionality another page i m getting uploaded image on my server but dropzone is not show image on my dropzone only show image url SyntaxError redeclaration of var Emitter this error show on this Screenshot Mission Bol Add Kalyanmitra
