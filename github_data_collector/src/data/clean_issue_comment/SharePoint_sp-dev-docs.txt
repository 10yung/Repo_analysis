According to the answer given by andrewconnell in the manually created manifestjson should be used when syncing the SPFX app to Teams Observed Behavior It seems the default manifest is still being used Steps to Reproduce Upload a SPFX webpart with a custom manifestjson file located inside the teamsfolder Sync it to teams via the ribbon button Additional thoughts According to this documentation I have to manually upload to zipped package to take advantage of the custom manifestjson Is this the way we should provide an app to teams for now Will there be an update to the sync process to use the custom manifest Category x Question Typo Bug Additional article idea Expected or Desired Behavior When calling REST endpoint for creating a folder in custom team site it should be created response code should be Observed Behavior When I called the REST endpoint I got Forbidden with Access denied error message Steps to Reproduce I have register a sharepoint app in following URL In there we have to provide permission and the scope for my app following is the permission I have provided AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicytrue AppPermissionRequest Scope RightFullControl AppPermissionRequests following is the endpoint Im trying to access following is the JSON body Im setting in the Postman metadata typeSPFolder ServerRelativeUrlsitesTeamSiteForBShared DocumentstestFolder following is the error response Im getting error code SystemUnauthorizedAccessException message lang enUS value Access denied You do not have permission to perform this action or access this resource Queries I have Above REST endpoint which Im trying to access is it correct what is SCOPE for accessing custom team site in sharepoint online I have raise the full detailed question in sharepoint stackexchange as well If above not clear please look into the following URL Category Question Typo x Bug Additional article idea Expected or Desired Behavior Building a SharePoint Framework package containing multiple web parts no other types of components One or more web parts have a long name Building bundling packaging and uploading to Tenant app catalog as we have done times before Clicking yes to tenant wide deployment Hitting Sync to Teams button in Ribbon menu Seeing a small notification that the package was synced successfully Web parts should now be available in the associated Team Observed Behavior Following all the above steps from to works a charm but when performing step the following happens The network panel in Chromes web developer tools show the request as returning a Bad request with no explanation whatsoever I found out after way too much investigation and testing that the culprit is the Web part manifests which have a preconfiguredEntries titledefault that is over chars in length Steps to Reproduce Example web part configuration that will lead to this bug Improvement or bugfix Could we get a more verbose message than Bad request I am hoping that others can save some time by me submitting this as the documentation is not very specific from the SharePoint side that this is a requirement Either this or notice it in the Web part documentation or in the schema file The following documentation for creating Teams manifests for Web parts manually led me to find the error but nowhere does SharePoint Web part development mention that this is an issue I noticed that the create site does not work when I pass in STS when I try to create a team site Also the Topic value should be c ac c f a fd d af e not NULL
