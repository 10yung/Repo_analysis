Was working fine and then after a computer restart the program has seemingly broke Upon trying to launch PIDtoolbox the splash screen opens a windows error sound plays then it freezes and goes to Program not responding before the whole thing exits No changes have been made between computer restarts so I see no reason as to why it doesnt launch Im not sure if there is anyway I can get crasherror messages Edit v appears to open fine Its just v Would it be possible to add the capability to process multiple files at once then dump the resulting stepresponse to a GIF file Example Spent the last two days making that and Im really close to the ideal Servo PIDs Thanks in advance RS When ever i try to dump a log to desktop and import it into Toolbox i get an error saying that it doesnt have the required permissions Even in admin compatibility mode However if i dump the files into a folder held on the Desktop I can load process it as normal Hi Im developing a bot for plastmatree which uses that tool and telegram bot api to convert log files This is kind useful for pilots who doesnt own a laptop dont want or cant bring a laptop to the field I was taking a look at your work to make another bot to integrate it and I got some doubts I see that the bot runs on matlab and draws matlab windows to show the output right I was wondering if it could be possible to output that same windows to an image directly that way i can run it on my ubuntu server and send the images back to the users That would be awesome Thanks Very useful to catch differences in a quick way Thanks Currently pidtoolbox remembers the last working directory AFTER pidtoolbox is closed I keep pidtoolbox open until it either crashes or gets closed inadvertently In the time it is open I usually jump between log directories when analyzing multiple quads It would be nice if when loadrun is pressed that it checks if fileA or fileB is loaded and then remember the working directory If fileA is loaded and fileB is empty remember the working directory of where fileA is when loadrun is executed If fileA is loaded and fileB is loaded then remember the working directory of fileB since pidtoolbox still crashes if trying to load two files from different directories If fileB is loaded and fileA is empty remember the working directory of where fileB is when loadrun is executed If fileA same file but fileB has changed or vice versa then remember the working directory of the changed file Hi I tried to analyse a BF Log NameVersion Bin r betaflight MAMBAF hex Datum The csv is created and PTB reads it and the progress bar disappears but then PTB just hangs Tried a older Log on the same computer and works fine Regards Jan Mac os X Ive got some errors during install which is And another one kinda like this After those two I got Installation successfull message After finished installation there is an empty folder PIDToolbox in Applications When I run the program from Downloads folderor copying contents of main folder to created empty folder in Applications it is stocking on Also I have installed MATLAB Runtine R b downloaded from MATLABs site Completely stocked but very interested in trying this Would be quite useful to have a possibility of choosing time as Xaxis in the spectrogram Ie having distribution of frequencies in a signal by small timeframes This would help me a lot in analyzing the frequencies of gyro noise in my setup Thanks a lot for the useful tool Most likely Im missing something so consider this more like request for comment or tip for a topic in the documentation When comparing Dterm unfilt vs Dterm with Hz checkboxes checked I see both peak and mean are larger on filtered graph compared to unfiltered Filtered indeed looks worse overall too How shall I interpret this Is this due to normalisation Why this does not happened for Gyro spectrograms A bonus question on Dterm data if I may Where Dterm unfiltered data comes from I have debug set to GYROSCALED does it log Dterm too Cant see that debug field in Betaflight Blackbox Explorer img width altOddDtermspectrogram src BBLzip
