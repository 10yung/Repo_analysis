Background Information Build should be unrelated WSL Arch Version current Describe the bug The new baseexecgen function which has to succeed at least once To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Install a nonstore Distro using wsldl or wsl import Install wslu in that Distro Run any wslu command wslvar wslview wslupath wslsys wslfetch wslusc and wslsys are all affected See error messages appear related to a registry key and some path executables listed by find From what I can tell the commands then proceed to function correctly despite this function failing Expected behavior A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen wslu commands to function as normal without error messages Additional context Add any other context about the problem here The current baseexecgen in the header expects a registry key called PackageFamilyName to be present for the current Distro which doesnt seem to be created for Distros installed manually instead of through the store Also within that function the first call to regexe doesnt fully qualify the path which may cause issues if these commands are run during login before PATH is fully set up This is the pull request for the release of wslu memo Documentation TODO sparkles New Features TODO boom Breaking Changes TODO bug Bug Fixes TODO This will be the first component of wslu written in C Thus it will be developed in a dedicated repo Update as more I think about it it is better to write it as a Windows Desktop app to manage all system at once instead of just each command per system Also put on the store Background Information Build version WSL Pengwin Version Describe the bug xwwwbrowser command has problem with tcgetpgrp and It looks like tcgetpgrp problem But when I checked the internet it shows it is an old bug and It was fixed To Reproduce I ran jupyter lab it should open localhost link for auth Expected behavior xwwwbrowser should work Additional context To confirm it is actually coming from your xwwwbrowser img width altbug src First picture with windows interoperability img width altbug src Second picture has no windows interoperability and basically no tcgetpgrp problem appeared If there is anything needed I would love to provide it Thank you the Cygwin project has this tool which opens a FILE with the default application it seems the closest match is wslview but only works with URLs not local files
