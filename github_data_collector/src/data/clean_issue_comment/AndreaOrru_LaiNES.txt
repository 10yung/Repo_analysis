Im going to change it into a twoplayeronlinegameCould you give me some advice BRK is a twobyte instruction so PC is incremented twice before being pushed not just once Sources and blaggrs instrtestv Hi I fix some bug and make menu support scroll Hi maybe Im wrong if so sorry for that but I cant find the two extra circles if a branch goes to a new ram page see should this templateFlag f bool v void br s j rdimm if P f v T PC j be maybe something like this templateFlag f bool v void br s j rdimm if P f v T ifcrossPC j TT PC j Thank you Is this a known issue libincludeBlipBufferh void BlipBufferendframebliptimet Assertion BlipBufferendframe Frame went past end of buffer samplesavail long buffersize failed It happens here x fffed d in BlipBufferendframe this x fffed ce c APUbuf t at libincludeBlipBufferh x fffed e in APUrunframe elapsed at srcapucpp x fffed da d in CPUrunframe at srccpucpp For context I was working on a libretro port of your emulator core but I do not think that is the issue here The frame count is always at when this crash happens Im testing with SMB World Hi there appears to be a global buffer overflow caused by line here Because n is allowed to be the next loop iteration where n overflows the secOam buffer because it can only hold elements Steps to reproduce Build OS X version open lines and open a directory with rom files try going to the last one Result while it does select the rom it wont show it on screen so you have no idea which rom you picked This should add support for onescreen mirroring as well as mapper support AxROM However something is quite wrongthe mapper is pretty simple so I think this exposes some other weaknesses particularly with the PPU Not sure though Ive been wrong before Partially addresses Is a Windows build an eventual goal of LaiNES This is an absolute priority in order to remove the dependency from boost and Blarggs stuff
