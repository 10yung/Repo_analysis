when I run stinfo probe I am running Catalina No USB device was added to dev so maybe I am missing a driver The hardware is from Amazon initeq STM ARM STM F C T Blue Pill Minimum System Development Board with STLink V USB Programmer Pack STLink V Would anyone know how to resolve this I looked for infodrivers but did not find anything stinfo was built manually from git Thanks so much for your help Itamar Thanks a lot for stlink I started to make myself a little bit more familiar with the software structure I added a document developertxt and some comments here and there Of course still a lot more could be done Maybe it is useful to others especially because you look for a new maintainer There no code changes in this pull request just comments I have a fix X Programmerboard type

got it to work with the following changes First I renamed STLINKCHIPIDSTM G X STLINKCHIPIDSTM G X and added STLINKCHIPIDSTM G X to better reflect the large vs small chips The larger G X includes the G G and G while the smaller G X includes the G G and G Then I updated the description fields in stlinkchipidparams devices Then I added an entry to the devices array to match the G X parameters Then I added an OR to the slchipid checks in stlinkwriteoptionbytes to allow the new G X part Now I get the following output srcgdbserverstutil stutil g de T INFO commonc Loading device parameters T INFO

Thank you The stlink project maintainers STM L has single bit word with all needed options I just works STM L is a bit more complicated There are two bit words to modify Sometimes you need to change only one When reprogramming a device with RDP level you only have to change RDP to everything else is erased But even with RDP you cant reflash large code while IWDGSW is cleared So Ive decided to
