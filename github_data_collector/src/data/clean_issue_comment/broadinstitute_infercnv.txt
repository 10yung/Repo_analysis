When comparing the last part of chromosomes the higher matrix data value is observed in observation than in reference and more is amplified in infer graph Can you tell me why the precnvregionsdat and I HMM Bayesian intensities are there more amplified in references The last chromosome has about geniuses Can you do that because its too small In summary the infercnv graph and HMMintensities graph of the last chromosome had conflicting results thank you Hi I performed run and addtoseurat It was successful but I couldnt understand the columns of the metadata I read but Im sure what each column represents Is there any explanation available Thanks hascnvchr haslosschr hasduplichr proportioncnvchr proportionlosschr proportionduplichr proportionscaledcnvchr proportionscaledlosschr proportionscaledduplichr toploss toploss toploss I run infercnv separately for each patient using the same reference genome and cells After that I need to merger the infercnv objects Is there any

infercnvobj obsdata obsdata Error I have only cells and features But the step has run for hours and it seems that it gets stuck in this step Any ideas or suggestions Here is the screenshot Now I am running the new version of infercnv and there are so many intermediate results I dont want to save those results so I was wondering which parameter I should set to stop the infercnv outputs the intermediate results and only output the final result to save my space inferCNV can generate the final heatmap with only one annotation bar but I wonder if I could add another annotation bar and how Hi I am using inferCNV for my data set I have given groups as references And three groups as observations infercnvobj infercnvruninfercnvobj cutoff analysismode subclusters outdirResults denoiseTRUE HMMTRUE clusterbygroupsTRUE tumorsubclusterpval I can see final heatmap is fine groups has been represented as References and groups as observations But when I checked following text file HMMCNVpredictionsHMMi randtreeshmmmodesubclustersPnorm predcnvgenesdat HMMCNVpredictionsHMMi randtreeshmmmodesubclustersPnorm predcnvregionsdat I have found cnv has been reported in all references groups also How is it possible Hi Using the infercnv Would like to know how numrefgroups affects final results With same set of sample cells and reference cells I tried diff numrefgroups results looked so different numrefgroups infercnv numrefgroups infercnv Why the reference heatmap looks different In numrefgroups case it seems that there are several cnv blocks for example chr and chr Based on those blocks I decided using reference groups because this is what it looks like on the heatmap However these cnv blocks are gone after using numrefgroups Am I correct to use numrefgroups or there are some better way to judge whether I did things correctly Why final results looked so different using different numrefgroups Thank you very much Hey I trid to run the program by following commands
