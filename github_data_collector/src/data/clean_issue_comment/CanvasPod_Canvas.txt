 canvas Hi When the view loads ie after segue from previous VC the animations have almost already completed I tried changing the delay but it didnt work I want the animations to happen after the view has appeared Any help here Thanks Hello first of all thank you for the extraordinary work you do I have a question if you allow Canvas manages subscriptions and online sales a training group for a user of such date on such date if not what is complicated to put it in place Thank you I have a button where I want it to animate FIRST THEN go the second view but the button goes straight to the second view controller even though I put animViewstartCanvasAnimation in my IBAction I even tried to transform to the second view programmatically but it didnt work Please Help hello I first tested canvas it worked I loved the animation then I added swrevealview controller for my menu bar and now my animation is not working I spent several hours looking for a solution I ran the install multiple times and each time it could not find the Canvasframework or the podMYAPPframework or Foundationframework files I installed the git repository I edited gitignore I edited my podfile etc Please look into this issue I had to find another solution for animating my buttons and wasted a lot of time on this I also had to recode my entire application since it would be faster to do this than to try to fix all the config issues created by installing pods in my project Add comments to code for developers for example explain how to use methods in CSAnimationh and CSAnimationViewh It would be helpful for getting a better idea of how canvas works without having to read your code should modify the podfile add the target line target Canvas do pod DAKeyboardControl pod Canvas path Canvaspodspec pod URBMediaFocusViewController end Hi I install Canvas framework in my project however i cant import canvas module into ViewController
