Add rightFirstTrigger rightSecondTrigger leftFirstTrigger and leftSecondTrigger properties to MCSwipeTableViewCell to make Different swipe percentages for left vs right possible This fix is backward compatible and you can still use firstTrigger and secondTrigger properties Fixing up some warnings no big deal screen shot at pm This feature helps not swipe separator for example or other elements on cell Delegate of MCSwipeTableViewCell property nonatomic assign id MCSwipeTableViewCellDelegate delegate Change viewlayer renderInContextUIGraphicsGetCurrentContext To view drawViewHierarchyInRectviewbounds afterScreenUpdatesYES It runs much faster From my tests on my app it went from s to Heres is a better explanation on possible choices and it has a link to why it is better It will be more awesome if we can have more than one action buttons on swiping Eg Instagram comment cell which on swipe provides multiple action buttons eg Reply Delete Report etc Instead of setting the default color on the cell itself allow customizing the default color for each swipe This is useful if you have more than one swipe gesture on a single cell eg a left and a right swipe and you want to show the same color background whether the trigger point has been reached or not
