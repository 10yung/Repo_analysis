Some weeks ago my rolling release distro delighted me with PHP As I could find some hints that you already adopted some parts of your nice software to this php version Id like to point out another issue which seems to be related to some Backward Incompatible Changes according to the php documentation When trying to sync my database by vdirsyncer Im faced with the above mentioned error The log

www usrsharenginxhtmlbaikalhtmldavphp Baikal Core Serverstart Could someone please help me with this issue Thanks in advance flart I use the python caldavpackage in a python script to request events from an calendar hosted on an baikal server I try to request events in a time interval with start and stop date a The script works fine with other calDAVserver b The script works well with a baikalhosted caldavcalendar created with ios c The script works fine with a baikalhosted calendar created by a baikaluser via browser d the script detects the err on calendars created by the baikaladmin via adminsite I noticed that in case b there is a calcalendartimezone property with an valid setting In case c there is no property calcalendartimezone and in case d there is an empty calcalendartimezonesetting So far it looks like bug But i belive that the server is fine and the baikal admintool is buggy I cant offer a proposal because i cant PHP But i would prefer a patch that supports the user with no information instead of wrong information Thanks for your support MM Baikal version x Please fill out the following checklist Replace the empty checkboxes below with checked
