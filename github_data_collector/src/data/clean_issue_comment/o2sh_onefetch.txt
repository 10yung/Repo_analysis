Case in point I use automatically generated documentation which is a whole bunch of html files so onefetch thinks my project is about html I know I can specify a language via the a switch but it still seems like a fairly easy change to avoid this It is very common to include documentation in doc or docs or documentation so I suggest ignoring these directories when determining the projects language It looks like onefetch c uses BrightBlack for both colors even though it actually doesnt onefetch b c properly looks like it uses Black for primary color and BrightBlack for secondary color This appears to be a limitation with ANSI since echo e e mBlack e m and echo e e mBrightBlack e m both look the same in xterm Perhaps the bold flag should default to off instead of on Or at least some warning in the help message for c regarding this Not sure the best way to fix this would be but users are being limited to half of the available color options This PR aims to add a GitHub Action that automatically creates a PR in the homebrewhomebrewcore repository that updates the Formula I dont really know if there is a great way to test this without publishing releases manually now Also we should figure out which HOMEBREWGITHUBAPITOKEN we should provide as I dont think the githubactionsbot has enough permissions to create a PR in another repository Figure out the right API token x Test the workflow Please add jupyter notebook ipb support bash git clone Cloning into neuroinversekinematic remote Enumerating objects done remote Total delta reused delta packreused Unpacking objects done gosha n projectstmp cd neuroinversekinematic gosha n projectstmpneuroinversekinematic onefetch gosha git version Project neuroinversekinematic HEAD fac c master originmaster Version Created months ago Language Markdown Author Georgy Perevozchikov Last change months ago Repo Commits Lines of code Size bytes files License or bash gosha n projectstmp git clone Cloning into lacmus remote Enumerating objects done remote Counting objects done remote Compressing objects done remote Total delta reused delta packreused Receiving objects MiB MiBs done Resolving deltas done gosha n projectstmp cd lacmus gosha n projectstmplacmus onefetch gosha git version Project lacmus HEAD d de master originmaster tags Version Created months ago Languages C Python C Markdown Shell XML Authors Georgy Perevozchikov gosha Andrew Grigorev Last change days ago Repo Commits Lines of code Size MiB files License GPL only examlpe repos shows wrong version probably due this configuration I would be great if you can add support for V projects I made a test on the old repo and got some weird result bash git clone cd wppluginsdeploy onefetch Project wppluginsdeploy HEAD cde master origindevelop originmaster Version Created years months ago Language Shell Author Oleg Butuzov Last change days ago Repo Commits Lines of code Size bytes files License its GPL and files arent empty find name sh xargs wc l wpdeployfunctionssh wpdeployoptionssh wpdeploysh total mac and brewed onefetch OS Debian x x Version official binary RUSTBACKTRACEfull onefetch d pathtomygitrepo thread main panicked at called Optionunwrap on a None value srclibcoreoptionrs stack backtrace x aae b backtracebacktracelibunwindtraceh fcc e e bc b at cargoregistrysrcgithubcom ecc db ec backtrace srcbacktracelibunwindrs x aae b backtracebacktracetraceunsynchronizedh bad be e a at cargoregistrysrcgithubcom ecc db ec backtrace srcbacktracemodrs x aae b stdsyscommonbacktraceprinthd a f c da at srclibstdsyscommonbacktracers x aae b stdsyscommonbacktraceprinth ec f cfb e a at srclibstdsyscommonbacktracers x aae b stdpanickingdefaulthookclosureh cbf b e f at srclibstdpanickingrs x aadff stdpanickingdefaulthookh a f d at srclibstdpanickingrs x aaea d stdpanickingrustpanicwithhookh f b e f ed at srclibstdpanickingrs x aae stdpanickingcontinuepanicfmth abfbb e b a at srclibstdpanickingrs x aae f rustbeginunwind at srclibstdpanickingrs x ace d corepanickingpanicfmth e f af b at srclibcorepanickingrs x ace bc corepanickingpanichda e f accfb at srclibcorepanickingrs x e e onefetchmainhe f fc x c b stdrtlangstartclosureh d d a x aae stdrtlangstartinternalclosureh e c c a at srclibstdrtrs x aae stdpanickingtrydocallh ccd dc eaa at srclibstdpanickingrs x ab ea rustmaybecatchpanic at srclibpanicunwindlibrs x aaf d stdpanickingtryhc e ee ee f at srclibstdpanickingrs x aaf d stdpaniccatchunwindh dfc c aee at srclibstdpanicrs x aaf d stdrtlangstartinternalhea b a afe at srclibstdrtrs x e main x fe dec e libcstartmain x c da start x unknown
