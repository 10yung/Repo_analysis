Description Every time that I enter Processing in both bit and bit versions the ribbon text and dialog text are complete gibberish Use a title that describes what is happening Give a description of the proposed change Expected Behavior Bug Tell us what you were expecting Improvement Tell us how you d like it to work I was expecting all the ribbon and dialog text to look normal so that i can work easily and navigate efficiently Current Behavior Explain the difference from current behavior All text that is seen on the ribbons and dialogs except the text in the main editor section is corrupted and I cant seem to find a fix for this This issue happens on both bit and bit versions Steps to Reproduce Provide an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce Including code will make it more likely to be fixed Open Processing Wait for it to load up Bam most of the text is corrupted This bug is happening of the time Its strange that this is only happening on my computer I have used Processing on other

visualizer with curved vertecies I found a bug that the when using endShapeCLOSE to end the circle the last and the first vertex are getting closes in a straight line and not like expected in a curved one Expected Behavior Bug Tell us what you were expecting Improvement Tell us how you d like it to work When I use endShapeCLOSE the shape should be closed with a curved line not a straight one Current Behavior Explain the difference from current behavior The shape gets closed with a straight line Steps to Reproduce Provide an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce Including code will make it

Ubuntu Possible Causes Solutions Optionally ideas on how to implement the change Same Bug in P js I found the same bug in the p js Issue page Heres the link This is my first time contributing here so please let me know if theres anything I can do better I was looking through the Processing docs to find the info for a function that I saw someone use in their code but was surprised to find that the cropping capability using the image function had no documentation So this is me trying to include it If this looks good Ill also be opening a pull request in the processingprocessingdocs repo to update the description in the xml ant run error Downloader has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime class file version this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to In documentation to setup project its clearly mentioned that Java is required and thats what I have but the error says that Downloaderclass has class file version of which requires Java to compile Java fullversion java full version b javac fullversion javac full version b I first had a different version of Java but now its java u Shifting to java might work but that would be against documentation How to specify a list of dependencies that have to be installed before developing a sketch I understand that if you export the sketch for others it will include them but is there a Processing equivalent of Pythons pip package manager Right now Im thinking of adding a list of dependencies that they can add through the GUI library installed but it doesnt feel quite right
