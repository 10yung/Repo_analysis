Im using mdbook v Heres the markdown I tried to write Blockquote with included code inside Lorum ipsum dolor sit amet But do included code blocks rust include anotherincludedtestrs By Quote Author And heres the HTML I get when doing mdbook build note the multiple blockquotes Id expect only one opening and one closing h a classheader hrefblockquotewithincludedcodeinside idblockquotewithincludedcodeinsideBlockquote with included code insideah pLorum ipsum dolor sit ametp blockquote pBut do included code blocksp prepre classplaypencode classlanguagerustfn main codeprepre blockquote precodeprintln quotThis is a file quot codepre pp blockquote precode By Quote Author codepre blockquote And a screenshot of this img width altScreen Shot of unexpected rendered HTML src If I use the markdown renderer instead I see that after processing the include the markdown looks like this Blockquote with included code inside Lorum ipsum dolor sit amet But do included code blocks rust fn main printlnThis is a file By Quote Author but the markdown that needs to be generated is this Blockquote with included code inside Lorum ipsum dolor sit amet But do included code blocks rust fn main printlnThis is a file By Quote Author I was going to try to fix this by taking whatever text appears on the same line before the include directive so in this case and then repeating that text before each line of the included file but tests like this one show that inline includes are supported that example would mean Some random text with would be prepended to every included line Limiting the recognized text to something like only would miss cases where theres a blockquote inside a blockquote or a blockquote inside a list or other edge cases Im not thinking of So I dont know how to fix this and Im opening this to see if anyone else has ideas or at least to document that this doesnt work In response to issue cant search chinese maybe its necessary New issue as per At the moment search result highlights can be either removed by editing the page URL or pressing Esc This is a papercut especially but not only on mobile there is no Esc key editing the URL is even more fiddly than it is on a desktop Besides I had only found out about removing highlights with Esc after searching online and stumbling upon Adding a UI element to clear the highlights seems like the most straightforward solution Hi I have searched the document it seemed that there were no any configurations about GFM GitHub Flavored Markdown mode support Does mdBook support GitHub Flavored Markdown mode Thanks WIP not sure if right approach Hi there it has been a while since I contributed sweatsmile For this PR I want to brink back an old feature I miss draft chapters Draft chapters are chapters that dont have any content no file associated with them and only show up in the table of contents They were previously a long time ago supported by mdBook but at some point there was a regression and they were never brought back I found them particularly useful in two situations When I wanted to show that a specific chapter was planned for the future It has no content no file but as it shows up in the TOC users know that I plan to write it When I am playing with the structure of a new book or a series of new chapters In this case as the structure still changes a lot and I only want an overview I dont want the files to be created Having the possibility to first freely map out the structure of the table of contents before worrying about the actual files on disk is a huge advantage to me So with this PR I implemented draft chapters explicitly they are a new kind of item in the summary and book This means that the changes are breaking changes This is what it looks like Screenshotmdbookdraftchapters As you can see in the image Draft chapters can be used wherever a chapter can be used Draft chapters are rendered in the TOC but are not clickable Draft chapters can be the first chapter of the book in that case the index page will be blank Navigation skips over draft chapters It has been a while since I have been involved in the project and since I have actively programmed with Rust so feel free to point out anything that could be improved Grepping all feature doesnt show anything about output feature console git grep F w feature rs srccmdmodrs cfgfeature

now rendering of mathematics is very slow and jarring I believe one solution for this is to render math as MathML or SVG during the build process rather than handling it on the client side Both Mathjax and KaTeX offer this ability albeit in Javascript Node I assume there are rust equivalents for the same I suggest that mathematics be rendered when running the build command
