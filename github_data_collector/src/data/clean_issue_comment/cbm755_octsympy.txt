The vpasolve function only returns one numerical solution out of N possible solutions to a polynomial equation The SMT vpasolve function says that it returns all possible numerical solutions when the input is a polynomial For polynomial equations vpasolve returns all solutions from An example given on the Matlab page is S vpasolve x x x x x and the solution should be a column vector of solutions Ours only returns one solution which is arrived at by nsolve based on an initial guess of Someone wrote to me saying that the examples to get started are in a screenshot and thus not copypastable Should we rename the How to install section to Getting starting Should we have just one screenshot so its not so far to scroll to the text We could make the stepbystep look more like an example eg showing the output People often have trouble getting PythonSymPy working maybe we should point people at sympref diagnose in the README file Other ideas Its currently being deprecated and will continue to work with a warning in In we will drop it note there could be etc for before Im not sure how to report this properly since I just tried to install this a few moments ago Trying to follow the examples it seem to sortof work However when the last UTF character is printed it just prints a garbage symbol and then the CLI prompt become useless Ie doesnt react to any further commands This is the output I get using Octave for Win on Win octavegui BTW How can I check which Python interpreter is used by the SymPy I have installed with SymPy in all of them but havent set any PYTHON var a sym a a should be empty but instead we get an error This picks up the excellent work of genuinelucifer and latot in There is a lot of background and discussion at I merged master into that work Many changes were no longer needed which simplified things I also did not indent the ctor code which means it should be easier to keep this uptodate with master than it was before x merge master periodically not now but before merging reindent the sym and symfun ctor there seem to be some new issues report upstream after checking if they are present in make a list of upstream bugs that need to be fixed before we could merge this x superiorto superiorprecedence with classdef TODO file bug cannot save some indexing stuff grow from nothing xtest TODO if logicalobj seems broken again TODO num cell is broken TODO doctesting broken on Once upstream Octave supports help symassume and help symassume we might consider switching all of seealso documentation to use that form upstream updated to fix url Maybe not now but soon should merge this Originally I thought Id keep it around until pytave matures New upstream sympy allows bold matrix symbols using bold unicode characters Example octave syms a n A symA n n A sym n n matrix expression aA ans sym a This is off by default upstream Im not sure how well this is supported by fonts But heres a possible patch if we wanted this diff ainstprivatepythonheaderpy binstprivatepythonheaderpy try except eg SymPy issue prettyascii strx prettyunicode spprettyx useunicodeTrue prettyunicode spprettyx useunicodeTrue matsymbolstylebold a ETSubElementet item f ETSubElementa f ftext strOCTCODESYM The following snippet A sym V D jordanA causes Octave to hang and after a few minutes outputs the following Waiting error Python exception TypeError Cannot multiply class sympymatricesdenseMutableDenseMatrix and type NoneType occurred at line of the Python code block return Ajordanformcalctrans error called from pythoncmd at line column jordan at line column problem at line column It is working correctly for other matrices Running Ubuntu LTS Octave and Symbolic
