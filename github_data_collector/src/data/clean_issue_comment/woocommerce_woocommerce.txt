I can reproduce this bug consistently using the steps above WordPress Environment Szczeg y Copy and paste the system status report from WooCommerce System Status in WordPress admin NA Describe the bug For some data variables in a product an array can be used for example for the upsellids When we remove elements from this array it reverts back to the old state after saving the product So if we continue using this product in code it will contain incorrect data This was originally brought to light in the Bookings extension see To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Create a simple product with multiple upsell products assigned Get the ID of this product to be able to reproduce it with some code as follows product wcgetproduct upsells productgetupsellids vardump initial upsells remove arraypop upsells productsetupsellids upsells vardump after update productgetupsellids productgetchanges productsave vardump after save productgetupsellids productsave vardump second save productgetupsellids Initially getupsellids will return array int int After removing and updating it will return array int After the first save it will return array int int It will save the product correctly but wont replace the data in the object correctly after saving When saving the second time it wont do anything because the changes array is empty Expected behavior We would expect the product option to always contain the latest information The reason it contains the older information is because a recursive replace is done see This code works fine when adding elements to an array But when removing elements from an array it doesnt update them correctly Which is because of the following behaviour If a key from the first array exists in the second array its value will be replaced by the value from the second array If the key exists in the second array and not the first it will be created in the first array If a key only exists in the first array it will be left as is The third point is where it doesnt remove the data from the array One suggestion was to replace the function call with arrayreplace Does that cause any other problems or is there a specific need to recursively walk through the arrays Isolating the problem mark completed items with an x x I have deactivated other plugins and confirmed this bug occurs when only WooCommerce plugin is active x This bug happens
