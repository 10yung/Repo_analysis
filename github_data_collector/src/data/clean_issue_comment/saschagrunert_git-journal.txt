Bumps nom from to details summaryChangelogsummary pemSourced from a href changelogaemp blockquote h Change Logh h Unreleased unreleased h h Thanksh h Addedh h Fixedh h h pThis version comes with a complete rewrite of nom internals to use functions as a base for parsers instead of macros Macros have been updated to use functions under the hood so that most existing parsers will work directly or require minimal changesp pThe codeCompleteByteSlicecode and codeCompleteStrcode input types were removed To get different behaviour related to streaming or complete input there are different versions of some parsers in different submodules like codenomcharacterstreamingalpha code and codenomcharactercompletealpha codep pThe codeverboseerrorscode feature is gone now the error type is decided through a generic bound To get equivalent behaviour to codeverboseerrorscode check out codenomerrorVerboseErrorcodep h Thanksh ul lia href helped in refactoring and error managementli lia href helped

desired Security updates receive only security updates if desired details I am testing your tool Using o option appends the journal to the end of the file which seem to contradict the normal order of a changelog The question arises if the full changelog should be generated or just the diff to the last release I was avoiding the o option and tried to write the output directly into the file git journal CHANGELOGmd which also failed since ansi escape sequences are not stripped This rigid feature of enabling the color could be easily put in automatic mode just by checking if stdout is a tty Im trying to use git journal to populate releases built by travis ci So travis run the following command to get its local repo git clone depth branchmaster Riduidelrrss imap And when I run git journal in this folder I get this error message git journal Error ErrorMessage msg Log parsing error object not found no match for id e f b f c c c e f d b classOdb codeNotFound How can I avoid that When I use git journal on my windows box I always have the following message displayed as first command git journal Cant load configuration file using default one Le fichier sp cifi est introuvable os error Is it because I have no cliyaml file in my home dir looking at the code you seem to load that file at startup
