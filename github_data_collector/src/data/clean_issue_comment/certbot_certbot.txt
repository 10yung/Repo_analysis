Fixes I tested this by making the release script fail and doing a dummy release If you run a command like sudo certbot certonly d exampleorg standalone rsakeysize it will result in a renewal configuration file containing the following renewal parameters rsakeysize authenticator standalone If you then run sudo certbot certonly d exampleorg standalone reusekey forcerenewal rsakeysize is dropped from the renewal configuration file despite it still being a bit key I think we should preserve this value This is probably overkill but this cherry picks to the x branch to properly specify the minimum Certbot version in case of a point release Python is planning on enforcing that abstract base classes in the collections module are imported from collectionsabc See We currently are not always doing this in Certbot and are ignoring the deprecation warning about it at Properly testing and finding all occurrences of this problem is a little tricky see but we should fix this and remove the pytestini entry well before Python is released Locally if I delete the line disabling the warnings about collectionabc run toolsvenv py to create a Python developer environment activate it and then run pytest certbottestspluginsdiscotestpy tests pass despite the collection module raising deprecation warnings If I upgrade pytest to the latest version tests fail as expected Whats going on here I think I remember having similar problems in the past that were fixed by updating pytest to a newer version Are duplicates of warnings that are raised inside of pytest itself not properly reported This may just be a one time bug but if its a general problem with pytest that will keep reoccuring itd be good to understand the behavior The documentation section Changing the ACME Server needs to be updated in particular it still says Certbot uses Lets Encrypts ACMEv API by default This was discovered by mojoa on the Lets Encrypt forum The current mechanisms dont work for a machine with FIPS in enforcing mode This patch fixes this issue MD is not an allowed hashing mechanism Pull Request Checklist If the change being made is to a distributed component edit the master section of certbotCHANGELOGmd to include a description of the change being made Include your name in AUTHORSmd if you like The reuse account functionality eg v can reuse v accounts makes full canonical symlinks rather than relative symlinks This leads to problems when the letsencrypt folder is moved renamed migrated etc This is in contrast to the relative symlink method already used between live and archive Setup Ubuntu LTS Certbot doesnt have to be installed etcletsencrypt that has v and v account support and therefore has the v accounts directory symlinked to the v accounts directory Repro Verify that the folder etcletsencryptaccountsacmev apiletsencryptorg contains a working symlink named directory etcletsencryptaccountsacmev apiletsencryptorgdirectory mv etcletsencrypt etcletsencryptnew Result etcletsencryptaccountsacmev apiletsencryptorg now contains a failing symlink This is because that symlink was to the full canonical path instead of a relative path Expected etcletsencryptaccountsacmev apiletsencryptorg contains a working symlink Adrien has a branch where he had this working using QEMU Using the approach described at we should make snaps for all of our DNS plugins We need to resolve first We may also want to resolve and as well
