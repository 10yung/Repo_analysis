when I use this function I find a issue you may run the code and find it I think it is because the matlab cannot mark off the handle and the number code x y fig Plotxy fig Plotxy fig Plotxy fig Plotxy fig Plotxy error I am using this to create my plots but I encountered a problem that I cannot place three legends in a single row it is always in front of the graph which is difficult to read for reviewers please solve my issue I will be grateful Untitled Thanks Creating of publication quality graphs thats what i need But i have so much subfigures plots Can i use PlotPub for this I am seeing an issue when a legend is created with markers Whenever a line includes a marker the text in the legend corresponding to that line turns gray I am using R a The problem can be reproduced with generate the signal f frequency Vm peak phi phase t f th pift v Vmsinth v Vmsinth phi v Vmsinth phi plot them plt Plott E v t E v t E v pltLineStyle three line styles pltMarkers o s pltLegendBox on pltLegend theta o theta o theta o legends exportfig is a function to export figures with publication quality It exports pdf without bounding box solving for example and likely This is a duplicate of previously submitted issue now closed Add options to change text Interpreter and dimension Units Correctly detect legends previous code did not work in Matlab a I have not tested this change in previous versions Dont throw a warning for ErrorBar plots It will be highly convenient if it supports bar graph Please add this feature if feasible Hi does PlotPub allow one to apply separate axes labelsaxes properties to different axes on the same figure If not could you consider adding this feature Can u make PlotHub support other plot type such as bar graph
