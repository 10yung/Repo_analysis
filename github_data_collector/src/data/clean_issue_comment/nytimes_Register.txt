 The Play Stores purchase UI has moved to a bottom sheet from the old dialog We currently display as a dialog It would be nice to make ours look the same way is the library we use to do swipe gesture detecting I believe since we made the move to AndroidX this is causing problems It should be replaced with either our own solution or maybe get rid of the gesture altogether Register gets Permission denied trying to read registerjson config file on Android Q devices This is due to Currently BillingContextWrapper will crash when onBindService is called because package manager returns queryIntentServices w a list of size We should be able to recover from this gracefully and show an error toast of some type Tests that were removed due to PlayBilling library GetPurchasesAndSkuDetailsConnectionTestjava BuyServiceConnectionTestjava Lets see what we can do to try and cover what was lost in the above tests when it comes to PBL Right now it can be a pain as you have to remember to push the updated version of the config file before you try to access it One possible idea is linked to since the config app would be deployed with your app you could include the config file in your apps source and Register reads from it there Also would be nice As of now you have to separately install the config app in order to use register If the version of Register youve coupled with your app is different than the version of the companion app you can run into issues If we can automatically deploy the config app with your app like LeakCanary does then that issue would be mitigated and would be a nicer experience It seems like a user has to manually configure the separate app to test different flows Is it possible to set the desired value programmatically in the context of an automated test
