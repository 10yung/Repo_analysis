 Currently weve used cache in the layer of RocksDB of token database The cache in RocksDB is called block cache which stores some pieces of SST table data into memory But its needed to have an objects cache which stores the instances at token database level Because when reading object from token database it needs to deserialize binary data into object data And it takes some time especially for the complex type like passivebonus Support partition in postgres uses pgpathman Build pgpathman into postgres docker image Currently we use image from bitnami maybe we need to build our one Update sql to create partition Improve query performance Analysis current query sql to find the complex queries and add necessary indexes Analysis partition performance impact Support all the actions Currently postgresplugin dont support all the actionseg lock bonus suspend processing breakpad is used to produce minicore file when encountering crash and debug symbols will be uploaded to S when building Docker image Its needed to have one script to support the whole process when a crash is produced Use breakpad client to get the hash of crashed evtd program Download the debug symbols from S according to the hash Use breakpad to produce the detail crash stack Bonus is one of main features will added to the v And therere two parts passive bonus and active bonus Passive bonus will be first implemented
