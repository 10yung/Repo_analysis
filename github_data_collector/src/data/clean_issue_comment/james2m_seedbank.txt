I just started using Seedbank v and everytime I run rake dbseed I am running into this issue NameError wrong constant name Class x eef I am trying to add just one record to start with and I havent been able to take off I am on Rails and Ruby Does anyone have any thoughts on how to resolve this issue Is anyone using this gem with the latest versions of Ruby on Rails without any issues Clean styles by Rubocop All tests were passed Hi I have a hook in my Rspec config to run my test seeds with Seedbank before my test suite runs Worked great until I tried to upgrade Seedbank to now I get this error An error occurred in a beforesuite hook FailureError RakeTask dbseedtest invoke RuntimeError Dont know how to build task environment see tasks specrailshelperrb in block levels in top required e in main Here are the relevant lines from my config ruby RSpecconfigure do config configbeforesuite Seedbankloadtasks RakeTask dbseedtest invoke What is the recommended way of accomplishing this I dont believe I can do Railsapplicationloadseed with Seedbank It works fine on Thanks Please check this PR before Refactor DSL and clean styles in order to make next PR easily Please check this PR after After this PR merged we can use customized file names by overriding Seedbankoriginalseedsfile This PR allows to add a configuration file to seedbank in order to define lambdas beforeeach and aftereach executed before and after every seed file Those lambdas can help set and clean up any particular state that depends on file system redis etc The example rake dbseeddevelopmentusers seems to actually only run dbseedsdevelopmentusersseedsrb Is there any way to force some commonshared code to load beforehand without having to do after or require in every single individual seed file Its possible to use active record reflections to create a seed running order treating belongsto as something like dependencies as we see in bundler It would be great if seedbank used reflection to guess which seed files to run first I can show you some code that might help or I can implement it with a pull request when I get some time though it would be good to see if you think its useful first Add a new rake task to set up db layers for nonrails setups and update README to provide at least one example of this I dont think seedbank is currently supported for these Has it ever been considered Would you have a few tips on what it might require
