Fixes rocket Enhancements Migrate vxdemosrccomponentschartsSimpleBarjs to typescript memo Documentation Update references to vxdemosrccomponentschartsSimpleBarjs This seems possibly related to an old issue or the recent TypeScript rewrite but Im finding that with LegendThreshold the last box isnt rendered I have a scale with breaks and thus AFAIU colors I built a base example with workaround attempts here As a rundown First version just passing the break color scale to LegendThreshold gives a legend with Less than on the first box but no corresponding More than on the last one I checked that the scale is valid though by calling the scale function on a high value see console log Second version explicitly adding to the end of the scale domain This works but hardcoding an upper limit means theres no more than which would be more appropriate for this type of scale Third version based on the components source code at least the gist of it I dont know TypeScript was to add null to the end of the domain but now the last box says More than instead of More than I should also mention that as another workaround setting labelUpper or higher works fine to get or higher Just wanted to bring up the fact that the default More than was broken Let me know if Im misunderstanding something or if I can help on it Thanks in advance d supports a squareroot scale and it would be nice for VX to have something reflecting that d s squareroot scale is a convenience method that is a shortcut for a power scale with specific parameters so achieving the desired effect may already be possible with the power scale in VX But it would be nice to have that same shortcut for a common use case I have been following the move to TypeScript and saw that the Brush component has finally gotten some examples Using alpha I tried out some of the demo code Some of it worked but Brush did not Using it leads to JSX element type Brush is not a constructor function for JSX elements Type Brush is missing the following properties from type ElementClass context setState forceUpdate props and morets JSX element class does not support attributes because it does not have a props propertyts The issue here is the import of React inside Brushdts import React from react React apparently has no default export and TypeScript does not like or understand this unless you set allowSyntheticDefaultImports true import as React from react would be the correct import here that works and without setting this Other typings import React the same way but didnt cause me any trouble Still maybe all imports of React should be adjusted Since I suck at TypeScript I could be wrong about the typings This Stackoverflow thread explains some of it There is a vxevent package but it has no description or examples It might be helpful to add some documentation for it Need to make the changes in for all packages The constrain prop initially took a reference to the prop function constrain on mount but then the function never updated when the prop function did This way the thispropsconstrain function will always be the most recent reference This is important when working with hooks and useCallback boom Breaking Changes Im not sure if this was intentional after all it very well could be bug Bug Fix I was going to make one but decided to do a PR instead I have a use case for a brush that can be initialized with some state more like a controlled component rather than an uncontrolled component as it currently maintains its own state For example on initial render there would already be a brushed area that the user can then drag to resize rather than always starting from an unbrushed state I think this could be achieved by optionally passing in brush state rather than the brush managing its own state Is there appetite to support this usecase Im happy to submit a PR if so Im having problems getting the bisector to work so I have been following the Areas demo example code and stumbled across this The following would error right Or is there yet another thing Im missing const xStock d new Dateddate line then d x xStockd date xStockd date x d d line xStockd date ddate is undefined xStockd date ddate is undefined bug Bug Fix Debounce calls can still fire after unmount so we need to cancel them
