Hello I have a problem I installed emulationstation on my old computer on windows but I have square instead of the text Weird Like if I dont have the typography Wich one is used Can you help me Thanks a lot Now that the Raspberry Pi has HDMI ports and you can hook up dual displays maybe it makes sense to start a conversation about being able to support a display interface with display dedicated for games and a nd display used for settings and selecting games For those that dont have displays but have an iPad iPhone tablet or other screen that can remotely connect it might be nice if you could use those devices to remote in and control the primary device Id love to be able to use touch interfaces a keyboard or a mouse to scroll through long lists of games and a game pad just isnt as good for those tasks HDR It all started when I downloaded a theme that ended up being too large for storage and forced emulationstation to crash I deleted the theme and reset it to carbon reinstalled emulationstation and yet still crashing Could use some help Hi Im looking for a way to have two controller simultaneously control ES and running emulatorsgames So for examples I want to be able to configure the Dpad on USB controller A but use the fire buttons from controller B A friend of mine depends on the Adaptive Controller and in order to play games she needs AC and a second controller as well Thx Hello I am running ES on a linux mainline kernel retrorangepi a retropie build for sunxiAllwinner SoC My device have a RGB LCD connected and a HDMI out Currently ES is launching on the LCD But the HDMI out only shows the console On Xfce dual screen works properly I can select the primary monitor arrange them left right and resolutions and so on I am trying to get this When HDMI is plugged in switch ES to HDMI When HDMI is disconnected switch back ES to LCD Or alternatively clone the framebuffer to both HDMI and LCD with LCD resolution so that when HDMI is connected it can show the signal I am not sure how to do this Should I try to make changes on ES source code so that it outputs to both framebuffer or support HDMI detection and switch Or should I try to edit DRM driver code to clone framebuffers to both outputs First option looks like the right way to do it but I am not sure if it would work only in ES and not in games Thanks Hi Im working on a project to integrate an LED matrix marquee with EmulationStation and RetroPie Using the runcommandonstartsh and runcommandonendsh scripts in RetroPie Im able to change the LED matrix to artwork that matches the game that has been launched That works just fine video of that working here Id like to take it one step farther and also be able to change the LED matrix as the user is scrolling through games on EmulationStation before launching a game I do have an existing REST API and just need a hook I can tie into to trigger my API based on front end scrolling events in EmulationStation Specifically my API would need rom name and platform name passed Would like to know if this is achievable and if so any pointers where to get started would be greatly appreciated thanks This allows the user to pass an API key for the gamesdb scraper It works by letting users add scraper configurations to essystemscfg maybe not the right place Heres an example of what the segment looks like xml scrapers scraper namegamesdbname only valid scraper name atm pathapithegamesdbnetGamesByGameNamepath currently unused APIKeyREDACTEDAPIKey scraper scrapers The idea is try to make scrapers as configurable as possible but at the moment the only valid name is gamesdb and the only used child element of a scraper is APIKEY The code I have works but obviously this needs to be cleaned up For one thing ratings developers publishers and genres arent yet supported For another its a long way from truly configurable But hopefully this is a good enough starting point for some feedback Update Basic support for scraping developers publishers and genres has been added Currently there doesnt appear to be a way to access ratings through the TheGamesDB API Fetching each requires a minimum of synchronous API requests at the moment I expect that Ill want to make those asynchronous similar to the imagethumbnail fetches in the future But its a bit more complex than those because the fetched information is shareable between all games scraped with that scraper But I digress Next up is refining the configuration files a bit With the release of RasberryPi with k what do you guys think of an all new UI I always felt like the design looks outdated especially compared to Apple tvOS Netflix PS etc I would love to do some layouts but have limited time only I got something super sleek and simple in my mind Maybe you could make an open request where designers all around the world could send in uiux designs and you or the community votes for the best one As of th of June none of the two scrapers are returning any matches nor throwing any error messages when failing to scrap This is a bit related to but it would be extremely handy if we could use the Release Date of a scraped rom to sort it Itd really make for a wonderful archival history of roms for a system
