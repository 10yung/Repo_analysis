Hi Trying to adjust some local gp settings script works just fine when executed directly on a machine but not with intune The script is executed successfully but nothing happends to the local GP The scripts includes installing of nuget and the PolicyFileEditor module this has been tested and works Also there seems to be an issue with a computer that is AzureAD joined here the computer will have an empty GroupPolicy folder until someone manually initializes the directory Is there any way to initialize or will the powershell module do this Script UserPolicy C windows system GroupPolicy User

into the Comment area of each Administrative Setting That way I can leave some notes in a gpresult H output file if anybody ever were to look at the Windows machine that was configured via DSC PolicyFileEditor Is this possible to implement at all If so how complex would this be to implement Hello Thanks for your wonderful module I have noticed a problem when attempting to enable the USB RemoteFX USB Redirection feature when using your policy What I have found is that the PolicyFileEditor module does correctly set configuration in the GUI if the GPEDITmsc console and it does appear to create the registry key but yet whatever other back end magic that happens when you manually enable the feature in the GUI is not happening when using PolicyFileEditor module Here is an example Run the following command setPolicyFileEntry path envsystemroot system GroupPolicy Machine registrypol Key SOFTWARE Policies Microsoft Windows NT Terminal Services Client ValueName fUsbRedirectionEnableMode Data Type DWord When you check the GPEDITmsc configuration under Computer Configuration Windows Components Remote Desktop Services Remote Desktop Client Connection RemoteFX USB Device Redirection Allow RDP Derection of other supported RemoteFX USB devices from this computer you will see that it is correctly set to Enabled for Administrators and Users However it doesnt actually work You can know this by opening the Device Manager and selecting your USB Host Controller Example Intel USB Host Controller and clicking the Driver Tab and selecting Driver Details When the RemoteFX USB Redirection feature correctly enables you will see CWINDOWS system drivers tsusbfltsys listed as one of the driver files To demonstrate how it should work you can manually open GPEDITmsc and go to the configuration listed above and disable or not configure it Click Apply Then select Enabled for Users and Administrators Click Apply Now check your driver files and you will see that the tsusbfltsys driver file is immediately added even without a reboot or GPUPDATE I guess my question is how can someone figure out what other magic is happening behind the scenes other than the registry key that gets set which doesnt appear to paint the whole picture Hi I have s of computers for which I need to read some setting from local group policy Can this script be used on remote computers Hi thanks for the module Its very good The help text from aboutRegistryValuesForAdminTemplatesHelptxt was very helpful I found that when I set a local policy group option the machine didnt update its policy until after a reboot or until I ran the command gpupdate force So for instance I ran the command SetPolicyFileEntry envsystemroot system GroupPolicy Machine registrypol Key Software Policies Microsoft Windows Explorer ValueName NoNewAppAlert Data Type DWord The affect didnt take place until after I ran gpupdate force I think this is fine but I didnt see anyway in the help information or documentation on setPolicyFileEntry that you need to then call gpupdatereboot Is this expected behaviour of the module The process cannot access the file C Program Files WindowsPowerShell Modules PolicyFileEditor PolicyFileEditor PolFileEditordll because it is being used by another process I can see from the source code that commentbased help should exist for at least SetPolicyFileEntry but after installing the module v from PSGallery on a Win machine doing a GetHelp SetPolicyFileEntry showwindow is only giving me the basic autogenerated help That leads me to think there might be something wrong with the help block but I havent found it yet Im going to fork the project and see what I can see in VSCode and if I find something Ill make a pull request I just wanted you to be aware that Im looking at it If its some sort of known issue feel free to wave me off Is it possible to provide some documentation and examples I want to use the DSC Resource but is not that easy to understand how to use it even after checking GetDscResource Syntax cAccountAdministrativeTemplateSetting I would like to change some setting in Computer Configuration Administrative Templates Windows Components Remote Desktop Services Remote Session Host Licensing How do I do this
