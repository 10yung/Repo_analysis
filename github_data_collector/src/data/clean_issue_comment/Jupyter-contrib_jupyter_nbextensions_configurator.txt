I tried to install jupytercontribnbextensions according to the steps introduced in the official website I finished the first step Install the python package And When I proceeded to the second step an error was reported jupyter contrib nbextension install user File ipythoninput c e b b line jupyter contrib nbextension install user SyntaxError invalid syntax This PR could close issue Dont know if this a good solution but it is at least working for me without issues as far as I can see Would be great to have this fix in the next release of the configurator as I just added a number of custom keybindings to a jupyter extension Looking forward to hear your feedback on this matter Hi I have encountered an issue regarding the definition of multiple hotkeys in one project I can define the first hotkey but all further hotkeys I want to change modify the first one again instead I have already spotted the problem in the code and I will send you a PR with a proposal to fix this Is there a way for us to create extensions that are notvisible and notdisableable through the extensions tab Also we want our extensions to actually remove functionality from Jupyter Notebook As a hypothetical example We want to have a legal popup displayed for a particular notebook that is prepopulated The user cannot Hide the legal popup by disabling the popup extension Of course we could prevent the user from accepting in this circumstance by having the legal popup hit a controller but lets just ignore that fact for the sake of this example Can all this be achieved using a notebook extension to disable it or is it mandatory for us to disable it via code Thereby making updating versions of our notebook setup hardish since we have to merge changes Of course we forked jupyter notebook so it shouldnt be that hard to change in the future Also please advise if this is not the ideal channel for posting general questions Sometimes when I use Table of Contents content does not appear in the IPython file He will appear the last yellow warning in the picture img width alt src With this change the conda recipe for the package no longer needs to rely on prepost linkunlink scripts Im using latest version of Anaconda python and followed setup steps for jupyter nbextensions and nbextensionsconfigurator Tried both ways on different machines using conda install and installing directly by pip No matter what I try the configurator tab show all extensions as incompatible Although I can disable the checkbox and select the extensions that I want and theyre working correctly Id like to understand if theres anything going on that I should fix Ive checked yaml files of some extensions and most if not all are compatible with x and x versions of Jupyter Other packages versions that might be of help jupyter INSTALLED latest jupytercore INSTALLED latest jupyterclient INSTALLED LATEST jupytercontribnbextensions INSTALLED latest Im trying to install NbConfigurator in jupyterhub so my users can enable their own custom extensions I have gotten it working fine I installed jupytercontribnbextensions which got a bunch of extensions installed for me when I ran jupyter contrib nbextension install sysprefix jupyter nbextensionsconfigurator enable sysprefix There are some extensions I do not want users to be able to use Quick example being Exercise Not relevant to us GistIt Its in a private VPN where Github access is not possible Im now trying to figure out how can I blacklist some extensions so that my users cannot enable those and they just dont show up in the Configurator Also can I autoenable some extensions like Code Folding etc Feature Request An extension enabling clickanddrag to rearrange the order of cells in a notebook The nteract notebook has this feature by default Perhaps its as easy as porting their code Not sure if Im posting this in the right place Thanks for your great work I use it every day and it dramatically improves Jupyter notebook ergonomics Thanks for this awesome tool I am using JupyterHub which is a multi user Jupyter installed the extension accordingly but the new tab doesnt show up here What I did conda install c condaforge jupytercontribnbextensions What I see when I am in JupyterHub as usual Files Running Clusters Thank you very much
