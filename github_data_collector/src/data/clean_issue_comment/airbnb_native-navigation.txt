A common problem with apps that are using this lib is that they lose their navigation stack after their ReactActivity is closed Besides the inconvenience one major problem of this behavior is that pushing back when reopening an app after the user has navigated away from the first screen causes a crash since the app no longer knows which Fragment to go back to The problem presents itself if the user has Dont keep activities turned on or the Activity is otherwise killed This PR adds a feature to restore our navigation stack in those situations It works by tagging each Fragment we navigate to with the total size of the back stack That way when your ScreenCoordinator is instanced we recreate the Fragment stack in the same order they were initially made The result is that the app now has every Fragment in the Activity stack and can safely navigate back to them At some point the backStacks object can be null making backStackspeek crash the app I could not put my finger exactly on why this happens but I suspect its some kind of race condition Anyway its always when trying to pop This PR does two things to address this problem Adds a null check before trying to peek into our backStacks Logs a warning every time we would try to pop or push with a null backStacks That way we wont lose track of the problem This fixed the problem in our production app without any side effects but maybe somebody with more context on the code can clarify why this crash happens and whether this is an acceptable fix Adds the onHostDestroy method call Lacking this call can cause problems when using features that rely on your React lifecycle Besides were already calling onHostPause and onHostResume so for the sake of consistency we should also do onHostDestroy Migrate to Swift Now we can build nativenavigation latest Xcodev Hi First of all thanks for this great library I really like the Shared Element transitions which are working really great for me which would be a reason to use this library over wix navigation However is it also possible to have a swipe gesture to pop a screen I didnt find it in the docs Or is this still a missing feature Do you mate in plan create a typescript definition file img width altscreen shot at pm src I am currently using wixreactnativenavigation However there are plenty of problems when using it reactnativepushnotification cannot be used in android with wixs navigation it renders all tabs while using it I cannot just logout by setting redux to initial state directly because some of the rendering components may using the redux state Overall wixs navigation is not stable enough as I used the navigator provided by react native before The app crash increase a lot in this few month Therefore I really want to try this library and find a better navigation solution In these few weeks I keep looking these three forks And I guess taxfix may already using it in their iOS production app because their navigation is quite similar with nativenavigation So is there any example for tab bar and login structure using nativenavigation Im still learning the source code so please correct me if my assumptions are wrong I believe so far we have initial goals to start from Make it commercially supporting by any team inside their project this could be my team Im reviewing this possibility Seamless setup and integration for new brownfield RN projects Apart from obvious things like stability I can see next steps has to be done first to achieve goals complete lacking documentation Especially for the possible integration options Integration new devs new commercial support involved provide simple use cases with tab bars drawers etc As a temporary solution could be an integration with existing libs Not sure about that review existing issues maybe someone can pick and fix few issues prioritize the most lacking functionality comments are welcome verify if it works with RN eg upcoming has some changes in initial params fix everything coordination avoid doing same things because of miscommunication I started with documenting initial setup and integration guide There are lots of chapters that are totally empty Anyone else We have to think what suits better for our distributed team Not sure if trello will be good We need something to track our progress Anyone who wants to contribute please share your ideas your vision your ideas PRMRs are welcome
