Even with an empty demo project I find that I cant navigate to a new view without dropping at least one or two frames during the transition animation This is a real bummer because its the only thing separating the feel of my react native app from a genuine native app Heres a video recorded at fps on an iPhone XS Youll notice a frame drop toward the end that makes the animation feel choppy droppedframemp zip I believe react navigation uses the native driver so what is causing this dropped frame And can anything be done to prevent it and create smoother transitions Before I used v to achieve this effect by routing nesting horizontally switched routes can pop up modal and pages inside modal can be switched horizontally It is found that the routing nesting of the v version is not the same as before Can anyone help me achieve the previous effect using v reactnative reactnavigation Setup import createAppContainer createStackNavigator createSwitchNavigator

of the TutorialNavigator the second line to the FourthScreen of the HomeNavigator and remove the ThirdScreen from the history ie when I go back from the FourthScreen I dont want to end up on the ThirdScreen but I want to end up on the SecondScreen of the HomeNavigator Since the use case constrains the navigation to be initiated from the TutorialNavigators screens to the FourthScreen of the

Android reactnavigation alpha reactnative expocli node npm Hi Is it possible to create interactive transition in Stack Navigator with this great library Back gesture is already automatically supported eg if I create FromBottom transition using navigationOptionscardStyleInterpolator transform and enable gesture then user can swipe to close the screen The solution I am looking for is similar to iOSNative UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition It allows to trigger navigation navigatedetails but also to send current progress So I can create GestureListener on some object and during this gesture I can update transition progress Then it could use cardStyleInterpolator transform as with back to calculate proper position etc Youtube app may be the good example we can swipe video to small player bar and then swipe it to fullscreen I was able to achieve it using iOS native UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition but unfortunately I could not do it on Native Android Fragment Transitions does not allow interactive animation Of course I could just create a gesture animation on nonscreen object and just place it above current screen as here but I think it would be great to create it with navigation as normal screen transition Thanks in advance Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request Motivation I find method replace is missing in types but this can be used in js Test plan wont need to I just past the types from v Code formatting Look around Match the style of the rest of the codebase Run yarn format before committing I run yarn format with error Command format not found see I have a tab navigator with tabs I want tab A has a title home tab B has no header So here is my code tabNavigatornavigationOptions navigation navigation state object const routeName navigationstateroutes navigationstateindex if routeName home return headerTitle home else return header null Here is the result bug As you can see home is showed OK but tab B has a white space in the header If both of the tabs are header null it will be OK tabNavigatornavigationOptions navigation navigation state object return header null bb Your Environment software version reactnavigation reactnative Current Behavior Apologies first for posting a question I have posted on stack overflow and searched everywhere for my question and i had no luck I need to know whether it is able to achieve the behavior I want using reactnavigation I am trying to find a way to navigate to specific screen that is created multiple times from one statically defined screen First multiple screens are created by following thispropsnavigationpushtabScreen option thispropsnavigationnavigaterouteName tabScreen params key uuid option I am able to successfully create multiple same screen using stackNavigator but the problem is that I need to be able to navigate or jumpnot just going back to previous screen to any of the screens created without having to unmount the created screens so for example if I have Screen Screen Screen Screen Screen I should be able to jump or navigate Screen Screen Screen Screen Screen Screen and so on without having to unmount the screens when navigating Stack navigator uses stack so from what I understand it pops all the screens before navigating to a screen and therefore unmounts the screen Is such behavior achievable in react navigation If not where or how should I look into solving the problem Thanks Expected Behavior Able to navigate dynamically to screens created multiple times from one screen Your Environment software version reactnavigation reactnative node npm or yarn npm Drawer navigation was working fine in V once I upgrade to V there are two problems Drawer not closing when clicking the background on web only Drawer open by itself when swiping right or left depending on drawer position Current Behavior I have a custom header and tab bar in my navigators Every now and then this happens Simulator Screen Shot iPhone
