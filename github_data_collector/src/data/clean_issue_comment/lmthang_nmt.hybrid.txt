I read this paper and I am trying to implement a model which also use the mixture of character and word embedding I wonder how to handle the relation between character and word embedding What I know is that when we input a source sentence to the neural network there may be an unknown word in it or it maybe not When we input a sentence that does not have an unk its embedding would be directly from a lookup table And the parameters of the characterlevel encoder does not have effect on the training objective Then should I use the gradient that is calculated from this sentence to update the parameters of the character encoder How should I update the parameters of the character encoder Hi I like this code but i am not an expert in Matlab Please i would like to have this implementation in Pytorch for more comprehension as Developer Thanks in advance Will the NMT integrated in the CoreNLP codebase in java This would help to use the pretrained models as other CoreNLP models and to train new models as well using the current codebase and java utilities Thank you Hi I could train a new hybrid model without any error messages But when using the scripts testsh the following error message appears at the end bash Loading data src from file datahybrid idtestmk src unk unk unk unk unk src end unk unk Loading data tgt from file datahybrid idtesten tgt On Friday unk unk many Orthodox Serbs prepared for Christmas by lighting the unk with wishes for good unk happiness and wealth tgt endThe new legislation would effectively make it impossible for the unk of Bulgarias more than unk parties to participate in the polls Decoding sents Jul Decoding batch of sents minLen maxLen tgtEos Jul Exception identifierMATLABassertionfailed nameAssertion failed stack filetmpnmthybridnmthybridcodelstmDecoderm namelstmDecoder line stack filetmpnmthybridnmthybridcodetestLSTMm nametestLSTM line cc lmthang
