Seems like they are missing hyperv ISO builder how to assign static IP address the to the VM I am trying to build a hyperv VM through the JSON hypervwindows R serverstandardamd json Since there are no options to specify the IP address the build could not connect to internet to get the windows update Please advise if I am missing anything Even the VM not getting the IP from DHCP server installed on the same Hyperv HOST Hi Ive tried to build the ubuntu server box on hyperv and the path and filename for bootx efi are not correct The correct script is note the difference in case cp r bootefiEFIubuntu bootefiEFIBOOT mv bootefiEFIBOOTubuntushimx efi bootefiEFIBOOTBOOTX efi Dont know if this breaks the build for other versions of Ubuntu Tested only on serveramd ISO Hello i tried the hypervwindows serverstandardamd json adapted the variables to my enviroment changed the ports in the powershell files to and added winrmusessl true winrminsecure true The result is hyperviso Waiting for WinRM to become available with that error in the Logfile ERROR WinRM connection err unknown error Post dial tcp connectex A connection attempt failed because the connected party did not properly respond after a period of time or established connection failed because connected host has failed to respond The Host is HyperV host is Windows R What could be the problem Many thanks in advance Regards Mathias I am building for vmware and I am seeing this error nothing changed from the json other the the ISO details I have got windows r standard template which is working fine with SCSI controller as LSI and now I am looking to update the same to use pvscsi instead of LSI I was going through your build process but couldnt get from where scripts you are trying to install pvscsi drivers Im just looking to update drivers so that i can build template using SCSI controller as pvscsi Could please let me know how this be done i think you think swap statements in condition if

Logzip I saw that in the windows windows serverstandardamd Autounattendxml file there is a commentedout NonUEFI DiskConfiguration I tried to use that in place of the commentedin UEFI compatible but with the same result I also tried to use scsi virtualDev lsisas instead of scsi virtualDev pvscsi in the json file fixing this error message for other packer scripts but no effect I combined this two measures no effect Help would be appreciated Looks like the boot command is no longer correct If you replace the first three lines of bootcommand escwait escescenterwait set gfxpayload x enter linux installvmlinuz with enterwait f esc bsbsbsbsbsbsbsbsbsbs bsbsbsbsbsbsbsbsbsbs bsbsbsbsbsbsbsbsbsbs bsbsbsbsbsbsbsbsbsbs bsbsbsbsbsbsbsbsbsbs bsbsbsbsbsbsbsbsbsbs bsbsbsbsbsbsbsbsbsbs bsbsbsbsbsbsbsbsbsbs bsbsbs installvmlinuz Looks like this gets you to the correct prompt to type in the boot command It didnt like the linux command there Ive left the rest of boot command lines as is And when I vrdp in I see its got a Kernel panic not syncing VFS Unable to mount root fs on unknownblock
