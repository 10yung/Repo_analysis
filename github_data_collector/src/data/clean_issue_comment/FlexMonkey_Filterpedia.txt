 update swift syntax from swift to swift adds support for iPhone landscape orientation only fix some GLSL and metal relation crashes update gitignore and remove xcuserstated from the repo Most of the edits were actually pulled from another fork I picked at random that fixed the swift build issues However I noticed that a lot of filters has horrible slider ranges and default values I believe as a result of the swift conversion so I found the issue and cast the filter values as NSNumbers and then used the floatValue of an NSNumber to get those min max and default values instead of casting NSNumbers as Float Many of the Filters Including EightBit CRT Bayer Dither Lens Flare Lens Correction etc based on CIKernel are crashing due to new changes ERROR parameter has unexpected type vec should be a sampler type vec uv samplerCoordimage This seems to be a common error message among most crashing filters please check Any chance of publishing this for Mac OS too Id LOVE to help but Im struggling myself with applying CIFilters onto live camera input on Mac OS and I seem to miss some of the basics there Otherwise Im very experienced in Application design and development Please let me know if youre interested In my tests your MetalKuwaharaFilter is actually slower then KuwaharaFilter however here Simon mentions Metal is supposed to be faster Any idea why it is like that some function Attributes that override from class CIFilter must change from String AnyObject to String Any Compile on Xcode Version C swift Updated input arguments of vImageHistogramCalculationARGB for Swift Adjusted input arguments of vImageHistogramSpecificationARGB for Swift Clicked a lot of Fix it hiding behind little red circles with a white dot in them Performed short sanity to make sure calls to vImageHistogramXXX are okay Made sure it also compiles with nonsimulator targets Made sure it also runs the customMetal shaders Known issue Custom Metal filter only show the output if they are selected before any other filter Hello Love your book We met briefly at a conference a while ago btw Anyway Ive updated the project so it builds on Swift with zero errors or warnings I have not rigorously tested this I just wanted to get it running so I could play with it But it seems to work Mostly this was automatic updates except for the following manual changes AnyObject Any breaking out some tricky doubledictionary unwrapping with optionals into a function Adding an optionals within a nested UnsafePointer structure to use it with vImage updates to remove deprecated GCD methods Hello I tried to convert HistogramDisplay to Swift but I have a problem with this lines of code let histogram UnsafeMutablePointerUnsafeMutablePointervImagePixelCountmutating rgba vImageHistogramCalculationARGB inBuffer histogram UInt kvImageNoFlags the vImageHistogramCalculationARGB method is still same as in Swift but I cant properly initialized an optional UnsafeMutablePointerUnsafeMutablePointervImagePixelCount method Some ideas I received the error Cannot invoke initializer for type UnsafeMutablePointerUnsafeMutablePointervImagePixelCount with an argument list of type mutating UnsafeMutablePointervImagePixelCount
