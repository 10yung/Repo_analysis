I sometimes want to preemptively add a directory and the entire directory structure starting from it This has to be done manually one layer at a time for example fasd A will add all things three layers deep but not two layers or four A indicating all files beneath it ie now the matches as well as all other characters would be helpful and probably would not conflict with anything else Currently different linux based distro uses the different package manager Snapcraft has brought the abstraction over it I found it very suitable while playing with multiple linux distro So this is small addition to this from me Now it is available on snapcraft store under beta channel Though it is published under my name Im fine with moving it under snapcrafter or clvv for maintaining it Signedoffby Swapnil Mhamane swapnilgmhamanegmailcom Manually editing fasd is tedious and deleting it to rebuild it once in a while is not great either However fasd accumulates invalid paths as files and directories get deleted renamed or moved around clvv mentioned here that he is not keen on implementing such functionality but I think that it would be a great addition to fasd One downside as mentioned by clvv is that paths to unplugged external devices will be purged But I feel that it is up to people to be careful about this and not run the purge functionality when the devices are not plugged or stay clear of that functionality altogether or accept to lose the data base for the unplugged external devices This downside does not in my opinion justify the much larger downside of not having the functionality autojump as a purge flag which does exactly this with the same downside for unplugged external drives and it is a great thing to have This repository does not seem to be maintained at the moment but if it becomes active again in the future as I hope it will as this is a really great project maybe this is something to think about Thanks I am using zsh version framework ohmyzsh on both macOS and Arch Linux and have eval fasd init auto in my zshrc Ive defined a global alias alias g F fzf but it wont work properly I cannot conveniently do something like ls F but have to do ls fzf when there is eval fasd init auto First I thought it has something to do with letter F or f and tested it with other letters eg alias g Y fzf or alias g U fzfwith a space before the pipeline but still the same problem Why is this happening And how can I avoid it Thanks Edit other zsh global aliases like alias g L less works fine in the same environment fasd version zsh f FereidoonsMacBookPro eval fasd init auto FereidoonsMacBookPro sssj aevil FereidoonsMacBookPro typeset p a typeset aevil FereidoonsMacBookPro agood typeset p a typeset agood FereidoonsMacBookPro typeset p a typeset aevil FereidoonsMacBookPro This fix tries to address for now for bash shell only liquidprompt One of the features that I love about liquidprompt is that if any command ends with an error then the prompt displays the error code error code of the last command gets added to the next prompt Ive been using fasd and liquidprompt together for a while now and I recently noticed that the above mentioned feature in liquidprompt is broken by fasd Any suggestions on how I could fix this Ill be happy to code test and send you a PR or how I could get a work around for this issue More context on this issue that I created in the liquidprompt project Sorry to post what might be a newb question here but wondering how I might install this on Amazon Linux which uses yum I am being forced to use Amazon Linux as a dev environment and cant quite find the right repository to load and install When executing z somedir and somedir doesnt exist or the directory otherwise isnt changed to the return value from fasdcd should be an error but we get This makes it difficult to use in scripts as well as also making it harder to use because you need to double check that your directory change worked each time The synopsis section of the manpage has fasd AD paths Later under Compatibility the A option is described In shells without prompt command or prompt command substitution tcsh for instance you can add entries manually with fasd A However the D option isnt described at all Presumably it removes entries
