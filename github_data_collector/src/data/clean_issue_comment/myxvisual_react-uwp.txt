 Problem description Link to minimal working code that reproduces the issue Versions ReactUWP React Browser This piece of code seems wrong to me if used with this piece of code javascript NavigationView pageTitleTest backgroundFF defaultExpanded true expandedWidth isControlled true it makes the NavigationView background disappear and first the remaining menu will overlay the content until clicked unfocused and at the same time the whole layout is moved in the original place of the NavigationView Or in other words the logic seems inverted Also another issue is when the currInitWidth is set because then these steps will remove the element completely from users view and it cant be retrieved back without dev tools Load with width Resize to Resize back to Also unless either removed completely or replaced with original propsinitWidth itll just overwrite users value which undesired I am working on NextJS project server side rendering On link Sample code says needGenerateAcrylicfalse if using SSR set this config to false using fallback color But thats all the information I can really find So I have some questions Why do I need to set to false even though acrylic background is display correctly with flag set to true Where do I set a fallback colour Thanks Uncaught TypeError Cannot convert undefined or null to object When trying to change theme using
