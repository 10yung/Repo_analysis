VirtualBox Guest Additions and kernel module Please verify that these guest additions are properly installed in the guest This is not a bug in Vagrant and is usually caused by a faulty Vagrant box For context the command attempted was mount t vboxsf o dmode fmode uid gid varwww varwww The error output from the command was No such device Is it just me or does the Pro version still enable PHP as default Can we get that changed to Hi thank you for Scotchboxpro its awsome Unfortunately no matter what I try I cant install the soap module for PHP I can install php soap only with apt Ive added ppaondrej repo but it doesnt contain the package either What can I do I dont want to upgrade the whole OS to bionic Its been a while since PHP has reached its end of life Will we see an update of Scotch Box Free version to any time soon I think it might be time to get Ubuntu PHP and MySQL out of the box Very often there is a need to change the patch version of PHP installed For example my teams policy is that we support at least PHP latest patch and therefore the development environment must be at that version A Update OS Package One way of doing this is described here Basically after logging into your environment vagrant ssh you find out what PHP versions are available to you bash sudo apt show a php grep Version This will produce output eg Version ubuntu Version ubuntu Version ubuntu Once you know this you can install a specific version bash sudo aptget install php ubuntu B Build for Specific Requirements If you have very specific requirements especially if you need PHP compiled in a certain way one good solution is using phpbrew This will allow you to build any PHP version Be aware however that since you are building PHP in your dev environment that environment will need to contain build requirements which are very often devellevel packages There is no definitive list of packages you need because build requirements for each specific PHP version is different You can find an example of doing this here Install build requirements These are the different OS packages that are needed to build my specific version which in that example is PHP Install phpbrew Pretty straightforward sequence according to the manual which will result in it having an uptodate version of recipes Compile PHP Creates a new version available to PHPBrew with specific extensions and also adds code to the startup script This helps with running phpbrew in the future Switch to new PHP version This means that the version will now become available Another similar approach is by using phpenv which is gaining popularity
