When i was decompiling doubanapk I can not see Classes ClassyShark hint error loading archive It will be great to have simple text search in the selected file Currently its all flat and XML is mixed with Java and others Not even sorted by type It offers various things that are missing here and vice versa It would be great to have a single library that has both of what those libraries offer We could this way get resources data properly maybe even parse more Take this sample Helloworld APK and open the file iclauncherforegroundxml Uploading appdebugzip Not just a jar file But a real dependency that we can use in Android projects If this is already possible please write it on the main page of the repository and show there also tutorials of how to use it with various ways of input such as InputStream Uri etc The reason I dont mention File is that sadly Android is becoming very much against it preferring the terrible SAF API instead Currently there is no way to find those that belong to the current configuration let alone to a locale There is no gradle dependency of the library there is no jar file there is no usage of Sharkwith I want to try it out right on Android device I want to get manifest data to get resources to be able to view them including app icons even if they are VectorDrawable or Adaptive icon The reason for that is that sadly Android has added new restrictions to get information from APK files so its impossible to do it for them unless I copy each APK file to my own path of the app which is a waste of time and storage The export button does not seem to do anything Open APK Select AndroidManifestxml Press export button Expected AndroidManifestxml is exported to the file system somewhere Actual Nothing happens Related issue and workaround is there The xml external entity is not disabled when parsing the xml string When analyzing malicious apk or app it may cause xml external entity injection
