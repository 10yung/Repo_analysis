Hello Our provider seems to be analyzing domain names through an http https request for and ports Is it possible to somehow configure the OpenVPN server so that with an http https request on port and it will issue a website or redirect to some popular website Please tell me what to read on this topic what to study in order to implement this Or is there an option for someone to perform this work remotely Thanks packages version openvpnsystemdresolved openvpn ubuntu rootxps openvpn version OpenVPN x pclinuxgnu SSL OpenSSL LZO LZ EPOLL PKCS MHPKTINFO AEAD built on Sep library versions OpenSSL c
