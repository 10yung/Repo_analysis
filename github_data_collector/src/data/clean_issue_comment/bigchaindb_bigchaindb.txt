Describe the bug Merry Christmas everybody I have a question regarding BigchainDB We have a setup of a cluster from nodes where each has a Tendermint and MongoDB and they are connectedWhen in one of nodes on MongoDB Level a document is deleted it does not recover itself Is that possible to solve somehow To Reproduce Install a cluster from several nodes login to MongoDB directly delete a document Expected behavior On the node where it happened it should recover itself Fixes This should make the regexbased tests considerably more efficient and more likely to find bugs weve made a lot of internal improvements since x smile Problem statement BigchainDB v b has been around for quite a while Recently we have updated Tendermint supported version to v which has incompatible blockchain Despite the fact that we have defined instructions on chain migration no one expected to migrate to incompatible chain within patch version range So there is a demand for Tendermint v compatibility among BigchainDB users Solution bigchaindbabci package was upgraded to support multiple API versions New configuration field stating tendermint version was added Make sure the title of this pull request has the form Problem A short statement of the problem Solution A short statement about how this PR solves the Problem Issues Resolved What issues does this PR resolve if any Please include lines like the following ie Resolves NNNN so that when this PR gets merged GitHub will automatically close those issues Resolves NNNN Resolves MMMM BEPs Implemented What BEPs does this pull request

bigchaindbbackendexceptionsConnectionError Authentication failed Additional context Add any other context about the problem here Is there a tutorial or how to in order to upgrade from b to versions Thank you As we have talked in gitter Im going to put a screenshot of the problem In the photo theres nodes where I have dropped the DB bigchaindb drop and reset the node tendermint unsaferesetvalidator On the node below I have set it to create empty blocks each seconds and its there where it pops up the error Nodo Secret conn As you can see it doesnt create any blocks I have waited min and If i try to do a tx with the javascript driver it returns a nil pointer exception but thats another issue and it may be related to this Any help will be appreciated After command sudo
