man fzf x I have the latest version of fzf x I have searched through the existing issues Info OS x Linux Shell x bash x zsh Problem Steps to reproduce Does anyone have an ansible task to share for installing and configuring fzf I found that the apt package for debian does not work well so its not straightforward So when installing fzf I need to use the git installation approach Also fzf automatically modifies bashrxzshrc and when using ansible this needs to be more carefully or manually controlled Any sample tasks appreciated x I have read through the manual page man fzf x I have the

through the existing issues Info OS x Linux Mac OS X Windows Etc Shell x bash x zsh fish Problem Steps to reproduce Current implementation of fzf with vim will stretch current buffer above How to keep the buffer that used with fzf separated or dont impact currentany buffer Theres clapvim but I dont like the way of clapvim use much more resources and appear in center of screen I like the way fzf appear at the bottom and has less distraction compare to clapvim The stretch issue with fzfvim also cause distraction and not clean but more acceptable than clapvim way This is a first pass at and will require some additional ideashelp I am willing to provide The idea here is to allow targeting for conservative farts like me The snap model is also pretty neat Right now this is published under an intentionally unofficial name while I continue to sort out permissions and plugins locally But there is another option available We can request to publish this snap under classic confinement This is a much easier thing to do than piece together the necessary plugs one at a time and asking for autoconnect permissions but it isnt necessarily clear to me if fzf would qualify given the link above But right now ripgrep has classic so Im thinking it is achievable for fzf given a wellreasoned case Left to do assuming there is no consensus around just going the classic route Identify additional plugspermissions for fzf to work as intended have junegunn reserve the fzf name on snapcraft publish edge release under official snapcraft name Request automatic connections to identified plugs ideal user experience imo no point to publication if users must create manual connections after installation probably update CI to automatically publish snaps on release Publish first stable snap Thanks for
