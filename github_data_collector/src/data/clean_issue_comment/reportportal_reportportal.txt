Describe the bug I am trying to create a launch by making API call See the example powershell script below I had been using this script for long I had created several launches with name

Kotlin and TestNG and gradle as the build tool compile group comepamreportportal name agentjavatestng version When I run the tests via gradle wrapper it generates a bunch of artifacts under build folder after the run I am specially interested in the xml files contents under buildtestresultsgradle task nametest classxml Since it has a systemout tag with all the standard output This has useful context around the test failure such as what API callsflows were triggered before failure Is there a way to get this information to show up in report portal buildgradle repositories jcenter

sets in yml file Before it was split into separate test methods in RP now RP shows it like attempts for Retry So I cant see failed items as To investigate Expected behavior Each data set should be

solution youd like As a user with the role of a project manager or members I want to be able to filter bugs by type in the Unique Bugs widget taking into account the types of bugs added in our project Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe On our project defects have several degrees of importance We need to display a table of blockers for the new version of the product Describe the solution youd like As a user with the rights of a project manager I want to be able highlight various dashboards in color so that it is more convenient for users to move between a large number of dashboards group dashboards into separate areas according to an arbitrary parameter or make nested multilevel dashboards a dashboard contains a group of dashboards Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Our project will use many different dashboards more than In the current situation they are arranged sequentially and the only way to sort it out somehow is to assign such names so that when sorting they line up in the right order But this is not enough It is necessary to divide dashboards into groups Describe the solution youd like As a user with the rights of a project manager I want to be able to move widgets between dashboards Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I am customizing dashboards In the process I understand that the existing dashboard needs to be split into two To do this I need to transfer some of the widgets to a new dashboard I make them shared add them to a new dashboard But I can t remove these widgets from the previous dashboard because if I delete a shared widget from one dashboard it is automatically deleted from another A similar situation in the case of combining two dashboards Describe the solution youd like As a user with the role of a project manager I want to be able to copy widgets which allows me to create similar widgets with different filters Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe When I customize dashboards I need to create a series of similar widgets that have the same functionality and are based on filters where the difference is only in the parameters For example I create widgets with launch statistics for each environment Conveniently after you create a widget you get the next one by simply copying this one and changing the name of the widget and its filter Describe the solution youd like As a user with the manager permission role I would like to be able to edit a group of filters at the same time in order to replace one common value used in these filters with a new one Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I have a large number of filters indicating the version of the product As soon as a new version of a product appears I need to change it in all filters It is long and uncomfortable Screen Shot at As a user with a manager permission role I would like to have the ability to assign the users from the project members list as test owners for the existing tests so they would be responsible for maintaining and analyzing them
