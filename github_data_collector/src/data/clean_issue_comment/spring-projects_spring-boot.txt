Im attempting to use immutable ConfigurationProperties objects with ConstructorBinding Despite the opinion of many I like my constructors to declare Optionals for optional arguments Currently I get a null value passed into my constructor if the property doesnt exist It would be nice if an empty optional could be provided if the argument is of type optional and the value is null Thoughts Juergens suggestion works great for mutable ConfigurationProperties classes but not immutable ones For further details Id like to have a class like so ConfigurationProperties public class SomeProperties NotNull private final OptionalString someConfig ConstructorBinding public SomePropertiesOptionalString someConfig thissomeConfig someConfig public OptionalString getSomeConfig return someConfig Instead my class looks like ConfigurationProperties public class SomeProperties NotNull private final OptionalString someConfig ConstructorBinding public SomePropertiesOptionalString someConfig thissomeConfig someConfig null Optionalempty someConfig public OptionalString getSomeConfig return someConfig This failure is from hasRecreateSchemaActionSet Could not reach any contact point make
