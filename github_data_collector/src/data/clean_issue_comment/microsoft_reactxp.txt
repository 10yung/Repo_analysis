Hello im trying to use react apollo hooks library to connect to a graphql backend but give me this error in render TypeError Object is not a function at ModuleuseMutation this is my component import

with Urql librate too We are using a timing animation in our button component and generate snapshots from our Storybook stories by using the storyshots addon When we generate our snapshots we get the following error when we are using the timing animation Cannot set property transform of undefined Any thoughts on this particular issue I dont see an easy quick way to see ReactXP in action without cloning the project Ideally there should be a demo link that we could play with Also the docs should inline the components instead of only listing the props This could increase the number of people that at least explore ReactXP What do you deregtd berickson erictraut think about reducing ReactXP size ReactXP has a significant size especially it is important for the web version Maybe the following issues are related When showing a modal the surrounding div seems to have hard coded styles display flex position fixed left px right px top px bottom px justifycontent center alignitems center flexdirection column flex auto alignself stretch overflow hidden zindex How can we make the background dim Implementation is just the same as the docs modal example HI i was trying to implement reactxp with threejs but i dont know how to do it anyone have any example Thanks I have a GestureView contained inside a Scrollview with width and height It is being used to detect swipepan leftright within the scrollview works fine for web and ios however seems to block scrolling or conflict with scrolling in the scrollview on android only Our reactxpelectron app has started to trigger an assertion in FocusManager when it tries using restrictFocusWithin Uncaught Error Unable to find node on an unmounted component at invariant bundlejs at findCurrentFiberUsingSlowPath bundlejs at

bundlejs This seems to happen randomly we have not found a reliable repro In the past weve seen it be caused by controls that are addedremoved from the hierarchy relatively quickly When the app randomly got into this state I tried debugging to see what was going on From what I could understand by looking at the code FocusManager stores a list of all tabbablefocusable components in the app addedremoved on mountunmount When restrictFocusWithin is used to restrict tabbable items FocusManager iterates through this collection of stored components and disables their tabIndex so only the children of the component will be tabbable When it iterates through each component the process first makes sure that the given component is still mounted the assertion and this is what is being tripped in our app I used the debug session to see which component had been unmounted and was causing the assertion to through but it appeared that every component that was being checked was tripping this assertion Most if not all of these components should not have been unmounted so something strange is making the following assertion code think that they arent mounted function assertIsMountedfiber isFiberMountedImplfiber MOUNTED invariantfalse Unable to find node on an unmounted component void Has this issue been seen before when using restrictFocusWithin Would anybody know how components might get into this state ie tripping this assertion when the component should still be mounted Is there a race case where the app might refresh and the stored components list in FocusManager might be getting out of sync When this breaks in our app it is broken until the app is killed and restarted meaning all of our modals and other components that use FocusManagerrestrictFocusWithin dont work Hi All Thanks for the great work on this library I am thoroughly enjoying using it in my first ReactXP project Im busy doing an accessibility pass on my components and noticed that the Link component does not accept the accessibilityLabel prop Is there a reason for this I am testing incoming deep linking on Android with the goal of being able to share images from the Gallery app to my RX app The code in my app is RXLinkingdeepLinkRequestEventsubscribeevent consolelogevent do something here The intent in AndroidManifestxml is intentfilter action androidnameandroidintentactionSEND category androidnameandroidintentcategoryDEFAULT data androidmimeTypeimage intentfilter I also added androidlaunchModesingleInstance as an activity parameter to ensure that the launched instance is the one with the already subscribed event The app instance launches correctly from the background when clicking the app icon in the Share via menu in the Gallery app but the deepLinkRequestEvent never triggers My code is in the same section with RXAppactivationStateChangedEvent and RXNetworkconnectivityChangedEvent which both trigger correctly on their respective events Am I missing something on how to implement deep linking with ReactXP
