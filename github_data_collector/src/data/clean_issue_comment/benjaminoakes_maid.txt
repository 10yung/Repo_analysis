uptoNASf volume homescanormyfilesmacscreencapture end end end CJK character there seems to be the problem but have no idea how to handle this Thanks to phylor there are a bunch of new changes Id like to release this as v after we can verify that things are still working The first part of that is releasing a beta which just involves bumping some versions etc Its been a while since Ive done a release so after those changes are made I also need to make sure I can release to rubygemsorg Help with bumping the internal versions and testing would be very appreciated Id also be up for updating dependencies We can drop any old Ruby versions that stop working but if the tests are still passing Im fine with keeping them for now Im still using maid but much less than I used to so thank you phylor for making some contributions Is there a way to change log file destination or redirect to streamapplication regards This allows you to do eg ruby repeat s overlap false do end so that your jobs dont run on top of each other Watch rule in daemon mode throws an error The syntax looks right as this is the sample rule Repeat rule works fine Any ideas whats wrong Tested with Ruby and Thanks

end end end end Hi have no idea where to get this info but what is the performance of this vs hazel Is it possible to unzip password protected files Somehow the Maid daemon crashes at startup when I use the move tool in a simple watch rule Any idea why this occurs and what I could do to work around this Conditions Ruby installed with Homebrew ruby watch Move screenshots do destination PicturesScreen Shots dirDesktopScreen Shot each do path movepath destination end end The daemon crashes only when there is already a screen shot on the desktop when its started If the daemon is started while there is no screenshot on the desktop it starts successfully but doesnt seem to watch the folder for changes dropping a screenshot on the desktop does nothing Replacing watch with rule and running maid clean force does the expected thing moves the screenshot in the PicturesScreen Shots directory Stack trace shell maid daemon Logging actions to UsersMichaelmaidmaidlog
