Apple changed the url from libraryios to libraryarchive Now it seems to include code samples for all platforms so may need new filtering for ios only or maybe tweaking of URL params Parsing libraryjson is broken malcsimacSamples mh ruby download rb SystemLibraryFrameworksRubyframeworkVersions usrlibruby jsoncommonrb in parse unexpected token at JSONParserError topics namePlatforms A weird issue I have is if I run it with ruby downloadrb and if it errors with URL moved even if I edit the URL to the new one and run it again it still reports same error about URL moved doesnt even check the newly edited URL very strange Some instructions on the readme page would be good like what packages needed and the command line args I think I did sudo gem install zip and sudo gem install something else I was interested in the AVTouch example which doesnt build on a current Xcode version anymore But I found this translated project Are you interested in adding this information to the README In QRunLoopOperationm Some state transitions XXX init start cancel cancelOnRunLoopThreadThread startOnRunLoopThreadThread finish dealloc This state transition do happens if the calling thread of voidcancel is exactly the same as selfactualRunLoopThread Due to waitUntilDone is set to YES in voidcancel self performSelectorselectorcancelOnRunLoopThread onThreadselfactualRunLoopThread withObjectnil waitUntilDoneYES modes selfactualRunLoopModes allObjects Is there any reason to wait until done here or waitUntilDone is supposed setting to NO Px Ux Py Uy Pz Uz Pw simddotU E Qx Vx Qy Vy Qz Vz Qw simddotV E Rx Nx Ry Ny Rz Nz Rw simddotN E Sw f return simdfloat x P Q R S actually should return transpose of result Hi Firstly I would like to thank you for the amazing code these samples have helped a lot When running CloudPhotosUsingCloudKitWithiOS on iOS it crashes and gives me the following error CloudPhotos Terminating app due to uncaught exception CNPropertyNotFetchedException reason A property was not requested when contact was fetched I have tried Adding NSContactsUsageDescription to the infoplist and that didnt work Any suggestions on what to try In Auriotouch How to detect when has frequencieseg and exist I would be interested to know if when you sync you are deleting the sample folder and adding the new one Or are you extracting the new sample and then replacing the files and deleting any that have been removed If not then the latter of a real sync would be cool because then we could see the diffs between the files inside the sample updates using Githubs web interface which would make it really easy to see what Apple are doing between updates eg what files they changed and what the changes were Eg the prerelease update to AdaptivePhotosUsingUIKitTraitsandSizeClasses I mentioned in my other issue the only update was a change from Selector to selector which seems to me a really dumb reason for updating the sample given it has broken the sample on nonlatestbeta XCodes that dont have that version of Swift yet I found that out doing my own diff but I could see me doing this again for other samples Theres probably a really easy command to sync the files from the zip to the previous folder that includes deleting any I could look into it if you like Not sure what you can do about this but you might be interested to know about prerelease samples which work on the Xcode betas youll notice the prerelease in the URL eg note libraryprereleaseios Adopt Swift language changes Updated to support split view Refactored and updated to include a storyboard version New sample code that illustrates how to make your app universal and adaptive That differs from the normal sample which is what you synced to your repo Updated to support split view Refactored and updated to include a storyboard version New sample code that illustrates how to make your app universal and adaptive I think it would be beneficial to become a repo for all versions of these samples organized by year
