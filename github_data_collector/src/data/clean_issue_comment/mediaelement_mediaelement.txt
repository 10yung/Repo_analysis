I can find no way to have captions on by default This should be possible for accessibility reasons Is there a way to enable this in the API Thank you Setup I am using medialementjs v via npm and the setup is done as part of a React component as mentioned in the docs It is running on KAIOS which I think should behave as Firefox I am facing an issue where I see quite a few calls failing out with HTTP status code On digging into the failing calls I see that the calls have byte ranges greater than the content length as determined from previous http requests of the audio file I cant find any reason why this should happen Adding the requestresponse details for a scenario host and file name are replaced with dummies GET abcmp HTTP Host abcdefcom UserAgent Mozilla Mobile LYFF iLYFF i i

There appears to be some kind of issue loading YouTube videos with MediaElement on the Brave browser based on Chrome Im not sure if this is a Brave issue or something to do with MediaElement Steps to reproduce Download open the Brave browser Im using MacOS Version Chromium Official Build bit Go to the MediaElement homepage Select YouTube as the video source Click play Expected behaviour The video should play Actual behaviour The video does not play and the following error can be seen in the developer console Access to XMLHttpRequest at from origin has been blocked by CORS policy The value of the AccessControlAllowOrigin header in the response must not be the wildcard when the requests credentials mode is include The credentials mode of requests initiated by the XMLHttpRequest is controlled by the withCredentials attribute Other notes Normal YouTube embedding appears to work fine in Brave With Chrome under Android the dropdown list becomes inactive and stops the video Looking through the documentation it is unclear whether this supports the ability to provide multiple video formats passed as sources for a single video similar to a basic html video element Ive tried loading sources with the same name such as file webm and file mp but this just results in a file playlist I know for compatibility I can use h mp alone but Id really prefer to provide webm for those that support it and will benefit especially mobile users with less access to affordable bandwidth Is this supported Thx Were getting a couple different errors with mediaelement The first is Uncaught TypeError Cannot read property userAgent of undefined We believe its related to this line which looks for default on the window which another library is changing as is relatively common If the mediaelement files are loaded after the other plugin the above error occurs If we make sure the other library is loaded after mediaelement then it doesnt throw an error Simple UMD modules will break mediaelement See this demo for an example It causes the following error Uncaught TypeError Cannot set property mejs of undefined Seems to be caused by ObjectdefinePropertyexports esModule value true conflicting with the line here Because esModule is already set on the window the interopRequireDefault function returns obj but the code is expecting it to return default obj These are things that Rollup adds to compiled UMD files so its going to be an issue with a lot of different tools It would be best to fix this on the mediaelement side since its a common break point Related to but different conflicts As per documentation load method used to reload the audiovideo element But im facing issue in case of youtube video It is working fine with self hosted video Steps to reproduce Go to link Select Youtube from selection play thie video From console execute mejsplayersmep mediaload it will not reload the player as per documentation it should reload it Same working with MP vidoe Instead of selection youtube just select MP and follow same steps as above it will reload the video Running gtmetrix report and getting performance hit by render blocking javascript I can change the enqueque code but requesting you add to your todo list to load the JS differently Thanks hello everyone Is everyone use mediaelementplugins in vue or nuxt I want to use quality plugins but i donot konw how to do it
