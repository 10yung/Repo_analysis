The treatment of static assets needs a rework as it has real limitations at the moment In the current rewrite of the extension I propose we adopt a new approach to asset management Sphinx make html Information Only The current sphinx html writer produces a static folder with a collection of assets contained in a single folder This isnt convenient for all notebook cases as it is difficult to find supportive static assets for individual notebooks It works well for large websites notebooks sphinxcontribjupyter rather than implement different ways the static assets are collected for ipynb jupyterhtml etc I propose we adopt a fileasset approach to the static folder If an rst file documentrst contains a figure picturepng then the file would be copied to staticdocumentpicturepng This allows a unique path without worrying about file collisions between documents It also helps locate static assets for notebooks For slide and course notebook cases we can modify this to include the document folder in the directory the notebook is written so it would be easy to distribute the notebook and files If math blocks contain or then the environment is not being respected during the conversion from ipynb to html and gets interpreted incorrectly Example rst math label firmdynamee st et mathbb st bar s at st bt mathbb st geq bar s This is a known issue of nbconvert The current lecture site pythonquanteconorg implements multitocs for various streams such as graduate and undergraduate It would be nice to develop a better way to specify this information rather than index proliferation as this is hard to edit and maintain Ideas Use metadata to build various supporting index files such as introducing a toc directive for build the necessary objects and the author would label each file in a category Build a more advanced web object ie network of lectures diagram that has a configuration file DrDrij would you have any idea how we could build a nicer object for presenting toc for various dimensions One idea would be a network diagram with clickable nodes showing the flow of various streams The fix here needs to be applied for linux systems it seems We are merging book pdf support without docs as a beta feature that is undocumented Rather than documenting an object that is likely to change in the refactor effort this month we will add a broad documentation update in NovDec A feature that might be useful is to have self contained html pages so they could be opened directly Currently the makesite is setup to server the html pages via a web server When running a selecting run of jupinx it looks like sphinx isnt picking up all the index pages as indextoc is not being rendered bash base reposcollablecturesourcepy jupinx cws file sourcerstpandasrst sourcerstaboutpyrst Running make clean Removing everything under build Running make website Running Sphinx v making output directory building mo targets for po files that are specified building jupyter source files given on command line updating environment added changed removed checking for homemmckyreposcollablecturesourcepysourcerststaticquanteconbib in bibtex cache not found parsing bibtex file homemmckyreposcollablecturesourcepysourcerststaticquanteconbib parsed entries looking for nowoutdated files none found pickling environment done checking consistency done preparing documents done writing output pandas copying static files copying static files to executed folder WARNING jupyterstaticpath entry homemmckyreposcollablecturesourcepystatic does not exist done Starting notebook execution for website and html conversionif set in config aboutpy pass s indexdataandempirics pass s index pass s indexlearningpython pass s pandas pass s These warnings arent always helpful as they are not required elements WARNING html folder not present in the themes directory WARNING coverage directory not found Please ensure to run coverage build before running website build and WARNING Image folder not present inside the theme folder We should add some passthrough variables that the minimal theme can use when writing a website sitetitle siteauthor sitekeywords sitedescription for jupytermakesite We should ensure to throw an error if an nbconvert process is unable to convert a file to tex A useful error message with lecture name should be issued and exit
