 Hello Seems that diff files are not syntaxhighlighted works when switching to another theme Any plans to support this Thanks in advance on selected text background color contrast is not visible Pictures can be more intuitive I dont see any license info for the Monokai Dimmed theme Is it available for me to use as a color theme in another project Thanks for a nice theme I just noticed a significant UX issue with CC files namely this file The part after define is barely readable we should probably try to find a better color for this Everything except comments is rendered either white or light blue as seen in the screenshot above Closing tags have a white and the rest of the tag light blue Since the recent update to the fantastic Monokai theme blade templates have had a shady color scheme that is different from the usual colors when working with html files Any update to fix this Here are the screenshots Working with vuehtml files Now working with blade files This is what I see after having installed via vscode market place and activated the neon theme screenshot Im assuming thats not intended behaviour I see this both on an iMac and on a windows computer
