downloadRStudioCRANdata can sure create a big request Rather than choose a range of consecutive dates I wanted to sample a few days from a wider range For instance random days over the past year I added subsampleNULL to the function parameters and this code to the function if isnumericsubsample alldays samplealldaysminlengthalldayssubsample If you like it Ill issue a pull request Thanks PS Ive never contributed to a package before The method is a bit sloppily written and saves a downloaded file with a name that derives from the URL This is hugely problematic when it comes to URLs containing parameters My method installfromurl in the package rbettersyntax avoids this issue by cleanly assigning random names It allows one to unzip files when necessary and flexibly determines where the package root folder lies Here is an example installfromurlurl unzipTRUE By contrast installrinstallURL installrinstallpackageszip cannot handle URLs like this which are quite common Hello I copied
