Id like to make three changes to the project for the sake of project cleanliness Change our formatting configuration to use Unix EOLs globally Add cargo fmt check to our CI Configure Clippy in our CI These changes will have the following dev flow impositions PRs will not be able to be merged until cargo fmt is ran PRs will not be able to be merged until cargo clippy returns clean If were fine with these changes I can go ahead an implement them Further reading Clippy Rustfmt I have been thinking about opportunities for us to harden everything and we could theoretically add Subresource Integrity to the build pipeline Since that whole flow is entirely controlled by tauri and we can fingerprint the assets are guaranteed to be the same we could potentially use this for external validation of the app where a notary knows the checksums and the app validates these checksums or die Here is something to read about SRI Custom URL schemes provide a way to reference resources inside an app Users tapping a custom URL eg yourappfoobar in an email for example launch the app in a specified context Other apps can also trigger the app to launch with specific context data for example a photo library app might display a specified image Tauri could have a simplified API to registerunregister the custom URI scheme protocol a listener A Rust package exists that does System App URI registration for macOS Linux and Windows Unfortunately this package does not support passing also the url params to the application it only triggers the application launch An example implementation together with Tauri

you must reference an issue where this binding has been proposed discussed and approved by the maintainers Bugfix x Feature New Binding Issue Code style update Refactor Buildrelated changes Other please describe Does this PR introduce a breaking change check one If yes please describe the impact and migration path for existing applications in an attached issue Filing a PR with breaking changes that has not been discussed and approved by the maintainers in an issue will be immediately closed Yes Issue x No The PR fulfills these requirements x Its submitted to the dev branch and not the master branch When resolving a specific issue its referenced in the PRs title eg fix xxx xxx where xxx is the issue number If adding a new feature the PRs description includes A convincing reason for adding this feature to avoid wasting your time its best to open a suggestion issue first and wait for approval before working on it Other information When using a SPA built with Nuxt the site does not load correctly it just shows a loadingerror page and a couple of errors appear in the console This happens using both embeddedServeractive true and false as well as running the tauri app in dev mode and ensuring the builddevPath points to a local server Ie npmimserve running the exact same dist folder although nklayman said that was not the case for him The logs that appear are as follows embeddedServeractive true SCRIPT SCRIPT Expected identifier string or number embeddedServeractive false HTML Unexpected character U NULL Null characters should not be used To Reproduce Create a new project with NuxtJS and make sure to select spa mode Build the project with yarn build and either init tauri or copy the dist folder to a tauri project Configure tauriconfjson to use the dist folder as distDir Build the tauri project and run it Expected behavior The SPA site should load correctly inside the app as happens with a usual VueJS app Screenshots LoadingError screen Platform and

operating systems different from host system Describe the solution youd like Rust Electron all have mature cross compilation systems I develop webapp in a separate frontend project and publish and operate independently but also want to build a native app use native features The current configuration file does not allow this configuration Please make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines PULL

these problems but there is no ETA The relevant code in tauri is here Ive only been able to test this on my machine so others could have different experiences Hi pretty new here but as a discussion where ongoing on the project Discord doing a tracking issue for this seemed like a good idea Disclaimer Im not an accessibility expert at all let alone a Tauri one so suggestions are highly encouraged Accessibility is something very important it allows people with vision problems and movement difficulties to use our application Electron cover this issue by using Chromium that since its a fully featured web browser already have accessibility feature builtin Tauri on the other side use many system independent webviews we must make sure to exploit all their builtin accessibility features and if possible While Tauri cant force everyone into doing accessible application we must make sure that many point are covered by it Make sure screen readers have access to the website content Aka being able to read it like a website Make sure others inputs arent overridden by Tauri like arrows tabs shift tabs so navigation on websites can be possible
