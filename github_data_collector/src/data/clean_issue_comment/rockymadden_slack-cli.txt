 Im trying to pipe a url to a channel and it always ends up formatted with backticks For example echo slack chat send ch mark I receive the message but it looks like this img width altimage src Is there a way to format piped output Apologies if I am missing the obvious but I am wondering if there is a way to obtain the number of unread messages in a given channel Many thanks As an addition to the reminder functionality there is now a way to output both reminder list and reminder info in human readable form This outputs something along the lines of this console reminder list human My recurring reminder id Rm APGDDV Do something when event happens id Rm APGEDF Check in with Paul id Rm APGSDR I completed something id RmJELLGW J This shows a non completed reminder id Rm BJGEKD Added human flag to show human readable info about reminders If flag is not set we default to showing JSON data Added docs for human flag When I try to run slack init with my slack bot token I get the following output usrlocalbinslack line usrlocaletcslackclislack No such file or directory ok false error notwritable Proposed changes use text field for chatsend when there is only text Thanks for the great utility This PR adds support for searching for a user id by their email Not sure what you want to do about the new integration test but I figured Id stick in your public github email in it for now Im seeing a bunch of failures on make test even wo my changes so I assume there must be extra environment needed to run them cleanly Please let me know if thats not true fix Please allow send message as slack app bot account We need asuserfalse when use bot token Fixes
