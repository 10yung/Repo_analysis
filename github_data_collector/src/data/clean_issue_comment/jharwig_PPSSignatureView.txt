Since iOS has deprecated OpenGL GLKView it would be great if this project could be converted to Metal I dont know how much longer OpenGL will still work in iOS Current version is iOS and it still works But still one day it will fail Would you merge and create a version if I fix the warnings that appear in xcode I did some pr to other projects and they never did so I wont do it if there is no plan in merging it Thanks Is there any plans to include Carthage support for this awesome project Thanks Hi jharwig your example app crashes when I touch Variable Width tab with this error message Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInternalInconsistencyException reason GLKViewController loadView loaded the Iy iDqVviewKH vi Sl nib but didnt get a GLKView Thank you Developers can now listen to PPSSignatureView once signing has started ended and has cleared the current signature ld library not found for lPods clang error linker command failed with exit code use v to see invocation solution open Build Settings then find out the Link Binary With Libraries then delete the libpodsa I use this in my app and wanted to know if theres a way to save the signature as an image base encoded to send via API to our payment gateway server Thanks Hi when I call signatureImage Im able to get the related UIImage but after a few moments the app crashes XCode start showing a lot of SIGABRT and EXCBADINSTRUCTION Does it happens to anybody Does anybody have a solution XCode iOS Hey Jason Thanks for a cool library It works really well Ive been using this library in an app at work We decided that we need to repopulate the screen with a previously captured signature in some use cases Say the user signs but isnt ready to save but they need to look at some other view controller in the middle of their workflow I got it working but before setting up a pull request there are a couple of things I wanted to address I tried collecting the vertices as they were generated and then passing them back to addVertex but the call to glMapBufferOES fails and the log spews a bunch of messages Attempting to copy gl buffer prematurely Since that didnt work I tried something else I added my own target to the pan and tap gesture recognizers and recorded the gesture locations and velocities in their respective views When the signature view comes back on screen I play back the gestures and the signature draws appropriately Is there a better way to redraw the vertices without mocking the gestures Im not so familiar with OpenGL ES so I might have been missing some setup in my initial implementation Also because my signature view is in a scroll view which jumps when the signature finishes as a result of some of application logic its collecting data then refreshing the screen theres a streak of ink towards the top of the signature view One last thing Id love to contribute this back to the project if its wanted but I need to clear it with my company for legal reasons I dont know if they consider the gesture recordingplayback mechanism to be their IP In the meantime more context on the GL question might help someone else even if I cant I got this error pod install The dependency PPSSignatureView fromPPSSignatureViewpodspec is not used in any concrete target CocoaPods x must need target Add target PPSSignatureDemo to Demo Podfile Thank you
