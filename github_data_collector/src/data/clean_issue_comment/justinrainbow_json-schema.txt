In some cases php warns that in CollectionContraintphp lines and schemaitems used as array but it is actually just true boolean Solution check it beforehand with isarray Note this problem happens when I use draft for schema validation eg validatejson jsonschemadraft json jsonschemadraft json Since weve pinned HHVM to and the tests are passing we should probably take it out of allowed failures now Nightly was failing to install dependencies because quite rightly people have marked their code as not working on PHP yet We can instruct composer to ignore PHP version requirements No interaction mode is already enabled due to travis setting an env variable that enforces it This PR x configures the preferred installation method via composerjson For reference see This PR x keeps packages sorted in composerjson For reference see This PR x disallows installation of multiple versions of friendsofphpphpcsfixer x removes unknown fixers from the configuration for phpcsfixer x installs friendsofphpphpcsfixer using a separate composerjson to work around PHP version incompatibilities This PR x disables the nosuperfluousphpdoctags fixer which is implicitly enabled by using the Symfony rules Related to Personally I would not use the Symfony ruleset but instead configure fixers one by one I do this with localheinzphpcsfixerconfig which allows me to reuse a configuration for friendsofphpphpcsfixer across projects Together with this works excellent by the way in keeping projects updated with a consistent configuration phpcsfixer is still trying to apply new breaking changes to the source in this case its removing parts of the documentation comments despite which was explicitly intended to prevent this CC localheinz See Make sure that library should not raise exception with example option
