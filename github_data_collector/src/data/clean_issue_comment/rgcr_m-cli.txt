I am very angry at this and I might have to go back to a system backup to restore this The wallpaper picture did exist Why did this happen macOS Hi could you please tag a new stable release The one available over Homebrew is still and this is almost years ago rgcr Add dock subcommand to add a small spacer to the doc bash defaults write comappledock persistentapps arrayadd tiletypesmallspacertile killall Dock I want to set the values in this menu Hidden dot files are not removed when running m trash clean as well as trash files stored on mounted volumes The former should be easy to fix and for the latter the command should look for mounted volumes and clear the contents in the Trashes folder Hi there what about adding help and h to the plugins Im coming from the Linux side and i recently ran m wallpaper help by mistake and it changed my wallpaper to the default Sierra one Not so great What do you think about that I love this tool for macOS Can i suggestrequest an enhancement feature It would be useful to have command completion to speed up workflow For example typing m bl Tab would complete to m bluetooth and another Tab would give you the status enable disable command options Another example is typing m b Tab this would allow you to complete to battery or bluetooth Maybe this is already implemented or there is a Mac terminal way to index commands for auto completion But if it is it was not immediately obvious to me Added a resource section in Readmemd for future reference inspiration
