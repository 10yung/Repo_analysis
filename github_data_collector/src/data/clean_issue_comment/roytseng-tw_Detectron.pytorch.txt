Hi I want to convert this model to tensorrt If someone has done please share guidance It would be great help In addition to this I am using torch trt and facing issue while building cuda engine Its throws error Unused input Kindly let me know the input and output names Thanks I followed your guidance and met the problem below when I run the code python homeliujianguojiguomaskrcnnpytorchtoolstrainnetsteppy dataset coco cfg homeliujianguojiguomaskrcnnpytorchconfigsbaselinese emaskrcnnR C xyaml bs itersize Traceback most recent call last File homeliujianguojiguomaskrcnnpytorchtoolstrainnetsteppy line in module main File homeliujianguojiguomaskrcnnpytorchtoolstrainnetsteppy line in main maskRCNN GeneralizedRCNN File homeliujianguojiguomaskrcnnpytorchlibmodelingmodelbuilderpy line in init selfinitmodules File homeliujianguojiguomaskrcnnpytorchlibmodelingmodelbuilderpy line in initmodules resnetutilsloadpretrainedimagenetweightsself File homeliujianguojiguomaskrcnnpytorchlibutilsresnetweightshelperpy line in loadpretrainedimagenetweights pretrianedstatedict convertstatedicttorchloadweightsfile File homeliujianguoanaconda envsPANetlibpython sitepackagestorchserializationpy line in load return loadf maplocation picklemodule File homeliujianguoanaconda envsPANetlibpython sitepackagestorchserializationpy line in load magicnumber picklemoduleloadf pickleUnpicklingError invalid load key x a my operating environment cuda cudnn pytorch python my GPU is geforce gtx ti I have no idea how to deal with it and really hope you can give me some suggestions I would appreciate it if you could reply to me Best wishes for you updated spelling of the default CUDAPATH in readme Hi torchvision has been released and supports ops such as nms roialign It is now possible to support PyTorch Is it possible to run inference on CPU In the forward function of the roiXconv fcgnheadpanet in fastrcnnheadspy it relies on the gpu version of the roi align How can this issue be solved This issue is somewhat related to I understand that TRAINSCALES parameter allows us to show the scaled version of the image to the model My question is will this also work in the case where object sizes vary but image size is constant In my case the size of images is mostly consistent x But the sizes of my objects of interest can vary from x pixels to x pixels Should I change the FPNRPNANCHORSTARTSIZE to start from or should I modify the set of TRAINSCALES or perhaps both add compiler version note according to fix typos on strings syntax issue on string I need to test new backbone of fasterrcnn it it a NAS model Can you tell me how do I add new backone PLEASE FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE POSTING Read the READMEmd thoroughly READMEmd is not a decoration Please search existing open and closed issues in case your issue has already been reported Please try to debug the issue in case you can solve it on your own before posting After following steps above and agreeing to provide the detailed information requested below you may continue with posting your issue Delete this line and the text above it Expected results What did you expect to see Actual results What did you observe instead Detailed steps to reproduce Eg The command that you ran System information Operating system CUDA version cuDNN version GPU models for all devices if they are not all the same python version pytorch version Anything else that seems relevant
