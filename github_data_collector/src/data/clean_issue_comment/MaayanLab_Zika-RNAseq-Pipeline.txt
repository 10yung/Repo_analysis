Hi again As I am trying to run the Zikaipynb I noticed that the link ftpftptracencbinlmnihgovsrasrainstantreadsByStudysraSRPSRP SRP is either deprecated or not accessible to everyone By following the parent directory ftpftptracencbinlmnihgovsrasrainstantreads one notices that only a sibdirectory ByRun is currently available By using SRP as a query term for SRAexplorer I retrieve the ByRunsraSRRSRR directory Could you confirm that this corresponds to the data initially included in the analysis by pointing to the deprecated by now ftpftptracencbinlmnihgovsrasrainstantreadsByStudysraSRPSRP SRP If not could you point out the discrepancies missing or additional files Here are the links ByRun associated with SRP ftpftptracencbinlmnihgovsrasrainstantreadsByRunsraSRRSRR SRR SRR sra
