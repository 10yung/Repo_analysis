Is there a way to removeuninstall removed formulas from brew using CakeBrew I recently encountered this error Can CakeBrew notify users about removed formulas please add a date column this way can see what are the latest releases eg either can sort or have drop down updatedrelease last days etc brew does show newly added but unable to see entire list because it scroll past the window of the terminal Here is full Italian localization itITxliffzip Giving an option for removing unused dependencies is very desirable There is a square in the formula popover view It would be awesome for Cakebrew to comply with the users preferences for Mojaves dark mode or enable it on an inapp basis I would like to localize Cakebrew into Turkish Would be nice to see formulas which are installable or have been installed via cask like brew cask list cheers Benny There is a small spelling error discovered within french localization see PR
