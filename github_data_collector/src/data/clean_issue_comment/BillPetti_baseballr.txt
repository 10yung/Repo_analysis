Trying to install the baseballr package using the following code devtoolsinstallgithubBillPettibaseballr I keep gettting an error saying Error Failed to install baseballr from GitHub converted from warning cannot remove prior installation of package digest Ive tried several different times and each time I get the same error with the only difference being the name of the package that cant be removed Is there any way to fix or work around this My apologies if this is a simple question as I am a fairly new user of R Hi Bill Im very new to R so Im sure this is an issue somewhere on my end I am trying to download the files and it looks like they arent being fully processed by the Chadwick tools I can see the Retrosheet files saved on my computer and it creates the all csv but its empty Is it an issue with with the Chadwick files or is there a step I missed with installing your package The other functions in your readme like teamconsistency are working so Im a little lost on where I went wrong requirebaseballr requiredplyr requirereadr getretrosheetdatapathtodirectory CUserssheffDocumentsDownloadsretrosheet yearstoacquire Parsed with column specification cols Field number coldouble Description colcharacter Header colcharacter trying URL Content type applicationzip length bytes MB downloaded MB cwevent is not recognized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file Parsed with column specification cols Field number coldouble Description colcharacter Header colcharacter Error in attrx names ascharactervalue names attribute must be the same length as the vector In addition Warning message In shellpastepastecwevent y year f pasteyear cwevent y f EV all csv execution failed with error code Introducing a new function to retrieve players by birthplace from BaseballReference Adding new visualization functions to Visualize Run Differentials within a season Visualize Standings timeline Game Behind Winning Percentage within a date period in a season Hey BillPetti Ive noticed a lot of the issues raised here are related to install the package not being updated on CRAN Is there a technical reason why it hasnt been updated or just lack of time If so I could put together a PR to align the code base with CRAN policies Is it possible to add a playid field for the dailybatterbref and dailypitcherbref functions Or is it possible to match the names to MLBID data Hey Bill Just discovered this package truly awesome stuff Curious if theres any way or if its possible to add to query batter and pitcher splits vs righties and lefties Thanks Hi there First off Im a bit of an R novice I dont know how devtools or the inner workings of R functions work that being said I ran into an error using the vizgbonperiod function code vizgbonperiod NL West error Error in mutateimpldata dots Column x is of unsupported type quoted call Currently using R latest baseballr version Can provide more details if provided the function to run to get them I think it is unnecessary I think it would be cleaner to just define geombaseballfield and let people use the existing ggplot functionality Maybe I will add this to my pull request This is an enhancement Id like to contribute to create a function similar to vizgbonperiod but to visualize the timeline of the winninglosing percentage of MLB teams on a specific period in the season
