 What version did you use How do I rename local variables in a method body without using Edit Method C which wont work in obfuscated assemblies because it fail to compile The only way I found is Right click in method body Edit IL Switch to Locals tab But sadly all local names are empty So I kinda have to guess try error which is the right variable Is it possible for dnSpy to fill the window with the local variables it displays Or is there any other way What version did you use dnSpy v NET Framework Write down all steps needed to reproduce this issue Also attach any needed files I am debugging a NET app in which a profiler injects a few mdTypeDefs and mdMethodDefs shortly after module mscorlib finishes loading However when I choose goto metadata and specify the token ID and then choose method body the token cannot be found This leads me to believe that dynamically generated tokens are invisible to dnSpy When I view metadata rows it shows me the existing tokens in the mscorlibdll assembly and none of the rows contain any newly added at runtime typemethod tokens I cant find a generated method token in a memory window either right after the last nearest token to the one I am looking for One thing is for sure by the time I get to search for these tokens they have already been emitted Any suggestions Before clicking Submit new issue try the latest build What version did you use Latest Write down all steps needed to reproduce this issue Also attach any needed files None sometimes when i edit the classes and i do something idk tons of windows pop out even if i close one another one appears making dnspy unusable maybe add something to hide these windows errors Followed instructions on front page of repo git clone recursive cd dnSpy buildps Get the following error buildps line syntax error near unexpected token string buildtfm buildps line param string buildtfm all switch NoMsbuild Before clicking Submit new issue try the latest build What version did you use dnSpy v NET Framework Write down all steps needed to reproduce this issue Also attach any needed files I have been debugging a dotnet network server program And I want to set breakpoint listening point which is systemRuntimeRemotingChannelsTcpTcpServerSocketHandlerReadHeader I got messages NET SystemRuntimeRemotingRemotingException TCP SystemRuntimeRemotingChannelsTcpTcpSocketHandlerReadAndMatchPre amble SystemRuntimeRemotingChannelsTcpTcpSocketHandlerReadVersionAndO perationUInt operation SystemRuntimeRemotingChannelsTcpTcpServerSocketHandlerReadHeade rs SystemRuntimeRemotingChannelsTcpTcpServerTransportSinkServiceRe questObject state SystemRuntimeRemotingChannelsSocketHandlerProcessRequestNow But I couldnt find that in dnspy APIs Can you explain me how to find dotnet APIs or any advise for debugging network program I used search to find APIs but there is no specific API I had never been debugging dotnet program Thanks What version did you use The newest one at least the one automatically downloaded by git Write down all steps needed to reproduce this issue Also attach any needed files Well I have a new installation of dnSpy and dotnet core for buildingx As far as I know its version when running dotnet build buildps the cmd gives me this error A compatible installed NET Core SDK for globaljson version from D dnSpy globaljson was not found Install the NET Core SDK or update D dnSpy globaljson with an installed NET Core SDK C Program Files dotnet sdk C Program Files dotnet sdk C Program Files dotnet sdk C Program Files dotnet sdk I want to disbale auto shortcut and optimal code when compile because when dnspy auto shortcut and optimal my program not work Thanks for reading I try to edit an exe and everything looks fine but when i save the module even without any edit the app crashes after a few seconds I have added the program i am talking about it is the exe in it i try to edit trikkericonzip Im maintaining a small unity game mod with modified scripts There is a lot of crossreferences between them with custom fields and methods If the game gets updated by the devs all those scripts will need to be patched at the same time and any reference that doesnt exist will make compiling individual scripts not possible Is there a way to to compile multiple scripts at the same time to ensure all references are recognized Or is there a fast workaround for this issue Thanks in advance dnspy has been immensely helpful What version did you use latest otne Write down all steps needed to reproduce this issue Also attach any needed files wanted to save one simple executable changed only this Button enabled true Save module new exe doesnt run just exits Its GUI based
