The first badge update goes through fine but then updates are only applied when the user is looking at the page This seems to be a Chrome change because it works fine in earlier versions of Chrome but the fix for the time being is to trigger the update twice Firefox runs into an error when it executes the drawImage line see below and no link tag for a favicon is in the html The reason for that error is that this browser version is not able to draw an empty image on the canvas Could you please correct that Dokument Word Would you mind clarifying your intent with dual licenses Clearly GPL is pretty restrictive and likely would have undesirable consequences when used in a web client I think that would be consider static linking and thus apply I suspect your intention language used in packagejson was that either license could apply it is at the users discretion So after Ive initialised the favicon using new Favico I noticed that there doesnt seem to be a way to update the badge coloranimation style etc There is a badge api to update the text in the badge but what if I want to update the colors Is there a way to do this The way I solve this is by reinitialising the favicons but that causes other problems is there an easier way to do this I need a very simple usage only badge without text I did it by passing a onespace string as text faviconbadge Now without text I would like to display a smaller badge is it possible Is it planned to get a wrapper for Angular Safari now supports favicons in tabs however we still cant dynamically change the favicon after the favicon has been loaded and cached This is a problem if you use Gmail Slack Travis CI AppVeyor and numerous other websites See If you use Brisk right click on the Dock icon and select Duplicate Radar and enter or File Duplicate Radar If you dont have that menu option you might have to update Brisk brew cask install brisk There is a noticeable lag in updating the favicon in the bookmark bar The page gets updated with the favicon but the bookmarked icon takes a longer time to update favicominjsformatted Deprecation getUserMedia no longer works on insecure origins To use this feature you should consider switching your application to a secure origin such as HTTPS See for more details Hi I am working on a project where we need to show notification I am using this incredible library this is awesome The scenario is whenever any new update appears the Badge pop and cover almost part of fav icon is it possible to show badge number just after fav logo Please suggest i dont want to drop this script
