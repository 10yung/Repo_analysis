Could you do a pod trunk push please Hi I get Crash log as below Crashed comapplemainthread SIGABRT ABORT at x cf raw libsystemkerneldylib pthreadkill libsystemcdylib basename CoreGraphics CGPathmovetopointCGPoint const CGAffineTransform const UIKit UIBezierPath continuousRoundedRectBezierPathwithRoundedCornerscornerRadiisegmentssmoothPillShapes UIKit UIBezierPath continuousRoundedRectBezierPathwithRoundedCornerscornerRadiussegments SDSegmentedControlm line SDStainView drawRect Hello My segment control is made of segments and I want the last one to be the first selected segment I did so by using segmentControl setSelectedSegmentIndex My problem is that when the view is loaded a part of the last segment is out of the borders of the view and I want it to be completely visible from the start Can I have some help According to the example I created a sample project in swift targeting iOS but it didnt work out as expected I couldnt get the sample control to be visible even though view debugging showed the view does exist There must be something wrong with the default appearance This works fine under IOS and lower under IOS the first time we push the view containing he SDSegmentControl all is ok the next time around Go back to previous view and back to this view the segmentControl looses appearance setting we push it see below code for the border color and width SDSegmentedControl segmentedControlAppearance SDSegmentedControlappearance segmentedControlAppearancebackgroundColor UIColor colorWithHex e alphaalpha segmentedControlAppearanceborderColor UIColor whiteColor segmentedControlAppearancearrowSize segmentedControlAppearancearrowHeightFactor segmentedControlAppearancearrowPosition SDSegmentedArrowPositionTop segmentedControlAppearanceborderWidth we see the black defaults being drawn in black if we are on IOS which is inited under commonInits as Init border bottom layer selflayer addSublayerborderBottomLayer CAShapeLayerlayer if SDISIOS selfborderColor UIColorwhiteColor selfborderWidth else selfborderColor UIColorblackColor selfborderWidth The fix I used was to directly set the color to withe and the width to under this init bypassing the usage of the appearance setter This was the way I initially was setting in my viewDidLoad of the view being pushed as follows

control labels misplaces its positions Label frame moves down visually beyond the segment control bounds segmentedViewAppearanceimageSize CGSizeMake doesnt seem to work imageSize is always x Im not sure if this the intended behavior of the segmented control but when I place the object in a view that is embedded in a Navigation Controller the segment titles dont show up I discovered that if I scrolled up within the area where the title should be the titles eventually showed up so it seems that the titles are being incorrectly positioned I also tried embedding a UIView inside a container view but I still had the same issue Any ideas When I run SDSegmentedControl Demo I try click Disable Segement Button At last The app will crash I found this code dont check selectedSegmentIndex
