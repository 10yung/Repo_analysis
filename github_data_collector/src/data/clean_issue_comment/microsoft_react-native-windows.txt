 I think were just using a warning task where we should be logging This is annoying when viewing logs or pipeline status but should not impact our build output Internal apps consuming vnext will consume Facebook React Native APIs instead of our MicrosoftReactNative APIs These will currently break if they do not manually add ReactPatches targets when updating This change leads to projects consuming React Native directories to automatically enable patching Impact of this is mitigated by changes to make patching consume less disk space along with the fact that external template based projects will not be subject to patching since they do not consume react native or import raw react native property sheets Microsoft Reviewers Open in CodeFlow Only copy and patch ReactCommon since thats the directory we currently build This reduces disk space overhead for projects from MB to under This should save MB of outputs for a full build Additionally rename some properties which were using names which are no longer accurate or may be confusing Microsoft Reviewers Open in CodeFlow Fix Change the borderradiuspadding setters to follow the same lookup pattern Clear XAML props when value is null pointerEvents accessible overflow placement Refactor the Playground View test a bit and add option for testing pointer events Microsoft Reviewers Open in CodeFlow Enable building for the

This is a template for new feature or API proposals for React Native Windows Use this to submit new APIcomponent requests or behavior updates that are specific to Windowsonly For feature requests to React Native go here instead Its fine if you dont have all the details for the template below you can start with the Summary and Rationale Read more about React Native for Windows proposal process here Proposal Platform override integration tool Build a tool to help automate the process of integrating diffs in RN W platform overrides when RN W platform does an upgrade to latest version of reactnative Summary The process of upgrading RN W to latest version of reactnative involves manually diffing every one of our platform overrides eg Dimensionswindowsjs with changes that happened in reactnativemaster This process is too manual and errorprone This proposal is tracking building a tool to help automate this process There is a spectrum of possibilities here on the simpler end it could be something that helps us with the manual process eg it could just tell us which files are interesting on the complex end it could be something that automates the process of integrating diffs Open Questions Please list any open issues that you think still need to be addressed These could include areas you think would benefit from community or the reactnativewindows team input Automatic

ReactHost implementation depends on code that we currently have in Office internally known as Mso library Recently we have published an initial set of Mso liblets as githubcommicrosoftMso project but this one is missing DispatchQueues and MsoFuture required by ReactHost In this change we add a new simplified version of DispatchQueue and existing MsoFuture directly to reactnativewindows project This is a temporary code until we put all required code into the Mso repo and implement deployment mechanisms But it should unblock us with the ReactHost implementation The new DispatchQueue implementation is missing timers and waiters but it has a much more simplified code that also can do more The new IDispatchQueueService can schedule and invoke tasks shutdown queue do task batching support Queue Local Values like TLS for threads All platforms specific work is done by IDispatchQueueScheduler implementations The change also includes implementation of noexcept attribute for IDL files that will be replaced in future with the standard noexcept attribute when we start using new Windows SDK Microsoft Reviewers Open in CodeFlow Bumps uuid from to details summaryChangelogsummary
