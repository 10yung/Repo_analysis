 PR to update persistentlogin Roundcube plugin to Inline JavaScript is an attack vector The benefits of using a content security policy is upgrading insecure requests whitelisting only allowed resources and preventing content injection Doing this has low cost and high gain You just need something like this You can also set this in a server header meta httpequivContentSecurityPolicy contentupgradeinsecurerequests defaultsrc self scriptsrc self blahblah Then move all inline JavaScript that includes attributes and script tags to a separate file for example this needs to be changed I read in the docs that currently port STARTTLS is used Is there any support or plans to support port See my article on why supporting port would be a good idea The status page states that my nameservers are set correctly at the registrar however that is currently not the case I only noticed this because I added a secondary nameserver pucknethernet which I forgot to change at my registrar I think MiaB thinks that it is correct because it queries its own DNS cache instead of the one from the registrar see line I have an issue with most likely false positives of the dovecot fail ban filter Related to this bug and possibly containing a fix is The current solution of fail ban is to give users the choice between a normal and an aggressive mode defaulting to normal Source fail ban current release dovecot filter config file What is happening In my case multiple usersdevices are sharing the IP At some point the IP gets blocked and none of them can use their mail any more varlogmaillog shows about of those lines All of them have a different session ID and some of them have TLS handshaking while some of them do not Otherwise they are all the same Jan imaplogin Info Disconnected Inactivity no auth attempts in secs user rip lip TLS handshaking sessionanonymized Jan imaplogin Info Disconnected Inactivity no auth attempts in secs user rip lip TLS sessionanonymized Jan imaplogin Info Disconnected Inactivity no auth attempts in secs user rip lip TLS handshaking sessionanonymized Jan imaplogin Info Disconnected Inactivity no auth attempts in secs user rip lip TLS sessionanonymized Jan imaplogin Info Disconnected Inactivity no auth attempts in secs user rip lip TLS sessionanonymized Jan imaplogin Info Disconnected Inactivity no auth attempts in secs user rip lip TLS sessionanonymized Jan imaplogin Info Disconnected Inactivity no auth attempts in secs user rip lip TLS handshaking sessionanonymized varlogfail banlog shows that it picks those up and at some point blocks the IP for hours fail banfilter INFO dovecot Found fail banfilter INFO dovecot Found fail banfilter INFO dovecot Found fail banfilter INFO dovecot Found fail banfilter INFO dovecot Found fail banactions NOTICE dovecot Ban fail banfilter INFO recidive Found fail banfilter INFO dovecot Found fail banactions NOTICE dovecot Unban From my investigation I would say it is what the fail ban devs reference in their jail as Removed the no auth attempts log lines from the matches because produces lots of false positives on misconfigured MTAs making regexp unusable I would be happy to figure out which MTA is the source of those issues but do not really know where to start looking Clients running are K Mail on Android Mail on iOS Thunderbird on Ubuntu maybe more I strongly suspect K Mail as the culprit Thanks for the great work to Josh and all contributors I lose mail when testing the master branch on my test server as several other servers simple cant connect anymore This appears to be caused by commit Of course I encourage innovation However if certain companies have not yet been updated This leads to mail loss including important mail And that should of course not be the intention JoshData Please postpone this commit in the final version Thanks Jan m postfixsmtpd connect from email testde adapted for privacy Jan m postfixsmtpd SSLaccept error from email testde adapted for privacy Jan m postfixsmtpd warning TLS library problem error SSL routinestlsearlypostprocessclienthellounsupported protocolsslstatemstatemsrvrc Jan m postfixsmtpd lost connection after STARTTLS from email testde adapted for privacy I am running mailinabox v and since a couple of weeks unclear exactly since when I am getting the following error message in each incoming email header XSpamReport SURBLBLOCKED ADMINISTRATOR NOTICE The query to SURBL was blocked See for more information URIs REDACTED My resolvconf looks as you would expect cat etcresolvconf nameserver Is anyone seeing the same issue What debugging steps can I take to locate and eventually fix the problem fix spelling of guarantee This release contains only bugfixes
