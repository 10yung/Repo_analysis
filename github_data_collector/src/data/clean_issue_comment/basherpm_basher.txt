With XDGDATAHOME set ie basher is installed to localsharebasher bash basher install shellspecshellspec created basher and installed under that folder Specification Arch Linux has a useful summary of defaults First shot at closing Were using gitlab internally which a operates on port and b supports nested namespaces I can imagine a shortcut so that when somebody types basher install gitgitlabinternal groupsubgroupproject basher takes the uri asis for example sitepackagemybrach the format could be sitepackagecommitsha similar to npm This PR is a proofofconcept to address the issues discussed in Specifically it Removes the unnecessary and undesirable physical path resolution in basherlink Removes code duplication of resolvelink across multiple files Implements symlink resolution in a way that works on any platform with readlink including busybox docker alpine bash images and OS X without homebrew Vendors the symlink resolution code in such a way that it does not require copyandpaste to update nor does it require extra steps for end users to install It does this by adding a new file libexecbasherrealpath This file can be sourced by anything that wants to use realpath functions such as basherlink and its tests and it also works as a bootstrap loader for basher binbasher links to libexecbasherrealpath which when run computes the location of the libexec dir puts it on the path and then execs libexecbasher This allows libexecbasher to forego any symlink calculations of its own The libexecbasherrealpath file is tracked under revision control so a checkout of basher is immediately usable without any other steps just as before However if a new upstream version of bashuprealpaths is needed a developer can shell git C vendorbashuprealpaths pull pull updated version make vendor test rebuild and test git commit a check in changes In this way the distributed version can be kept up to date with the upstream code without any manual copyandpaste Replaces pjeby hugot pawamoy Tried installing but the only files are in bashercellarbin not basherbin as described in the basher install files for what to set your path to Is it correct to have bashercellarbin in the path variable as well or should it be linking packages to basherbin Confused I have some scripts that depend on basher being initialized and I would like to run them in nonterminal places like GUI or Conky To do that I had written my own wrapper but I now think it could be included in basher as a run command The run command would be written like bash get basher install dir basherpathdirname dirname readlink e set path export PATHbasherpathbinPATH init basher eval basher init bash execute given command Note this is written for bash only I did not consider other shells You would typicall call it like bash basherbinbasher run myscript myargs An example for Conky lua execpi basherbinbasher run myscript myargs This allows for scripts to include other scripts that include other scripts without sourcing the same scripts multiple times
