I have played around the frauddatasetv csv dataset It was successful when I used the original dataset However I tried to change data in some of value in WAERS BUKRS KTOSL PRCTR BSCHL HKONT fields as a new dataset and load trained model It will throw different number of input data column error message I think the issue is caused by less data categories in one of the data fields When perform onehot encoding the newly generated column is less than the original input data used by trained model My question If we want to evaluate abnormality on a new dataset with the same data fields columns is it required to retrain the model If no do you have any preprocessing recommendation to fit new input data into trained model For example play around with onehot encoding or other preprocessing approach
