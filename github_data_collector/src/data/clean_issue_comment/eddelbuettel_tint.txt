The tuftebook class made the tintBook pdf variant possible There is nothing yet for html that is really comparable The gitbook default for bookdown has a tufte variant but I find it lacking The navigation bar is pretty awful We would need some proper js css html help and it may be a fair amount of work In the meantime the pdf variant is functional When reporting to clients they tend not to care nor wish to see the code This means its common to set knitr options such that echoFALSE With this option set arbitrary marginfigure chunk content is not shown and this fact is not otherwise documented However its easily fixed by add echoTRUE to the marginfigure chunk option I do not know if this effects the LaTeX version as I dont use latex I submitted a PR to rstudiotufte for this not sure if your repo will pick it up automatically or not
