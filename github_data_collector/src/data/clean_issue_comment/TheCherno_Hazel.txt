 Describe the bug As of now we check the OpenGL version and create an error when we do not meet the requirements However depending on the VS install the default settings might close the debugger when the program exits after the error so the user has no way of noticing the error let alone read it To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Start Hazel with an OpenGL version and you wont be able to read the error Expected behavior Have a way of notifying the user that they do not meet the minimal requirements in this case we discord conversation where thinking of implementing the log files so we can see the errors even if Hazel closes unexpectedly or unintended Describe the bug A followup on There is quite a significant overhead by the cleanup of the function name of the instrumentor as mensioned in As this is already partialy resolved there is still some cleanup to do as with the different formats of the pretty printing the stdreplace is in some cases unneeded and in other cases not enough for example using the msvc compiler we could still remove the unneeded cdecl in every function name To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Load a result in chrome tracing chrometracing and check out the function names Expected behavior The expected behavior is to have a more uniform function name across all compilers A possible solution could be to create a static function that returns the correct function name This function we could differ for each supported compiler as we already have the different pretty functions in a macro This function could even be exposed to other parts of the future debugging section of the engine I just wanted to ask if there is any reason why Cherno didnt use the chrono header file for measuring time between frames Is this just becasue of preference or maybe chrono is inefficient in some way Describe the issue if no issue has been made This PR doesnt fix any issue This PR will improve the existing OrthographicCameraController described

how to contribute to Hazel This PR addsimproves the following OrthographicCameraController Camera translation speed now scales with the zoom level implementation is different from Zoom Level and Enable Rotation can now be manually set at any timeany place There is a minmax zoom level limitation but manually setting zoom level using SetZoomLevel overrides that limitation Additional context None Describe the issue if no issue has been made This PR doesnt fix any issue This PR will improve the existing Input and described below PR impact Make sure to add closing keywords List of related

InputKey struct which represent a single key press or mouse button press Input checks now checks over the said InputKey instead of raw KeyCodesMouseCodes enum values Add an enum InputName for holding the name of an input to be mapped Add a map for key mapping each InputName key is assigned with one InputKey and are remappable at any timeany place OrthographicCameraController Update Controller to take advantage of the new Keymapping system Additional context User can also add their own InputName value at userlevel code I noticed that the Indexbuffer is using GLARRAYBUFFER instead of GLELEMENTARRAYBUFFER at glBindBufferGLARRAYBUFFER mRendererID Implements Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Not really a feature request but more of a suggestion The result files from profiling HazelProfile StartupRuntimeShutdown json shouldnt be under version control In order to not to have to keep remembering to notcommit these files it would be better if they were created in a directory outside of the source tree Describe the solution youd like Remove these json files from version control When creating instrumenation session create the files in temporary directory instead of the current directory which is likely to be within the hazel source tree Describe alternatives youve considered I considered just adding the files to gitignore But this doesnt seem like the right solution eg what if someone runs Sandboix app from a different working directory What if someone adds a new session youd then need to remember to update the gitignore Describe the issue I just fixed some code in OrthographicCamerah and OrthographicCameracpp namely made the camera movement code more compact and readable than it was before in my opinion Proposed fix That is why always write cosglm radians and singlm radians if it can be much simplified to just dX and dY Theta is simply the name of the angle around which the camera will rotate dTranslationSpeed and dRotationSpeed are speeds only multiplied by delta Well increase and decrease methods are just auxiliary they can not be used but it seems to me that the code looks cleaner name Pull Request about Propose a fix for a small issue in Hazel Describe the issue if no issue has been made A clear and concise description of what the issue is Explain the difference between the expected and the current behavior A screenshot or copy of the error could be helpful as well PR impact Make sure to add closing keywords List of related issuesPRs this will solve Impact IssuePR Issues this solves None or
