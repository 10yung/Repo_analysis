 details here If the maxConcurrency option in Clusterlaunch is undefined somehow Cluster never fires any workers and appears to stand still without any errors or warnings In my code I had set the maxConcurrency option to a variable and while refactoring code accidentally set the value to undefined causing Cluster to never process any queue items Maybe Cluster could trigger a warning or error if maxConcurrency is set to something nonnumeric I have several jobs that require running in headless false mode and therefore run them locally on my main machine Because each new page pulls Chromium to the foreground I cant do anything else while these jobs run Is there a way to run headful mode but keep the puppeteer instance in the background I tried setting CONCURRENCYPAGE which is better but still pulls the browser to the foreground on each new page Hey when I tried your example code in headlessfalse mode it opens a blank page which is idle and stays until the task are completed And if the task goes on for a long time this blank page is observed to use around Mb How can I get rid of that blank page since it consumes some memory Here is your example code which reproduces this issue
