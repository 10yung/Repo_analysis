repo from the Security Alerts page details Hi all I would like to ask if it is possible to add an image to a form For example I have created the new form and between a title and a description I want to put the picture there Or any other ideas Should I extend something inside a browsercms As I can see I think adding the picture somewhere in a form is not allowed is it zaznaczenie When the page name is long visualeditortoggle buttons are pushed off the view not visible div idvisualeditortoggle Its bunch of fixes found in rails branch rename currentuser to currentcmsuser update compassrails upgrade to paperclip fix forms editor fix cms domain setting End user reported when she added an image on the People section of the website the formatting was off The newly uploaded image is larger than the previously uploaded images Checked the CMS backend but dont see anything to confirm images should be adjusted Is this a coding issue How could I create a theme using foundation Not really a bug but for users that may wish to be able to publish html code within the WYSIWYG editor a line needs to be added to the CKE config file CKEDITORconfigallowedContent true Note that the inline editor if tables is not turned on via the toolbar will not allow table code to be displayed properly and will overwrite whatever content is in the inline editable area Once the toolbar is updated to have the table button this seems to fix the content issue The configallowedcontent is still needed but this is something that does need to be sorted out The modal which opens after clicking for incontext editing of a page is not active and appears to be part of the modals slightly opaque background As a result clicking anywhere on the modal makes the modal close and the links to any content type inside the modal cant be accessed The links themselves when accessed via the page source of the browser actually work and render the add new content dialog
