HI Does it work on an MSSql adapter How do I enable MSSQL database adapter support The manual does not mention this Is it even possible HI I have been trying to install pluins from the Redmine plugins site but man I am having so much hard time with this because whatever I try ends up borking the container with gem fails etc So I am guessing that I am constantly hitting plugins that are not meant to be for v I am wondering if we can make a good listing of working plugins for v under this topic So that we save time not waste time with trying to install unintallable plugins thanks Related to I wish reminder functionality would be implemented Hopefully it isnt a big deal Hi together just recently I bought myself a Synology DS NAS and found that it directly supports to install and run redmine from its Package Center Since this redmine version is not the latest one I came across sameersbnredmine on dockerhub I tried to download and install it from the Synology docker GUI but after startup it gives me an database connection error Ive downloaded MariaDB and setup a database along with a user equipped with the required right and connected it to docker using the DBNAME DBUSER DBPASS and so on Is there anything else I have to do in order to run it When using docker with a container orchestrator kubernetes in my case most logging infrastructures will expect your containers to send their logs through STDOUTSTDERR In this image we miss most interesting logs typically access logs because they go directly to files Moreover the location where they go is a volume which makes it way harder to symlink the logfiles to another location such as devstdout or proc fd It would be really convenient to have an environment variable that would allow all logs to be sent to STDOUT Upgrading from redmine to redmine causes unicorn to exit repeatedly This is due to the upgrade from ruby to The files in srvdockerredmineredminetmp need to be removed grep redmine dockercomposeyml redmine image
