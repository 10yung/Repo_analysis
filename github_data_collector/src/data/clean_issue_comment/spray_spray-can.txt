Hello I tried googleing around but it seems there is no support for socket activation in spraycan quite old though Is this something that can be added easily or hacked into it from the client side Hello I think I may have found a bug when dealing with HEAD requests to spraycan The documentation states By default spraycan handles HEADrequests transparently by dispatching a GETrequest to the handler and stripping of the result body See the spraycanservertransparentheadrequests setting for how to disable this behavior But it doesnt say that the head directives wont be processed as all when the setting is on Ive made an example repository with instructions on how to reproduce what I see as an error or undocumented feature here The steps to reproduce are in the README file in the linked example Is this the expected behavior If so where is it documented Currently the HttpServer only watches for timeouts for the initial part of a response ie once a chunked response is started the following response chunkes can be separated by infinitely long time periods without triggering a timeout
