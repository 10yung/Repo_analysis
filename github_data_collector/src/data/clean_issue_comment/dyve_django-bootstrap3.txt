The version attribute has been removed in from the bootstrap module This is backwards incompatible and results in errors for apps using the version info Tested with on Linux Python default Apr GCC on linux Type help copyright credits or license for more information import bootstrap bootstrap version Traceback most recent call last File stdin line in module AttributeError module bootstrap has no attribute version works fine Python default Apr GCC on linux Type help copyright credits or license for more information import bootstrap bootstrap version If I accidentally remove a field from a form but still try to render it using bootstrapfield I get an error message which doesnt really help me to track down my error bootstrap exceptionsBootstrapError Parameter field should contain a valid Django BoundField It would be nice if the error message could be more informative When using the bootstrapform template tag the generated label element does not get its title attribute populated from the helptext attribute of the corresponding model field Whereas it does work as expected for the bootstraplabel template tag This seems to be because the call to renderlabel inside the addlabel method of the FieldRenderer class in rendererspy does not include a labeltitle parameter Using the working call to renderlabel as guidance filling out the parameter like so seems to do the trick labeltitleescapestriptagsselffieldhelp In a project I am working on we generally use a fontawesome icon instead of a mere x as the close button for messages I can also imagine that in some cases you would be better to use a translated string Therefore I propose to make it possible to change the content of the close button and do it in a way that supports a translatable string or html such that the following two scenarios are supported BOOTSTRAP messageclosebutton i classfa fatimescirclei and BOOTSTRAP messageclosebutton close Since settings is cached it should be reloaded during tests when this signal is sent bumped into this one while writing a test case to check the behaviour of placeholders
