MacBook Pro inch x macOS version A x Monitor setup Screens Feature request It would be great to have a stream external source feature For example video streams Im thinking of red bull daily highlights or YouTube videos etc etc etc I know I can download videos to a specific location and it will play them aka I could do it with a daily cron but Id prefer to have an option to paste in a list of urls or some form of json etc Im not profound in swift else I would do a PR but maybe you can point me to the right direction and Ill at least try to implement it and contribute to this awesome project It would be nice if there was a setting to show the current battery level or to hide it if the battery was fully charged I would like to set the clock to a monospaced font but not the extra message under it I liked the idea of the spanned mode for multipledisplays but the resolution is too low when spreading across monitors The independent mode works well but when you have all the videos selected the that it picks can be completely unrelated to each other Since the videos are already grouped by location and by daynight could we have an option for the Independent mode to select videos from the same group for my monitors ie All the of the great wall videos or even all of the china day videos could be shown simultaneously Or all monitors could pull from the day time set of San Francisco for example showing different aspects of the same city In the current version I saw a dessert a city and an urban park from different locations when I tried it just now Even better would be getting to choose our own groups but I imagine that UI would be too complicated not worth the effort Running macbook pro with Catalina and Aerial Not running any external monitors Some videos do not run full screen and only appear in the lower left hand corner of the screen Sometimes the same video runs fine All videos selected are downloaded and in the cached folder Log and screenshot of issue attached Is this a known issue Thanks aerial AerialLogtxt Ive always used the text in the left corners but today I was looking at it and thought it might be interesting to see what it would look like centered on the top and bottom time on top description on bottom or vice versa For anybody delivering classroomstyle training workshops it can be difficult to get everybody back into the room on time The best way Ive found to do this is to put a countdown timer in minutes onscreen It puts the onus on the participant to work out when to be back so they wont be the one walking in late Everybody knows where they stand by just looking at the screen even the trainer This would also give the screensaver project some free advertising because many people will want to know where did you get that Bonus features for me would be a allowing tapping the up or down arrow on the keyboard to add or delete minutes saves opening the preference box to change time from say the prev min lunch to min pm break just tap or hold up or down key also allows you to quickly time a class exercise b play a sound when the timer reaches zero airplane seatbelt sign turnon sound c minute display flashes and or changes colour when it reaches zero d if you could get a screensaver to transmit over a webmeeting from the hosts machine that would be pretty cool for online lessons maybe this is already a thing I cant recall Love this thing thank you to the team Edit FYI I use a hotcorner to activate the screen saver
