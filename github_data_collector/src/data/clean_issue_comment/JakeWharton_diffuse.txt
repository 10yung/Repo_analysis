Have you considered having a lightweight version of input for this tool Im thinking of something like all the important stats exported to a text file Maintaining a bunch of apk snapshots for comparisons seems not to make any sense when I could be maintaining a number of text files for a fraction of the cost If the lightweight input was available I could be keeping the text file for every single commit on master or at least X last of them and using it as the base for comparisons on my Pull Requests Once its released Blocked by Id like to use dexmethodlist to find all the test methods in my apk Our tests unfortunately dont follow a convention that I can use to parse them out instead we rely on Test annotations It would be very nice if the annotations of the method could be available perhaps behind an option I tried to implement this myself but I got stuck with the DEX file format and did not get the correct annotations out Here is my WIP If you can give me a pointer in the right direction I would very much appreciate it
