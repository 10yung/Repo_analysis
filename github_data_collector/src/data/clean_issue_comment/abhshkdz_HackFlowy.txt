Thank you for providing us a such great tool In order to contribute I found a couple of bugs in the viewstask the Lists get method is not finding new elements fi pageViewcollectiongetprevSibId By switching it by a filter on the array solved the issue fi pageViewcollectionmodelsfilter node nodeid prevSibId view In the addNote method the blur occurs after the new task is inserted making the previous item to be set as empty By positioning the blur before the new note fixed the problem Hope this helps For example using ipfs eg saving to ipfs and then returning a hash so you can continue working on it also maybe enabling p p collab editing When I hold shift WorkFlowy permits to select several blocks at once but HackFlowy moves the selection over to another line After folding a list item when someone hovers over that folded item the hover option which have complete or uncomplete etc the fold option must convert to unfold option I setuped test heroku instance Each time I load it I get items in random order if you select item click on tab than on shifttab it doesnt moved to the previous position byut placed above it Also tab not always works After some time it just stop moving items or can move it in the invalid location levels at once
