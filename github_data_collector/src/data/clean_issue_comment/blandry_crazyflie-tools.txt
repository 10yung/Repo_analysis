Hi blandry I am using a really simple tracker with kinect and was wondering if it would work if I used the coordinates obtained from kinect to publish on the SEVICONCHANNEL using the firmware Thanks Hi blandry I am thinking about implementing the differential flatness controller for crazyflie based on Mellingers paper I used your code as reference and had some questions about crazyflietoolsmatlabinvertFlatOutputsm Can you give me some insights so that I can speed up my learning curve You used xyzrollpitchyawxdydzdrolldpitchdyawd as states instead of xyzrollpitchyawxdydzdpqr in Mellingers paper Why You get u omegasquared for the controller using differential flatness Then abandoned it and used u x pqr u kF instead Why And the dimension of u seems to be wrong because u is a scaler Thanks Li This is a major work item but we should try to rebase of Bitcraze latest firmware Hi Benoit Great work and thanks for sharing I found your thesis after finding this repository and it is being a great read I was wondering which firmware for the CF you would advise to download and if you had done any tests comparing your firmware against the firmware by bitcraze do you know if there is any major update they have done comparing to your latest firmware I was planning to use your estimator and the model you identified on my application I am running the whoenigcrazyflieros and was interested to improve the controller to do some precise landing and was thinking of running an LQR with your model In case you have any tips they would be greatly appreciated Thanks a lot Best Jos Hi Cant access the Vicon folder Can somebody help me Thanks Mauricio We need to reproduce the logic for the usb driver found here It created the problem that is discussed here with a temporary fix Working on this CF firmware now finished compiling with only the warnings as follows blandry help modulessrcsystemc In function systemTask modulessrcsystemc warning implicit declaration of function commanderInit Wimplicitfunctiondeclaration commanderInit modulessrcsystemc warning implicit declaration of function stabilizerInit Wimplicitfunctiondeclaration stabilizerInit modulessrcsystemc warning implicit declaration of function commanderTest Wimplicitfunctiondeclaration pass commanderTest modulessrcsystemc warning implicit declaration of function stabilizerTest Wimplicitfunctiondeclaration We need to setup better documentation for installation and usage
