issues suggestions how to fix links for us to have context eg stackoverflow etc Im submitting a x bug report Action taken what you did I started the bot at exactly UTC It ran fine for many weeks with virtually no drift However as soon as the Kraken API went down for minutes a problem occurred with the candle calculation This is a hour interval The last tick calculated before the API went down was UTC hours later at the next attempted tick the kraken API was down at It retried again times per second thats a problem in itself until The bot then stopped reporting any errors The next tick was attempted to be calculated at and I have no idea why there was a minute delay from the last error to the time when the next tick was calculated Even though this tick occurred at it calculated the tick at It went back in time The next tick occurred at but calculated a candle timestamp of I dont know how it arrived at when the last attempt was at The next tick occurred at and correctly calculated a candle timestamp of Every tick after this occurred at XX So there is a big problem there After an API failure the candle timestamp calculation goes wacky and doesnt correlate correctly to the data coming in until ticks after data has resumed In addition since the API can be down for X number of minutes the candle calculation is now X number of minutes drifted in time from original start This throws the entire strategy off Expected result what you hoped would happen Candle timestamp calculation should resume after an API failure at the next scheduled interval based on the interval specified in the strategy settings Actual result unexpected outcome Candle timestamp calculation resumes based on the a random time after API data resumes coming in Please advise how this can be properly addressed Im thinking the bot needs some internal work on the candle but in the mean time I think I could check for drift and if drift occurred automatically stop and restart the bot on the next scheduled tick I need to think how this could be accomplished Separate import jobs could retrieve data for overlapping time periods Is there any way to reconcile separate datasets containing data from the same exchange for overlapping periods of time Thanks Note this is the technical bug tracker please use other platforms for getting support and starting a non technical discussion See the getting help page for details Im submitting a x bug report question about the decisions made in the repository Action taken what you did Run the updatebinancejs script but I still cant see USDT in assets Expected result what you hoped would happen To see both USDTBTC and BTCUSDT so I can decide if I want to accumulate BTC using USDT or rather accumulate USDT using BTC Actual result unexpected outcome USDT only appears as currency not asset Other information eg detailed explanation stacktraces related issues suggestions how to fix links for us to have context eg stackoverflow etc I run the script to update pairs from Binance it works BUT I can never see any USDT as asset only as currency Why I personally would like to accumulate USDT using BTC how can I do that if I only see USDT as currency
