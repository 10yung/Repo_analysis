We shouldnt use the outdated Selenium module from this repo and use the one from the Gallery instead Im proposing to change the Endpoint terminology to Dynamic Endpoint makes little sense to new and old users alike There are two ways of doing this one breaking and one not One would be to add an alias to Endpoint and call it DynamicContent This is nonbreaking and would start a transition over to the new terminology NewUDCard DynamicContent Some stuff The second which is breaking but I like better is to include a switch parameter on components that support dynamic content Then you could switch better dynamic and static content by including the switch parameter I just think it reads better NewUDCard Content Some stuff Dynamic Would love to hear comments We have a user that was running a script in UDInput that takes about minutes It would be really cool to update the progress bar of the input as its going Add Width Height to Buttons When building dashboards with buttons they can look sloppy depending on the text content Hate This Would like to easily be able to designate a px or value like many of the other controls powershell NewUDButton Text Run OnClick Derp Icon play Width powershell NewUDButton Text Run OnClick Derp Icon play Width Describe the Issue I noticed the ReplaceToast parameter on the ShowUDToast cmdlet Either I misunderstand the function of this parameter or I am not using it right ShowUDToast Id tstSyncDraft message Syncing Duration ReplaceToast Dosometing ShowUDToast Id tstSyncDraft message Sync complete Duration ReplaceToast My expectation is that the second toast will replace the first but it just goes on top of it What Am I doing wrong To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Example Use above snippet Start Dashboard Expected behavior The Toasts should replace each other instead of stacking up Version Information Operating System win server PowerShell Version Universal Dashboard Version UD Hosting Method Powershell Additional context Add any other context about the problem here Is your Enhancement request related to a problem Please describe Today we dont get much logs for authentications providers So its very hard to debugtroubleshoot problems in this area Describe the solution youd like a new cmdlet EnableUDAuthenticationLog should have the following parameter Filepath path to log file Console Log to Console Level Level of logging Info Log Logon and LogOff Debug Log Full authentication provider traffic it could also be implemented in the already cmdlet EnableUDlogging we would then need to prefix the parameters Describe how this would improve your Universal Dashboard Quality of Life It would be much easyer to troubleshoot authentication issues Describe alternatives youve considered The alternative today it to network tracing fiddler Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the Enhancement request here Roles only work for formsbased auth and are confusing We should settle on a single way to do authorization Since more people use claimsbased auth authorization policies we should just use those and remove roles all together You can still achieve rolebased functionality with authorization policies any ways The first step is to add a warning in the next minor version that roles are deprecated The second step is to completely remove them in the next major version Warning when using Roles in Remove roles for Is your Enhancement request related to a problem Please describe kind of I want to expose link text dynamical Describe the solution youd like I want to be able to work with the NavBar I guess it need to work as an endpoint so its execute on each page load like NewUDDashboard navbar This is the complete navbar section minus the navigation part ifAuthenticated newudnavbarlink text Welcome userDisplayname link profile Attributes classnameactive else newudnavbarlink text Login link Login Describe how this would improve your Universal Dashboard Quality of Life This will make sure we can use that part of the dashboard Describe alternatives youve considered I guess it would be possible to code something that replace all of the ulnavmobile tagid Additional context Specified area Is your Enhancement request related to a problem Please describe Today we are unable to protect the dashboard globally if a user is not part of a group its only possible to do this on by limiting on every page and endpoints Describe the solution youd like I want to have the same parameter as newudpage have AuthorizedRole and AuthorizationPolicy So for access to the dashboard we can do this NewUDDashboard AuthorizedRole DashboardAccess or NewUDDashboard AuthorizationPolicy DashboardAccess and only users with that RolePolicy can access this can then be over limited on pages or Endpoints by providing thoes with another AuthorizedRole or AuthorizationPolicy Describe how this would improve your Universal Dashboard Quality of Life This will prevent alot of duplicated code in the source Describe alternatives youve considered Alternative is to control it in the Claim soruce ADFS for my usecase but it would make it very static as ADFS are controlled by another team Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the Enhancement request here Is your Enhancement request related to a problem Today we are unable to protect endpoints that are created outside of a page like scheduled endpoints Describe the solution youd like I want to have the same parameter as newudpage have AuthorizedRole and AuthorizationPolicy Describe how this would improve your Universal Dashboard Quality of Life This will prevent leaking of confidential informations to users that are not allowed to see it Describe alternatives youve considered I guess it would be possible to code this into every endpoint myself by using GetUDAuthorizationPolicy but its a tidius and bloating approach Additional context Adam Agree its a miss on his page D
