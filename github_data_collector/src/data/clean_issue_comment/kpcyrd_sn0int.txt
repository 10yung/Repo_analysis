There should be a first class command to check the api status of a given key like the current credits This could be done with a regular script that takes a keypair as input Updating the database directly is cumbersome there should be a way to setunset the featured flag and the new properties described in This should be tied to a moderator role that can be assigned to users We want to expand the current api responses with the following features Flag modules as defunct Allow redirecting modules to other modules with an automatic update This is used to rename modules or transfer ownership to a new maintainer Deprecate modules to automatically uninstall them not sure if we actually want this All of these are automatically overwrittencleared by uploading a new update In addition to we should add tooling to run CI for module repos As an example the modules currently in kpcyrdsn int should be moved into their own repo with CI enabled Hello If you want to report a bug we added some common questions below that help us analyse your issue faster All of these are optional so feel free to remove anything that doesnt apply snOint fails to install on Kali Linux Rolling This is the output rootxxxxx sn int git master cargo install f path Installing sn int v rootsn int Updating cratesio index Compiling ring v Compiling url v error E use of unstable library feature alloc this library is unlikely to be stabilized in its current form or name see issue rootcargoregistrysrcgithubcom ecc db ec ring srclibrs extern crate alloc error aborting due to previous error For more information about this error try rustc explain E error Could not compile ring warning build failed waiting for other jobs to finish error failed to compile sn int v rootsn int intermediate artifacts can be found at rootsn inttarget Caused by build failed cargo install f path s user s system cpu total How to fix that to test sn int Regards Olaf Versions rustc version rustc cargo version cargo sn int version not yet built due to the error described above uname a Linux xxxxxx kali amd SMP Debian kali x GNULinux Environment Operating SystemDistro cat etcissue Kali GNULinux Rolling n l Installed from sourceaptpacmanbrewdocker source githubcom v cloned two hours ago Thank you Well try to respond as quickly as possible Theres currently no way to learn about newly featured modules besides running quickstart occisionally We could include the list of featured modules in the update check response mod seems slightly overloaded andor counterintuitive since we claim to be a package manager we should consider changing the wording to package and pkg while keeping mod as an alias This is a somewhat invasive change but something we should decide before further investing into the mod term There are a few shortcomings that should be fixed before the next release x accounts should have a phonenumber field devices should have location fields for locations that arent tied to a network struct see also x domains subdomains and emails should be lowercased automatically x accounts should have a profile picture field that points to an image blob x accounts should have a birthday field x networks should have a description field devices should have a firstseen field Right now we can have TTLs for structs and links but we cant have a TTL for fields like location info that expires over time Im not sure whats the best way to go here yet This is a bit of a larger problemthought Mostall datetime are built around the idea very specific timestamps often with minute or second precision In some cases were getting data like on or day ago which is rather inaccurate We could try to translate into but it would be hard to tell if we mean at some point at that day or exactly at this time day ago is even worse because this is usually range of h h m
