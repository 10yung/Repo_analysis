i excluded all chest armors that i dont want so in pic we have subsitutionals robes all with T as solar only cos void like you see on list is excluded but its missing arc ok now as pic lets add that solar to exclude and modify nothing magic now we have arc on T with possibilities and as pic same bug is in beta version of dim pic pic pic Im trying to build an armor set that includes at least two season mods one is general one is void I dont care which piece takes them as long as one of them takes each Currently this is impossible I could filter for season but I dont need every piece to be season I can select the protective light mod but I have to choose when selecting it which armor piece it goes in and at this stage I dont know or care My suggestion is that the seasonal mods not have a slot attached to them as they can be applied anywhere custom stat total column saves preferences for each class kcxLSu cct Only fetch once every hours unless a user explicitly requests it This addresses and probably our collective sanity In Loadout Optimizer you use shiftclick to select a perk but to exclude an item This is both confusing and not obvious From a UI point of view it would be more consistent to drag the perk into the select mod or perk area in the same way that dragging items to include or exclude them The autocomplete order starting with isarmor looks like this The problem is that isarmor will autocomplete before isarmor but armor is a qualifier not a primary type so isarmor is a subset of isarmor The order should give the widest match first This is purely cosmetic but the Ghost Projection icon in collections is more than twice as wide as any of the others and it makes the text not line up If there isnt a normal width icon Id remove it completely so its like Badges I dont really like the attempt at a color scale for stats in the compare view This replaces them with just white text and a highlight for the best value The only thing this really loses is cases where all the stats are the same those used to be the only white stats img width altScreen Shot at PM src We should show the notification only when the wish list is loadedupdated not every load When using the sourceironbanner search its not detecting the current seasons armor Screen Shot at PM
