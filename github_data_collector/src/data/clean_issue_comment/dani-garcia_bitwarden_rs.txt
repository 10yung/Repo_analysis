 Subject of the issue Hi I started getting a strange issue The BWRS container becomes unresponsive sometime after starting when I sya unresponsive I mean unresponsive to browsing via clients like Firefox I can neither access the local ip nor the reverse proxied url The Docker logs shows nothing it looks as if it is running normally Here last couple lines from docker logs f bitwarden request INFO POST notificationshubnegotiate response INFO POST notificationshubnegotiate negotiate OK Your environment Debian Testing Docker docker run d name bitwarden v mediabitwardendata p p restartalways bitwardenrsserverlatest Bitwardenrs version Install method Docker Clients used Firefox Android Reverse proxy and version Apache Other relevant information Steps to reproduce Start the Docker container wand wait about half an hour the web page is unaccessible Expected behaviour I should be able to access the site nomatter how long the container was up and running Actual behaviour The site is not reachable The site is initally reachable for a while but after sometime it is not reachable via all the IPs the server has or the reverse proxy via Apache Relevant logs curl v Expire in ms for

Bitwardenrs logs request INFO PUT apitwofactoru f error ERROR U fError CAUSE BadCertificate response INFO PUT apitwofactoru f activateu fput Bad Request Currently uppercase bool values seems not to work eg SIGNUPSALLOWEDFalse which is really confusing and can lead to missconfigured public servers Normally most common boolish string values like yesnoyntruefalseTrueFalse should be converted to a real bool while reading env variables Hello I have problem with the ios APP Web Vault works fine Sync Failed in the log is bitwardenrsapiidentity WARN Detected unexpected parameter during login devicepushtoken auth ERROR Unauthorized Error Invalid device id Can I somehow clean the device It could be handy to have some basic CLI options for the bitwardenrs binary in place Minimum set could be something like bitwardenrs help and bitwardenrs version These CLI options can also be used to verify if the compiled binary is executable Hello I just compiled bitwardenrs using postgresql now im setting my bitwardenrsenv file and I dont really if im supposed to point to a database and if yes what should i set in front of DATABASEURL thanks a lot for all your work Hi there I originally created a template for the bitwardenrs docker container for use with unRAID Now that there is an official docker image and unRAID template I have depreciated my template I have had since then a few support questions and I just want to know where to direct people Typically a support thread is opened on the unRAID forums and support is provided there but if you would prefer it to be over here on github then thats cool I just want to know where to send people Thanks for making this awesome software I use it every day Unless I overlooked them there arent any notes specifying these key points when configuring SSL for containers Certificates must be in RSA format If they arent it will complain it could not parse the environment variables and fail to start I spent a lot of time trying to use an ECDSA key not realizing this Switched to RSA and things started working after cleaning up other debugging steps I took Use the environment variable ROCKETPORT to change the system to listen on if necessary I had to do this for it to run on Google Cloud Platform GCP You could probably also just port forward to if youd like but this seems to be a more ideal solution at least for me You can always change the port to something completely different as well if desired ex If you plan on using Cloudflare in front of your install I highly recommend using the Full Strict SSLTLS option if possible This ensures the highest level of security meaning your server has a valid signed certificate being used To use Cloudflare with minimal hassle and not having to fight with LetsEncrypt Generate an origin certificate if desired its free for all plans on Cloudflare Install the certs to your container storage somewhere Use ROCKETTLS to point to both files Use ROCKETPORT to change the default port to Switch Full Strict SSLTLS on for the domain on Cloudflare Note the longest period a generated origin cert can be set valid for is years Additionally these certs are only trusted by Cloudflares origin servers hence why its signed by them The general publics browsers will still freak out There is a possibility the cert will be terminated earlier than years at Cloudflares discretion and you would need to update your cert again ifwhen it expires or gets revoked This is just a matter of signing in to your control panel clicking a few things copying the text and pasting it over the files on your server then reloading it Sure not automated like LE but considering the time it takes in comparison its not that bad You can always regenerate new certs ahead of time as well to extend the final expiration date Im not expecting all of this to be added to the wiki Im just dropping it here in case anyone else is having issues and cant figure it out Might save them some time Hi guys Maybe a dumb question but where in the code is this logic handled Is it possible to set limits per accountorganization or is it a global setting for everyone Cheers Hey there no actual issue but I dont want to miss anything We are using Bitwarden hosted at our Servers and dislike this heavy infrastructure for only users As I read this implementation should be far more lightweight and easier to maintain than the official one I have a few questions which I was not able to find answers for in the wiki or in other issues How to Migrate from Bitwarden Server to Bitwarden RS Server We have a running bitwarden instance What do we need to migrate the MSSql Installation to this Docker is no issue but I dont know Rust Organisations for Free With this server it looks like we are not required to pay money to Bitwarden anymore I read that you request your users to still pay money to Bitwarden for Client and Co update We are going to do this but did I understand the texts right How to Update the Server When we have all data in Bitwarden RS what is necessary to update the server How often do we get bitwarden client releases and have to wait before we are able to work with Bitwarden RS again Are data migrations to new formats done within the server or do we have to start scripts manually Is this even a thing Just to know how stable this will be as this will become a very important part of our infrastructure Have a nice weekend Bastian
