I was able to do a apt search and found lolcat on there so I thought about adding this Captura de pantalla de photo I have a slightly odd environment so it might be that It is Windows Cygwin Mintty zsh also tested with Bash This is the first time Ive opened an issue on Github Dont know if the screenshot will workI dont know much about Ruby so forgive me if its not helpful Hello World I would like to see a bonfire colorized terminal output like the one with a rainbow What keywords should I use to google it For a file which file reports as Littleendian UTF Unicode text with CRLF line terminators lolcat produces no output at all Any setting I need to tweak lolcat is awesome and more people should know about it than just the people browsing gems I work on the Snap Store which gets browsed by millions of Linux users so I put together a snap of lolcat to get more eyes on it To build it snap install snapcraft from Ubuntu or install Multipass on MacOS then brew install snapcraft Then run snapcraft to create the snap file To publish create an account then snapcraft login snapcraft register lolcat snapcraft push releasestable snap From there you can add screenshots and videos so they show up on Hope this helps I pipe a few scripts through lolcat because rainbow output is awesome However I noticed that when a script includes an emoji in its output such as beer from certain homebrew output lines lolcat fails at the emoji and the remaining output is dropped For reference Im on OSX and installed lolcat using homebrew
