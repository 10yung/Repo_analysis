Hi I am having below error DesktopAppsOpen Source AppscanabaltiosmasterImportFromCoreDatabestrunsxcdatamodeld NSUserStringVariant not getting coredata file please help Is there any possibility of compiling Canabalt to HTML so that it s playable on mobile through the browser Would be quite cool to have this on Firefox OS for example The readme here on github should have some more info In particular it seems weird to me that it doesnt link to the app on the appstore This one I presume but without a link in the readme theres potential confusion There are openAL issues with iOS Sound effects do not play but music is fine Hello Here are two patches that allow the project to build with Xcode Thanks Philippe
