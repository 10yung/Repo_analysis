There are many files in JUCE that contain include JuceLibraryCodeJuceHeaderh though there is no such JuceHeaderh file at that relative location For instance but JUCEexamplesDemoRunnerSourceJuceLibraryCodeJuceHeaderh doesnt exist The code compiles because the JuceLibraryCode folder itself is part of the include search path In more details the compiler first fails to find JuceHeaderh relatively to the source file that includes it it falls back to the include search path it resolves JuceLibraryCodeJuceHeaderh from JuceLibraryCode which always works for any project generated by Projucer Since JUCE Projucer has always added the JuceLibraryCode folder to the include search path so it is safe to write include JuceHeaderh in any project generated by Projucer Thus I propose to always use include JuceHeaderh It is shorter it stands out from the other relative includes and it is always correct Also it simplifies a bit the code of Projucer which doesnt have to deal with computing relative paths to JuceHeaderh anymore ed tpoole feel free to merge at will Please include detailed steps on how to reproduce the bug preferably with already existing JUCE code such as the demo plugin or the demo code Create a class that inherits from DragAndDropContainer and implements dragOperationStarted Add a child Component that calls DragAndDropContainerstartDragging

ShowWindow F I was testing our plugins in Waveform Windows with HiDpi enabled and encountered this bug As I assume it s built with Juce I believe this is the right place to report this All other hosts I ve tested Cubase Studio One FL Studio Wavelab Bitwig expect to send and receive mouse coordinates in screen device pixels unlike macOS which works in deviceindepent coordinates this is a legacy of win I believe The result is that the context menu is displayed at the wrong coordinates Waveform must be applying dpi ratio a second time as can be seen on the screenshot below using a vst official sample just to check it s not a bug in our code It was a missing feature on Linux I declare all my changes are licensed under MIT or ISC or whatever liberal edited modulesjucecorenativewin Networkcpp
