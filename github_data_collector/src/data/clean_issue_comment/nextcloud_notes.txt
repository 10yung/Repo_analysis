See Currently HTTP Status code is returned It would be much better if the clients could display an appropriate error message why the sync failed I have Nextcloud running on a Slackware current server on my home network I have two tablets and two phones all Android with the latest Notes installed from the FDroid repository Only one of each still have an active data plan with Verizon All are configured to upload only via WiFi and only when connected to my WAP both bands of which are configured with SSID broadcast turned off There is a m n wall fork running on a dualport computer between my networks and Roadrunner Updates and new notes are made on whichever device is easiest to reach Occasionally edits and new notes are entered while out of WiFi range After editing or creating a note some will sit and spin attempting to upload but even two days later will not have uploaded Phones Pixel a Samsung S Tablets ASUS Zenpad Z Samsung Galaxy Tab E WAP Netgear R Dualband uses firewall for DNS FIrewall is configured to accept just the machine name for internal lookup only Steps to secure WAP Turn off SSID broadcast Change SSID to be at least characters Add password of at least

added SFTPpi Syncnotes The Sync folder was not there Refresh notes and see it crashing The settings cogwheel disappears so the only solution is to create the folder path above in the SFTP folder and then correct the path Expected behaviour An error message should be shown after validating the SFTP folder path Actual behaviour Notes app crashes and there is no clue is given as to what happened

its strange to tell users to use this feature here and the other feature there An then they tell ure silly to set up a system such this experimental Cloud and last Hey dude Google and M can do this and u wont Aehm why ure using Linux Sorry again But welcome to my life Fixes see discussion under especially Thanks to paulschwoerer for help on implementing this For now Im using the old OCNotification API since I want to be compatible to Nextcloud We will switch to the new OCPToast API later grafik jancborchardt Is this how you imagined Describe the bug Notes display a blank screen with a little on the left and Fetching notes has failed See JavaScript console for details on top right To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Click on Notes Server please complete the following information Notes app version Nextcloud version Nextcloud OS Ubuntu Web server Nginx PHP version Database Mariadb Client please complete the following information Browser incl version Firefox OS Fedora Log files Browsers JavaScript console Error Request failed with status code exports exports onreadystatechange fetchNotes this is reachable Hi all The hyper links dont show on my browser when in preview mode The hyperlinks are not clickable when in editing mode Some times I just need to have a view of the contents of the note without some of the details Using some advanced editors eg VIM is it possible to fold some text sections like chapters and sections which is great to solve the problem above As a solution it would be possible to enable folding of any header sections or at least support the tags details and summary as Github already does for example as well as Gitlab and other public repositories as far as I know like below details summary Title of the folded section summary hidden content details I use notes daily and love it I tried many options for a front end on mobile phone but I find that the web version is just right a part of some small things that I will try to fix later Motivation The thing is that when you tap Add to Home screen in chrome it always saves the Nextcloud default app ie files which is in the way when youre trying to quickly add some note Solution Ive looked through the code that is responsible of adding the manifest file and found that there is a default app theming that looks if the appsappimgmanifestjson file is available and adds it otherwise it generates its own manifest in the ThemingDefaultsphp file php if image manifestjson try appPath thisappManagergetAppPathapp if fileexistsappPath imgmanifestjson return false catch AppPathNotFoundException e route thisurlGeneratorlinkToRoutethemingTheminggetManifest but then the main htaccess file is redirecting all the files to So I decided to make a pull request there where I would allow apps to have their proper manifest files Result With changes to server and the manifestjson within this PR I get And Im able to save Notes app to desktop and access it quickly PS I also created a sandbox to be able to quickly debug apps Follow up of The design has to be fixed see
