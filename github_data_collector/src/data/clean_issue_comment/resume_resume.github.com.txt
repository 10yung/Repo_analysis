I optedin and got my resume but it wont let me share It says user not found It looks like the project list is not sorted by stars what is it sorted by Test download Thank you for this awesome project I noticed that my GitHub resume did not list repos to which I had push access My resume link Unlisted repos I checked the relevant GitHub documentation and it has a query parameter to request all repos This will include repos of which I am either owner or member This PR adds the query parameter to the API request I was able to confirm the behavior with GET API requests Default type owner Type all I have not tested this locally but I am reasonably confident that this should work Information is a noncountable noun so it should say just information not informations Since this only uses public data I see no reason this app should require optin Why do we need anyones permission to publish already public data Quoting the generated document at This r sum is generated automatically using public information from the developers GitHub account not support case please fixed it thanks
