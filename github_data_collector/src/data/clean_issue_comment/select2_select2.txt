I have used select and need the scroll bar as below pic But found the scroll bar will autoscrolling to bottom when I click it or open options Debugging the source found the root cause is when container closeopenfocus the search will be focused My question is why the search should be focused automatic Select Jquery browser Chrome Version Cheers Last updated in There is a strange issue Im facing that I cant find the way to solve and to identify from where the issue could come The steps to reproduce I have a form with a select element Turns this select into a select The forms includes the ability to duplicate the entire form When the forms get cloned I have a function to reinitialize the select element to make them work again thourh using the select destroyselect The cloned select work correctly and as expected But the strange things happens that the previous select the original from the first form gets destroyed I was checking it in several ways and I cant find the issue some of my checks and security workflows I tried to follow are I ensure to append the cloned element first and before query it again through the jQuey selector I tried to separate the destroy function from the reinitialization as this clonedselect destroy clonedselect Instead of process everything in the same line clonedselect destroyselect Both functions destroy and reinitialization destroys the original element I tried to run only one of the functions and both continues destroying the original one So Is possible there is some internal link between those elements that causes the destruction of the original one Thanks in advance for any help on this Im using select with maximized height and paginated ajax data When the first page is loaded when the select is resized the load more results appear And if the the scrollbar is removed because all the first page results are showed its impossible to fix the state Hi My usecase is dynamically create a select element and then I need to remove it from the page after it has been changeduser selected something or cleared selection or user just click on another element For such case select close event suits pretty well But Im getting the following error with latest chrome and latest select version Uncaught TypeError Cannot read property query of null at danonymous select fullminjs at deinvoke select fullminjs at detrigger select fullminjs at dtrigger select fullminjs at dopen select fullminjs at dtoggleDropdown select fullminjs at oanonymous select fullminjs at oeinvoke select fullminjs at oetrigger select fullminjs at oehandleClear select fullminjs It appears only when Im trying to clear selection by clicking on the clear all icon Ive created codepen snippet for this issue Steps to reproduce Create a select with the following options minimumResultsForSearch Infinity placeholder Select option allowClear true Select any option Click clear icon and an error will be showed in browser console The workaround for this issue is to use setTimeout destroySelect But I think that its still the issue with a select component This pull request includes a x Bug fix Hi the Contribute link returned for me Page Not Found This is a fix for it Thank you all for this awesome library PS Another thing this link is returning not found too It appears at the side of the Contribute link Im not sure how to solve this so Im just saying there was a discussion in Options with empty value will not be shown i want to have an option to insert an emptyblank line as separator of my options Like Labels but not a label At the Moment we use this as a simple way of grouping opitons with a normal select option list i can insert an empty option this will be displayed as a empty line and so it is a visual separator with the use of select this emtpy option is removed how can i get a separator without using labels Hi Im having this warning message Added nonpassive event listener to a scrollblocking wheel event its refer to this line thisaddEventListener toBind i handler false How can we fix it Thanks This pull request includes a X Bug fix New feature Translation The following changes were made Rather than triggering DOM updates for every mutation within the select only do it once if at least one mutation is detected Ive had an issue when using select with datatables editor I have a dropdown that has elements loaded via datatables editor and ajax Everytime I filtersortchange page on the table a new request fires to get the data the correct page but also annoyingly and seemingly unnecessarily the list of options for the dropdown gets returned again This then causes the page to become unresponsive as select goes through and refreshes the DOM I think its certainly doing something along those lines times for each option being removed and times for each option being added This issue didnt exist before and the below changes fix it All tests are still passing but I could very easily have overlooked something important though Hello this is not an ISSUE but maybe future feature html data attr placeholder for element for multiple selector not rendering their own placeholder example select classexample dataplaceholderexample select classexample dataplaceholderexample active select function example example select now both select box shows the first select box placeholder
