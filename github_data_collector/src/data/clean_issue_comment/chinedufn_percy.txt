Ive implemented custom components in Percy similar to what you see in React so users can use a MyComponent pattern rather than mycomponent which feels a bit more up to date with competitor frameworks Ive had to implement a list of valid html tags to do this I took them from here If this isnt the best way of going around this please let me know or if this is an unwanted change then thats fine too I tried to implement children in the same way React handles them ie a children prop gets added into the child component but Ive been round in circles with this I kept hitting borrowing problems I also had a look how Yew does it which is similar to React and still couldnt figure out a nice way of doing it Any help on this would be appreciated Children actually do work but theyre just appended to the end of the parent like in the normal HTML tags Im hoping it wouldnt require a huge refactor for it When running clientside the unsafeinnerhtml attribute does not update the inner html when passed to DomUpdater For example the second and third assertions fail in rust featureprocmacrohygiene extern crate wasmbindgentest use wasmbindgenJsCast use wasmbindgentest use websysElement use virtualdomrsprelude wasmbindgentestconfigureruninbrowser wasmbindgentest fn testinner let div html div unsafeinnerhtmlspanhispandiv let mut updater DomUpdaternewdiv let node Element updaterrootnodeuncheckedinto asserteqnodeinnerhtml spanhispan let div html divspanhellospandiv updaterupdatediv let node Element updaterrootnodeuncheckedinto asserteqnodeinnerhtml spanhellospan let div html div unsafeinnerhtmlspangoodbyespandiv updaterupdatediv let node Element updaterrootnodeuncheckedinto asserteqnodeinnerhtml spangoodbyespan There seems to be a bug when navigating to the catchall route but not contributors ex localhost test The current implementation panics using both rocket and actix as server Rocket currently has for unknown routes and this should be added to the actix example as well I was wondering if Percy is looking into integration andor contribution to alternative templating libraries such as maud Investigate memory usage a bit by clicking between the contributors page and home page in the demo Make the DOMUpdater free closures that are no longer being used Hi Id like to trigger a change to state in this case to hide an element when a page is visited To do so I put a msg in an onvisit handler like so route path mypage onvisit hidesidenav fn myroutestore ProvidedRcRefCellStore VirtualNode MyViewnewRcclone storerender fn hidesidenavstore ProvidedRcRefCellStore storeborrowmutmsg MsgHideSideNav Expected behavior Page loads and the element Ive specified is hidden as a result of the above message being sent Actual behavior This runtime error panicked at already borrowed BorrowMutError Minimal Reproducible Example In the isomorphic example you can reproduce by changing downloadcontributersjson to send a message like so route path contributors onvisit downloadcontributorsjson fn contributorsroutestore ProvidedRcRefCellStore VirtualNode ContributorsViewnewRcclone storerender fn downloadcontributorsjsonstore ProvidedRcRefCellStore storeborrowmutmsg MsgInitiatedContributorsDownload Arbitrary message Notes From reading a little bit about the error is that its more of an RcRefCell problem than a percy problem I thought would be useful to post it here anyways because I imagine others will get snagged on it at some point buildwasmsh line wasmpack command not found error toolchain nightlyx unknownlinuxgnu is not installed But it is installed Is it possible to use Percy to develop applications with Sciter for frontend Is there already a way to initialize a Virtual DOM from an actual DOM element This is despite I think that the requirement can be removed from Ill give this a shot locally and open a PR if its working
