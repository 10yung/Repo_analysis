It seems like you dont need to store visibleItemCount totalItemCount and firstVisibleItem as member variables of the listener since they are recalculated on every invocation of onScrolled and arent used anywhere else Also I guess it is a good coding practice to store VISIBLETHRESHOLD as a const val in the listeners companion object Use compile SDK version Gradle Use new version of Kotlin Coroutine Update unit test with Spek
