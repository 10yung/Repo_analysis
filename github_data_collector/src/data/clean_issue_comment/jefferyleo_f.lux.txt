I have a jailbroken iPhone running iOS with h lix jailbreak Ive always used flux from the cydia repo I think it was version without any issues A few weeks ago I was unable to sign my jailbreak so I side loaded flux with the Xcode project from this repo version I am now jailbroken again and uninstalled the old flux version from cydia and kept the side loaded version and keep signing it with provenance every week I use the new darkroom feature every night but after a couple of days after a reboot the red tint gets stuck and the screen does not return to its normal colors during the day I also cant change any settings in flux change temperature disable preview only darkroom works The colors are not inverted when dark room feature is disabled but the tint stays I attached a couple of pics to clarify what I mean Is there anything I can do to fix this I just want to open Flux with Alfred and when its open my screen is dimmed to a single preset Then when I exit out of Flux I want it to return to normal brightness I sleep at completely random times and When I wake up is useless Messing with settings so that I can turn it onoff causes me to simply not use this app as much as Id like to maybe check once a day or once an hour and update locationtime zone with OS Hi I am getting the following error from Xcode when I try to build this app Target iflux has copy command from UsersbDownloadsfluxfluxmasteriflux to UsersbLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataifluxciglrfbteqzwqafnuwfvdkdacxohBuildProductsDebugiphoneosifluxappiflux Target iflux has link command with output UsersbLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataifluxciglrfbteqzwqafnuwfvdkdacxohBuildProductsDebugiphoneosifluxappiflux I had a look through all the files for copylink commands but could not find the cause this is the only issue with the build process Trying to build for iPad running iOS Please make flux work for iOS fLux is way better than Nighthift on an iPhone X because the way Apple implemented it makes all text go blurry when scrolling It looks like there is a yellow layer that scrolls slower than the rest And we have a new Electra jailbreak now from beta screen shot at pm img Im working on an app which combines by other apps altogether and want to run my apps Any way I can do this I am on windows and as such i can onlu use cydia impactor to install ipas I hate using GH issues like forum comments but sorry I mistakenly updated my iPad original retina to iOS thinking I could use the latest Jailbreak on it oops Also discovered that that Apples nightshift doesnt work on bit devices either which is ridiculous Since I only use my iPad for reading in bed at night that suddenly because a rather painful experience The good news is I was able to sideload this version of Flux on it and its working just fine yay It sounds like the current Cydia version of Flux might not be compatible with yet but FWIW this version sideload seems to be I want to use launch center pro quickly open flux enable action Can add url schemes do enable action
