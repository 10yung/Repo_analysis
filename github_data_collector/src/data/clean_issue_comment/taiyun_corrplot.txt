Hello corrplot guys Im using this package for my project and its really a wonderful tool But I found that the pvalues output from pmat cormtestMp have bugs that means some calculated p values are higher than the correct ones which are validated by SPSS If the bugs can be solved that will be great Thanks a lot for developing this package TJ Same question as these guys range is correct but the colour palette is whiteblue and not the expected redwhiteblue corrplotcorrcorCorObavexpmethod colororder hclusttlcolblackaddrect addCoefcol greycllim cmin iscorrFALSE taiyun yihui COSEditor Thank you for developing the corrplot package I like the feature that this message pops up when loading the package r librarycorrplot corrplot loaded As an R package developer how did you make it appear Thanks Hi I enjoy using this package I ran into some issue with color display today I notice the color of some of the cells are not displayed according to the color label For example the positive values in column and should be red not blue I wonder anyone else run into this issue Hi there I am facing the same problem as and have been struggling with this otherwise great package I do want to use this package but also have control over the displayed range and colors Would have been nice if the authors had considered this feature Are there any workarounds to properly limit the correlation range to anything other than and also map to the full range of specified colors Thanks I would like to be able to plot multiple corrplots on the same page Is there a recommended way to plot them using ggpubr or gridExtra packages preferably ggpubr Below is an example r libraryggpubr datamtcars M cormtcars setseed different color series col colorRampPalettec F red FF F yellow white cyan FFF blue F col colorRampPalettec F B B D D F A FDDBC FFFFFF D E F C DE C AC col colorRampPalettecred white blue col colorRampPalettec F red FF F yellow FFF F cyan FFF blue F wb cwhite black parask TRUE different color scale and methods to display corrmatrix plot corrplotM method number col black clpos n titlecutoff ggarrangeplot plot Which produces the following error r Warning messages In asgrobdefaultplot Cannot convert object of class matrix into a grob In asgrobdefaultplot Cannot convert object of class matrix into a grob Again I want to emphasize that my main goal is to use ggpubr or gridExtra I love corrplot but was running version with R Mac until last week I updated to R GUI El Capitan build because some tools were no longer working but now corrplot will not perform a couple of tasks I can no longer plot large correlation matrices x I know its big but it always worked until now it just took minutes to render I get the message Error vector memory exhausted limit reached I can no longer extract the order of columns from such large matrices with AOE or FPC clustering using corrMatOrder Again it used to work before But now I get the same message as above I am using the exact same code as before on the same datasets Help Minimal reproducible example M cormtcars diagM NA corrplotcorrplotM method shade iscorr T cllim c produces Error in if anycorr cllim anycorr cllim missing value where TRUEFALSE needed Possibly related to I want to represent my correlation results by corrplot but found that the labels of correlation coefficients on the right of the legend overlaped with legend This warning stopcolor limits should cover matrix have some issues while the code only used the comparison of greater than the min and smaller than the max in order to determine should it be raise the warning and stop the program Would that be inclusive such as if user provided a custom limit c Then there might be chance that getting or In the current design of the program will restrict the user to use this range unless they specify with c The current code is if anycorr cllim anycorr cllim stopcolor limits should cover matrix
