In the sentence below Matplolib should be Matplotlib Implementation of the Matplolib viridis color map in R Googles released a new Turbo map that is designed as a replacement for Jet It is designed as a compromise between viridistype maps and the useful manycolor properties of rainbow maps It doesnt quite meet the stringent rules colors in this package meet but it does have a coherent philosophy and some distinct advantages Should we include Turbo in viridis Inclusion in viridis makes it rapidly available in ggplot and lots of other packages which is helpful if the purpose is to serve people who want these popular maps On the other hand it makes viridis less coherent If so we probably want to modify the vignette to explain the difference If I try to load viridis and the sf package in the same R session I get an error on trying to load the second package The error message is Error in getgenname envir envir object groupmap not found Error in getgenname envir envir object groupsplit not found Whichever package is loaded first works fine I am running sf viridis and R on macOS We are contacting you because you are the maintainer of viridis which imports ggplot and uses vdiffr to manage visual test cases The upcoming release of ggplot includes several improvements to plot rendering including the ability to specify lineend and linejoin in geomrect and geomtile and improved rendering of text These improvements will result in subtle changes to your vdiffr dopplegangers when the new version is released Because vdiffr test cases do not run on CRAN by default your CRAN checks will still pass However we suggest updating your visual test cases with the new version of ggplot as soon as possible to avoid confusion You can install the development version of ggplot using remotesinstallgithubtidyverseggplot If you have any questions let me know Hi sjmgarnier Ive been using your viridis package for some time and I really appreciate your work in it I feel however that it should include diverging colormaps In version seaborn introduced two new diverging colormaps created with viscmicefire and vlag Do you think it would be appropriate to include them into viridis and viridisLite I can work in a PR Additionally we can discuss the inclusion of the twilight circular colormap included in matplotlib and the mako and rocks sequential colormaps included in seaborn All of them were created using viscm Thanks Removing space between link makes link render properly Whenever I see a new version of viridis I always wonder what the changes were A NEWSmd or ChangeLog would be helpful here Thank you Since everything is imported and exported anyway this only changes that viridisLite is no longer attached to the search path all symbols remain accessible by users who called libraryviridis Fixes It will create an unnecessary message Loading required package viridisLite you could import and reexport the viridis function from it instead sorry for not including both changes in just one patch
