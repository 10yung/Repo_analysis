three projects Windows Form Web Client SignalR Server Does somebody suggest me to see which book or website SignalR Server can be a bridge between Windows Form and Web Client by SignalR Fixes Hello all Im trying to start simple selfhost app but got error SystemEntryPointNotFoundException The following errors occurred while attempting to load the app No assembly found containing an

signalR for event In my view I have buttons login open refreshToken Logout In my view clieck event of all buttons works ie login refreshToken Logout but onClick of open button is not working below is

MicrosoftAspNetSignalRMessagingScaleoutStreamSendFunc send Object state at MicrosoftAspNetSignalRInfrastructureConnectionSendConnectionMessage message at MicrosoftAspNetSignalRHubsHubDispatcherOutgoingIHubOutgoingInvokerContext context at my configuration is copypaste from I looked into Redis cache It seems that its ok It has enough space Does anyone have any idea why this is happening or how can I debug this We have MVC application which holds SignalR Hub and hosted in IIS an we have WPF Clients deployed in user machines which talks with Hub for receiving and sending text information and system works fine On the server Hub I have override OnCOnnect Onreconnect and OnDisconnect events to update user information who are offline and online So at any point of time I want to hold active users at a particular time Need help in identifying the below use case I tried googling for the info and I have not found online so posting here User Logs off or shutdown the system when internet disconnects or he is way for sometime ie system went to idle state so that I will update them as inactive in my database I have followed MSDN article to register onConnected and OnReconnected and deregister Ondisconnected Thank you I pushed LoadTestHarness to my server on AWS and to a regular server Second one works just fine the first one is intermitent If i open a couple of Load Generator tabs and start the broadcast only one or two are getting packages If i refresh the main page the dashboard and start the broadcast again now the previous load generators that were receiving packages stop receiving and maybe another load generator tab starts getting I did this test because i have the same problem on my signal r app If i have multiple users subscribed to notifications only a few of them are getting the notifications But after a while they stop getting the notifications and other users start getting but not them And after a while the opposite happens the firsts users are getting again but not the other ones All the websockets are connected i dont see disconnections or reconnections This is only one server on AWS Any idea Thanks Using MicrosoftAspNetSignalRCore with aspnet webapi and net After connecting i create a group abc With a button in the web ui i send a normal http request to the webapi In the controller i inject
