On versions that support it we should include options to install Windows Terminal via both Store and Chocolatey in scenarios where Store access is prohibited but choco installs are not automatically from the Box Starter script The Terminal should be available for all dev scripts as anybody doing any type of CLI will want to use it even if they dont realize it at first Additionally Win OpenSSH should be updated directly from github or from chocolately currently chocolatey is a version behind The reason behind this is simple Releases on github are available sooner than installing via optional features on Windows and also requires reinstall in most cases during an OS upgrade when enabled via optional features This would also be available on all windows script so regardless of whether WSL is installed or not the user can still use native SSH instead of Putty Beside Google Chrome one click installation cant be done on the latest Microsoft Edge Insider beta based on chromium This should be taken under consideration if its going to replace current edge version boxstarterlog Was running devwebps script and didnt get Hyper V installed here is what I found in the Boxstarter log Installing the following packages MicrosoftHyperVAll By installing you accept licenses for the packages MicrosoftHyperVAll not installed The package was not found with the sources listed If you specified a particular version and are receiving this message it is possible that the package name exists but the version does not Version Sources C Users ddieppa AppData Local Apps JBC PX WGX XDKD PO boxstionc fcdd c a cefda cf ed BuildPackages Chocolatey installed packages packages failed See the log for details C ProgramData chocolatey logs chocolateylog Failures MicrosoftHyperVAll MicrosoftHyperVAll not installed The package was not found with the sources listed If you specified a particular version and are receiving this message it is possible that the package name exists but the version does not Version Sources C Users ddieppa AppData Local Apps JBC PX WGX XDKD PO boxstionc fcdd c a cefda cf ed BuildPackages Sending message PostRunMessage out if there are subscribers T PID Boxstarter restoring current directory location to C Windows system VERBOSE Boxstarter restoring current directory location to C Windows system T PID Boxstarter Exit Code VERBOSE Boxstarter Exit Code Attached is the entire Boxstarter log file Also noticed that after failing running the HyperVps script apparently none of the following scripts run Dockerps WSLps Browsersps Didnt get installed any browser or docker or WSL was running the devwebnodejs script and got a few red messages but the problem really happens when installing Visual Studio workloads here is the screenshot the script stall there like for more than an hour any clue and then got this here are the print screen of the other issues found perhaps they are related Adds checks for operating system version SKU and architecture where applicable to WSL Docker HyperV app removal and developer mode enable scripts Tracking issue not sure if we care to track it but something i realized when i had a VM to test the desktop workloads When I am looking at devappps I dont know what all of the following settings actually do SetItemProperty Path HKCU Software Microsoft Windows CurrentVersion Explorer Advanced Name NavPaneExpandToCurrentFolder Value It would be great to see what all of these do like jay harris did in his dotfiles for windows There are a number of items that could be processed in parallel such as some of the settings and uninstalling of applications Im going to work on improving the devweb and devwebnodejs scripts These are some of the ideas Use nvs with LTE and Latest Node Versions installed There is also an issue with the git VS Code wants to use not matching up with WSL git so I ve always bootstrapped this by using WSLGIT and pointing git in vscode towards that wslgitexe Maybe install yarn as well Native WSL Deps Installed this would handle all of the native npmnode modules that most people come across Zopfli Reyon neonbindings etc buildessentials from aptget Install Microsoft Edge DevTools preview Install webdriver If it is an insiders this should be part of the developer mode x VS Code with the Debugger extensions Chrome Edge Ill keep this issue updated with the progress
