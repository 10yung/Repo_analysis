I have a remote server that I do not control I would like to use bloom to cache the responses from the remote server curl H BloomRequestShard H BloomRequestIgnore In this case I am making an http request to bloom with an https request to the api server specifying a new flag RequestIgnore to disable cache on the request I have a few remote API servers so an example of how to configure multiple hostsshards would be useful NOTE I am currently able to use bloom with http to accomplish this task with the exception of controlling the ignore cache from the client Currently Bloom supports a single Redis host port When Redis is run in a clustered mode with multiple masters Bloom is unable to consider another Redis node to talk to for continued use upon the failure of a master node Libraries like ioredis support this kind of functionality Goal build a generic plugin system on Bloom to be able to extract data and inject live configuration changes an IO interface On which we may integrate a wide range of stuff without needing to touch the Bloom core For instance a metrics system which is relevant for the Bloom use case Early requirements Metrics Instance RPS total per request type Successerror ratio Requestresponse latency per BloomStatus MISS HIT DIRECT Cache hitmiss ratio probably perroute
