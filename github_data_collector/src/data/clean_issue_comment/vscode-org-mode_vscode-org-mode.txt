The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

Security Alerts page details Could the following syntax for perfile todo keyword configuration be supported TODO TODO FEEDBACK VERIFY DONE CANCELED You may also write SEQTODO to be explicit about the interpretation but it means the same as TODO or TYPTODO Fred Sara Lucy Mike DONE A setup for using several sets in parallel would be TODO TODO DONE TODO REPORT BUG KNOWNCAUSE FIXED TODO CANCELED Remember that the keywords after the vertical bar or the last keyword if no bar is there must always mean that the item is DONE although you may use a different word After changing one of these lines use Cc Cc with point still in the line to make the changes known to Org mode from Function that detects timestamp in cursor context is modified to also collect information about brackets being used allowing user to use both and i used a method identical to TODO state management The ability to FoldUnfold with TAB in OrgMode Hide Leading Stars How can we go about implementing these It would be nice if propertylogbook drawers could be folded too Example from the orgmode docs org This is a headline Still outside the drawer DRAWERNAME This is inside the drawer END After the drawer Currently if we apply the Org Italic command on an already in italic text like my text already in italic we get my text already in italic it would probably be better to revert the text in normal mode so get my text already in italic The Org Italic command applied on a snippet of text like first line second line third line adds a slash at the beginning and the end of the snippet so we get first line second line third line which is not correct because nor orgexport command nor vscodeorgmode plugin itself handle this snippet as italic text We should add slashes at the beginning and the end of each lines so we should get first line second line third line Seeing two projects marketplacevisualstudiocom with the same userfriendly name but two different names tootoneorgmode vs vscodeorgmodeorgmode both referring to this github project with no way to differ on what commit they were built from how should I decide which one to install Can it be made more clear what is the purpose and status of each of these With the new extension release we need to find a way to reach our userbase to make them switch to the new publisher extension One way to do it would be to publish a version that open a page explaining the user that he need to replace the extension to have latest features I start to dig how to implement that as bookmark or gitlens do and end up on vscode extensions samples So far the current version will open the Upgrade page at start This is still beta and prototypal focused on the mecanism rather than the message Once working this would need to be backport on original extension and a release with the original publisher should be made Well could later use that mecanism to publicize new features Feedback are more than welcome I wanna know what you think about this img width
