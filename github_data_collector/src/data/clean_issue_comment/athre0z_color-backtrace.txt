Im using colorbacktrace along with rayon The trouble is that rayon produces absurdly long stack traces Im looking at one with frames right now These long stack traces push my interesting stack traces way way up my scroll buffer Id like to filter out the rayon stack frames Its probably too much to task for colorbacktrace to do it for me but itd be nice if I had the option to provide custom filtering logic stderrorError has an experimental support for providing a backtrace of type stdbacktraceBacktrace However colorbacktrace accepts only types backtraceBacktrace and failureBacktrace in its printing functions Would it be possible to add support for the std variant as well Im not sure how hard it would be because it doesnt expose its inner frames Using colorbacktrace in a test gives the following output Screenshot from The last lines are all pretty much useless in this context and if possible should be added to the list of ignored patterns in I believe Im currently in the process of porting a project from failure to SNAFU to try it out and Id like to be able to use colorbacktrace with SNAFU backtraces They also use an opaque wrapper type same as failure though theirs is a much simpler wrapper just a NewType so doing the hacky failure style integration should be trivial I would however like to communicate with the SNAFU devs and the failure devs and the guy who works on std that I talked to last time who had plans for getting backtraces into the stderrorError API and make sure everyone is on the same page so all the integration eventually gets done the right way Since it seems that SNAFU already has a way to extract the inner backtraceBacktrace I propose that colorbacktraces README should be updated to document this fact along side the existing notes on how to integrate with failure Im planning on getting to this soonish Currently panic handler colors std module into green and other modules into red but in my opinion If add possibility to set user color for that match some pattern it will be very useful for fast detect where is the panic occured
