hi i have windows pro bit v build its my program do ircli in windows just time i get the notification another try to send notify did not show after restart windows all of the failed notify are here what happend to this is it windows problem also i tested aa sleep but i cant watch any notify after restart all of did not show notify are here why Hi there Im curious why you opted to use both macnotificationsys and notifyrust as the later one encapsulates macnotificationsys completely If you found any issues regarding usability or API Id be curious to know MacOS panics with the error below when trying to send multiple notifications thread main panicked at called Resultunwrap on an Err value ErrorMessage msg AlreadySet Example rust fn main let app testapp notificanotifyapp test succeeds notificanotifyapp test errors The underlying notification library used for MacOS tracks if the application name has been set and will error when trying to set the application name again notify should handle this error gracefully PR is refactoring calls to unwrap and return the library errors for notifica although this issue would still be present it wouldnt panic but the early return would not trigger additional notifications If is the direction for error handling I can catch the ApplicationErrorAlreadySet locally and continue execution otherwise return all other errors to the caller Nonetheless I can fix this just need to know what branch to branch from The winrt doc for uninit states Unitializes the Windows Runtime This must not be called as long as any Windows Runtime object is still alive From my understanding this might cause issues if multiple threads try to send notifications Once the first thread is finished uninit is called while other threads might still require the runtime I cannot test if there are any actual implications From my comment on reddit and as a reminder for myself You might want to change the notify method to return a Result SomeErrorType and dont call unwrap in your code It is considered bad practice for a library to panic Could a list of supported operation systems and notification backends be specified in the README That would clarify support questions some might be having like what backends are supported on Linux it seems to be using dbus and is FreeBSD supported Browsers have a Web Notification API available from JavaScript that would be great if this crate could use it when compiled to webassembly Im not sure what a cross platform API could look like for this it could be an enum rather than arbitrary images
