Hi slice and splice have different purposes and functionality I definitely agree that splice should be avoided due to its destructive nature Anyway the only case when they forgetting for a second about destruction have the same output is when the first parameter is exactly and optionally both pass the same second integer Actually they even give the same output also if the first parameter is greater than but only if the second one is not passed Not sure how to summarize that in a few words but to avoid confusion I would at least shortly mention it Is the next function is really pure Every time it will produce new function const signUp Db Email attrs const user saveUserDb attrs welcomeUserEmail user When I open any chapter say ch Right chevron links to the current chapter header Id expect it to link to the next one Env MacOS Desktop Chrome v latest I havent used Gitbook but it might be solvable via GitBook update also mentioned in The readme refers to but this link is offline ipadress not found The subscribe button wont let me create accounts on the legacy gitbooks site Unauthorized New accounts should be created on the new version of GitBook Head to Im keen to be notified when new chapters are published Migrating the book from the legacy to the new gitbooks might solve this problem Are there any other workarounds Declarative coding section i quote For those of you who are thinking Yes but its much faster to do the imperative loop I suggest you educate yourself on how the JIT optimizes your code Here authors tells map or for doesnt matter performance wise map is more readable and JIT optimizes that This is not true He forget to mention the time and effort spent while JIT do its thing I am sure JIT does cool staff and i am sure it is not free Also jsperf doesnt look as he said I know jsperf is not the best tool but it gives an idea Screenshot Please add a how to cite section to the README ideally with a supporting bib entry In Chapter arrayToList a List a const arrayToList Listof I execute in the ternimal consolelogarrayToList got nested array List Is this expected behavior Hi Im recently learning categorytheory and functional programming The image in the chapter categorytheory is different as I imagined Base on my understanding In category theory there are only objectdot and morphismarrow with some rules identity composition associative In the category of set dot represent set and arrow represent mathematical functionmapping between sets In the programmers point of view the dot represent typeString Boolean and the arrow represent pure function My imagination is like the image showing below The group of black arrows are a functions mapping values between types But In the category point of view we cant open the dot to see what elements inside because its a dot I know its more intuitive to show the elements inside to make it easy to understand And i agree with that But I think the types in the each of the circles should be the same If Im wrong please just let me know Have a good day So I was looking at how the Chapter is going and at the section Not quite a monoid is said that the First monoid cant really be one since it doesnt implement an Identity but it just so happens that it can implement a Nothing from Maybe as an empty for itself and be concated around This is kind of a workaround for the laws of Monoids if I understood it correctly so it might be the reason you authors decided to leave First itself as not quite a monoid since it needs a little help to be lifted from Semigroup into this category Sorry if this issue is wrong Im doing my best to understand the concepts and laws had to overclock my brain to understand a few cryingcatface Inspired from the Crocks docs
