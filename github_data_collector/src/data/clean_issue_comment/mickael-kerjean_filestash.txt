 Screenshot Firefox your ticket must contains the following information description of the bug step by step instructions to reproduce the bug observed behavior expected behavior Description title Steps navigate to demofilestashapp on Firefox mobile and type in a password field Observed input shown as plain text keyboard suggestions active Expected input obfuscated as dots user I have some multi GB files that Im sharing and the browser first tries to display them For example some large zipped data files split into smaller portion ME Thats odd can you share such a zip file Theres some logic in place to detect if the content is binary or not and if binary display the download button instead It looks like a bug from that code user You can create a multipart zip file and see what happens when you click on part z I have a set of data files with GB parts and it doesnt work properly Do you want to see a video tutorial that go through the installation we will make it happen if we ever reach thumbs up Any plans to add yet another sorting flavor namely separately sorting directories first and then separately files ie combination of the current sort by type and sort by name Currently if one chooses sorting based on name directories and files will end up mixed I think many people are not used to this including myself so Im creating this tracking issue for that wink Btw filestash looks like a really nifty software its easy to setup except for slightly misleading error messages like invalid password when the SFTP directory was actually set to an invalid path or connection refused when actually the host wasnt reachable at all due to incorrect DNS translation and seems to do nearly everything needed though Id wish to switch onoff hidden files visibility interactivelyondemand in each folder and not as a systemwide option When I am logged in I can browse images using the image navigation bar and with the arrow keys If I open the image using the share URL in a private session or incognito mode the navigation bar is not present And I can not navigate using the arrow keys either Happens both with Firefox and Chrome I would expect the behavior to be the same a bit puzzled as to why its not S have many auth signature version can we add signature config in S advance option all the auth signature version definition in auth type In my case I have many self hosted S server a part of server host by minio and another part of server host by ceph they have diff signature version so I want to add auth signature version in S config Thx Hi I thought I would be good if you were able to compress and uncompress filesfolders this would allow for the easy download and upload of folders or multiple files Hi mickaelkerjean If I create a file or diretory via filestash the date isnt displayed When I click through the directories it is displayed again See peekDAN Z Hi mickaelkerjean Is it possible to download a directory or multiple files
