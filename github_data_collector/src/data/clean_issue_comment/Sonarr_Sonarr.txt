Logs log Debug log System Information Version Package Version ls by linuxserverio Mono Version Filelistro added an api to the tracker as it was rss only before is it possible to get them integrated into sonarr If the devs need invites I can provide them This is the news posted about the API Before we go on to the subject from the title which is mainly targeted at developers we wish to bring to your attention something that impacts all users A few days ago we made some improvements to how searching torrents works more exactly Torrents are now indexed in real time Meaning that you can find it via search right after its uploaded We made some improvements to the way words are analyzed for indexing To be more specific the search will now return much more accurate results We have also greatly improved the algorithm which handles word positioning in the search engine you can now find much shorter words and the relevance of the results is higher Lets go on with a short list of goodtoknow things for the API You can find the API at A requestshouruser limit is enforced All API calls have to be sent as a GET request The authentication is made using your username and passkey The API can return responses as JSON as well as XML At this moment there are two endpoints searchtorrents and latesttorrents latesttorrents works the same way as the current RSS feed with the added benefit of being able to filter by IMDb For more info visit FIleList staff offers a bounty for who manages to do this permanent VIP and Special Rank Status Describe the problem I use a few different root paths and this would allow me to move files root paths very easily Describe the problem When specials occur on Shows with Daily naming scheme they can be imported incorrectly in media organizers Describe any solutions you think might work allowing standard naming structure for just Specials fixed it Additional context example is Jeopardy which has a tournament thats considered a special but in Plex it combines them with standard episodes that have aired that day A lot of time there are two episodes in one folder The folder name ha the following structure SeriesNameS E qualityreleasercodec Inside the folder there are two files with the following name schema SeriesNameS E qualityreleasercodec mkv SeriesNameS E qualityreleasercodec mkv In this case only one file is copiedimported and is named as the folder but with the extension of files SeriesNameS E qualityreleasercodec mkv Of course it should copyimport both files keeping the original names Asset Sonarr Version Operating System Windows net
