The handling of textql looks much more reasonable txt cat acsv idname john lisa cat bcsv colordate red blue T csvsql query select from a join b acsv bcsv idnamecolordate johnred johnblue lisared

based on columns and also more importantly replacing values in certain columns based on regex Must haves Ability to find lines matching the regex for testing appreciate this overlaps with csvgrep Ability to replace the found regex Nice to haves User can provide a list of regex replacements by file Ability to use replacement groups I may have a usecase for this in the near future but logging it here incase someone thinks its needed and wants to take a crack before me Id love to be able to remove embedded newlines from the header row when converting an Excel file May even need ability to remove embedded newlines from all rows but I havent encountered that issue yet I see issue is related and may be implemented soon The sed d workaround for that issue doesnt work with newlines in the header I am trying to run csvstat on a simple CSV file containing sales data I have run using csvstat v csvfilepath It is showing some random error We are trying this very every other CSV we have The

above command and get all CSV to a particular directory For now it is creating allnew CSV file to the directory where my xlsx file is present I want to create all csv files to my desired directory I am a heavy user of csvsql Thanks for creating this great tool and for making it publicly available I am not a programmer I created this account at Github only to contact the maintainers of csvsql I had a small database with about lines It always worked fine with csvsql I added over new lines all at once it works great like that as well Then I added about new lines I cant have csvsql to process it I checked the integrity of the csv file and it is OK It has no quoted cell whatsoever It is a personal file for personal use my personal policy is to automatically remove quotation marks The csv file has over lines and when I run a query it returns an error message which does not apply to the situation Row has values but Table only has columns Which is simply not true Is this a known issue Is it solvable Has anyone ever reported it I can submit the csv file if you want I may not log in to Github soon or ever I only created the account to post this feedback But you can reach me at gasconheartrawtextclub Greetings from Spain Just like the regular grep command it would be great if csvgrep supported multiple files The implementation would need to take in to account the column headers present in each file Currently Im using cat to achieve what I need cat Filescsv csvgrep c m foo This could potentially match a column header in column though which wouldnt be the desired result how can i use csvkit in my python script I want to convert a CSV file to SQL CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements However csvsql insists on providing db together with insert This is strange as csvsql produces CREATE TABLE itself so it knows the schema and should be able to create INSERT statements without any additional information It would be great to be able to pass in bind parameters for parameterized queries when using sql csv Something along the lines of querysql sql select from phonebook where lastnameplastname Script shell sql csv querysql b plastnameJones db connection string
