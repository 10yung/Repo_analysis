Pinhole intrinsic calibration for stereonarrowleft stereonarrowright stereowideleft stereowideright However the camera images are stored as stereoleft stereoright and stereocentre According to the paper stereonarrowleftrighttxt are for the the stereocentre and stereoright images stereowideleftrighttxt are for the the stereoleft and stereoright images So are there two intrinsic calibrations for stereoright stereonarrowrighttxt and stereowiderighttxt What about intrinsic info for treating stereoright as a monocular camera If for instance I feed images from one of these lenses to a visual odometry algorithm that works on monocular images which Pinhole fx fy cx cy values would be correct The mono left camera extrinsic It seems from the car sensor location image that the translation should be close to It seems there is also a mistake with the mono right camera Hi RobotCar Team Firstly thank you for your great dataset I followed the to project pointcloud into images using the Python API provided by the SDK However the result seems incorrect as the attachment shows The code is also in the attachment Do you have any suggestions screenshot from The code is python Copyright c

below show the global pose relative pose obtained from VO and stereo frame at the same or closest timestamp As seem the INS and VO poses are completely different with the stereo following the VO Do the timestamps need to be modified according to the start time of each sensor INS VO Stereo INS VO Stereo Hello I ran ProjectLaserIntoCameram function but I got some erroneous results For example these are the results I get for timestamp for the centre camera And after zoomin image It is clear that the samples over the pedestrians are not coherent and also on the background Can you please check if you get the same output and If not can you please tell me what did I do wrong Thanks Adam Ive found a few sequences dont have their timestamps of GPSINS and fisheye camera synchronized For example the sequence It seems that in the sequence when GPSINS has already turned around at the end of the sequence the fisheye camera is still a few seconds from the turn But most of the sequences are well synchronized This is just a boundary error but it is annoying since it happens for the last a few hundred frames of many drives when I try to generate the point cloud for each frame I though many people might use your SDK and it may be useful to point it out Error The error message will be Matrix dimensions must agree at the following line of in file RelativeToAbsolutePosesm fractions posetimestamps votimestampslowerindices votimestampslowerindices votimestampslowerindices I figured out that it is caused by the posetimestamps it not bounded by votimestamps If the max posetimestamp is greater than the max votimestamps upperindex in line will be empty and upperindex in line will be Solution We could add one function to bound the posetimestamp with votimestamps and avoid any changes in your original code Add the following line before line at BuildPointcloudm lasertimestamps boundLaserTimestampslasertimestamps insfile Added function is as follows function boundedtimestamps
