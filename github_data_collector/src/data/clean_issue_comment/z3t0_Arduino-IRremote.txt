whole thing on just an atmega p processor using his internal clock on MHz nothing works on MHz few buttons are recognized My question is does processor frequency affect stability of irreceiver If yes I can use an external escilator what frequency is considered stable Hi all I use STM S F P adruino core sduino library I use IRremote library but have problem about interrupt The compiler Adruino IDE inform no such file avrinterrupth I know to use IRremote libray need to modify a little bit but my knowlegde about this MCU not enough Anyone can support me Board SparkFun Pro Micro Library Version Protocol Any Code Block c include IRremoteh IRsend irsend void setup void loop for int i i i irsendsendSony xa Serialprintlni delay delay second delay between each signal burst I have followed some of the recommendations when using the Spark Fun Pro Micro v Hz board Including Updated to use timer Updated to use pin for output What I observe when running above code the onboard Tx LED blinks times likely during the Serial output and then repeats every seconds The IR LED stays in an on state verified by using cellphone camera Board ARDUINO UNO Library Version Protocol Sony if any Code Block c

latest release is used Any code referenced is provided and if over lines a gist is linked INSTEAD of it being pasted in here The title of the issue is helpful and relevant We will start to close issues that do not follow these guidelines as it doesnt help the contributors who spend time trying to solve issues if the community ignores guidelines The above is a short template allowing you to make detailed issues Just tested this library with a Nano IoT board it works like a charm Can you please add details ex PIN in the README A really small pull request because I noticed useless spaces before Hello Im trying to turn on the Carbon Heater with IRremote When I try to turn on the SamSung TV or LG Air purifier its working whlie the heater dont This is the Air purifiers result Code Block c Code E E bits Timing unsigned int rawData NEC E E unsigned int data x E E In this case both sendNEC or sendRaw code is working And this is the Heaters result Code Block c Encoding UNKNOWN Code A AB bits Timing unsigned int rawData UNKNOWN A AB When I use sendRaw code its not working I try so many times various distance between the heater and the Aduino UNO I want to know what the problem is Lastly I write the code sendRawDemo I used Thanks Code Block c include IRremoteh IRsend irsend void setup Serialbegin void loop int khz kHz carrier frequency for the NEC protocol unsigned int On Power irsendsendRawOnsizeofOnsizeofintkhz delay Hey So Ive been playing around with this library and visual studio and Ive created an app so that I can control my home lights that have an infrared remote over the internet Its quite basic but currently the app receives the command to turn the lights on and then sends a command to the arduino over the serial port and then there are a lot of if statements to check what code the app has sent and then I use IRsendsendNEC xFFF A and change the hex code for the different hex statements I was thinking I could send just the hex code from the app over the serial port and then use something like string code SerialreadString IRsendsendNECcode but when compiling it says that IRsend cant use strings Im just wondering if there is a way around this as Ive managed to make the app side use a config file so I can set it up for different lights but with the arduino side being basically hard coded If I change my lights and they use a different remote then Ill need to recode the arduino Or if there isnt a way currently to get around this would there be a possibility of adding in that functionality With the if statements the arduino code is quite long but if Im able to use a string I can achieve the same functionality with about lines of code
