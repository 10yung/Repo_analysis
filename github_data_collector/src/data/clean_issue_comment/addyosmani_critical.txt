bezoerb We will need to drop support for Nodejs x but thats OK IMO for v x From a quick test some tests fail Makes the intention clearer TODO x figure out how to handle the Vinyl test failure Same as for x This set of patches along with the deps updates and the changes I made in the deps themselves so far reduce the module load time from ms to ms on my dev Windows VM Also the package size should be reduced I tested the branch with Nodejs and tests passed but please review carefully so that we dont miss something I kept the patches separate but Ill squash them ifwhen you approve bezoerb We need to test this just in case its causing mixed line endings Im trying to build a project on a new MacBook Catalina which builds fine on my old MacBook Mojave Nothing changed in packages just a minor version in nodejs v instead of v on the old MacBook I get this error after emitting CriticalCssWebpackPluginTypeError Cannot read property contenttype of undefined at temp UserstomSitesparkwindorieldevnodemodulescriticallibfilehelperjs at UserstomSitesparkwindorieldevnodemodulescriticallibfilehelperjs at processTicksAndRejections internalprocesstaskqueuesjs Other projects with the same setup are being build and the Critical CSS files are being generated I tried updating the NPM modules to the same versions as the working project but no cigar Updating them to the very latest didnt work either And I cant seem to find anything related on Google Does anyone have an idea what this could be This is WIP but feel free to review and push any patches here bezoerb Not sure its worth doing this it does save a bit but compared to downloading Chromium this is nothing It looks like critical downloads the image maybe to perform inlining image which costs additional bandwidth consumption Is there an option to turn it off Im trying to use Critical for deploying a static website on Now Zeit For using critical on a remote server like Zeit Now it seems I have to use puppeteers and Chrome Zeit seems to permit it and the documentation gives some info about it here Im trying to follow the documentation but Im not so into puppeteers so it looks I miss some steps Anyone has faced the same issue Maybe give some tips or some repo examples Maybe offtopic but I would like to ask anyway
