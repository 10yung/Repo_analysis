which version of fluent should I use for fluentsender in gettingstartedmd start the FaaS server cd functions python functionserverpy I cant find functionserverpy only have serverpy in the directory When I use the command python serverpy to start the script I get errors as follows Traceback most recent call last File serverpy line in module from benchmarksserver import File xxxfluentmasterfunctionsbenchmarksserverpy line in module from import composition File xxxfluentmasterfunctionsbenchmarkscompositionpy line in module from includefunctionspb import Thanks This has proven difficultimpossible As a result adding Anna lattice types requires recompilation and potentially code changes Currently the system operates at either causal mode or noncausal mode Refactor the codebase so that it can support both with a single build Currently durable PUT is implemented by letting the client issuing multiple PUT requests to servers that hold replicas These servers however will again gossip the payload to each other which is redundant We should eliminate these gossips to improve performance Currently all keys are gossipped under the same gossip period Ideally we should adjust the gossip frequency based on the access frequency Hot keys will be gossipped more often and cold keys less often Currently the monitoring system runs single node single threaded which could be a bottleneck when we increase the scale of the workload We should make it multithreaded and distributed
