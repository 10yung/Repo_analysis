 Description In the base game connecting a console or pressing the WASD keys will make the cursor draw an infinity symbol In tModLoader when the game loads mods the cursor is redirected to the top left of the screen It shouldnt be too hard to do this action slightly below the cancel button while finding mods Side note also make the cancel button accessible to controllers Probably warrants another issue detailing complete controller support Possible Drawbacks Not much really This is almost completely harmless and wont even affect many tmodloader users This is purely novelty Additional info NA At first I used the version of TML v When I changed to v I couldnt compile mod source code in the game GCZ HZ RQ G EUX help UI Scale bellow one should be allowed to make UI display properly on small displays Description Unloading a mod with placed tile entities keeps references in TerrariaDataStructuresTileEntityByX when exiting into the title screen Log File totally applicable Steps to Reproduce Load mod with TEs Go into a world tested SP place TE use it maybe Save Exit world Disable mod and reload Create a memory snapshot and find references to the TE Expected behavior Since Im on the title screen after exiting the world itd expect it to be unloaded and thus TerrariaDataStructurersTileEntityByX should not store tile entity positions and ids on the title screen Actual behavior TerrariaDataStructuresTileEntityByID as well as TerrariaDataStructuresTileEntityByPosition are not ready yet to let go of my mods precious TileEntities causing the mod list to display the not fully unloaded warning Reproduction frequency yes Additional Information grafik clientlog when ever I try to click on things with my mouse it always goes to the thing that was highlighted even if my mouse is highlighting another thing and the only way I can move on the home screen is to use wasd and it wont let me update and I tried to check the mouse without tmodloader and it worked until I put tmodloader back on terraria When using the generic approach to saving and loading a List of Item youll end up with undesirable results public override void LoadTagCompound tag TestA tagGetListItemTestA TestB tagGetListTagCompoundTestBSelectItemIOLoadToList public override TagCompound Save return new TagCompound TestA TestA TestB TestBSelectItemIOSaveToList In this example TestB will Save and Load properly as Air but TestA will Save and Load as Unloaded Items My guess is this logic doesnt expect the Type TerrariaItem that will result from the automatic approach public static void LoadItem item TagCompound tag if tagCount itemnetDefaults return A possible solution is this but Im not sure yet Im not sure if Im missing something or if trimming such tags should happen

the steps to reproduce this issue Click Multiplayer Click Host Play Select character and world to play on Host a server Expected behavior What should be happening If you dont know leave what you think should happen The game shouldnt crash but host a server Actual behavior What is actually happening The game crashes Reproduction frequency How often are you reliably able to reproduce this issue Always Additional Information Any additional information configuration or data that might be necessary to reproduce the issue NOTE This replaces My other branch got a little screwy so I made a fresh one Description of the Change Currently hovering over a UI element and scrolling the mouse wheel will adjust your hotbar in addition scrolling This is obviously undesirable so this change aims to fix that It was a little tricky because of the order events happen The important ones from my perspective MainInGameUIUpdate Technically this happens first but because the players input hasnt been read yet its actually one step behind for picking up scrolls PlayerInputUpdateInput Sets scroll wheel values PlayerUpdate Updates the hotbarrecipes position based on scroll value This creates a problem since we dont want the hotbar to move if a scrollbar has been scrolled but we havent reached that point yet Its also not possible or at least quite difficult to identify if a scrollbar will update at the point of PlayerUpdate My change records the input scroll value when attempting to move the hotbar and delays processing by one cycle This gives the UI elements and mods an opportunity to reset the value if they handle the scrolling and want to cancel out the hotbar offset Alternate designs I originally relocated the hotbar handling so it would happen just after the UI update and added a condition that it would only update if a scrollbar event had not been handled However this was a bit of a more significant change to the original code so it was suggested that I try delaying the processing a frame instead of changing the order altogether I also tried identifying in the player update method whether the user was hovering on a UI element with a scrollbar I did not get this working and decided there must be a better method Why this should be merged into tModLoader Its a bug that is core to scrollbars with tModLoader so it impacts lots of mods Benefits Better user experience Possible drawbacks Some mods may have relied on the old behavior For instance BossChecklist and many of JavidPacks other mods would calculate how much the hotbar moved and reverse it See here This fix breaks the workaround but obviously its better to have a proper fix in tModLoader that prevents stutter Applicable Issues NA Sample Usage NA Description Achievements sometimes seem to reset when relaunching tModLoader May or may not have to due with new Steam Library UI as its been happening since that beta was released and used Seems to nearly always happen on computer reboot and when relaunching Steam Steps to Reproduce Reboot computer relaunch Steam I think it has happened with both of these on occasion Launch tModLoader through normal means or through debugging Enter a world with a character Brace for incoming obtainable achievement spam Expected behavior Achievements should be maintained as completed when completed when relaunching the game Actual behavior Achievements are reobtainable and marked as incomplete Reproduction frequency Achievement reset doesnt seem to happen EVERY time but when rebooting computer its almost guaranteed
