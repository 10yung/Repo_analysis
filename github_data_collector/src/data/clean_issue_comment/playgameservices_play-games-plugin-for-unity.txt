messagenull Hello everyone Ever since the PGA update Ive been struggling trying to get my app back on track Its something Id been working on for a year and was near release Now my app freezes on trying to get leaderboard data for top players in my leaderboard This is something that was previously working and just simply broke a couple of days ago My exact line of code is if PlayGamesPlatformInstanceIsAuthenticated PlayGamesPlatformInstanceLoadScores ID LeaderboardStartTopScores LeaderboardCollectionPublic LeaderboardTimeSpanAllTime data Here ID is retrieved from the GPGSIds script thats created upon set up and is passed to the function that contains this snippet of code I really want to emphasize the fact that this had been working up until the PGA update I have not made any changes to my code and it follows the tutorial for set up given on this repository very closely Any help will be greatly appreciated Thank you My game published on Google Play Unity version xx not exactly sure but at least version GPGS Version My location IstanbulTurkey Last Update The top scores and user score are downloaded and displayed on the game UI I dont use the Play services own leaderboard UI Everything worked fine until a few days ago But now when I want to view the score table the application crashes after viewing the scores I didnt update the app I got this error EGamesNativeSDK Exception in comgoogleandroidgmsgamesleaderboardLeaderboardScoreBufferget javalangIllegalStateException Max XP must be more than min XP I attached logtxt The error code starts from line logtxt Edit Before that happened I updated the google play app on the phone and deleted the cache and data in the settings
