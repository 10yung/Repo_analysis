If this component is not drawing in your UIScene based application simply change this line here With swift if availableiOS if let firstScene UIWindowScene UIApplicationshared connectedScenesfilter activationState foregroundActive first as UIWindowScene selfnotificationWindow CWWindowContainerwindowScene firstScene else selfnotificationWindow CWWindowContainerframe UIScreenmainbounds This component is not working anymore on iOS I am trying to find a solution for this but cant see anything ideal to fix it Edit The component will not work if your app uses UIScene iOS notificationLabel Hi do you have any thoughts on enabling swipe to dismiss Slightly controversial but looks nice over a standard UITabBar Solves Offers the CWNotificationStyleHomeIndicatorNotification option screenshot The text in the notification should be vertically centered in the navigation bar but referring to the notch Actually it is centered referring to both the notch and the status bar and the result is a terrible vertical offset in the text in the iPhone X notification Hi I will be great if you update your code to swift also UPDATE Ive submitted my Pull Request with CWNotificationStyleHomeIndicatorNotification screenshot Previous messages Out of curiosity I thought Id try this library on the iPhone X iphonex It works as expected but also as expected the text is covered by the notch area A better option might be for those phones with the notch to use the home indicator area just temporarily at the bottom of the screen Any thoughts or interest on this Sorry about this warning But this is very serious I noticed that my device was very warm so I decided to check the CPU usage I was surprised when I saw the values floating between and JUST when a animated notification is triggered I just removed this component of my application and voila the CPU usage floats around on all features uploading data p playback data syncing And yes I was using this component as recommended The source is the Swift version Here is a screenshot proving this issue screen shot at
