Hi Ive been trying to understand what the output parameters of the function CWMm mean but I cant find any documentation I also ran the code to see if the result helped me understand but it didnt Could you help me understand what fvpmxCxCyb are Thanks a lot Is it possible to query from the dataset without having a specific object in mind Alternatively is there a known way to randomly sample from the dataset Thanks I have been using this tool to annotate images Unfortunately the webbased tool differs significantly from the Matlab code in terms of how it converts polygons to pixel maps The LMobjectmask function makes use of Matlabs poly mask This function does not allow selfintersection of objects and removes pixels that are covered twice by the same object This is not the case for the web tool It would be very helpful if you could provide Matlab code that matches what the annotators see in the web tool I am trying to create a local index for using the images offline However I run into an error when I follow the steps supplied here below Option Access the online database directly with the LabelMe Matlab toolbox When I run the line that creates a local index D LMdatabaseHOMEANNOTATIONS it gives me the following error Error using str num line Requires string or character array input Error in LMdatabase line vannotationobjectmid str numvannotationobjectmid Could someone help me fix this Thank you I want to label my pictures my own without webbut I dont know if this tool can help me with it
