Use multistage build From MB to MB image size Add dockerentrypoint script for dynamic setup Add dockercompose file I have compiled successfully the project but when I am trying to start it it exits immediately I checked the webdislog and I see the following webdislog Oct Invalid argument webdislog Oct Connection failed setsockoptTCPNODELAY Invalid argument Seems like the nested array cannot be handled GEOADD discovery testing GEOADD discovery testing GEOADD discovery testing curl X GET GEORADIUSRO testing testing testing curl X GET GEORADIUSRO null null null rediscli GEORADIUSRO discovery km WITHDIST testing testing testing Getting this error after running make make cc c O ggdb Wall Wextra I Ijanssonsrc Ihttpparser o webdiso webdisc In file included from webdisc serverh fatal error eventh file not found include eventh error generated make webdiso Error My application uses PSUBSCRIBE and waits for notifications about keys Redis generates hundreds of events about keys Data that gets out of webdis to my application is mixed first some http chunks are sent then all of headers then http chunks continues Fucntion httpschedulewrite schedules write event for every httpresponse but libevent does not preserve order of calls to httpcanwrite In effect first are called callbacks that sends chunks then headers and then there are only chunks left Similar situation might happen when a chunk would be too long to fit with one call to write in httpcanwrite Hi Nicolas When I try to set a value using a POST method with string content body and a KB base encoded message server respond with following error SET false ERR syntax error I guess this is because my content has some slahes in itanyway I can set the value using the PUT method but if I want to set an expiry time PUTKeyEX I get a syntax error as well If I remove the EX value is set correctly Is it possibly to set the expiry time using PUT Thanks This adds support for the preprocessor flags that are usually passed as CPPFLAGS rather than a part of the CFLAGS This provides a way to start webdis with dynamic port allocation and discover HTTP port number by simply grepping logs ie without need to use netstat or sockstat that are not available on some architectures Dynamic port allocation is a feature that can be used to run webdis adhoc for testing purpose
