Hi there Ive updated Presentation to be compatible with Xcode and Swift and bumped the pod version up Please let me know if any question and would love to get this merged asap Thanks Alex Cannot inherit from class PagesController compiled with Swift because it has overridable members that could not be loaded in Swift This was a quick and dirty way to support Swift and Xcode I removed a dependency and just hardcoded the necessary files within here
