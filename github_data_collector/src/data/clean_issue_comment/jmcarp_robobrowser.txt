The followlinkvalueNone args kwargs documentation notes are incorrect On the method description reads Find a click a link by tag pattern andor BeautifulSoup arguments Which appears to pertain to find or findall Should just be click a link Is it possible to force the RoboBrowser instance to reload a page In my use case Im waiting for a download to finish before scanning for hrefs to follow but the parsed method doesnt appear to update as the page loads eg its forever stuck at downloading even though the expected wait time is s If I refresh the page middownload manually it doesnt interrupt the download progress My guess is that parsed references a snapshot of sorts taken once when a page loads and further invocations reference that snapshot instead of the live HTML Ive tried invoking the open method again but that seems to create a new window of sorts losing all the download progress Thanks It seemed to be treating this as a normal input type when it should be treated as like a submit button There is also the slight change when it serializes from just a single field and value to two fields appropriately named with the x y values of where on the image the user clicked Currently I am not handling there being different x and y values simply just creating two new fields with x and y appended to the name Robobrowser object have args tries delay multiplier but delay is disappear in init function and multiplier default is None Multiplier is Urllib s backofffactor default is This change make a error TypeError unsupported operand types for NoneType and int In robobrowserRoboBrowsergetlink File usrlocallibpython sitepackagesrobobrowserbrowserpy line in getlink selfparsed linkptn texttext args kwargs File usrlocallibpython sitepackagesrobobrowserhelperspy line in find soup name attrs or recursive text kwargs File usrlocallibpython sitepackagesrobobrowserhelperspy line in findall if matchtexttext tag File usrlocallibpython sitepackagesrobobrowserhelperspy line in matchtext if isinstancetext repatterntype AttributeError module re has no attribute patterntype See also I get from the Readme how to set a checkbox but I cannot see how to remove one if it is already checked The form I am working with can change which fields are checked based on whether someone else has logged in and manually chosen some fields So from my code I need to specify which fields are set when submitting the form Is this possible The input typeimage tag was not yet supported Ive ignored nameless elements for now technically it is permitted to omit the name attribute at which point only x and y values are submitted Hi I have this issue I am trying to fill forms of this website using robobrowser My code in python is below newCRTSDR betaurl browser RoboBrowser browseropennewCRTSDR betaurl form browsergetformactionCRTSimaging form queryinput value form radius value However queryinput does not have the attribute value before I fill the input and when the input is filled the attribute value appears and is set with the input value The HTML code looks like Before when it is empty input classformcontrol inputsm typehidden idqueryinput namequeryinput After setting an input input classformcontrol inputsm typehidden idqueryinput namequeryinput value Thank you for any help Hi Not an issue per se just wondering the status of the project Can I make screenshots webpages
