Im absolutely not an expert but wouldnt the Adamoptimizer better to use for textgenrnn than RMSprop This will use native Tensorflow Keras and supports Tensorflow Hello Is there anyway to feed some text while generating at runtime For example while generating texts can we feed some sample sentencesentences into the algorithm so that it can create texts based on given text It crashes after about lines when I try to train a new Model on my GPU This doesnt happen when I use my CPU Im using Python TFGPU CUDA Python from textgenrnn import textgenrnn textgen textgenrnn textgenreset textgentrainfromfilerolltxt numepochs printdone textgensavethistesth textgengenerate Epoch I tensorflowstreamexecutorplatformdefaultdsoloadercc Successfully opened dynamic library cublas dll I tensorflowstreamexecutorplatformdefaultdsoloadercc Successfully opened dynamic library cudnn dll ETA s loss Hi there First of all great library Ive been having lots of fun with it Is it expected behaviour that the vocabjson file doesnt get updated once its been created from a newmodel I have the following workflow With txt files trainfromlargetextfile on with newmodelTrue and wordlevelTrue Stop the script which saves out the weights vocab and config files Start the script loading in the saved weights vocab and config files and for the remaining txt files loop through each and trainfromlargetextfile with newmodelFalse and wordlevelTrue My expectation is that for each new file it trains it would contribute to the vocab file and refine the model But the reality is the vocab file doesnt get updated so new words found in the new texts do not become part of the model Is this right Thanks again for your work and how to deal with Chinese I had made textgenrnn with external Keras since native TF was missing features Now that there is parity I am OK with merging it back into native TF with TF support textgenrnn does not use much custom Keras code so it should be a relatively simply change the concern is not breaking old models which may be possible due to the SavedModel change TF also has TPUmixed precision support which will be very helpful for training performance
