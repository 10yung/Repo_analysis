Chrome Version Official Build bit Getting this error whenever the extension loads in Chrome You can see it in the Errors section of the Extension TypeError Cannot read property replace of null assetsjavascriptsfiltersjs aanonymous filtersanitize function return functioninput return input replace g amp this is the line replaceg lt replaceg gt Active record location is referencing Gem files instead of project code in the chrome debugger On my companies app we have some js calls to the rails server to check for new notifications or whatever It may not be the best way to receive notifications but it is legacy from before browser notifications were possible As a result when I am using rails panel whenever the notifications on the site are checked the active request is set to be that newest request This is not very useful when I am currently looking at a prior requests parameters and suddenly the new requests info is brought up It looks like the culprit is here at that line we set the active request to be the newest incoming request I dont think we should do this unless there is not a current active request or rather when the user has not clicked on a request yet Id like to know others opinions on either removing that line or changing it to meet my suggested conditions Update styling to match new Chromedevtools flat design Summary Dont change scopeactiveKey when its already set Update mock data every seconds to simulate whats going on in many applications these days Bump version to Many words When debugging an application where transactions keep coming in RailsPanel would keep selecting the newest transaction This is a bit annoying understatement when youre looking at a specific transaction to see whats going on I fixed that by only automatically selecting a transaction when there is no transaction selected I also added some code to the mock data function to simulate new transactions coming in every couple of seconds To test open panelhtml in Chrome and see the mock requests coming in and the new requests not being selected as they previously were Resolves Styling is far from perfect any design help welcome TODO move button to top bar see

But nothing unusual about those Any help to remove this noise appreciated I remember using this before and finding it useful and I could have sworn it used to exist What happened to it any way to get it back Some of our report pages have a lot of partials that cache On the initial uncached page render there are so many partials that the RailsPanel popup scrolls off the bottom of the screen and we cant see it without Cmd to shrink the page size Even then some pages overflow off the bottom Our solution has been to set some css on profilerpopup using the Stylebot Chrome extension but I thought perhaps the panel could support this natively rather easily profilerpopup height vh overflow scroll Would be cool to have a button for cleaning the controller actions list in a similar way as the clear button in Chrome Developer Tools in Network tab
