Whenever I use the city button and type in any keyword the result just says no matches found even for general terms like gravitation As a third party extension cite c is a great enhancement to jupyter notebook So why not add it to jupytercontribnbextensions Hi the plugin works a treat in the notebooks thanks but I dont seem to be able to use it in jupyterlab are there any tricks I could useplans to make it available for jupyterlab too Thanks T I have a jupyterhub installation serving singleuser notebooks wonderful tools and would like to have everyone be able to use cite c for inline citations in their notebooks I guess my short question would be Looking at the installpy script it looks like its only able to install for the local user Is there any known way to install for all users under jupyterhub I realize they may need some local files installed in their accounts like cls files and such that are installed with zotero which I have done for one user account for testing purposes However the handlers still dont seem to be working properly Even if I use python m cite cinstall as that user the cite czoterooauth page doesnt load and results in a response I can get a little farther if I manually set up the cite cjson file with my credentials but the search gui isnt displaying correctly and even though I can get it to read my library and insert the correct cite tag information the citations dont get rendered inline nor in the bibliography I dont understand the software enough to make any more headway at the moment but if there are any suggestions on what might need to be altered I might be able to make some more progress Sorry if this has already been addressed before but I couldnt find any mention of cite c being used with jupyterhub anywhere While my python fully updated conda environment was active I did pip install cite c python m cite cinstall After launching a new notebook server and opening a notebook I was expecting to see the new icons meantioned in the README but they are not there FYI I am using the nbextension configurator with a couple of other extensions that create new icons in the notebook toolbar im just thinking if you used absolute icon positions maybe they are overwritten by some of my other extensions Otherwise I dont see any errors At the moment it doesnt seem to be possible to cite a particular page paragraph clause chapter etc within a source Might this feature be added Im not familiar with citeprocjs but its possible with eg pandocciteproc Im hoping to use Jupyter with students so cite c will be a very important part of that decision but they do need to be able to identify page numbers in their citations I am running Jupyter using Firefox and Opera as browsers I have just installed cite c When I use the Insert citation button in Opera it always tells me there are no matches regardless of what the search terms were When I do it in Firefox I get no response at all Either way no citation is inserted It occurs to me that there may have been a problem in connecting to Zotero eg I suppose its possible that I entered the ID incorrectly though there was no error message at the time but I cant see any way of changing or resetting this and reconnecting When I insert a citation into a Markdown cell I get the raw text cite dataciteundefinedcite which is then rendered as the authors name and year This is how its stored in the ipynb file source cite datacite undefined cite The raw text should include the author and year of the paper a DOI or something else Hi Sorry but I am new to github python etc hope I dont annoy anyone too much I am trying to install cite c using jupyer notebook on sagemathcloud In my ignorance I copied all the cite c files folders into a seperate empty folder gitignore wouldnt copy over for some reason so I carried on anyway whilst in this new folder I typed python installpy into a box which said terminal command and hit the play button the terminal command box output the following Traceback most recent call last File installpy line in module from IPythonhtmlnbextensions import installnbextension ImportError No module named htmlnbextensions I am running Windows in case that has anything to do with it cant see how as it is in the cloud From this description itll be clear I dont know much I attach a screenshot in case it helps screenshotinstallfail Is the problem that I am using sagemathcloud instead of installing Jupyter locally Any chance of some help or advice Kind regards Paul I wanted to uninstall cite c in Jupyter I did not find any documentation to do that
