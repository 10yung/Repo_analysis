Ive been struggling with this problem which for the longest time I assumed was buried in rmarkdown or pandoc The flattenpara pkgdown helper is adding excess paragraph tags which can produce unwanted html markup in the generated reference pages This is the output you would see using a buttonGroupInput in a shiny app img width altimage src This is what I see on the pkgdown generated page img width altimage src Here is the markup from the generated page html div idflavors classyonderbuttongroup btngroup btngroupinfo dflex rolegroup button typebutton classbtn valuemintpp pMint pbutton button typebutton classbtn valuestrawberrypp pStrawberry pbutton The markup button typebutton classbtn valuemintMintbutton is converted into button typebutton classbtn valuemintpppMintpbutton I will see about adjusting the rules of flattenpara to better account for this case An easy check might be to ignore text inside htmlpreserve Im not certain this is actually easy because it may not be simple to check the context of a potential paragraph location Hi I havent been able to get pkgdowndeploysitegithub working at as I keep getting the no deploy key found error as shown for example at Initially I started by using usethisusepkgdown usethisusepkgdowntravis Installing deploy dependencies Successfully installed dplscript gem installed dpl Preparing deploy dpl Deploying application Error No deploy key found please setup with travisusetravisdeploy Execution halted Script failed with status Initially yesterday the Travis endpoint was org but I moved it to com since travisusetravisdeploy by default wouldnt work travisusetravisdeployendpoint org did work In any case at com I deleted the keys in both Travis and GitHub as this worked for another user specifically at and I then ran travisusetravisdeploy and it all seems to work I see the new keys in both Travis and GitHub R travisusetravisdeploy Querying Github deploy keys from repo Getting environment variables for ComunidadBioInforegutools on Travis CI At least one key part is missing private or public Deleting old keys and adding new deploy keys for Travis CI com for repo regutools to Travis CI and Github Added a public deploy key to GitHub for repo regutools Added environment variable for ComunidadBioInforegutools on Travis CI Added the private SSH key as a deploy key to project regutools on Travis CI as secure environment variable TRAVISDEPLOYKEY Added the public SSH key as a deploy key to project regutools on Github At pkgdowndeploysitegithub I see that the error is triggered when nzcharsshid is TRUE and the default sshid value is sshid Sysgetenvidrsa At I do see that TRAVISDEPLOYKEY is set but maybe I need to add some other environment variable on my travisyml file I looked at a few other travisyml files at githubcomropenscilabs like circle and travis but they use other tools tci as in ticdeploy for which feels like a new rabbit hole P Setting environment variables from repository settings export TRAVISDEPLOYKEY secure If you have other ideas on what else I should try or how I can get more information for debugging this please let me know Thank you Best Leo R session

circumvent this There are a lot of pkgdown sites with broken figures on the homepage because most maintainers are not aware that pkgdown only supports images in a few locations since only a few locations also work with CRANs rendering of readmemd This could be documented a bit better and perhaps it would be helpful if buildsite emits a warning when the readme contains figures to relative paths in source folder that are not supported by pkgdown and a hint to move these to eg manfigures maelle Happy to use a smaller image if we can find one by simplifying default argument in memoized function
