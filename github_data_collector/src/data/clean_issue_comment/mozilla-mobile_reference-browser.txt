orgmozillacomponentsfeaturesearch SNAPSHOT Searched in the following locations Required by project app This PR added dynamic adjustment for the engineView but it wasnt in the right place for when the toolbar scrolls away This ends up showing blank white boxes where the engine view is when the toolbar is scrolled away img width altScreen Shot at AM src We need to add that call into the EngineViewBehaviour probably so that we can have it invoked when the toolbar scrolls away I did a quick test of the solution I proposed but that doesnt seem like the best way forward Note consider if this has a perf loss to it cc hiikezoe for reference Steps to reproduce Install via PlayStore Open Mozilla Reference Browser app Expected behavior App opens Actual behavior System crashes and reboots See downstream FenixFirefoxPreview bug for details Device information Android device different devices at least FairPhone running Android LineageOS with MagiskRoot and XPosed Reference Browser version As of from PlayStore Bug did not appear in MozillaReferenceBrowser from apkmirrorcom See here for bug in FirefoxFocus Bug did not appear in and before FirefoxPreview and FirefoxPreviewNightly QUESTION Is there a APK version archive where I can get old versions to check when the bug started Steps to reproduce Open Reference Browser Open any pageex wikipediaorg Open the dots menu Tap on the Add to

Nokia Android and Nexus Android Reference Browser version build Gv a Notes Not reproducible on Google Pixel a XLAndroid and Motorola Moto G Android It may be a regression from the issue Steps to reproduce Make sure Reference Browser has the Storage permission Navigate to filestorageemulated Documents Expected behavior The browser displays a list of local files in the Documents folder and allows you to open them Actual behavior The browser searches Google for filestorageemulated Documents Device information Android device Moto G Reference Browser version There is a corresponding bug for Fenix at which is under active discussion but I think referencebrowser should go ahead and allow this in the meantime for development purposes Its is a significant productivity hit for mobile Gecko development to not be able to load local testcases in a GeckoViewbased browser besides GVE which lacks many features
