I have translated your KeepingYouAwake program into Russian The translation is complete The localization files are included rulprojzip With respect Alexey Zhdanov Hello Marcel Dierkes I have translated your KeepingYouAwake program into Russian The translation is complete The program itself are attached to this letter With respect Alexey Zhdanov img width altscreenshot src img width altscreenshot src img width altscreenshot src img width altscreenshot src img width altscreenshot src img width alt src Raised the minimum deployment target to macOS Sierra Goodbye Yosemite and El Capitan Updated app icons to match the macOS Catalina style Also to get rid of the white background img width alticon x x src As title I cannot open the context menu with right click on the icon in menu bar Left click still works normally macOS KeepingYouAwake was installed using brew cask I also tried getting the app directly from this github repo but theres no luck The weird thing is the right click menu still works on another machine of mine which also has Catalina The only difference between the machines is the other one the working one was upgraded from Mojave while this one not working one has Catalina installed by default If theres some debugging needed please let me know Thanks newmarcel As per and Would it be possible to integrate your commit into and allow the display to sleep but the Macbook to stay awake As long as caffeinate i which prevents Macbook sleep in any situation but allows display sleep is used and not caffeinate s which prevents Macbook sleep only on charger whilst allowing display sleep there should be no bugginesunexpected behaviour re and Hi I had this working well on High Sierra but rebuilt my mac on Mojave and now cant get it to work Is anyone else having this problem MacBook Pro VersionMid Using MBP battery power supply set KYA to start with the computer Step Cover the lid Connect the external screenthe screen doesnt respond Unplug the external screen cable open the computer coverconnect the external screenthen cover itnormal screen display Hello I wanted to suggest to make this available either as a dmg download from a website or via the Mac App store The reasoning behind this is that I as a more technical person have no problem going to GitHub and figuring out what to do But to share this with people who are less technical is a bit more difficult This is by far one of the essential tools for mac especially in the workplace I think providing simple one page website with some info about what this does and a download would go a long way even something that published with GitHub pages Another option is to add it to the Mac App Store but I understand there are extra steps and costs to get there
