This is a workaround that should work for both bash x and x Ive got the tfenv repo checked out at opttfenv I symlinked tfenv and terraform from the bin dir to usrbintfenv and usrbinterraform I have an upstart Amazon linux process that simply does terraform v On system start I have a script that runs tfenv install latest so that the system wide Terraform is whatever the latest version is Users running terraform v works fine but my upstart script results in this output with the latest alpha opttfenvlibexectfenvversionfile line HOME unbound variable Failed to retrieve TFENVVERSIONFILE from tfenvversionfile If I switch opttfenv back to after running tfenv install latest so that opttfenvversion is generated I get the desired output of Terraform v It would appear that however the alpha is determining paths to the tfenv root is broken when run under a script like this Feature Request Add a quiet parameter to silence the download status when installing a new version of Terraform Shorthand q Long quiet Desired Behavior When running tfenv q install Then The following should not print download progress should not show all of the pound signs inflating message and archive message should be hidden Why The download progress text clutters log files tfenv install INFO Installing Terraform v INFO Downloading release tarball from INFO Downloading SHA hash file from tfenv tfenvinstall WARN No keybase install found skipping OpenPGP signature verification Archive tfenvdownloadQ YCJ terraform darwinamd zip inflating usrlocalCellartfenv versions terraform INFO Installation of terraform v successful INFO Switching to v INFO Switching completed terraform v Terraform v Your version of Terraform is out of date The latest version is You can update by downloading from wwwterraformiodownloadshtml Im on MacOS Mojave brew v Homebrew Homebrewhomebrewcore git revision d last commit Homebrewhomebrewcask git revision a aca last commit Since the da ade a ebd b b f b a fb every time I call terraform its simply broken bash usrlocalbinterraform line usrlocallibhelperssh No such file or directory ERROR Failed to source helpers from usrlocallibhelperssh Looks to be any issue on the Bash code and very recent Im sure this was working last week UbuntuBionic is the OS Im using this Im now pining to v as I should have done from the very start I found a bug when trying to use tfenv with the env variable CLICOLOR to give ls the ability to show colors in MacOS Terminal The whole log can be found in What I did was changing the ls commands with find doing it in a compatible way between GNU and no GNU find because we cant use the depth option Additionally I added recent versions of Ubuntu and MacOS for TravisCI testing as well as putting CLICOLOR in the env to make sure it covers future cases MacC ib brew install tfenv Updating Homebrew Downloading Already downloaded UsersixbLibraryCachesHomebrewdownloads d da b bc a c d aeb b c a c baf ffcc c cc d tfenv targz usrlocalCellartfenv files KB built in seconds MacC ib tfenv tfenv Usage tfenv command options MacC ib tfenv listremote MacC ib tfenv install tfenv tfenvinstall ERROR No versions matching found in remote MacC ib tfenv install latest tfenv tfenvinstall ERROR No versions matching latest found in remote tfenv currently only relies in version files to dispatch the final terraform version This PR allows the version string that would otherwise come from versionfile to come from an environment variable See Didnt know how to resume it better x If you set the tfenv version to and enter a directory with a terraformversion that points to it changes the tfenv version globally That means that when you go outside that directory it doesnt revert the tfenv version to it maintains the version I think it should do it as the default behaviour PD tfenv its very cool thanks for your work
