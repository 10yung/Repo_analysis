stackoverflowcomquestionstaggedARCore For Sceneform issues use If using Unity use If using Unreal use SPECIFIC ISSUE ENCOUNTERED Horizontal planes that are the ceiling or floor dont recognize that vertical planes may be walls and a diagonal section is drawn where there are corners or alcoves In this example which uses Huawei equivalents of ARCore APIs for ToF data on the P the vertical planes correctly identify the walls which indicate the structure of the room but the ceiling plane doesnt recognize the alcove and instead there is just a diagonal section In this example of a corridor the vertical planes correctly identify the walls but the ceiling plane doesnt appear to account for the vertical planes It is unclear to me whether or not this is an ARCore issue or a Huawei specific issue as vanilla ARCore plane detection doesnt work as well without the ToF enhanced data though hopefully the new ARCore Depth API should solve that VERSIONS USED Android Studio ARCore SDK for

run the WorldAR demo and observe the floor and ceiling planes WORKAROUNDS IF ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS There is a list of ARCore compatible devices here And as explained on this page a csv can also be downloaded from the developer console The problem is that these two list are not consistent Some devices listed on the ARCore page are not present in the csv and some devices present in the csv list are not listed in the ARCore page May you explain why these lists are not consistent Which list is the most reliable Thanks Samsung released a new refresh of the A series a few months ago A sA s the previous models were already compatible with arcore I currently own a A s Will there be support for the new models I want to place an d object but I do not want to display it on camera but it shout should draw it at specified point using Java code Import fbx file size Mb then error cause invalid stored block lengths How much limit file max size for fbx The other fbx file size is under Mb Use
