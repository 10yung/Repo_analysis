Hi Can I include the notes ie the text under each header as well as the header in the md mm and mm md Ive tried but this does not seem to work Thanks Atanas For more general use in md mm you should at least allow a maxlevel argument to select the maximum level in markdown files that will be shown in the mindmap maxlevel show only chapter level maxlevel show only chaptersection level
