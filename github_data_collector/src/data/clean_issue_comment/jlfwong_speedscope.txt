It seems the builds for and latest fail because of different snapshots Some profiles can get pretty big pretty fast so itd be convenient if we could upload compressed profiles and have them be decompressed something maybe like this There is something strange The method testidsfromimportdoneexist appears twice And the second Maybe this happens because once it is the lowest line in the stacktrace and once there are submethods below this method Data was created by pyspy Feature Request It would be nice if speedscope would have some kind of filtering Either whitelisting only include stacktrace lines which mycodemylib in the path name Or blacklisting exclude stacktrace lines which contain frameworkstandardlibrary I am not able to implement this But maybe the company I work for could sponsorfinance the implementation It would be very nice if speedscope would visualize the memory usage too Of course optional But if the value memory usage of process would be available it would be nice to see it What do you think If WebGL is disabled in the browser the site loads and the browse button works but nothing happens after selecting a file Looking in the console there are these messages Error Setup failure speedscopef b js Error Cannot find module demanglecpp caf eejs Error Cannot find module demanglecpp caf eejs I looked up the mangled code and that error does seem to be thrown if getContextwebgl fails so it seems to check out I dont know how but some other sites will show a more friendly error if WebGL is disabled but the site requires it OS Windows Browser firefox bit with webgldisabled set to true in aboutconfig I tried chrome and it worked fine I couldnt see how to disable webgl on chrome theres no setting at least so I couldnt test if that would cause it to fail on chrome too If I look at the Sandwitch view then I cant see the difference between symbol names In this case there is executechild twice I guess one is from the python module subprocess and the next is from the module subprocess It would be very nice if you could the details of a symbol name like in the other views This is related to An easier way to understand that you can set the viewport in the upper part Up to now the mouse cursor is like in this screenshot It would be more intuitive if the cursor would look like this Here a small hint that the UX could be improved I needed to think to understand that the upper rectangle marks the viewport for the middle part of the windows With other words I needed some time to understand the pink arrow in this screenshot How could this get improved Maybe a different color for the rectangle would help I hope you care for UX issues like this And I guess you have a better idea how to fix this than my idea CTF has the nice ability to encode custom counters that then get plotted as bar charts It would be great if speedscope could do that too then I could probably replace my usage of chrometracing with speedscope already See for an example CTF trace with various counters you can open it in chrometracing to see how it looks like there Cheers
