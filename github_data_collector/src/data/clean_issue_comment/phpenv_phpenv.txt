Hello i dont know where to ask cause there is no info about google groups or something like that but ive installed with phpenv and plain php works fine now i want to add modules like ldap mcrypt and some others how i can do that ive installed pear but it doesnt contain needed modules next i tried to install pyrus to work it is needed to run like that php homephpenvphpenvversions binpyrusphar this is ok but when iv trying to install mcrypt php homephpenvphpenvversions binpyrusphar install Pyrus version a SHA D C AA FA DF CD A Using PEAR installation found at homephpenvpyrus Mimetype applicationoctetstream Pyrus Package Exception Could not download from kb Pyrus PackageFile Exception Invalid packagexml Pyrus XMLParser Exception Invalid XML document Pyrus XMLParser Exception Line Element This element is not expected Expected is how i can install these modules hello it is cool that now it generates simple systemd config so my FR is to add something like this Userusername Groupusergroup to Service section in phpfpmservice it is not a problem to add it by myself but would be cool to limit it on installation step ps and same with phpfpmconf cause default user is www and it is not relevant This issue is meant to track a feature roadmap for the Milestone At the very least this should put phpenv in parity with changes from rbenv afterwards release version numbers can be made to track rbenv version numbers Please state other phpenvspecific roadmap features to be included for tracking here Im opening this in response to which puts phpenv in line with rbenv and is very much appreciated but is too big a PR to do in just one go and will need to be broken down and tackled on a perfeature or at least percommand basis I have not found a way to complete the test on phpenvglobal with Apache apxs link library TODO Is that needed I tried to install the latest versions available on phpbuild but without luck I tried to install and they all come back with BUILD ERROR Here are the last lines from the log configure error Cannot find libz or BUILD ERROR Here are the last lines from the log configure error Cannot find zlib depending by the version Command Line Tools are installed and they are up to date definitely something to investigate further As per PR phpenv may not be sourced by a graphical login if it is only sourced in bashprofile however the instructions in READMEmd specifically point to bashprofile This may cause some unexpected behavior for some users during installation and thus needs to be amended with a more robust instruction Not acceptable solutions source phpenv from bashrc bashspecific triggers on each subshell force use of bashprofile bashspecific tell users to source bashprofile or bashrc or profile from one or the other bashspecific invasive of user preferences use complex logic to determine if we sourced bashprofile bashspecific brittle interferes with shell emulation Needs testing to determine if this is an issue Specifically sshd login working as expected terminal login working as expected GUI login working as expected I just tried to install this through homebrew it wasnt available as a package Are you the ones I should talk to about this or are they I had to install autoconf bison libjpegdev libpng dev re c and had to research these because the error messages werent clear coming from phpenv Is it possible to make one nice sudo aptget list It would be a huge timesaver for people This will scare away less experienced people in my opinion Also could you guys make the default repo clone branch master Is that a thing Add a Tipp to Topic Adding to bashprofile will only work if you start bash with tty Additional info see here If you mean broke you wont be wrong and you can Donate to phpenv to help us with that If you mean broken we can help you with that but first lets see what is really going on there Since we hide all the gory details it may happen that something broke and no errors were displayed We attempt to log everything to files one for stdout and one for stderr which can be found under tmp Information from both the log and logerr may be useful to identify the problem It may however happen that the scripts fail even before we get to start writing to the files To see what is happening behind the scene we can enable the PHPENVDEBUG option which will cause the scripts to output all the commands being executed export PHPENVDEBUG We are mostly concerned with the last few commands to see where it actually caved Try and work out in which directory the script currently executes from For most of its tasks this would be phpenvphpsrc the source code repository directory but it may be that the command was executed from the phpenv home directory phpenv or somewhere else instead Try and execute the last command from the debug output which is the one that caused phpenv to fail and exit to see if we can find the error message and identify the problem if you are still unable to fix it or even if you were able to resolve the issue please let us know about that by submitting a new issue In order for us to reproduce the problem and get a solution for you as quick as possible these are some things you can supply to help us to help you What operating system and version are you using What version of bash are you using What are the exact commands executed which caused the failure What was the standard output If you think it may help post a link to a gist of the debug output or just the last odd lines of that Can you see anything from the bottom of the log files perhaps that may help in finding a resolve The most important part of solving these issues is for us to be able to reproduce the problems first Create a new issue and write down as much as possible and give it a good description but before you submit first preview the message and follow as you read Can you reproduce the problem based on the information youve given Good now press submit and someone will get back to you shortly
