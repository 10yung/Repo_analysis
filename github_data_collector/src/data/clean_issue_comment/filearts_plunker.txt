security fix PRs for this repo from the Security Alerts page details When I attempt to hit the streaming button I get Streaming fails Unable To Load Streaming Code with no instructions or advice on how to get it working The links to Privacy Policy and Terms of service are not working from When I go to create a new Plunk I see the following error in the console After that I cannot add any packages editor js TypeError Failed to construct URL Invalid URL plunkrloaderror For example Loading screen doesnt disappear Hi Geoff Plunkr is totally awesome It would be abolutely off the scale if it was possible to import a GitHub repository from within mobile Safari iOS on iPhoneiPad At the moment it seems you can do this with the desktop version I am desperate to import an Angular project from my GitHub account Just to let you know at the moment although StackBlitz allows this kind of functionality the preview does not work on the iPhone Whereas the preview does work with Plunkr so adding the import routine would put it ahead of all the competition on mobile devices Was using puppeteer to do some auto stuff That session id was given by plunker but its not mine I often observe single page applications failing to fetch resources ondemand after some inactivity URL Steps to reproduce the problem Open one of the above plunks preferably the first one When the preview is loaded wait for about a minute Click on one of the items within the app eg kbdLufthansa EUR kbd The app tries to show some more content but fails to do so Check the network tab in the dev tools Result Error resource demoviewDetailviewxml could not be loaded from viewDetailviewxml Check for file not found or parse errors The fetch fails with even though the file exists in the project folder and doesnt contain any invalid syntax that could result in parse errors Workarounds Interact with the app as soon as possible In the above case reload the plunk and click on the kbdLufthansakbd item immediately The app successfully retrieves the requested view and displays it on the right side Use one of the links same plunk different links No matter how long you wait files can be retrieved anytime
