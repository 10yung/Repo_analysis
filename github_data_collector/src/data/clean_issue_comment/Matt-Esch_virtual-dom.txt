Hello MattEsch We have currently a project where all ui are based on virtualdom and pretty happy We want to insert in one of this project screen a component developped in React for another project Do you think we can we do that and be sure that no future problems will occur thanks Hi I have a state object which contains an array which is used to show tab view The array generates an array of widget in the UI If i close the second element or the first element always the last element is destroyed I am trying to create virtual table rows with a loop but they dont appear The rendering works but only to the tbody This is the resulting HTML div table tbodytbody table div The code var h requirevirtualdomh var createElement requirevirtualdomcreateelement function viewstate function renderRows var rows for var i i stateitemslength i var item stateitems i rowspush htr htd itemdocumentDate htd itemdocumentKey return rows let tableRows renderRows return hdiv htable htbody tableRows var tree viewstate var rootNode createElementtree documentgetElementByIdappappendChildrootNode How can I get this to work Phantomjs is an unmaintained project Removed phantomjs dependency from packagejson runbrowser supports phantomjs hence removed it from devdependency Signedoffby ossdev ossdevpuresoftwarecom When I change the keys test case as follows the getReorderPatch function doesnt work because the patch returned from diff is an Array javascript testkeys get reordered function assert var leftNode hdiv hdiv hdiv key hdiv hdiv key var rightNode hdiv hdiv key hdiv hdiv key hdiv var rootNode renderleftNode var patches diffleftNode rightNode assertequalpatchCountpatches assertReorderEqualsassert patches removes from key from key null from key inserts to key to key This PR Bumps deps npm i givers error in windows now Allows for stringlike values for inputs in Invokes hooks after properties that resolves class of issues Splits testmainjs into testhjs testrenderjs testwidgetjs testvnodejs and testpatchjs that allows for better tests navigation Adds use strict directives to avoid mistakes typos Enables gentle eslint config and fixes all errors Bumps nodejs for travis cc MattEsch Raynos Zolmeister If you prefer I can split thit PR into multiple I am going to create a transform converting react to virtualdom alike to preact so I can devote some time fixing issuesPRs if you have no time to run this repository you can provide contributor access to it There is a datavis project coming similar to rectvis hoped to base it on virtualdom so looking forward to this PR not being ignored Whats the relationship between virtualdom and react virtualdom Since new passive scroll listeners Chrome virtualdom triggers new viloation in chrome Violation Added nonpassive event listener to a scrollblocking wheel event Consider marking event handler as passive to make the page more responsive See Can you please look into it If render a snippet of HTML like so input typetext valuefoo and then update the snippet to an empty string input typetext value the updated DOM retains the foo value You seem to test the same equality keyslength times rather than testing equality for each key
