Hi This is a very cool extension I wanted to try it out and as I am one of the project leads for mybinderorg turns a Git repo into interactive executable notebooks checked if it would run there This PR is the small addition needed to make it work It tells binder to install the conda package done Try it yourself If you like it we can also add a badge like Binder this to the readme for people to try out Ive install in my python repository pip proxyproxyutbmfr install nbtutor jupyter nbextension install overwrite py nbtutor sysprefix jupyter nbextension enable nbtutor py sysprefix now in a notebook I have in a first cell loadext nbtutor and in a second cell nbtutor blutch print blutch then I execute the code in the first cell nothing appends And now in a second cell nothing happends but I have this exception just replacing my login by in my javascript console firefox Exception in event handler for toolbarrebuildCellToolbar InternalError columnNumber fileName lineNumber message too much recursion stack eventstrigger proto Object stack Arguments toolbarrebuildCellToolbar Object selected false anchor false rendered true callee Getter Setter length SymbolSymboliterator function values proto defineGetter function defineGetter defineSetter function defineSetter lookupGetter function lookupGetter lookupSetter function lookupSetter constructor function Object hasOwnProperty function hasOwnProperty isPrototypeOf function isPrototypeOf propertyIsEnumerable function propertyIsEnumerable toLocaleString function toLocaleString toSource function toSource toString function toString valueOf function valueOf Hi Logan I liked to try nbtutor with nbgrader This is weird issue after enabling nbtutor globally I am unable to make anything with cells especially create cell below current cell by menu item Insert Insert Cell Below or by keyboard shortcut I am sure this is nbtutor issue because at another server with nbgrader but not nbtutor enabled it works normally at the server giving trouble after disabling nbtutor all is as it should be My actual software versions you can see from nbgrader issue which I submitted today Edit link to nbgrader issue From Windows Mac OSx When i run nbtutor r f the GUI does not display on the right hand side I have installed nbtutor and no error message is displayed Thank you for the help I notice that the original Python Tutor application can be used with with Python Java JavaScript TypeScript Ruby C and C programmes though Im not sure how it actually works Which got me wondering will this plugin be able to work with other kernels If so to what extent might the approach generalise to other language kernels too such as R nbtutor makes notebook unusable when both nbtutor and nbgrader createassignment extensions are enabled It is nbtutor that is breaking things with the following web console error too much recursion initEventsCellToolbarprototyperebuild nbtutorjsnbtutorminjs I cant seem to get any of the visualization show up I think I am doing as shown in the screencast but it doesnt work Plus I get this when I try to turn on Memory or Timeline What am I doing wrong Thanks screen shot at pm A cells code is pointlessly rerun again via ipython to get the ipythoninput fcodecofilename set and the code cached I dont know enough yet about the IPython API to do this better inside the debugger Also include IPythons out output
