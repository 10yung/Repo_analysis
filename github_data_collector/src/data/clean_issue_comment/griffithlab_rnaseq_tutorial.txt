Hi I just quantified RNASeq reads generated with a Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing device using kallisto The estcounts reflected well the number of reads I observed for some example genes but I was wondering if the tpm calculation is using the read length parameter Since each nanopore read should more or less represent a whole transcript then incorporating a fixed read length in TPM estimation would lead to wrong results right Regards Markus I am new to RNA seq data analysis I have followed hisat stringtie and ballgown pipeline I have created the list of genes by following all steps mentioned in the paper protocol list of genes created by step number This list contains all differential expressed genes present in all samples and this list did not contain any identifier which tells me this gene belong to this sample My question is that how can I identify a number of differentially expressed genes belong to one sample here mine gene list file feature id fc pval qval gene MSTRG E gene MSTRG E gene MSTRG E gene MSTRG E same case with the trancript file geneNames geneIDs geneNames geneIDs feature id fc pval qval MSTRG MSTRG transcript E MSTRG MSTRG transcript E MSTRG MSTRG transcript E MSTRG MSTRG transcript E MSTRG MSTRG transcript E next question is that how can i change the gene id in these above file into ensembl format to get gene ontology I did the tutorial typically as it is I used the same tools versions but I have main problems in DE visualisation The distribution plot of UHR vs HBR shows a less number of genes and the labelled genes are not the real top genes of probability values but when I look to my UHRvsHBRgeneresultssigtsv I have about genes the top genes I attached the plots PDFs are IGLC MPPED PRAME IGLV CDC APOBEC B PLA G SHANK RP A CACNA I ATF IGLV KDELR ERCC Sep LA c G SYNGR MYO B ERCC GNAZ MLC MAPK IP ERCC TEF TutorialPart SupplementaryRoutputpdf outfilepdf Hi there I followed the tutorial to align RNAseq PE reads I found both rnastrandness FR and RF produced the same results and they are also the same as the results generated by ignoring stransspecificity Just wonder why is this Thanks heaps in advance for your help Huanlee Hi I have a couple of questions about dUTP method generated RNAseq data Do you thinks it has the same strand specificity as TruSeq Strand Specific Total RNA I found this piece of code from Trinityv utilalignandestimateabundancepl if SSlibtype add strandspecific options for kallisto my kallistossopt SSlibtype R rfstranded frstranded if kallistoaddopts kallistossopt kallistoaddopts kallistoaddopts Which means Trinity SSlibtype RF is equal to kallisto quant rfstranded Do you think it is correct Many thanks Huanlee I am trying to follow the tutorial but I cannot get past the expression section In particular when I try to get the expression matrix with stringtieexpressionmatrixpl I get a compilation error stringtieexpressionmatrixpl expressionmetricTPM resultdirsHBRRep HBRRep HBRRep UHRRep UHRRep UHRRep transcriptmatrixfiletranscripttpmallsamplestsv genematrixfilegenetpmallsamplestsv Type of arg to keys must be hash not private array at stringtieexpressionmatrixpl line near samplelist Execution of stringtieexpressionmatrixpl aborted due to compilation errors I am not really an expert in PERL so I am having some problems troubleshooting the code but it seems that samplelist is not a hash well it says that in the error How do I solve this Im getting a couple errors when trying to run HISAT my input is hisat p dta x index input input input input S outputsam but I keep getting the error message ERR Different number of files specified with reads as with Any help would be much appreciated I think that this tutorial could use a module on normalizing the genetranscript expression estimates provided by stringtie before differential expression estimation Hi Im experiencing errors when running the hisat to generate sam files hisat p rgidUHRRep rg SMUHR rg LBUHRRep ERCCMix rg PLILLUMINA rg PUCXX TGACAC x RNAREFINDEX dta rnastrandness RF RNADATADIRUHRRep ERCCMix Build ErccTranscriptschr read fastqgz RNADATADIRUHRRep ERCCMix Build ErccTranscriptschr read fastqgz S UHRRep sam Warning the current version of HISAT is older than the version used to build the index Users are strongly recommended to update HISAT to the latest version Error reading block of offs array Error Encountered internal HISAT exception Command homeubuntuworkspacernaseqtoolshisat hisat aligns wrapper basic p rgidUHRRep rg SMUHR rg LBUHRRep ERCCMix rg PLILLUMINA rg PUCXX TGACAC x homeubuntuworkspacernaseqreferencegenomechr withERCC dta rnastrandness RF S UHRRep sam tmp inpipe tmp inpipe ERR hisat align exited with value Any idea what caused it Create a mapping file output a final list of DE gene names create a mapping to gene name in R and use gene names as symbols in final figures
