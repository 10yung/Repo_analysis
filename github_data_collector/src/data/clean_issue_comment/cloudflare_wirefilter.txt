Would it be possible to have examples of using wirefilter in Go Its mentioned in the Cloudflare Blog post regarding wirefilter that Cloudflare has embedded the engine into your Go REST API Currently many errors return spans that last to the end of the input when they could be refined to a narrower region Not providing specific examples but it would be good to walk through the tests and see what can be improved Hello It is not issue itself but more like feature request for future it would be great to perform recursive check of nested parameters For example you have JSON as POSTarguments like abc d and it is parsed to requestpostabc and requestpostd It would be great to set single rule like requestpost to check all nested elements in requestpost variable instead of making separate checks adopting rule to requestpostabc and requestpostd In context of HTTP protocol the same might be applicable for GETarguments headers cookies or any parameter that may contain nested structure
