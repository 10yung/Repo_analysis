Hi everyone Heres a very picky image distortion bug I have a dp widget with an dp padding On the other side I have pixelperfect images made at dp its dp dp sides If I apply those images to an ImageView the result is pixelperfect But if I replace that ImageView with a CircleImageView the result is not pixelperfect anymore Thinking about it I think that CircleImageView is getting the dp image then resizing it to dp and then applying the padding and resizing the image again to dp Here are some screenshots First a comparison and then a screenshot of every case Comparing side by side Comparison Using the plain ImageView ImageView Using CircleImageView CicleImageView By the way Im using a local png file No network or strange things there Thanks again for your work And happy New Year I needed apply a spacing between the image and the border So i maked a propriety of padding mRadiusPadding that give this space kept the image without cut support Glidev to display gif setBorderAlpha method added Is it on your roadmap to add support to Glide crossfade animation handles issue Added TranstionDrawable support Now can use Glide built in transitions Calling setImageURI with the same value as the previous one causes a redraw Im programatically applying alpha values to the image like this mProfilePicturesetImageAlpha But it doesnt seem to do anything Ive tried using the same line of code on a regular ImageView and it works just fine but when applied to the CircleImageView it doesnt work Any suggestionsalternatives Hi Im facing a quite interesting problem on Android Lollipop if I set Bitmap to CircleImageView with setImageBitmap method it just shows black image monosnap Image is selected from Gallery app and I can view it in debug mode bitmap is not corrupted Everything is working OK with default ImageView monosnap This behaviour is random some images are working correctly some are not and it occurs only on Android Lollipop Do you have any suggestions Ive checked app logs everything is working OK no OutOfMemory exceptions or something similar
