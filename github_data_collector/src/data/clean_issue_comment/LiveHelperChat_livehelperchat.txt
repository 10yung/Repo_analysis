Hello I have a System where the users need to sign in and Im trying to set the chats id to the same as the users uuid so that the user never loses the conversation history even when switching browsers or devices I saw that there is a SSO plugin that was developed but I am still unsure if this is the right solution for the case Also I am unsure if it is still compatible with the most recent version of LHC Do you have any advice on how I should tackle this issue Hi I want to enable clamav virus scan on the files that a user uploads Ive enabled the scanner in the Files Configuration The livehelperchat is installed at varwwwchat Ive installed clamav and clamavdaemon using aptget Both the clamavdaemon and clamavfreshclam services are now active on my server The socket file path is varrunclamavclamdctl Now when I upload a file the socket method tries to make a socket connection using socketconnect and I get a No such file or directory error I think socketconnects nd param accepting a unix path is getting the varrunclamavclamdctl value but the socketconecction is expecting the path under varwwwchat resulting in varwwwchatvarrunclamavclamdctl How can I make it to use the rootvarrunclamavclamdctl Should I install clamav via source for this to work Hello I use sessionstart etc on various pages and directories When I embed code i the javascript doesnt run livehelperchatmasterVENKYlhcweblibcorelhcorelhsysphp at line iniset A session is active You cannot change the session modules ini settings at this time So questions where can i set error level reporting Can i set it at the directory level in htaccess or do I have to do more inside some PHP files settingsiniphp doesnt seem to have it And more importantly for sessions how do i tackle this Thanks again Live helper chat version On Firefox when the mouse is up to thumbs up and down has not the correct pointer The pointer is not the hands but the input icon How to reproduce From Firefox start a chat than when chat is accepted and you have thumbs up and down go with the mouse over and cannot see mouse pointer to be correct Is it possible to stop the html tags being stripped from additional data sent Cant find where this is happening in the code Ideally Id like to add a new variable type HTML and only prevent tags being stripped for those of that type Any advice how to go about this Hi I want have purchase during the chat or even before chat starts What can I do Anyone can help We were getting errors because some urls are larger than characters Increasing the size of varchar from to on lhchatonlineuserfootprintpage in the database fixes the error Http spec allows for urls to be a maximum of characters I think this should be the limit Could this get changed A simple schema update would do it ALTER TABLE lhchatonlineuserfootprint MODIFY page varchar NOT NULL Hi I would like to know if is it possible to set an api call to an external service inside a lhc bot For example I would like to set a trigger for any chat event start new message new file close ecc and then suddenly send a request via POST with all chat info and parameter wait for a response and then make the bot to execute an action based on the obtained value Thanks in advance If I chat within Telegram bot there is no notification comes if client closed the chat Is it possible to realize this feature Or maybe I should make some changes in code
