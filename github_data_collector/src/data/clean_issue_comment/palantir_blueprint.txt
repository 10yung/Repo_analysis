Steps Navigate to Click open dialog Resize the window so the scrollbars appears Click on the scrollbar to view the bottom of the modal Youll see the dialog disappear and the user may not be able to get back to the contents of the dialog fixes Environment Package versions Browser and OS versions Google Chrome Mac OS X If possible link to a minimal repro So far unable to repro outside of our App Steps to reproduce Have an overlay appear Click on it to give it focus Actual behavior Get the following crash TypeError Failed to execute contains on Node parameter is not of type Node OverlaythishandleDocumentFocus srccomponentsoverlayoverlaytsx This screen is visible only in development It will not appear if the app crashes in production Open your browser s developer console to further inspect this error Expected behavior For it to just focus Possible solution We do extend the Overlay with this component jsx BPOverlay usePortalfalse isOpenthisshowOverlay Card classNamenonidealoverlaycard NonIdealState titlethistitle descriptionthisdescription iconthisicon div classNameoverlayadditionalcontent thisadditionalContent div Card BPOverlay However were not touching the handleDocumentFocus method any ideas as to what may be going on here Were using TypeScript and we were also able to repro this in an older version as well Environment Package versions Browser and OS versions Internet Explorer Steps to reproduce Ignore all modern browsers on your computer and instead open Internet Explorer Browse to Switch on Loading prop Actual behavior The loading button spinner is not positioned correctly blueprintbuttonloadingie Expected behavior The loading spinner should be centered vertically and horizontally in the button Environment Package versions Browser and OS versions Chrome Official Build bit Steps to reproduce I have a class that displays a bread crumb for each directory in a path I show this in my dialog which is pixels wide Below is my

HTMLLinkElement const target aElementtarget thispropsonBreadCrumbClickedtarget Actual behavior If the path is really long and each breadcrumb has more than one word the words wrap BreadCrumbWrapping If the path is so long that the overflow menu is visible tabbing does not take you to the overflow menu instead it takes you to the first unoverflowed item Clicking the space bar or enter key not sure which one should work here does not call the crumbs onClick method Expected behavior I do not want my crumbs to wrap I want to be able to tab to the overflow menu I want to click the space bar or enter key not sure which one should work here and if the overflow menu has focus I want the menu to display if a bread crumb has focus I want the OnClick method to be called Possible solution Add tabIndex to the overflow menu Prevent wrapping for the breadcrumb text Have the breadcrumb code catch the appropriate keys and call the onClick method IF YOU ARE A PALANTIR EMPLOYEE DO NOT POST INTERNAL LINKS OR REFERENCES HERE Environment Package versions blueprintjstable Browser and OS versions Chrome v Windows v If possible link to a minimal repro Steps to reproduce In the above CodeSandbox link click a checkbox in the table Notice that the table row highlights but the Checkbox stays unchecked Click the checkbox again and now it finally rerenders in checked state Actual behavior The cellRenderer function for the checkbox Column is not being called upon state change of which rows are selected This causes the checkbox and the row highlight to become out of sync EDIT It appears that if I set the data limit to records the bug goes away and works as I intended If its anything higher than the bug reappears EDIT Setting the renderMode to NONE also seems to fix the bug But I lose performance with large data sets Expected behavior I expect the checkboxes to be in sync with the row highlight The checkbox should require one click to toggle the selected state of the row Possible solution I dont have a solution Environment Package versions blueprintjscore Browser and OS versions Mac OS X Chrome If possible link to a minimal repro fork this code sandbox here Steps to reproduce Spotted this while building a ControlGroup that contained buttons selects and some dividers tsx ControlGroup Other controls Button Divider Button Other controls ControlGroup Actual behavior The divider doesnt have its usual px padding Instead ControlGroup overrides with a default px padding for all controls Expected behavior The divider should have a px padding when inside a ControlGroup Possible solution scss Special case for dividers bp controlgroup bp divider margin px Labeling P because its an easy line fix of custom CSS for application authors Filing quickly for tracking but may be able to open a PR soon Part of Changes proposed in this pull request Convert the tslint custom rules to eslint Its been a while since I made these changes we should probably check they all still work and are linked up correctly Im not sure how I feel about the IconComponents rule may be worth removingupdating Its unclear to me why you would want to enforce anything other than Icon
