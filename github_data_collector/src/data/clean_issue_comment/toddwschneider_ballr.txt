Hi First of all congratulation on this fantastic work I honestly believe the pros at NBA are going to check these charts out quite a bit You can get a lot of information out of them and very intuitively so Have you considered allowing users to not filter by season therefore getting stats for a players entire career Im sure many would like to see that I think you can take that a step further and do charts that compare a players performance against his own across his career highlighting good and bad years It should allow us to see when a player peaked and compare his performance across different teams Anyway keep up the good work
