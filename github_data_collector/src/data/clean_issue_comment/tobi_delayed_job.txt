Hello I am using your class to perform a task similar to this I own a worker and this worker called me another worker But every time I do this the process is locked have you ever come across this error The query which can take several seconds UPDATE delayedjobs SET delayedjobslockedat delayedjobslockedby hostmine pid WHERE runat AND lockedat IS NULL OR lockedat OR lockedby hostmine pid AND failedat IS NULL ORDER BY priority ASC runat ASC LIMIT My indexes SQL Create Table CREATE TABLE delayedjobs id int NOT NULL AUTOINCREMENT priority int NOT NULL DEFAULT attempts int NOT NULL DEFAULT handler text NOT NULL lasterror text runat datetime DEFAULT NULL lockedat datetime DEFAULT NULL failedat datetime DEFAULT NULL lockedby varchar DEFAULT NULL queue varchar DEFAULT NULL createdat datetime DEFAULT NULL updatedat datetime DEFAULT NULL PRIMARY KEY id KEY delayedjobspriority priorityrunat KEY indexdelayedjobsonpriorityandrunat priorityrunat ENGINEInnoDB AUTOINCREMENT DEFAULT CHARSETutf ROWFORMATCOMPRESSED EXPLAIN says id selecttype table type possiblekeys key keylen ref rows Extra SIMPLE delayedjobs index NULL PRIMARY NULL Using where Using filesort row in set sec Problem is described below Server try to fetch a JSON object of user information from a remote server However some special character maybe utf mb make JSONparse raise a error DelayedJob caught the error thrown above then try to write the stack trace into lasterror field of table MySQL backend of ActiveRecord happend to be in UTF encoding it throw a error WHOLE running DelayedJob instance crashed and stopped I think some where need a begin rescue log writing failed xEF from ASCII BIT to UTF Mysql Error Incorrect string value xF x F x x xE for column lasterror at row UPDATE delayedjobs SET attempts lasterror unexpected token at subscribe openid o uLOt Z zaXfWBBcz Z Gz PmP nickname sex language zhCN city province country Hi It seems like nothing has happened in this repository for a while and the work is being done in collectiveideadelayedjob Why not set the canonical repository to that one so that issues and pull requests arent filed here This is easily done in the settings for your repository which Ive handily linked to smiley Cheers Hi for examaple Userrb model contains reward method which should be called using delayed job def reward puts selfinspect its returning the db record not the delayed job object handler end Now the problem is how do i access the delayed job object in reward method See comment on issue This actually does not work The first worker will block the next until it receives a kill TERM or INT and then the next one starts This is not multiple works but running three one after the other Please remove this incorrect documentation as it will cause people to waste time trying it If you set the I nlocale to a value different from the default locale the delayed tasks will not preserve the setting and you will have to set it manually inside each task eg send delayed mail See removing unnecessary linebreak in README thats all
