GitHub changed the way Markdown headings are parsed so this change fixes it See bryant readmesfix for more information Tackles bryant readmesfix Hi and thanks for this great plugin Is there a way to change the gravity direction according to the accelerometer of iOS or Android devices apply requestAnimationFrame apply translate D I like your plug very much but it not have the option named containment moving elements inside a div that is in jQuerythrowablePlease include this option so i can make my game easly Hi Im trying to rotate divs to use them as static diagonal obstacles The css rotation values seem to get overridden as soon as I make the div participate in the physics simulation This makes sense for dynamic objects But I imagine there should be some way of rotating static elements To recap Is it possible to give static elements custom rotational values and what would the correct syntax be Hi I checked all the examples but there wasnt anything on how to create some irregular terrain I would be fine with just drawing a straight line with some diagonal ups and downs but what is the methdodsyntax of doing something like that with box djquery I love this library and really want to use it for a bio section on my site It would be nice to be able to set the container div that the object should stay within the bounds of This way I could have the photo balls to fall and bounce around my bio section without falling out of view Is this a planned update Or is there a setting for it I am missing According to jQuery Opera v and older may sometimes report offsetWidth andor offsetHeight less than zero on some elements Therefore the check if an element is loaded should not simply evaluate for false since negative numbers will incorrectly evaluate as true Is there a way to disable gravity and let the balls just move constantly without dropping
