I am working on the DShapeNet now however I have no idea on the pretrained model discriminative classmat and generative classmat Anyone can tell me where to find the pretrained models or how to generate them by myself Thanks a lot What is the format used for saving the voxels or the occupancy grid Also is the raw or tiff data considered as voxel data that can be processed using your framework How can I run the code without a GPU It is just for a small test Is it possible Thank you I ran polygon voxeldemo with example function below and receive error that array exceeds maximum array size preference Any ideas Thanks Justin polygon voxeldemo Error using polygon voxeldouble Requested x x GB array exceeds maximum array size preference Creation of arrays greater than this limit may take a long time and cause MATLAB to become unresponsive See array size limit or preference panel for more information Error in polygon voxel line Volumepolygon voxeldoubleFacesAFacesBFacesCVerticesXVerticesYVerticesZVolumeSizeWrap Error in polygon voxeldemo line J polygon voxelFV none Make A Volume with a few blocks I false I I I I Convert the volume to a triangulated mesh FV isosurfaceI Convert the triangulated mesh back to a surface in a volume J polygon voxelFV none Fill the volume JimfillJholes Differences between original and reconstructed VD absJI Show the original Mesh and Mesh of new volume figure subplot titleoriginal patchFVfacecolor edgecolornone camlightview subplot titleconverted patchisosurfaceJ facecolor edgecolornone camlightview subplot titledifference patchisosurfaceVD facecolor edgecolornone camlightview There are files discriminative classmat discriminative classmat generative classmat and generative classmat which I think are pretrained models But when I run call rectestm with any of these models I get the following error Error using feval Argument must contain a string or functionhandle Error in myConvolve line targetgpu fevalkConv Error in rectest line hiddenpresigmoid myConvolve kConvforward batchdata modellayersluw stride forward My question is whether pretraining using runpretrainm is necessary for running rectestm Also from where do we get the accuracy of the test data Thanks Hey I really like your work and I would like to reproduce your results on the NYU dataset How do you turn your point clouds into voxel representation Do you have the code for this Thanks How do you read a model and class parameters to sampletestclassificationmodelclass The provided models are a struct and I receive an error Undefined function mergemodel for input arguments of type struct Error in sampletestclassification line model mergemodelmodel
