Hi ybsong I am interested in the CREST and tested it in OTB and VOT I found that the performance drops when the scale of the target change rapidly compared to other trackers Maybe the search ratio is not a good solution Do you have some advices to solve this problem Thanks i find the code can not run in OTB because the size of the object is different but in code it designed resize the scales of times bigger than target can you give me a copy of test codes which can test on the OTB or VOT thanks The idea is apprently borrowed from the other one convolutional layerbased tracker CRT but not cited And I can not really understand how the temporal residual learning in the proposed framework can be helpful for tracking It is unreasonable Cant believe this is ICCV spotlight using vlargparse error when OTB test Expected either a paramvalue pair or a structure ybsong dynamicsong Can the residual layer really capture the appearance changes I think it only contributes to the training of base layer Error using Inner matrix dimensions must agree Error in CRESTtracking line featfeatcoeff Error in Demo line resultCRESTtrackingoptsvararginconfigdisplay Error in run line evalincaller script Hello here is the problem feat x single and coeff x double can you help me solve it ybsong I noticed that the CREST only use layers of VGG By using all the convolution layers will the accuracy increase And the learning rate of the residual network is too slow Does it mean that the parameter of the network need not to be changed substantially Therefore can the network be trained offline with large tracking benchmark thus making the CREST faster without much online training ybsong I am interested in your great job Can you provide vot trax code so that I can test CREST in VOT and VOT Dear author i have installed matconvnet successfully When running Demom i got some errors Just showed below Error using vlargparse line Expected either a paramvalue pair or a structure Error in cnntraindag line opts varargin vlargparseopts varargin Error in CRESTtracking line info cnntraindagnetonline imdb inputgetBatchWrapperopts Error in Demo line resultCRESTtrackingoptsvararginconfigdisplay I think that there is something wrong with your input variable values in the function cnntraindag or getBatchWrapper but i cant find the solution about that error Has anyone else had the same problem when running Demom Thank you for your time i am looking forward to your reply vlnnconv The option name is not a string argument number dagnnConvforward line outputs vlnnconv dagnnLayerforwardAdvanced line outputs objforwardinputs objnetparamsparvalue dagnnDagNNeval line objlayerslblockforwardAdvancedobjlayersl CRESTtracking line net evalinputgpuArraypatch Demo line resultCRESTtrackingoptsvararginconfigdisplay could you help me to solve this
