Expected algebriteorg to list latest stable as v and the test boxes to run against v Actual algebriteorg lists latest stable as v and runs examples off of Also relevant Which releases are considered stable Would v be the one to update to The command clear in Algebrite clears all predefined symbols If you enter clear e Algebrite returns e undefined Im looking into integrating Algebrite into my javascript web app for comparing math expressions that a user inputs in a text field with the correct solutions While testing Im experiencing that sometimes Algebritesimplify slows down significantly even though Im just adding a Calling Algebritesimplifyx takes sec to calculate while Algebritesimplifyx takes roughly ms Can you fix this issue or at least explain why this is happening When running this on your demo website or in the console Im getting results almost instantly Im using a minified version of the algebritebundleforbrowserjs Thanks in advance By example if I do defintx sinx x it gives me cos cos sin sin if I add double number in the range sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt By example if I do defintx sinx x it gives me Stop integral sorry could not find a solution When entering floattanpi the result is a big numeric result Similarly with other spots at which the tangent should be undefined Maybe output an error message instead Itd be nice if there were a way to get to return instead of a complex number I can get it using rootsx but it doesnt seem like theres any easy way for me to pick the real root out of the roots list eg in AlgebriteANYFUNCTIONAlgebritefactor x ANYFUNCTION wont get the factored input cause its argument is evaluated and hence the factors will be reexpanded Is this needed Can this be controlled better this came out of the discussion in At the moment rationalize x returns the term unchanged Numerator gives x and denominator Id expectlike to get x x and I guess this behavior is expected but is there a way to change it so that I get the results Id like to have or an other option Thanks factorxx x returns xx x x It should return x It seems that in cases involving fractions the system tries to distribute first before resolving the fractions ASSUMED STEPS IN ALGEBRITE xx x x x x x x xx Instead when factoring the system should recognise that sums within products can be cancelled out within fractions I tried to solve an equation with modular arithmetic but there seems to be a syntax error here x x Stop expected Is Algebrite able to solve equations that include modular arithmetic
