We recently introduced the ability to change an environment s instance type and suspension timeout but we don t allow changing it s name Since some users may prefer to retain an environment for an extended period of time as opposed to deletingrecreating environments from a repo as needed it seems valuable to support renaming so that folks can ensure their environment names are always as recognizablemeaningful as possible Using either VS Code desktop or web connected to a VSO environment copying individual files into the environment with draganddrop works but copying out of the environment with draganddrop does not seem to do anything Downloading files by selecting the file in the File Explorer viewlet and running the command File Download works correctly copyissue Details

creating a new environment and enter a name for the environment I see a check mark in the name box which seems to indicate that the name has been validated However if an environment of the same name already exists the create environment action will fail saying that the environment name is not unique It would be useful to get the error message when the name was seemingly validated before we attempted to create an environment Since today my VSO environment does not work anymore Im unable to browse for files homevsonline does not exist does not exist either I get message Failed to connect
