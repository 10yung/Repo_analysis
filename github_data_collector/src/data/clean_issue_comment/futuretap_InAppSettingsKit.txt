Hello After update POD on IOS i get errors with all my PSRadioGroupSpecifier The error is located on file IASKAppSettingsViewControllerm line selections indexPathsection updateSelectionInCellcell indexPathindexPath After investigations on same file I change that part voidcreateSelections NSMutableArray sectionSelection NSMutableArray new for int i i settingsReadernumberOfSections i IASKSpecifier specifier selfsettingsReader headerSpecifierForSectioni if specifiertype isEqualToStringkIASKPSRadioGroupSpecifier IASKMultipleValueSelection selection IASKMultipleValueSelection alloc initWithSettingsStoreselfsettingsStore selectiontableView selftableView selectionspecifier specifier selectionsection i sectionSelection addObjectselection else sectionSelection addObject NSNull null selections sectionSelection with voidcreateSelections NSMutableArray sectionSelection NSMutableArray new NSInteger sectionsNumber selfsettingsReadernumberOfSections for int i i sectionsNumber i IASKSpecifier specifier selfsettingsReader headerSpecifierForSectioni if specifiertype isEqualToStringkIASKPSRadioGroupSpecifier IASKMultipleValueSelection selection IASKMultipleValueSelection alloc initWithSettingsStoreselfsettingsStore selectiontableView selftableView selectionspecifier specifier selectionsection i sectionSelection addObjectselection else sectionSelection addObject NSNull null selections sectionSelection Hello I would really like to extend the IASKAppSettingsViewController to a custom one and just override the func settingsViewController sender IASKAppSettingsViewController buttonTappedFor specifier IASKSpecifier But my approach of extending IASKAppSettingsViewController and on viewDidLoad assigning the delegate self does not work The settings get display no matter what I do but the button never reacts to clicks Add more and more to my main viewcontroller is not what I want With the current version the Privacy Open in Settings app cell is placed within its own section and is not possible to modify its position in the table So instead of inserting the privacy cell in code as done in voidreinterpretBundleNSDictionarysettingsBundle how do you feel about making it so that the user can specify the location of the privacy settings cell by using a key such as IASKOpenPrivacySettings in SettingsbundleRootplist When the settings plist contains the string ApplicationGroupContainerIdentifier and a custom container name its not currently used by InAppSettingsKit See for information about this key Container groups are used for sharing settings such as between the app and its widgets Looking in IASKSettingsStoreUserDefaults it appears that standardUserDefaults is always used This should call initWithSuiteName with the name of the container from the key ApplicationGroupContainerIdentifier CGFloattableViewUITableViewtableView heightForSpecifierIASKSpecifierspecifier might be renamed to heightForCustomViewSpecifier It is confusing as it is now because it implies the delegate can set height for all types of specifiers In reality all are except kIASKCustomViewSpecifier which is actually the only type getting its height from this delegate method Thanks for a great product Will be nice to have a search similar to the iOS settings I dont understand the README very well Thank you very much if you can provide some gif pictures I couldnt find any way to change it It would be nice at least to transfer color from IASKAppSettingsViewControllers background Is there any support for validation For inapp settings it would be nice to have minmax length regex matching etc At minimum there should be some sort of validation delegate This is a selfish request but since Ive only picked up Swift just started and not ObjC I was wondering wether someone could provide a Swift sample of the app which doesnt require understanding ObjC PS Willing to sponsor the work
