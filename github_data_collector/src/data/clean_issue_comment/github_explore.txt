bootstrap should be placed here as a topic due to the fact that it is a definition of tool that is already recognizable all over the world it creates an effective combination that is trendy in the web even NASA uses it This is also the term for valuable software that helps in the development of projects and saves the valuable time of developers and designers Please note we will close your PR without comment if you do not check the boxes above and provide ALL requested information The Issues tabview of repos on topics makes exploring new projects difficult I like to browse topics to discover new projects and topics The Issues tabview obscures relevant toplevel information about a project instead showing a preview of a single issue on the repo The issues view does not give me any information of interest Please see the screenshot from the githubcomtopicsrobotics page for reference Robotics topics Issues view Code view relaxed Repos that are on the original Code tab provide all the info necessary to grok the projects contents and purpose For example from the description of AtsushiSakaiPythonRobotics I can assume it is a repository containing python sample codes for robotics algorithms from the topics that python robotics and algorithm are key parts of the repo and from the language indicator that it is mostly in notebooks Issues view persevere hybridgroupgobot is unfortunately in Issues view and it is not clear to me as the user what the project is about why it is featured in robotics topics or why I should be concerned with the featured Issue I dont know anything about gobot so why should I be concerned with one users need to use the gobot framework to leverage MQTTbot events to control the TelloBot Driver I would rather know what gobot is about How to disable Issues I would like to only see the code view how topics used to be and not see Issues or any other tab How can I display topics in this manner Give us full explanation Toi choi Vn game
