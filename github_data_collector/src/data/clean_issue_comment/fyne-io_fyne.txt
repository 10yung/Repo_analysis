 Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe The latest version of the cmd tool tries to rebuild the windows binary after the icon has been packaged and that rebuild will fail if the user doesnt have relevant windows stuff guessing MinGW and thus gives an error bash usrlib golangpkgtoollinuxamd link running x soluslinuxgcc failed exit status x soluslinuxgcc error unrecognized command line option mwindows Some users including my self might not have the required windows compiler toolchains guessing that thats the case here becuase they might be using fynecross instead for the windows packaging and rebuilding Describe the solution youd like to see I Would like to have a flag to pass to have it not try to rebuild because it is doomed to fail The input indicator box is located outside the app windows and mac like this avatar avatar Description Applications that wish to handle input without using the Entry widget cannot currently work on mobile This allows the app to request a keyboard show or hide programatically Checklist Tests included I could not find a way to test this it is a thin layer on top of existing functionality x Lint and formatter run with no errors x Tests all pass x Public APIs match existing style The following code has been used to run it The timeSleep is not required normally but this app wants the keyboard to appear on load which must be slightly delayed go if mobDev ok fyneCurrentDevicemobileDevice ok go func timeSleeptimeSecond mobDevShowVirtualKeyboard resulting in IMG I just watrched the youtiube presenation series of fyne Wow For the release i think that pion webrtc is the perfect marriage I bet the Webrtc pion tram would love to team up on this Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe To make an
