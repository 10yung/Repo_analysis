Hi Ive been using syuzhet and got to say its just awesome What I would like to add is my own dictionary in a NRC kind of way with my own sentiments and values Im kind of new to R and I tried to replicate the getnrcsentiment and getnrcvalues in order to acomplish getting my own dictionary I came up with something like this getcustomsentiment functioncharv clNULL lowercase TRUE myDictionary if ischaractercharv stopData must be a character vector ifisnullcl inheritscl cluster stopInvalid Cluster lexicon dplyrfilternrc lang language I commented this since I wanted my own dictionary iflowercase charv tolowercharv wordl strsplitcharv AZaz ifisnullcl nrcdata lapplywordl getcustomvalues lexicon myDictionary else nrcdata parallelparLapplyclcl wordl lexicon myDictionary getcustomvaluesmyDictionary resultdf asdataframedocallrbind nrcdata stringsAsFactorsF reorder the columns mycolorder c anger anticipation disgust fear joy sadness surprise trust negative positive resultdf mycolorder And for getting the values getcustomvalues functionwordvectorlexicon NULL if isnulllexicon lexicon dplyrfilternrc lang language Again commented this since I want my own Dictionary if allcword sentiment value in nameslexicon stoplexicon must have a word a sentiment and a value field data dplyrfiltermyDictionary word in wordvector data dplyrgroupbydata sentiment data dplyrsummariseatdata value sum allsent uniquemyDictionarysentiment sentpresent uniquedatasentiment sentabsent setdiffallsent sentpresent if lengthsentabsent missingdata dplyrdataframesentiment sentabsent value data rbinddata missingdata tidyrspreaddata sentiment value If I pass the dictionary directly into the function code not as a variable the code works but if I pass it as a variable I get this error Error in getcustomsentimentDBtext feelings Invalid Cluster My guess is there is something in how I format de custom dictionary that doesnt let the function find the clusters in this line ifisnullcl inheritscl cluster stopInvalid Cluster But also if that was the case why does it work if I put the dictionary directly inside the function I hope this makes sense and that you could point me in the right direction to work on this I realized that the NRC dictionary in spanish has multiple appearances for the same word in the same sentiment I look into the structure for the original translated dictionaries at and figured out that this has a same word in spanish being used to translate several words For instance the word asesino serves as translation for the words assassin cutthroat murderer murderous and slayer which in turn due to data structure returns incorrect data when being used with the packages functions The output for getnrcsentimentcharv cmira un asesino language spanish is anger disgust fear sadness surprise and negative while the output for getnrcsentimentcharv clook an assassin language english is anger fear sadness and negative I think itd be look if you could fix this for the package is quite useful I would expect this same issue to appear in other translation currently only languages with Latin alphabets are supported by NRC and custom methods I have made a fork which supports Unicode alphabets by altering the regex used and by using the CRAN package tokenizers for unicode tokenisation The regex has been altered from AZaz to s looking only at whitespace to split the strings There are more complex alternatives using perl style regex to include only non unicode alphabet characters if this causes issues I tried to use getnrcsentiment with lang portuguese and NRC method but it aways returns zero for all sentiments I was wondering if I shoud do something more to use it
