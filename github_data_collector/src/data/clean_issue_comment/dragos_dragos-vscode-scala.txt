 KDownloading Error DownloadErrorCaught javaioIOException Server returned HTTP response code for URL Server returned HTTP response code for URL Info PM Connection to server got closed Server will restart I have encounter this weird DownloadError when opening up this scala project for the first time Not sure if this is an issue of this plugin though is this superseded by Metals now or are we not to that point yet Im noticing that this extension when enabled in VSCode creates two files in the current project folder ensimelangserverlog pcstdoutlog Any way to prevent these files from being generated or at least have them be generated in some temp location My environment VSCode Scala Language Server My Scala project uses sbt with scala and sbtensime i tried also but same result OSX Java The plugin doesnt seem to work for me The hover always says Loading and no other features seem to work So I looked in the log I see these frequent errors ERROR

see this was maybe fixed in another issue VSCode Ext First of all thank you for your vscode extension Im having auto completion issues loading when using multifolder workspace FYI The only way I get it to work is to run sbt ensimeConfig at the top folder in the workspace corein my setting below Here is my simple workspace settings folders path core path common path project settings This issue seems to suggest that the total memory required to run a dragos LS is MB by coursier MB dragos GB Is that still the case Id like to use dragos in my project but our memory is a bit constrained We cant afford to shell out GB memory for this feature The amount of memory we can allocate for a LS is MB at the moment Do you think its possible to lower memory consumption for dragos Thanks Before that change VS Code would complain about unknown configuration options if those options were added to settingsjson This is properly recognized by VS Code The CI failure seems unrelated Are there plans for this extension to support an Outline tree view Would be a very useful feature Thanks For some reason langserver doesnt work on my MBP I have an encrypted filesystem APFS maybe thats the problem From
