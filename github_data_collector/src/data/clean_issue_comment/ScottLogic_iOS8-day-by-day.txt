CoreImage Detectors when debug on iPhone iOS always crashes with bad access in videoDisplayViewdisplay Without debug mode all works correct and on iOS too Im trying to use your chroma key filter and right now I have to run two pass on my image first getting the average color of a small area of the image then extract the color from the returned image then pass that color to your chroma filter then run the chroma filter It would be great to be able to chain those two filters Any idea how i could do that Hi Can I Take image and crop when detect rectangle Can u help me iOS daybydaymaster coreimagedetectorsLiveDetectionLiveDetectionCoreImageVideoFilterswift Value of type OSType aka UInt does not conform to expected dictionary value type AnyObject having this problem does it work for image sharing from photo library Is there any way to instead of bringing up the menu to click on the elements to open a Safari web view and have the JS communicate with that window I have a little bookmarklet that works wonders with your code but it overrides the parent window Id either like to launch the full iOS app to process the URL or run the JS on that popover dialog in safari Is this possible Hello Ive noticed that this example doesnt work on iOS See an attachment below bug I checked the issue in emulator and on my iPod with the same result On iOS and everything works as expected Any ideas how to fix it Im learning the sample code about how split view works The code runs fine in iPad but in iPhone the split view doesnt collapseleft screen is part of the master control Im using the iOS simulator First Id like to thank you for the great example It was very helpful I have implemented TouchId in my app per your example and it works as expected as long as the deployment is done via cable local However it stops working if one deploys via iTunesConnect In that case it does not seem to retrieve anything anymore Can somebody please provide some help or insight Thoughts Thanks in advance
