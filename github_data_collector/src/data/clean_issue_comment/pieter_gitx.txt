 When a commit message was changed by the git hooks it was not being respected The original message was still being passed along rather than the updated commit message from the commit message file Hi Pieter Thanks for making gitx Heres a typo fix for you Erin Hi I just changed one line in the historycss so that the gravatar image shown to the right in the commit history is shown on the same line as the commit meta details Added a simple button to the toolbar so that a keyboard shortcut or clicking the menu button Perhaps you like it I use a vertical monitor setup and was constantly annoyed to have to set the divider at every start Now it saves its position Greetings Mike
