For static and dynamic apps Prerequisites x I am running the latest version up upgrade x I searched to see if the issue already exists x I inspected the verbose debug output with the v verbose flag Are you an Up Pro subscriber Description It would be great to add regex capabilities to redirects like so redirects folderslugregexhere location status The pricing doesnt look great but it should at least be an option Basically its API GW without all the overengineered bits that are trivial to do within your application itself Currently you cant define these perstage only with up env Ideally you can define them in the stage and at the root level and they merge Im not sure if precedence should be given to up envs or the upjson but probably the upjson would be the most clear Prerequisites x I am running the latest version up upgrade x I searched to see if the issue already exists x I inspected the verbose debug output with the v verbose flag Are you an Up Pro subscriber Description Id like to use the same domain for multiple apps just different paths Hope this is possible Im getting this error ApiDomainProduction betaexampleco already exists in stack arnawscloudformationeunorth stackdashboard f f fed e b cb Steps to Reproduce Have at least two apps like name app stages beta domain betaexampleco zone betaexampleco path app and name api stages beta domain betaexampleco zone betaexampleco path api And so forth Then run up stack plan v up stack apply v even thought the verboseflag doesnt work for apply thinking Love Up Yes Definitely its super awesome Just need to know how to do this and then Ill hopefully be able to purchase pro cupid See for more details Prerequisites x I am running the latest version up upgrade x I searched to see if the issue already exists x I inspected the verbose debug output with the v verbose flag Are you an Up Pro subscriber Description TLDR in the javaGradle support in runtimesgo both the build and clean hooks should check for the availability of the gradle wrapper See The default clean hook fails for my project In particular my project is a Java Gradle project with the Gradle wrapper installed I also have a local Gradle installation which is a different version than the wrapper Due to the project fails when running with the locally installed version of Gradle but works when the wrapper is used By default up is currently using the wrapper for build but the locally installed Gradle for clean Steps to Reproduce With a project that uses Gradle and has the wrapper installed run up deploy v and see that the clean didnt use the Gradle wrapper Love Up Please consider signing up for Up Pro or donating via Slack Join us on Slack Prerequisites x I am running the latest version up upgrade v x I searched to see if

used the AWS execution role name foobar instead of its ARN arnawsiam rolefoobar Error message panic runtime error index out of range was not helpful had to fish out source code and realize that it
