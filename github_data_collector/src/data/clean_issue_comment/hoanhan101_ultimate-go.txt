For me I think this is common and confusing pitfall beyond just error interface it affects any usermade interfaces and structs Ive created Go snippet for this In Java null in DerivedClass is the same null in BaseInterface when assigned A lot of Go Projects are now moving to new dependency management system Go Module Go Module would be promoted instead of GOPATH GOPATH would still be there for backwardcompatibility This Feature will be finalized in soontobe Go Is there any plan for it or it need further discussion
