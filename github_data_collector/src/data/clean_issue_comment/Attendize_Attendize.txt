Hello I work in theatre and often when selling tickets for an event well have different ticket prices without knowing the exact number of each type of ticket well need but with a maximum total number of tickets to sell For example If Im doing a kids show with a seat theatre I may have price points adult and kid but I dont know exactly how many of each ticket type Ill need just that the total number of tickets sold cannot exceed I think it would benefit many if there was an option to set a maximum number of tickets when creating an event to automatically limit the number of tickets sold regardless of ticket type and maybe also an option to exclude certain types of tickets from the overall count Thank you I would do it myself if I had any coding skills Im a huge fan of this project and eternally grateful that Ive found it Im testing the software and It seems wonderful but QR Scanning doesn t work I tested on Firefox on Mac and Chrome and Firefox on Android I m getting the Couldnt find enough finder patterns error Any ideas Thanks I created an event and configured everything But when I try to end the event details and click on the customize link it loads a page with the message Well be back soon Were currently making improvements to our website How can i fix this issue Version The application can execute remote code XSS on the Account settings page at the version check Attendize uses a http request to to check for a newer version Since the response is just inserted onto the html any code can be executed Here is a POC response scriptalert script Or just change the lines php latestVersion scriptalert script try httpclient new Client response httpclientget Warn untrusted content is not validated but inserted into html EditAccountbladephpL latestVersion stringresponsegetBody catch Exception exception return false I only came across this issue when I got an error because I blocked outgoing connections The return value of the function that is getting the current version could return false While there is nothing wrong with that except that the functions calling it never check for this condition Alternatively the function could have default values set and always return a valid data structure DO NOT MERGE UNTIL IS MERGED Opening PR for prereview while dependency gets merged If you want to test you can use my fork of omnipaysquare PR adds support for Square gateway If it gets merged Id open a new PR to update the docs to point to this PR After the Payment Gateway refactory in the example on the docs doesnt make much sense anymore None Im not an expert on how bots scrape websites but I know theyre finding the contact form on our site and sending a bunch of spam I see that the Contact form is just a hidden div The Contact buttons click event looks like it just gets rid of the dipalynone on the contact form Im thinkin if the form wasnt in the DOM to begin with bots arent good at javascript and wouldnt be able to fill insubmit the form Should I rig up that contact button to generate the form HTML Im sure other folks have had the same issue Any creative solutions out there img width altimage src Allow Pay offline orders to be cancelled Fixed bug where if the order requires payment the offline payments option is shown if enabled Upgrade docker images to PHP Changed CancelRefund button to just cancel to remove ambiguity Its possible to show in a panel a number of users who checked in in real time Version
