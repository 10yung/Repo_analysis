To get the FRED dataset I used pip install pandasdatareader which has a bug This thread recommended using the dev version It worked well for me but is this the best solution Im wondering if the scaling factor in equation in the Numerical integration lab the section on Simpsons rule is incorrect I think equation should be multiplied by ba N rather than ba N Has anyone run into the following error by any chance Thanks File OSMexamplepy line in module grid TasmanianSGTasmanianSparseGrid File homejfan DesktopOSM day SparseGridSparseGridCodeanalyticalexamplesTASMANIANPythonTasmanianSGpy line in init selfpLibTSG cdllLoadLibraryTasmanianSparseGridslibtasmaniansparsegridso File softwarepython q el x libpython ctypesinitpy line in LoadLibrary return selfdlltypename File softwarepython q el x libpython ctypesinitpy line in init selfhandle dlopenselfname mode OSError lib libmso version GLIBC not found required by TasmanianSparseGridslibtasmaniansparsegridso Exception AttributeError TasmanianSparseGrid instance has no attribute pLibTSG in bound method TasmanianSparseGriddel of TasmanianSGTasmanianSparseGrid instance at x f ac cc ignored I get the following error when running pytest in the anaconda prompt using windows machine Its telling me I have access denied to this specific folder but I have admin privileges turned on Does anyone have any ideas about how to fix this Im unable to do any of the unit testing homework with this error pytesterror quainialberto asked the following with regard to Problem in the Object Oriented Programming lab I am approaching Problem of OOP and we are required to test our object Since we leant how to do unit testing can we create a unit test to test our object or we need to write the test like in the example given inside the problem formulation Thanks Albi You should do the testing as is stated in Problem of the OOP lab The testing requested and shown in Problem of OOP is called validation testing and is different from unit testing Both are important For anyone that wants to use Atom and python scripts there is a really handy package in Atom called hydrogen that lets you run code inline like a notebook However as far as I can tell there isnt a way to incorporate markdownlatex like in a traditional jupyter notebook
