odd usecase where I dont know the total at the beginning so I update it as it grows This works really well for the calculation but the bar itself is confined to the number of iterations initially set in total from tqdm import tqdmnotebook as tqdm progtqdmtotal dynamicncolsTrue progtotal progupdate shows a full progress bar incorrect metric correct In case Im just missing a method I posted a more complete example on SO source website known issues issue tracker StackOverflowtqdm adds contribwraps x tenumerate x tzip zip x tmap map x threadmap concurrentfuturesThreadPoolExecutormap x processmap concurrentfuturesProcessPoolExecutormap move threadprocess to contribconcurrent subpackage remove wraps just use contrib when wrapping builtins which dont require importing batteries included philosophy x test document add answer to potentially add potentially add itertools I thoroughly enjoy using tqdm for lots of notebook oriented projects However the leave keyword always requires me to look up the documentation having got the behaviour wrong the first time It seems to have a double meaning when leaveTrue either leave the progress bar on screen eg stays displayed or The progress bar should leave the screen eg gets removed from display Alternatively stayTrue would be unambiguous I realise that changing the kwarg behaviour might be undesired and I should just remember which way around is appropriate Just wondered whether clarifying the keyword in the API could be considered at some point in the future I have marked all applicable categories exceptionraising bug visual output

width altScreen Shot at AM src This bug is especially weird since it tends to occur only when I rerun a given cell ie the progress bar behaves as expected when running a cell with progressapply the first time but if you run the cell again without making any changes then it creates a new line for every update in the progress bar Also note that this behavior is unique to tqdmpandas and I have not
