I want to know all the X Y values of the edge for one object to estimate its size Any solution Thanks s xie Python Working on a video fileStream This model is eating ram for a large video mins by the time I reach the EOV it has already used GB ram and dows not release even after releasing the file Even tried it on the tutorial by pyImageSearch and on a live youtube stream Any help is appreciated Thanks Hi is there any code for testing RGBD data For example the NYUD dataset as written in the paper Thank you Tried to compile it on Mojave I have installed HDF from Homebrew and source Both produced the same following error message Linking CXX shared library liblibcaffedylib Undefined symbols for architecture x H LTfinddataset referenced from caffeSGDSolverfloatRestoreSolverStateFromHDF std basicstringchar std chartraitschar std allocatorchar const in solvercppo caffeSGDSolverdoubleRestoreSolverStateFromHDF std basicstringchar std chartraitschar std allocatorchar const in solvercppo void caffehdf loadnddatasethelperfloatlong long char const int int caffeBlobfloat in hdf cppo void caffehdf loadnddatasethelperdoublelong long char const int int caffeBlobdouble in hdf cppo H LTgetdatasetinfo referenced from void caffehdf loadnddatasethelperfloatlong long char const int int caffeBlobfloat in hdf cppo void caffehdf loadnddatasethelperdoublelong long char const int int caffeBlobdouble in hdf cppo caffehdf loadstringlong long std basicstringchar std chartraitschar std allocatorchar const in hdf cppo H LTgetdatasetndims referenced from void caffehdf loadnddatasethelperfloatlong long char const int int caffeBlobfloat in hdf cppo void caffehdf loadnddatasethelperdoublelong long char const int int caffeBlobdouble in hdf cppo H LTmakedatasetdouble referenced from void caffehdf savenddatasetdoublelong long std basicstringchar std chartraitschar std allocatorchar const caffeBlobdouble const bool in hdf cppo H LTmakedatasetfloat referenced from void caffehdf savenddatasetfloatlong long std basicstringchar std chartraitschar std allocatorchar const caffeBlobfloat const bool in hdf cppo H LTmakedatasetint referenced from caffehdf saveintlong long std basicstringchar std chartraitschar std allocatorchar const int in hdf cppo H LTmakedatasetstring referenced from caffehdf savestringlong long std basicstringchar std chartraitschar std allocatorchar const std basicstringchar std chartraitschar std allocatorchar const in hdf cppo H LTreaddatasetdouble referenced from void caffehdf loadnddatasetdoublelong long char const int int caffeBlobdouble in hdf cppo H LTreaddatasetfloat referenced from void caffehdf loadnddatasetfloatlong long char const int int caffeBlobfloat in hdf cppo H LTreaddatasetint referenced from caffehdf loadintlong long std basicstringchar std chartraitschar std allocatorchar const in hdf cppo H LTreaddatasetstring referenced from caffehdf loadstringlong long std basicstringchar std chartraitschar std allocatorchar const in hdf cppo ld symbols not found for architecture x clang error linker command failed with exit code use v to see invocation make liblibcaffedylib Error make srccaffeCMakeFilescaffedirall Error make all Error Do you have a version of tenosrflow Fix rendered markdown lists and add new lines for markdown conformity If I run PostprocessHEDm in MATLAB I get an error because I need to define these parameters parameters hedmatdir the hed mat file directory the output of batchhedpy edgedir the output HED edges directory imagewidth resize the edge map to imagewidth imagewidth threshold threshold for image binarization default smalledge remove small edges default Usually in python I would do something like this python scriptpy hedmatdir C folder hed edgedir C folder edge imagewidth threeshold smalledge But I have no idea how to do the same with MATLAB can you show me an example please Sorry for the noobish question Im following the Batch Processing procedure here and got to the point where I run batchhedpy and all my pictures are converted into MAT files MATLAB files the final step requires to run PostprocessHEDm to convert them into normal pictures but instructions says that I need MATLAB to do it get the cpp file edgesNmsMexcpp from and compile it in Matlab mex edgesNmsMexcpp You also need to download and install Piotrs Computer Vision Matlab Toolbox Is there any method to do it for free without MATLAB Thats a proprietary paid software I noticed that the author of this Google Coolaboratory is using Octave as a free alternative to MATLAB so I guess a free approach is definitely possible however that Coolaboratory works only online Id like a localoffline solution for Windows like Im doing now if possible Any help is much appreciated thank you very much for your kind attention The pretrained model link is ing Additionally the directory listing of appears to be empty Can the repo owners update the links Or can anyone watching this repo provide me with the pretrained model and prototxt files Thank you
