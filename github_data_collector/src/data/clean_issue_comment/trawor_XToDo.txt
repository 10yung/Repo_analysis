Hello shortcut keys cmdshiftt conflict how to replace shortcut keys Xcode support Source Editor Extension Tools We hope XToDo can be used in Xcode Its very useful for us Thanks When I pressed the shortcut to type TODO I want to add extra information like author after TODO because it easy to locate my personal code blocks THX Right now it is sitting in my Documents and I wish to move it somewhere else How can I do it This is the folder I am talking about at It would be great if the list of TODOs included subgroups based around filenames Example TODO File cpp TODO Fix this thing here TODO Fix this other thing here that needs fixing File cpp TODO This also needs fixing TODO we should probably fix this but maybe after the initial release instead of just a massive list that doesnt sort them by filename Downloaded the source code on both my imac running OS X and my macbook pro running OS X I compiled the project for both systems and restarted XCode and loaded up a project with some TODO comments in it The plugin appears in the menus and everything seems to work ok yet no actual listing of TODO points occurs in plugin window However if I run the standalone app set the source directory to that same project and add the TODO keywords the App window lists the TODOs for the source directory correctly Im not even sure where to begin finding out why this is happening Id love to be able to search for things of the format so I can easily find things Ive linked with my bug tracker However I tried adding as my prefix and it doesnt work unless I get all the way down to https which also gets a bunch of other URLs I have in the code Im guessing its probably an issue with how the characters are separated but I havent had time to dive into the code Any chance you might be able to add this How to make the to do list order by time or name First congrats your plugin is a TO HAVE plugin Definitely Please consider that TODO adjust margins and TODO adjust margins Will be displayed in this way adjust margins and adjust margins You have to truncate todo description if ends with
