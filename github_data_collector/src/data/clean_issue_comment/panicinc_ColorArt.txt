findEdgeColorimageColors relies on the image having a minimum size in order to work effectively If the image is too small there arent enough repeated edge colors to get past randomColorsThreshold Furthermore it might be a good idea to accumulate colors from the other edges as well as to give the edge a certain pixel width Finally its important for this method to return some color after all what does it mean for an image to have no background color Does anyone know the purpose of the squaring step in scaleImagesize Specifically Why does only a partial square portion of the image get used for the analysis instead of the whole image This is a huge problem for thin and long images It seems that the algorithm youre using has a tough time picking out reds Im using your library to pick out colors for albums and here is the first example of something going not as expected A Star Is Born The background color is pretty good It could be a little darker to reflect that the album background isnt pure white My main issue is with the primary color here There are pretty much only two colors on the album white and red The red doesnt show up in any of the colors be it primary secondary or detail color In all of these examples the colors are as follows Background color is from ColorArtgetBackgroundColor Song title is ColorArtgetPrimaryColor Artist is ColorArtgetSecondaryColor The time played and time left textviews are ColorArtgetPrimaryColor The progress bar on the seekbar is ColorArtgetSecondaryColor The draggable thumb on the seekbar is ColorArtgetPrimaryColor Heres another example pm The background color is a dark browngreen Ideally it would be a red or a white as those are the two most dominant colors in the image and they also touch the borders Yet another example MM For this album cover the background color is good Whats weird is that the primary color is pink There isnt really pink on the album cover though there is a bit of red in the reflection of the sunglasses It would make more sense for the primary color to be a black white or brown Moar example Say Something There should be redmagenta as the primary color Last example Witness Nix the purplelilac Use the redsorangeslight bluesblacks or whites The background color should definitely be white here as that is also the background color of the album Red or orange would work as well EDIT I found some more weird occurrences In the following image there shouldnt be any light blue More to Life In the following image there should not be pink Yiruma In the future similar to Chris Baness ColorFinder it would be nice to have a secondary text color which is either black or white depending on the brightness of the background color to ensure high visibilityreadability Is it possible to make an iOS port of this component Itd be nice to have a standard set of images to test to make sure that the output looks the same after making changes to the program The images from the blog post would be good ones to start with
