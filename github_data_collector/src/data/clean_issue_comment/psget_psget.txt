Dont know if anyone is still reading this Attached file is just slightly changed to remember and show the exception not just status code LastException Exception throw Could not retrieve modules

NetServicePointManager SecurityProtocol SystemNetSecurityProtocolType Tls or softer add Tls to the list which has ssl and tls by default No need to restart shell or ISE any more I just ran them in the same session and installmodule started fetching immediately PowerShell Core is nominally the same as PowerShell but uses a different root name for its moduleprofileprogram files directories This PR checks the PSVersionTable for the PSEdition property I checked on posh and the null key behaved as expected meanwhile PowerShell Core correctly identified as was then able to install modules Exception

Users benmi OneDrive This is a new Windows Pro Install Im trying to install the latest AzureRM Powershell bits Im not sure if this is the right place to post this but it seems that there is an issue with your hosting server whenever I try to download file Your server tries to switch to https but it cannot make it This is not blocking as we can still use or the alternative setup procedure but it would be nicer to fix the setup procedure to use github GetPsGetps script or fix the https issue on the host server I was looking at this and wanted to recommend a more updated cmdlet InvokeWebRequest

appveyl Modules PsGetString ImportModule FileNotFoundException FullyQualifiedErrorId ModulesModuleNotFoundMicrosoftPowerShellCommandsImportModuleCommand While it has a similar name I dont consider this a dupe of because the setup and issues are a bit different I have a r instance that Im trying to install Pester on via Chef but the install fails when it comes time to install Pester However I tried swapping out installmodule pester for GetPsGetModuleInfo Pester to see if its PsGet or Pester thats the issue and it looks like its PsGet given that I cant even query for package info Ive also tried installmodule psurl and got the exact same error see subject line I would like to note however that these commands work fine on the same instance when run via a local PS session but Im bound by what Im able to make use of via Chef the powershellscript resource in this case I should also note that Chef is going through SSHCygwin to run the powershellscript block I also tried installing pester via the local shell and then running the automation again That time I didnt encounter the error but Im assuming its because of a different codepath taken in PsGet if a package is already installed Is this user error or is the code making an assumption that it possibly shouldnt be My background is almost exclusively Linux so please forgive my lack of familiarity with the particulars of PS EDIT Figured it out is the culprit While its probably safe to assume that EnvAPPDATA is set on a Windows box I guess the same doesnt necessarily apply when that box is being accessed through ChefSSHCygwin the sessions may end up having mismatched sets of environment variables I just updated my PS script to explicitly set APPDATA to the value I pulled from the local PS session and it worked fine
