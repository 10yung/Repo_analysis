Fixes a number of bugs from Check whether the specified folder exists and that it has sufficient permissions Output a message specific to each of the errors above Existing folders and files do not cause a warning Existing files do not get overridden Add tests to prove the bugs in Added a few examples since people will keep asking We still have This publication does not otherwise define the structure and contents of the directory so the spec remains reasonably neutral in that regard Fixes First of I want to say thanks for this work Im still relatively a beginner developer From reading this standard it appears to me that a resources directory is analogous to a vendor directory in a composer project I could be completely wrong Considering the relative popularity of composer in PHP projects how does this standard reconcile the two Should the vendor directory substitute the resources directory in a composer project Can the two folders be seen as conceptually being the same I come up with a question to you Maybe you have some tips or recommendations I was starting a package with a concrete PHP package skeleton based on your PDS Skeleton The idea is to have some kind of a boilerplate that enables you to quickly start a new project In contrast to PDS it contains concrete implementations What do you think about this When trying to generate the structure for a new project I get a bunch of error messages php vendorbinpdsskeleton generate xxx PHP Warning mkdir File exists in tmptestvendorpdsskeletonsrcPackageGeneratorphp on line Warning mkdir File exists in

Created LICENSEmd Created READMEmd It looks like a permission problem But it seems that the generator expects that the folder xxx already exists The following works mkdir yyy php vendorbinpdsskeleton generate yyy I put all my autoloaded classes into src But where do I put the source for my main for a commandline executable Does that go in src Someplace else main like int main in CC the nonclass entry point for the program which typically receives the command line parameters via argv Are the commandline executables which belong in bin those which are delivered as part of the package Or are they executables which are generated by the package after delivery and installation via some userinvoked means Or both Please clarify the difference between public and src A common setup is to use one indexphp file to route requests to other parts of the project Please address this setup specifically in the documentation
