I am just beginner so i couldnt figure out how to implement to my project Anyone know how to keep the number not shaking when it in counting Thanks leadsCountingLabelmethod UILabelCountingMethodEaseIn Error Use of unresolved identifier UILabelCountingMethodEaseIn did you mean UILabelCountingMethod If its a number over it would be nice to add a thousands separator based on locale Not a must have but just noticed it Great Library BTW Thanks for the hard work I run pod update UICountingLabel and it does not update the pod to version Added a property to support Localizaed strings Thanks for your work Thanks for your nice OSS The default easing rate was too strong for my project so I changed this modification It would be more useful Also fixed small issue in regex pattern you have been missing NSRegularExpressionSearch at second search Instead of having a separate NSString format only expose the formatBlock property and make a setFormat method that sets up the right format block only at set time instead of on every iteration This will ultimately improve performance as a single block call each time is much faster than regular expression searches every frame So it would look something like voidsetFormatNSStringformat selfformatBlock NSString float val return NSString stringWithFormatformatval Note something will have to deal with formats that pass in d or i as the current regex does perhaps find these and then cast to int if it has those maybe two different blocks just ideas
