Currently only the body of issues and pull requests is shown For issues both the title and the body is shown For simple PRs where the information is contained in the title and in general for proper context and for consistency it would be helpful to also display the title While were at it perhaps the titles should be formatted differently from the body say as bold or something similar This is related to Would it be possible to have separate controls to showhide issues vs pull requests Letting the user to set a GitHub token will allow them the use the tool more frequently and it can do more expensive analysis See and for two tools which allow user to set GitHub token It would be nice to include the time as well as the date in the cards I tried looking in sitecoffee but couldnt figure out how to change it If you gave me some pointers Id gladly submit a PR Right now only repo watching events are included It would be nice to have the starring events as well I really like the timeline design but I think a project level showcase of multiple people would be nice to have in the future I know IE is such a petty nuisance but just to report an issue that it will alert Username is required on IE I dont know what may have caused it since it doesnt seem like there should be an IE bug on getting input out of textfield with the libraries you are using All the comments and issue text and probably others look ugly because theyre not being formatted the way they were intended
