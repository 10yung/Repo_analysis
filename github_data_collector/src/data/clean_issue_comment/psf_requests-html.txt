Hi I am trying to use requestshtml lib for my codebut I am getting following ERROR from requestshtml import HTML File usrlibpython sitepackagesrequestshtmlpy line def initself element htmlNone url I am using Python version Can someone look into this issue and let me know what is wrong Hi Im learning about web scrapping stuffs and Ive started to experiment with the Async class from this library until Ive stumbled into the following problem This is my code which is a function that receives a set of rules to know what to do when the AsyncHTMLSession is open async def getinfoscrappdataid base cssselector loadingtime asession AsyncHTMLSession request await asessiongetfbasedataid rendering the JS on the page await requesthtmlarenderwaitloadingtime data await requestfindcssselector firstTrue

RuntimeWarning Enable tracemalloc to get the object allocation traceback Do you have any ideias of what I did wrong Thanks Hi all i am using this library to crawl angular website i need only html page response and i am not even rendering the page only request for html raw response but after some time running fine it throw error as below requestsexceptionsConnectionError HTTPSConnectionPoolhostwwwexamplecom port Max retries exceeded with url example Caused by NewConnectionErrorurllib connectionVerifiedHTTPSConnection object at x fb cc Failed to establish a new connection Errno Name or service not known Please help me Multi url call with asyncio makes things complicated in our mediumsize project How can we bypass it Is there any way to use requestshtml within threads or maybe in in greenlets to make things simpler Note python async def getreddit r await asessionget return r example is not a good idea in thousands of urls Example li classpageNavpage a The response page received is stored locally in a file and does indeed contain the element but doing pagehtmlfindli classpageNavpage a yields an empty list whereas it should be returning a list with at least one element similar to Most competent web servers would shut down your little scraper very quickly hi i want to visit one website with ipproxy i wonder how i could use ipproxy in requestshtml

cannot import name Deque Hi All whats different between requests and requests html in python module Hi Im trying to render JavaScript from webpages but requestshtml fails every time to do it This is my code from requestshtml import HTMLSession s HTMLSession r sget rhtmlrender printrhtmlhtml Some important points to make Searching with CTRLF in the output for the right version thats displayed when rendering the JavaScript version is for nonjavascript while is for javascript it always shows Searching the keyword cookie it displays matches even when typing only cook doesnt show anything because that keyword is displayed when rendering the JavaScript It prints out the only HTML code before executing the JavaScript Ive tried to put a bigger timeout to render rhtmlrendertimeout But it still waits the default seconds When trying to put rhtmlrendersleep It waits for those seconds and then it doesnt do anything more than that it says that the connections been lost I thought that maybe it didnt render the JavaScript because it didnt have any type of headers so Ive added the Chromes ones Ive tried with useragent only then with all headers displayed in the network tab from Chrome when accessing httpbinorg but still with no success Ive tried to render the JavaScript with Pyppeteer which is included in the requestshtml library and it can render the JavaScript I dont understand why since its included in the requestshtml library the only downside of this is that Ive to scrape lots of links but I couldnt find a way to run multiple instances of Pyppeteer By the way Im using PyCharm on Windows with Python throws an error regarding a Deque thing that cant be imported maybe this info helps in solving the issue Ive tried to be as detailed as possible with the problems Im facing right now and I hope I can get the solutions Im looking for Thanks in advance PS Chromium is downloaded and it shows in task manager when running the render function same happens when running the Pyppeteer code
