Xcode yells at you when self isnt explicitly mentioned withing blocks This pull request makes Xcode calm down by adding self in the appropriate places within blocks I and others developers that I know always put this code manually would be amazing if you accept this pull request My application was rejected because Apple thought that I used private method setDefaultTimeoutInterval The only place with such method is the EGOCache After renaming defaultTimeoutInterval to defaultCacheTimeoutInterval my application was approved Hello I am wondering is there any way to find the path of a file using the key thanks in advance If we have many expired items it can be hard to remove them in main thread Moved it to background I read the source but it seems that theres no method or property for cache size In initWithCacheDirectory method of EGOCachem file the dispatchsettargetqueues usage is not correct objectivec instancetypeinitWithCacheDirectoryNSStringcacheDirectory ifself super init cacheInfoQueue dispatchqueuecreatecomenormegoegocacheinfo DISPATCHQUEUESERIAL dispatchqueuet priority dispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYHIGH dispatchsettargetqueuepriority cacheInfoQueue frozenCacheInfoQueue dispatchqueuecreatecomenormegoegocacheinfofrozen DISPATCHQUEUESERIAL priority dispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYHIGH dispatchsettargetqueuepriority frozenCacheInfoQueue diskQueue dispatchqueuecreatecomenormegoegocachedisk DISPATCHQUEUECONCURRENT priority dispatchgetglobalqueueDISPATCHQUEUEPRIORITYBACKGROUND dispatchsettargetqueuepriority diskQueue In man page of dispatchsettargetqueue it has below statements The result of passing the main queue or a global concurrent queue as the first argument of dispatchsettargetqueue is undefined So the usage of dispatchsettargetqueue is not correct the correct usage should be as below objectivec dispatchsettargetqueuecacheInfoQueue priority dispatchsettargetqueuefrozenCacheInfoQueue priority dispatchsettargetqueuediskQueue priority In initWithCacheDirectorycacheDirectory method use dispatchsettargetqueuepriority cacheInfoQueue code to set priority for cacheInfoQueue but according to Apple Developer this should be dispatchsettargetqueue cacheInfoQueue priority I think here have a mistake Hello In my project I add the block in UIImageimageForKeyNSStringkey if image pathImage try NSData data NSData dataWithContentsOfFilepathImage image UIImage imageWithDatadata catch NSException e if not success NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithFilepathImage then verify if can transform the data file in UIImage Its working very fine Can you add this in the project Because Im using cocoaPods in my project Thank you This Class is wonderful UIImageimageForKeyNSStringkey UIImage image nil NSString pathImage nil try pathImage cachePathForKeydirectory key image NSKeyedUnarchiver unarchiveObjectWithFilepathImage catch NSException e Surpress any unarchiving exceptions and continue with nil if image pathImage try NSData data NSData dataWithContentsOfFilepathImage image UIImage imageWithDatadata catch NSException e return image Removed dealloc it was an empty function Added test of key for plist in a function where it wasnt present Added possibility of get path to cached file Very useful por previewcontroller and some other classes which need an url and not an NSData
