In pools larger than a the internal and addresses which are valid are never allocated This means that the pools effectively decrease in size by addresses per contained within a subnet As far as I can tell this is caused by Following the curl examples on I expect the API to delete my asset with curl basic u blakeadminfirst d nuketrue X DELETE statuserrordatamessageReason must be specified Same counts for decommissioning curl basic u blakeadminfirst d statusDecommissioned X POST statuserrordatamessageNo reason for the status change was specified Adding d reasonfoobar makes the API call work for both actions curl basic u blakeadminfirst d statusDecommissioned d reasonfoobar X POST statussuccessokdataSUCCESStrue curl basic u blakeadminfirst d nuketrue d reasonfoobar X DELETE statussuccessokdataSUCCESStrue Please fix documentation Thanks in advance and best regards Hi there I am interested in looking at collins to help with our asset and configuration management requirements I was reading your quick start documentation and thought docker would be a simple route to getting going I ran the command as listed in your documentation only to be presented with the following error message docker run p tumblrcollins Unable to find image tumblrcollinslatest locally latest Pulling from tumblrcollins a d d f b Pull complete dbdc Pull complete f d d dd Pull complete

Cheers Chris Hey I have been messing around with a golang build for collins CLI for a bit now and have been using it for a while without any major issue outside of a few minor bug fixes Just thought I would add it here as well in case its useful for others Hi Are there any plans for to have new releases or is the project closing down Many thanks Tom OpenJDK Bit Server VM warning ignoring option

minimally different than the stock productionconf just changed the mysql details to point to our cluster instead of a local instance There are currently clients for Collins you have to roll your own even for Java If there was an OpenAPI document somewhere it could be used to generate clients in at least a dozen languages Swagger Codegen being the example that would be most obvious Ever found a bunch of machines that somehow got misconfigured and arent set to PXE boot but your IPMI access does appear to work Heres a gross hack Pipe the list of affected asset tags to this abomination while read tag do collins find c ipmi t tag done awk print sed s g awk print ipmitool I lanplus H P U root chassis bootdev pxe bash x Much better would be if collins or consolr could easily issue that IPMI chassis bootdev pxe command to them in a more standard way Should be very easy to add to consolr Having it go via the collins server would of course provide better logging I removed my version eye profile Version eye was used for monitoring dependencies I used it to make sure that dependencies were up to date when I used to actively work on collins its been over a year since I have It shows up on the README as a badge Previously had a number in place of unknown If interested someone should create a new version eye integration it is very straight forward Alternatively update the readme
