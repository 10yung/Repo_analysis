I have repo but its having the status okay but in my profile its showing only repo Even its processing everything The pie chart is an incredibly useful feature when it comes to visualising what languages I use the most It would be also useful for me to see what languages I have written the most as a commit to a repo for a certain language will count to that language when I have not developed my knowledge skills or used said language I would likely use this to provide focus as what sort of languages I wish to further my knowledge in Thanks Hi Top x programmers is supposed to be based on number of commits but I see this Is it a bug or how does it works really Thank you I would like to display on my online portfolio my Github commits per language for a given time frame and overall For example I could show three circular progress bars which show the percentage of code on my Github profile using data from Sourcerer Does Sourcerer expose an API which I could query to get statistics Additionally it would be nice if users can query for their contribution language distribution the past week and month like mentions This would be great building a snapshot of a users programming activity outside of the Sourcerer generated report If there is a tool I can use which can accomplish this please recommend it I really like Sourcerer but I dont know how to embed its insights into my portfolio website Id like to keep everything a single page and not have links going out So something like an embeddable widget would be nice like mentions Hi I have a huge local repo and it takes the sourcerer app about hours for hashing The problem is that after about minutes the status of the hashing process on the server is FAILED with reason Timeout reached The local app keeps on hashing for several hours but after finishing this step all I get is an error message saying that there was a error communicating with the server and the status on the website changes to FAILED with reason Processing error Wouldnt it be better to locally store the hashing results and upload them at the end instead of sending keepalives all the time I tried to Refresh Update Github repos I get this error in my console console baeee d a e bejs failed to refresh profile with gh data Error timeout of ms exceeded at texports e c e bcba ajs at XMLHttpRequestdontimeout e c e bcba ajs Thanks When I removed a directory from one of my repositories and committed the changes rather than reducing the LOC and commit count sourcerer doubled it Is it a problem with the app or something that I am doing wrong On some items like Javasript PHP jquery and async its giving me numbers way up there No way I have written that much giving me total lines of code in the k range I have definitely not written nearly quarter of that much Is this counting the total lines of the library used in a project as well andor forked repos sourcerer sourcerer Data in my profile is not correct since sourcer only fetch commits from master branch Processing error on a repo where there is a file in git history with char on it e Error while hashing Illegal char at index foldersubfolder T filenamets Its an old file where were already been renamed to remove the char but it obviously keeps on git history
