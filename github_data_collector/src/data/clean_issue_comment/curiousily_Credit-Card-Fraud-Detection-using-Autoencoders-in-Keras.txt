Hi I got your data now but i have a question could you please share the rawdata or show the way how you process the data Thank you very much Regards python inputlayer Inputshapeinputdim encoder Denseencodingdim activationtanh activityregularizerregularizersl e inputlayer encoder Denseintencodingdim activationreluencoder decoder Denseintencodingdim activationtanhencoder decoder Denseinputdim activationreludecoder autoencoder Modelinputsinputlayer outputsdecoder From the frauddetectionipynb theres model using relu as last layer However the csv file contains negative values which relu cannot represent I think the last layer of decoder should represent the input value Wouldnt it be an issue Thanks
