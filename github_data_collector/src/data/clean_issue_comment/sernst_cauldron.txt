Is it possible to have the ability to save CSVs using Pandas tocsv function added to Cauldron Or simply a download CSV or Google Sheets link right in the dataframe When something is writing a progress bar out to the terminal an error message comes up from cauldron cauldron SYNCED File chunk tmpcdremoteprojectp dqiznplanupdatefeatureS shappy cauldron cauldron RUNNING cauldron Traceback most recent call last cauldron File cauldronlocalcauldronclithreadspy line in runcommand cauldron selfkwargs cauldron File cauldronlocalcauldronclicommandsruninitpy line in execute cauldron skiplibraryreloadskiplibraryreload cauldron File cauldronlocalcauldronclicommandsruninitpy line in runlocal cauldron skipsstepsrun cauldron File cauldronlocalcauldronrunnerinitpy line in section cauldron if not sourcerunstepresponse project ps forceforce cauldron File cauldronlocalcauldronrunnersourcepy line in runstep cauldron consolerawresult message cauldron KeyError message sit This specific trace originated while getting shapvalues from the shap python library using a KernelExplainer A great feature would be the option to include own cssfiles to provide some custom styling Is that something thats on your roadmap Is it possible to save a notebook to an html file without including the code I can think of many cases where you want to show only the results but keep the way how they were obtained private Why do you recommend to use an instead of an for displaying latex equations In my opinion this reduces readabiliy if youre already used to latex and adds an extra step when copy pasting equations from another sourceequation generator What currently already works is using a raw string At least I suggest to add this information to the documentation cddisplaylatexr alpha delta btw Im running Windows and Python I know of some issues between Linux and Windows when it comes to backslashes but I guess this only true for everything touching the filesystem If you make a bokeh plot it will not show the bottom portion or the xaxis unless you put the window in fullscreen mode Width is okay It would be great especially during early development to have a button on the UI that collects relevant version information in one place that can be copypasted into a bug report The button would present a popup with copyable text with version or settings you feel most important to include in issues You could even could prepopulate the github issue form with a request to include that config info along with instructions for how to retrieve it Also could we get a version number include in cauldronnotebook cauldronversion isnt defined and there doesnt seem to be any other internal storage of version info jinja has version info python c import jinja printjinja version cauldron does not python c import cauldron printcauldronversion Traceback most recent call last File string line in module AttributeError module cauldron has no attribute version The config info available from the UI might include ProductName Mac OS X ProductVersion BuildVersion G Versions python Python cauldron UI beautifulsoup cauldronnotebook certifi click Flask itsdangerous Jinja Markdown MarkupSafe numpy pandas pip Pygments pythondateutil pytz setuptools post six Werkzeug wheel
