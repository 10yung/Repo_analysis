Dear We want to know about limitations of Multi DIC on speckle patterns Is it necessary to create very organised speckle pattern columns and rows xyz to use Multi DIC can we use Multi DIC with sprayed speckle patterns We are working with scapholunate ligament wrist with size of mm length x mm width and mm height Regards Nataliya Hi Dana The toolbox you designed is very useful but I have some questions to ask you How to modify step after the stereo calibration object is changed to the checkerboard Whether the speckle map can be manually used such as drawing black spots randomly on the white paper with a black pen and sticking them on the measured object Do I have to use speckle Is there an alternative Why does the displacement formed in step have no practical significance What is the specific result of step Where to find the result file and what it means From ddic to ddic is the triangulation principle applied Is it possible to measure one more displacement in the z direction Is it possible to get the coordinates of the pixel in the threedimensional space and draw the motion track of the object in the threedimensional space coordinates thanks susan It said in the maual that if you choose to stitch you will be asked to select the indices of the surfaces you want to stitch together I am confused with the indices of the surfaces I want to know what is the indices of the surfaces and what should I type in Set the sample as an example should I type in or just the number of the surfaces Hi Dana I have been facing issues for the last few weeks as I am not able to get the correct displacement as I should get I am getting the right result with step ie I have given D displacement to my object and step is working fine but after D reconstruction displacement values that I am getting is not correct Can you please suggest what could be possible reasons for it Thank You Kartika Hello Dana Ive been having some troubles understanding how the principal stretch are plotted and how those relate to the principal strains Below is a picture of a specimen shown on the tension side being curved How are the stretch lines plotted I thought it might be from the UVW vector but that doesnt make sense for the nd Principal Stretch image Also the strains that I get from the st principal stretch is negative Unless your sign convention is positive equals compression I dont understand why the results show negative strains when the specimen is stretched horizontally from the curvature Please do advice Thank you in advance Best Vivian Capture HiI hava already used other calibrate method to get the DLT parametersfxfyfscxcy how can I use theses parameters to compute the Dstrain of the pictures I seem to have an issue with step I can load in the images but dont seems to be able to get further when it asks me to press enter on the image It just seems to do nothing Hi Dana First of all I am very grateful for the toolbox you provided It seems very attractiveBut when I try to run the toolbox using the provided sampledata I have a few doubtscould you do me a favor and answer my doubts where is the exact position and orientation of the world coordinate system of step results is the Cylinder bottom the XY plane then where is the X axis If step is skipped can step determine both internal parametersfocal length etcexternal parameters When I look the step results I found that the number of points D is and the faces is I dont understand how this is going on Do the points D mean the center of the subset what about the faces results I will look forward to your replythanks you in advance Yours jack Hi Dana How can i write a calibrationObjectCoordinatesmat file with the true D world coordinates of the calibration object I dont understand what information should i write in Can you give me an example Thank you in advance Marco Hi Dana Whats the format of displacements data generated in step I want to draw a vector diagram using displacements generated in Ncorr because it has only u and v displacement but cant understand how do data saved in the file Yours Joe
