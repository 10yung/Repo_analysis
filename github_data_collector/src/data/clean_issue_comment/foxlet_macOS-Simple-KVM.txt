After configuring the PCIe Passthrough I went ahead and ran the basic script however QEMU begins in a paused state how do I get it to run If I try to install macOS in a VM it takes absolutely forever but it manages to complete the first installation step and then reboots On rebooting it then boots from the virtual disk it installed to After a bunch of terminal text scrolls by I get another loading bar which then proceeds to get stuck several hours later The first time to got stuck at rds when I forcerebooted it it got stuck at with minutes remaining No keyboard or mouse Just a stuck progress bar and a VM that doesnt appear to be using my hosts resources at all though the fan on said laptop does spin up when the macOS VM is booted Does anyone have any suggestions for diagnosing the issue Without any logs its extremely challenging to know whats gone wrong when I run sudo basicsh to open QEMU it will show the warning Press ESC in Seconds to skip startupnshany other key to continue see below image Press ESC in Seconds to skip startupnshany other key to continue If I press continue the CLOVER GUI will be showed and then I press enter to install macOS the problem reoccurs again and again if I press continue see below images the CLOVER GUI But I press ESC the SHELL will be showed SHELL My environment dual system win and ubuntu PC dell precision Thanks qemusystemx warning host

doesnt support requested feature CPUID DHEAXxgetbv bit Im wondering this script does transparently download macOS and launch QEMU but the ESPqcow cant be generated by the user AFAIK But this is my first try with Hackintosh How did you created it foxlet Hi Hope you are well Thank you for your MacOS Ive been using it for the past few weeks I have a problem now I can not download the new checkra n app it says my storage is full Is there anyway of making the storage bigger I do not have anything else on the macOS Thank You Having support for Gnome Boxes would be nice especially for Fedora users as it comes preinstalled Anyone has added it If so can you paste your gnomeboxes config file Thanks
