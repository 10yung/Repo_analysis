 Rswift a plist xxx xpng mailtoxxx xpng xxx xxx xpng mailtoxxx xpng My app has the night mode it will automatically find the image name with the suffix night when the user opens night mode So how to ignore these images night night Would it be possible to have an option to ignore letter case lowercase uppercase etc Any ideas on how this could be automated Doing checks like this on every build in Xcode with warning messages etc might be overkill and a performance hog but maybe if this were a command line tool or would be usable as an action in Fastlane The action could have settings to allow builds to fail or just generate warnings about unused assets bundle for NSString path in resPaths NSString name path lastPathComponent if namelength continue NSString keyName StringUtils stringByRemoveResourceSuffixname if tempResNameInfoDict keyName BOOL isDir NO ResourceFileInfo info ResourceFileInfo new infoname name infopath path infofileSize FileUtils fileSizeAtPathpath isDir isDir infoisDir isDir tempResNameInfoDict keyName info path path lastPathComponent I have false positives because of realm files and because I have in my project a complex concatenating algorithm titlesubtitlecategory But I guess for that no tool could do a great job Thank you
