 fix in ios with and height exchange error There were a ton of issues on iOS and most were fixed by this fork I did find an issue though In portrait mode if you had the master view open in the popover and rotated the device in my case an iPad running iOS the master view would be created and then immediately go blank What I found was that the popover was not getting dismissed first To fix this I needed to go into the MGSplitViewControllerm and move the lines if hiddenPopoverController hiddenPopoverControllerpopoverVisible hiddenPopoverController dismissPopoverAnimatedNO from voidwillAnimateRotationToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation durationNSTimeIntervalduration to the end of voidwillRotateToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation durationNSTimeIntervalduration So my solution looked like this voidwillRotateToInterfaceOrientationUIInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation durationNSTimeIntervalduration selfmasterViewController willRotateToInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation durationduration selfdetailViewController willRotateToInterfaceOrientationtoInterfaceOrientation durationduration This fixes the iOS rotation bug when the popover is present if hiddenPopoverController hiddenPopoverControllerpopoverVisible hiddenPopoverController dismissPopoverAnimatedNO I was going to post this in the issue board for aspregas fork but I could not find it So hopefully this will help someone save a couple minutes of searching Orientation Issues PopOver screen not looking proper Black screen occuring Please update the MGSplitviewController as per the iOS support I want to have a Popover with a MGSplitViewController inside and the Orientation Landscape But when i do that it does hide the MasterView and shows only the DetailView I need to have both display Master Detail I tried some settings and found that when i set showsMasterInPortrait YES it shows Master Detail together but the MGSplitViewController width is but the Popover has a width of px How can i fix that Issue I wrote the Post already here with some detailed Informations Pics etc Thanks I think you should add another value to the enum MGSplitViewDividerStyleNone so programmers dont have to have a split between their master and detail controller if they dont want too I am using status bar in my app and wanted to maintain the compatibility between ios and ios I wanted status bar to behave same as ios I dont want status bar to overlap view controllers while using MGSplitViewController Can any one please let me know how can i prevent MG SplitView to overlap status bar on view controllers By using the bestimmaa solution i was able to fix the view height issues but still struggling to get status bar working Thanks Found an iOS only bug status bar is not hidden in iOS its hidden uncorrected UI for navigation bar item See attached screenshot The static analyzer was complaining about some uninitialized values and whatnot So I cleaned them up with some default values Shouldnt change the behavior at all If you create another window which has top priority rotate device and hide this window then UI will be squeezed Maybe try to use UIApplicationDidChangeStatusBarOrientationNotification to handle that bug and layout UI properly
