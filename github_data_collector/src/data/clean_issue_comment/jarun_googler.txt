With the latest version from master I run googler N debug test and get this output DEBUG googler version DEBUG Python version DEBUG Connecting to new host wwwgooglecom DEBUG Fetching URL searchieUTF oeUTF qtest seimBoWDMPEeqiEqy Ms rdw tbmnws DEBUG Cookie PJAR DEBUG Response body written to varfolders hgy v pb jzxrdwpmwh zrbcTgooglerresponse p szdlhtml No results If you believe this is a bug please review before submitting a bug report The debug output is in this gist OS is MacOS Darwin Python version is as shown above and locale i set as follows LANGenUSUTF LCCOLLATEenUSUTF LCCTYPEenUSUTF LCMESSAGESenUSUTF LCMONETARYenUSUTF LCNUMERICenUSUTF LCTIMEenUSUTF LCALLenUSUTF This is a somewhat frequent complaint and scattered on hijacked threads Theres a fairly obvious solution for this a goddamn pager For some reason I havent thought of this until now maybe because of the XY problem users were always suggesting a dynamic number of results which is both unnecessarily hard to implement and a poor fit for our paging model and I was caught up in why thats a bad idea instead of tackling the root cause More concretely we just need to pipe output into less EFX E QUITATEOF F quitifonescreen X noinit A tried and true paging technique There are two problems with less EFX that are worth mentioning If user quits early the rest of the output is lost We can of course implement a repeat command r is conveniently still available to repeat the current pages results which largely mitigates the problem This does mean we cant make paging the default though It has to be behind an option P pager should be good enough and discoverability would suffer Discoverability is a really hairy problem for a program that pledges to leave no trace on users disk I guess we could suggest the option once in each interactive session where the output is longer way longer than a screenful That shouldnt be too annoying for people who dont want it right less is universal enough with one catch BusyBoxs less doesnt have F or X Im not even sure if it supports ANSI escapes havent tried A simple preflight with help should shake that out though Im not aware of any other less implementation except the most common one found in both Linux and BSD jarun Let me know your thoughts
