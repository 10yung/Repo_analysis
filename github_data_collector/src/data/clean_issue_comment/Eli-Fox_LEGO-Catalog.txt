Hi Is it possible to substitute livedata on room Dao to use flow and suspend fun If yes can you do it in a separate branch or update this example Thanks a lot and nice job with this pattern it is really easy to use but i have a problem to retry call API when got error because we already have livedata in repository and calling api in datasource how we can get retry request with this pattern Reproduce steps Open app and browse themes are loaded Data is loaded from network Press back button Open app again Actual Data is presented without loading it from network Expected Data should be loaded from network Please can you more sample Great project thanks for sharing I have some minor improve suggestion Result class is currently implemented in Java style and not getting benefits of the Kotlin compiler Having Result class implemented as sealed class Resultout T class loadingT ResultT data class errorTval message String ResultT data class successTval data T ResultT you can avoid excess nullability checks and possible exceptions in places like if responseStatusstatus SUCCESS saveCallResultresponseStatusdata else if responseStatusstatus ERROR emitResulterrorTresponseStatusmessage emitSourcesource and have it in more Kotlin way if responseStatus is Resultsuccess saveCallResultresponseStatusdata else if responseStatus is Resulterror emitResulterrorTresponseStatusmessage emitSourcesource Hope you find it useful
