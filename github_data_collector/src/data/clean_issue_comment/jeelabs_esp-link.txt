Hello community I got a new Problem but im not sure im right thinking about the reason of my fail message I got all worked Esp working fine Arduino working fine OTA works while testing with Blink Sketch without any problems in IDE Folder arduinobuild where the hex is into have MB with all Folder and Files and the uploaded hex is kb big AGrowBraininoeep AGrowBraininoelf AGrowBraininohex AGrowBraininowithbootloaderhex buildoptionsjson core includescache libraries preproc sketch Error IDE Arduino Windows Board Arduino Mega or Mega ATmega Mega Sketch uses bytes of program storage space Maximum is bytes Global variables use bytes of dynamic memory leaving bytes for local variables Maximum is bytes C Users Baervers AppData Local Arduino packages arduino tools arduinoOTA binarduinoOTA address port sketch C Users Baervers AppData Local Temp arduinobuild AGrowBraininohex upload pgmmegaupload sync pgmmegasync reset logreset syncexp SYNC Resetting the board Waiting for the upload to start SYNC at baud board e hardware v firmware Connecting to board done Uploading sketch done Flashing sketch Error flashing the sketch Flashing sketch Error flashing the sketch This report would have more information with Show verbose output during compilation option enabled in File Preferences Thank you for your help I am using ESP with Atmega to communicate with controller There are ESP ESP connected with Atmega is in AP mode and ESP connected with controller is in STA mode it is configured to connect to AP automatically on start up What i want is to be able to show the status of the connection between atmega and Controller led is green if its connected red if not Is this possible or do we have an option where any of the GPIO pin sets to HIGHLOW when a node is connected to ESP I recently flashed esplink to a D Mini clone and wired it into a consumer product that has an AllWinner R SoC and AXP PMIC Everything worked fine out of the box except I had to issue a uC reset to get the SoC to actually enter FEL mode after setting it up to do so I found that esplink driving the RESETPWROK line high was interfering with the SoCs watchdog reset I changed all instances where esplink drives the reset pin high to disabling output so it floats and now the SoC is entering FEL mode as expected My question is why has esplink been designed to drive reset high while idle If a uC requires a specific powerup sequence this would interfere with that If the uC doesnt require a powerup sequence the reset pin would have been pulled high on the board the uC is attached to anyway It would be nice if the webserver had an inbound interface to read and toggle GPIO pins arbitrarily Basically I would like to be able to do something of that ilk curl pin statuson curl pin statusoff I apologize if I have missed this someplace in the menus or notes and its already a feature I found a device that uses true RS signalling at TTL levels that I want to interface to ESPlink and to do that I need to invert the signaling back to TTL serial with an bidirectional inverter If the ESP UART hardware supports inverted signalling can that be a new feature to avoid a piece of hardware in between Hello I flashed esplink on an ESP device trying to communicate with an arduino board trough a ground station Mission Planner I can connect easily in TCP on port but would prefer to use UDP instead The android board is supposed to communicate over UDP on port Is it something possible with the esplink firmware Thanks for your help hi everybody after flash i cont find ssid nowhere what i did wrong i followed this under Mbit Mbyte module from console esplink v bcdc Flash config restore FAILED CONN led Wifi init modeAP Wifi uses DHCP hostnameesplink ip netmask gateway hostname null sleep enabletype Httpd init conn x fff a c Serbridge pins reset isp swap Reset cause external exccause epc x epc x epc x excvaddr x depc x Flash map MB manuf x chip x esplink v bcdc ready heap initializing user application Waiting for work to do mode softAPbeddc fc d add if dhcp server startip mask gw bcn but i tried many solution on windows too thanks for answers Please update SDK to v Hello Im excited about esplink but Im not sure if its what I need Looking for some help I have a projector which communicates via RS I have a level shifter in place attached to my ESP Ive loaded the esplink firmware onto the ESP and lo and behold from the console I can type a few commands to turn the projector on or off and to query status of the projector I want this to be automatic Ive been searching the documentation and other websites and it seems possible but I just cannot tell how Any help Many thanks Using master rev e I cant run make because Pyhton fails running genappbinpy File vartmpespiotsdkv toolsgenappbinpy line print filename cannot be none n When I force make to use Python instead it runs The above error is prevalent in that script missing brackets
