Replace offsetfrom with checkedsub in sgxurtsenvrsugetpwuidrocall Intel just released Linux SGX SDK The SDK changelog says Intel Software Guard Extensions SDK includes the following changes in version Supported open source version of Intel Integrated Performance Primitives Intel IPP cryptography library Support for the Intel Deep Neural Network Library DNNL library OpenMP library and POSIX Threads Pthread library Limited support only Refer to the Developer Reference for additional details Refactored the switchless library Developers have to optin ie import the sgxtswitchlessedl into their enclave EDL file and link with the trusted library sgxtswitchlessa and untrusted library sgxuswitchlessa in order to do enclave transitions using threads Removed sgxuaeplatformh sgxtaeserviceh sgxtaeserviceedl libsgxplatformso and libsgxplatformsimso Updated Local Attestation sample project to demonstrate key exchange flow between multiple processes Fixed bugs PSW changelog Intel Software Guard Extensions PSW includes the following changes in Added support for modularized installation Added support for running SGX applications inside Docker containers Fixed bugs Will move to But it

build target i linuxandroid release The same thing worked with v but it fails with v Also it works with other targets armv linuxandroideabi and aarch linuxandroid Im recently reading the source code of sgxtstdsgxtypessgxlibcand so on Its quite interesting and useful for users and developers to know about the design details of mesateesgx I would like to create a documents about architecture of source code but it may be weeks ago By the way Im not at english writing but Ill try my best to do it and the documents may need to be reviewed smile Hi all This project now belongs to apache and has a new repo path at Currently if one uses the forked crates heshe still needs to use the old repo URL as git rev v because all the forked crates are using the old repo URL Now mixed usage of this SDK like the following Cargotoml would trigger collision between two sgxtstd toml sgxtstd rev v git wasmi git Youll see error the globalallocator in sgxtstd conflicts with this global allocator in sgxtstd error duplicate lang item in crate sgxtstd f runtime note first defined in crate sgxtstd error duplicate lang item in crate sgxtstd f runtime note first defined in crate sgxtstd error duplicate lang item in crate sgxtstd panicimpl note first defined in crate sgxtstd error duplicate lang item in crate sgxtstd beginpanic note first defined in crate sgxtstd error duplicate lang item in crate sgxtstd oom note first defined in crate sgxtstd error aborting due to previous errors error Could not compile Helloworldsampleenclave So Im planning to have thorough update on all of the forked crates to use the new repo URL and it would affect all of the projects which are depending on the old URL Any ideas Best Yu The following rustlang PR should give us better debug info for duplicate lang itemissues Issue PR Can we get support for recent nightly including this PR Dear dingelish So far weve only done RA in debug mode which is pointless for a real application After talking to Intel weve learned that RA is possible in production mode without obtaining any special license with Intel The pointers they gave us were See the section titled Attestation Services Utilizing ECDSA Now the question for this rust SDK Do you already have some samplecode to perform RA in production mode with this new procedure Dears I saw asylo support grpc server running inside enclave Is there a similar demo in rustsgxsdk which can run a httprpc server inside enclave Ive tried to fix this but I realized I might be in the wrong place Would you mind forking wabt as well Or wabtcore like you did here
