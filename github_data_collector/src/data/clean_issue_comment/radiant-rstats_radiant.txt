A few months ago the top right corner of Radiant started saying Base dir Home regardless of what my working directory was set to At the same time I stopped being able to save into any of the folders I had been using before I was only able to select files in a folder called Home or in my OS C folder I worked around this nuisance until today Now I cant run any code even if its a brand new session with your sample code loaded I just get the following Error cannot change working directory Any idea what the issue is In my Rstudio when I copyandpaste the command below installpackagesradiant repos The consoles output is installpackagesradiant repos Warning in installpackages unable to access index for repository cannot open URL Warning in installpackages package radiant is not available for R version Warning in installpackages unable to access index for repository cannot open URL What I want to ask is Is it a problem with my RStudio s version How can I install it correctly Hi When I click the load button to load a csv from my computer I see someone elses computer not my own laptop Unsure of how to upload a csv file from my own computer This will be a big issue when we have students using radiant this fall semester Cheers Nate Hi Great app Incredibly useful I have one question I have a shiny app that I would like to use some of the Radiant functions in I have a dataset which is reactive already in the shiny app and I would like this to be loaded as the default instead of the diamonds dataset Is there a simple way to do this I guess I would have to do something like inputdatasetRVdata where RVdata is the default dataset I want But where would I put this code Thanks in advance Is there a way to create a shortcut that opens RStudio Radiant and a State File in one click This would prevent confusion and speed up analysis Hi This is an awesome app I am a novice R user and I just started learning shiny I was wondering if there is an easier to follow radiant app for starters for instance an app thats not packaged into a library and has the standard shiny framework ie uiR and serverR etc Thank you Margaret I tried parfamilySTFangsong befoe radiantradiant but does not work Hi just a quick question Im guessing you left out the alpha and shape elements out of visualize for simplicity and deal with the multiple x variables by faceting its pretty elegant all in all Its true that shape can be quickly abused I do think however the alpha is fairly bombproof and adds a lot of value for mediumlarge datasets in terms of allowing point clusters to be more easily visualized if alpha for example Are you interested in having a conversation about the inclusion of both of these Folks I have just created a table to make it easier to study which set of data best fits to variable s nature This like is a editable spreadsheet show and ideias feel free to change it and comment Greetings
