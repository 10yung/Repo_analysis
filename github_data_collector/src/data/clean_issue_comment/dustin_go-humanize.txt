This is a bit similar to but related to time I would love to print something like this Your premium subscription expires in weeks Trying this one go fmtPrintfYour premium subscription expires in v n username humanizeRelTimepremiumExpiration timeNow But that becomes Your premium subscription expires in weeks The reason seem to be the defaultMagnitudes which are go var defaultMagnitudes RelTimeMagnitude timeSecond now timeSecond Month d weeks s Week mathMaxInt a long while s Do you think it makes sense to change this so that when the blbl parameter is empty the space is automatically removed Fixes What When using the functions PluralPluralWord with a quantity of those functions return the plural word Why Plural function is based on PluralWord function This last one is strictly checking that the quantity is equal to in order to return the singular word However it should also return the singular word in case the value is Ex pending requests pending request pending request You already took the time to put English pluralization in its own folder it seems to make it more possible to internationalize So you should also move away from calling it commas for Thousands Separator because many countries use not comma Basically it is flipped You dont have to internationalize yet but it would be much more clear for an international audience if you used the term Thousands Separator over commas Hi I am using gohumanize for some backend code and BenjaminVanRyseghemnumbro for frontend code Unfortunately these libraries have slightly different semantics when humanizing numbers resulting in different reports depending on where data is processed For example gohumanize always omits subwhole digits when applying SIWithDigitsinput units while numbroinputformat a always keeps subhole digits I have asked numbro to make trailing optional in the output That would at least match how gohumanize behaves Meanwhile it would also be helpful for gohumanize to provide an option to keep subhole digits in SI text as another way to get these libraries working in sync Currently FormatFloat wont auto remove the trailing zeros at the decimal places Related PR Dont assign values we dont check I would like to see functionality for monetary abbreviation For example an application I wrote recently integrates with a game I play It displays in game currency with abbreviations becomes m becomes k etc I already have an implementation that I made so I was wondering if this functionality would be welcome in this project Hi Dustin I like your lib gohumanize And I want to suggest some improvements This changes will allow me to use this library to manage size disk correctly When we work with bytes to manage size disk we face to some problems with rounding values For example if you want to create a disk partition you have to see how much free space disk have So if we ask to create GB partition however we have MB we got an error For these cases I offer to add precision and different rounding functions These changes don t affect for main library functional and maintain compatibility with previous version your lib Please review this code With hope to your approvement Tony
