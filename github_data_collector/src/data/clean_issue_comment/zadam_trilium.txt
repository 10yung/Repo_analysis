It seems like Trilium messes up the order of the sub folders in the root after a large import I like to do manual ordering of my root folders based on my own priority however Trilium does not like that here and there and resets the order I cant thell if the rset is based on date or alphabetical because I have alot of folders with custom characters it would be nice if Trilium holds onto the custom order no matter what is going on thanks Hi It seems like when I look at the same file in the Win desktop and Firefoxvia login I see that the browser version has syntax hilight support for markdown like in Joplin but the desktop app does not have it The browser version is the one I compiled locally on Linux from the repo And the Browser is FF on Linux See the image for some sample code page comparison left is browser right is win desktop app triliumb qqTQmgQ Trilium Version It appears that after the th row of a table the background colour changes to a lighter colour identical to the base colour of the page I think you have an awesome software and I really love it I have a couple of suggestions to allow it to be used by more peopleless tech people Some of those people in the community could help build Information website can be static with links to the latest binaries but at least it gives some internet presence and better SEO Sponsor link in github or another way to make donations Signed builds on OSX it does cost money though but I am sure the community can find USD per year for that I think it is necessary to publish on brew Installers speaking for osx I didnt check other OS we usually expect a DMG Since this is usually an annoying job it could be automated with github actions or similar long term Provide hosted servers I am not sure if you want to keep it as a hobby but there is a market for that I myself looked at notion and decided against it because it doesnt have offline mode and its not open source but I would pay for an hosted solution with clientside encryption if possible Anyway those are just suggestions what is already there is really amazing I plan to write a blog once I get more familiar with the software and I think other people should too I know a while ago this was remove but I feel like a small link preview would be really a plus Maybe it could be a code integration I just started using your amazing app so I dont know yet Something like what mylinkpreview does img width altScreen Shot at PM src you have sort alphabetically can you add sort newestoldest Sometimes I want to have the most recent things in the list first other times the oldest Ive nearly anything I need in Trilium but Id like to know if its possible to implement notion like database Its based on a simple table but with lots of functionality behind the scene Every row is a block as everything is a block in notion that can have many attributes and could queried like a DB with different way of visualizing it How to you think its implementable With a note for every row I do not remember having this issue before Apperantly Firefox is using this port so not much I can do about this Any way to change this trilium Generated sourceIdgRy BDToB T Port is already in use I spend half of my time in trilium pasting URLs Therefore they are not converted to links automatically which is annoying So each time i paste a link i need to highlight the link press CtrlC press CtrlK press CtrlV Converting pasted links to weblinks automatically would be a great time saver Hope to integrate which provide diagrams very well then we can do more thing in trilium Thanks trilium is an amazing software
