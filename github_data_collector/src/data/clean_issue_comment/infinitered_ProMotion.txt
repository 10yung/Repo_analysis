 OVER years in the making So i ran into a crash when opening a modal screen that loads in a PMWebScreen If you close the modal before the content loads the app would crash So decided to look into if it was possible to get this old branch up and running and its working great for simple web page display in a screen Once i merged master into the wkwebview branch the changes are actually quite simple Ive tested this on ios and displaying a simple web page works great ruby class GoogleWebScreen PMWebScreen title Google def onload setnavbarbutton left title Close action close end def content NSURLURLWithString end end Closes I have a CollectionScreen that Im using to display dates If I change the dates on the collection and call reloaddata I get the following error NSInternalInconsistencyException reason UICollectionView received layout attributes for a cell with an index path that does not exist NSIndexPath xc e length path The web is full of reports like the following However calling thiscollectionViewLayoutinvalidateLayout or thiscollectionViewcollectionViewLayoutinvalidateLayout seems to have no effect The error is exactly the same no matter what data I update with even an empty array Ive been trying to resolve this for about hours with no progress so I wanted to check in to see if anyone here has thoughts on how to get data reloading properly Thanks Hi I would like to use more powerful Tab Bars by using a pod like RAMAnimatedTabBarController Their documentation indicates Set the class of the UITabBarController to RAMAnimatedTabBarController in your Storyboard or nib For each UITabBarItem set the class to RAMAnimatedTabBarItem How would I be able to specify a custom class when using opentabbar in PM Tap and longpress events on the tablerows are handled by ProMotion but only in the whitespace on the fringes of the tablerow Taps on the subviews of the custom TableViewCell arent captured by Promotions eventhandling To whom it may concern In the documentation the CollectionScreen should call the onload method once viewDidLoad gets called Via manual testing I found this doesnt happen I also believe I found the issue in the code The following method viewdidload calls onload and is common to all screens In ProMotionCollectionviewDidLoad which is an include of CollectionScreen youll notice that selfviewdidload is never called Whereas in ScreenModuleViewControllerviewDidLoad it is called as it should be Please fix Meanwhile I will override viewDidLoad in my subclass of PMCollectionScreen and place the following code there def viewDidLoad super selfviewdidload if selfrespondtoviewdidload end Best regards Sathya Sekaran I ran into an issue where when setting a titleview on a table section would actually set the RMQ stylesheet I had set on the screen to nil causing all sorts of problems for the cells underneath I fixed this in my project by doing this in tablerb ruby Section header view methods def tableView viewForHeaderInSection index section promotiontabledatasectionindex view section titleview view section titleview new if section titleview respondtonew Added the line below to fix the issue viewstylesheet selfstylesheet if selfstylesheet viewrespondtostylesheet viewonload if viewrespondtoonload viewtitle section title if viewrespondtotitle view end Not sure if we should add this to redpotion or what Is there a straightforward way to add sibling views to tableview in TableScreen and GroupedTableView Im looking specifically at use cases A when the tableview and a sibling view dont overlap say tableview at the top half of the screen and the sibling view at the bottom half B when the sibling view overlaysoverlaps the tableview I created a variation of the classes TableViewController TableScreen and GroupedTableScreen to inherit from a UIViewController and adding the tableview as a subview so sibling views can be added to the resulting TableScreen to work with use cases A and B It looks like this modification can be made directly to the original classes and still remain compatible If theres no way to do this currently with ProMotion and there isnt a fundamental issue with this I can create a PR for this I havent thought of specific ways to test this other than the existing spec If anyone has any idea feel free to pitch in On the simulator I cant test this but any of you know if the longpress action will interfere with Iphone s D touch or some like that the real question is the longpress action works fine on the iPhone s go here search for UILabel click on any of the resulting search results you will be taken to a Youve found something that doesnt exist page can someone point me to an example of putting several pieces of data on one table cell im trying to do something like this product product etc with one string left aligned one right aligned ignore dashes in center i have looked at lots of examples would appreciate the help
