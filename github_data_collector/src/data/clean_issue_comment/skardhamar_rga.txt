I have a script that runs automatically on a server every day Unfortunately any time that server gets rebooted the script crashes because theres no one there to paste in the authentication code Ive used other packages in the past that have some kind of oauthtokenrefresh function Any way to do that with this package I am trying to automate the date conversion of different columns in a table here is what my table looks like DAsset PAsset DAsset PAsset DAsset PAsset So i want to change date format for DAsset DAsset DAsset in the following way fori in n ifi Data i asDatepaste DataDAssetiorigin format Data i next But i am getting this error Error in asDatedefaultData f do not know how to convert Data f to class Date I am working on generating report with R Sweave When I try to fetch data from google reporting api rgaopeninstancega error occurs chunk object redirecturi not found I have been using rga under R and base RStudio environment with no problems Does anyone know how to solve this issue under R Sweave environment When I go to authorise the RGA package with my user credentials it pushes a pop up which once I click my account and details redirects back to local host and wont allow me to actually authorise the tool I believe this is because im running this tool on a server rather than local but previouslly it would give me a link to copy into the URL rather than the pop up which seemed to work as wouldnt redirect to local host then Any ideas on how I could push this behaviour instead Thanks There is already a package on CRAN called RGA Having one called rga is therefore unlikely to be accepted and even if it was it would be incredibly confusing In fact I think its already confusing since if you google rga package this one is listed first but this isnt the CRAN one getting this error when reuse the authentication token rgaopeninstance sa Browse URL Please enter code here authentication token sagetProfiles Error in if selftokenExpiresIn argument is of length zero Hi When trying to import the following data in R R returns a table with the Handle User column missing Sessionsbyuserbymonth gagetDataid batchTRUE metrics gaSessions dimensions gaHandle User gaDate Is RGA able to import dimensions whose titles contain an interval Customised dimensions names can be easily changed but I may encounter difficulties with the standard ones ie event label Thank you in advance Tsvetan I keep getting this error code installgithubrga skardhamar Error in curlcurlfetchdiskurl xpath handle handle Problem with the SSL CA cert path access rights In addition Warning message Username parameter is deprecated Please use skardhamarrga installgithubskardhamarrga Error in curlcurlfetchdiskurl xpath handle handle Problem with the SSL CA cert path access rights Hi I am trying to install your package however when I get to the part where I need to run the following lines installgithubrga skardhamar libraryrga I get this error Downloading GitHub repo skardhamarrgamaster from URL Installing rga Installing package RCurl Installing package into CUsersusernameDocumentsRwinlibrary as lib is unspecified trying URL Content type applicationzip length bytes MB downloaded MB package RCurl successfully unpacked and MD sums checked The downloaded binary packages are in C Users username AppData Local Temp RtmpCGvUTW downloadedpackages CPROGRA RR binx R nositefile noenviron nosave norestore quiet CMD INSTALL CUsersusernameAppDataLocalTempRtmpCGvUTWdevtoolsf fdc skardhamarrga acf libraryCUsersusernameDocumentsRwinlibrary installtests installing source package rga R preparing package for lazy loading Error package bitops required by RCurl could not be found ERROR lazy loading failed for package rga removing CUsersusernameDocumentsRwinlibrary rga Error Command failed Any ideas how I can fix this Thanks When walk TRUE and batch TRUE are both used and the daily results exceed rows the bulk operation incorrectly only retrieves the first rows This appears to have been reported in various forms in the past and I believe I have fixed this issue in this branch of my local fork Ive tested it on my end and it looks good But before I submit a PR Id appreciate some additional testing from those whove also encountered this issue In addition the batch fix that branch also contains Default to HIGHERPRECISION data sampling making results deterministic the DEFAULT setting is not Update link to API v docs for max results size correct syntax of error message Modify logic to to allow max to be adjusted when batch is specified fixes issue of batch option not working correctly with walk option Add walk and batch context to status messages Sync with mcfR with coreR where applicable Misc bug fixes cc joaolcorreia AlunHewinson kingo lunametrics MarkEdmondson Kusara skardhamar
