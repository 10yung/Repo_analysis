 Question Is it possible to retrieve scan response data with this library My device sends an extra scan response packet with some data that I would like to read while scanning Im not sure that is a bug in this library but I would like to find any information or opinion that can help Prerequisites I connect a peripheral device to a phone iosandroid and then get a large amount of data from the device using notifications Stream this data by subscribing on one of the characteristics devicemonitorCharacteristicForService As the device I use an emulator on bleno library I am running the latest version I checked the documentation and found no answer I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed Expected Behavior I need no automatic and unexpected disconnects on IOS if the connection is good signal and so on As currently in android everything is fine Current Behavior Stably disconnections on IOS in minutes after connection Connection time until disconnect is random but as rule max is minutes On android everything is okay and the connection is not interrupted and there are not any disconnects By the way I saw similar behavior with my Mi Band and the official app on IOS On Android everything is okay too Steps to Reproduce There are two situations Just connect a peripheral device to the IOS device bleManagerconnectToDevice bleManagerdiscoverAllServicesAndCharacteristicsForDevice and wait In minutes device will be disconnected automatically deviceonDisconnected listener get device object and error null with next logs

Connection error has occured subscription called from Sometimes I can get notifications without disconnects but its a really rare situation Context I tried finding something on the internet by this error code and message and found next Looks like its some problem or feature of apple devices but I believe that there is a solution because its really strange Im not so good at the BLE topic and probably missed some important detail and as a result have this situation with disconnects on IOS But I believe that there is someone who knows what to do or had this situation too And wait for your help or opinion Prerequisites Please answer the following questions for yourself before submitting an issue YOU MAY DELETE THE PREREQUISITES SECTION I am running the latest version I checked the documentation and found no answer I checked to make sure that this issue has not already been filed Im sure that question is related to the library itself and not Bluetooth Low Energy or Classic in general If that so please post your question on StackOverflow or on our Gitter channel Question So I am able to find find the devices I am looking for I am able to list the services and characteristics however I do not see the battery service F f b fb in the list of services returned Should I expect to see it in the list Ive tried thismanagermonitorCharacteristicForDevice deviceid F f b fb a f b fb err characterisitic consolelogthismanagermonitorCharacterstic consolelog monitor char device characterisitic JSONstringifyerr monitorbattery but I get Service F f b fb for device not found Can anyone help me get a read on the battery level of my device Hi everyone Im using this library to monitoring Characateristcs from two different devices on Android In particular Im monitoring for Characateristcs at devices So I have elements to monitoring I have tried to print the data monitored and I dont have the same numbers of data for all Characateristcs I have notice that sometimes I read the same Characateristc more time compared to the others How can I fix this problem async notifications thisbatterythisdevice thisdevice thisdevicesMonitoringthisdevice thisdevice

github so im sorry if something is wrong with formattingrules Im designing an app that connects via bluetooth to an heart rate sensor and with this library i successfully connect and read the values from it My issue here is that this one service is notify only no permissions to read or write and the only function from the library that i managed to use was monitorCharacteristicForService Everything was good until the program got complex The issue here is that i can only get the values INSIDE the monitor function and take it outside of it with setState which causes automatic render etc etc Any suggestions on how i can have full control on that buf variable on the image all the values i get are correct i just want to not use setState or manage to get values from the characteristic outside the function so i have more room to work with Once again sorry for the noob question since its not really a library issue but more like i dont have the skills to completely understand the documentation of monitorCharacteristicForService Thanks in advance for all the help you can provide PS i tried using redux to copy the state instead of changing it but without success After deviceconnect and even after discoverAllServicesAndCharacteristics readCharacteristicForService does not work But getting charactaristics by digging in does The first does not work async readDoorCharacteristic thisopenDoorCharacteristic await thisdevicereadCharacteristicForService cd c e cb e b a ae dbcce cda ce cb e b a ae dbcce This one does async readCharacteristics thisopenDoorCharacteristic null if thisconnected const services await thisdeviceservices for let i i serviceslength i const service services i thislogpushService uuid serviceuuid const characteristics await servicecharacteristics const openDoorCharacteristic characteristicsfindc cuuid cda ce cb e b a ae dbcce if openDoorCharacteristic thisopenDoorCharacteristic openDoorCharacteristic But I would prefer not itterating through services and caharactaristics when they are known to me Any ideas why this doesnt work ps The serviceUuid and CharactaristicUuid are not the same but close Thanks Regards Thomas Hey guys first I would like to thank you for building such tool which is great I have an error on IOS IOS While scanning I can access device name but the result of the promise I dont ts const connectedDevice await deviceconnect requestMTU devicename Good name connectedDevicename null I also miss a lot of data a seen on my screenshot img width altScreenshot at src Maybe you could help me Thanks a lot Hi Did you saw that and is it planned error React Native CLI uses autolinking for native dependencies but the following modules are linked manually reactnativebleplx to unlink run reactnative unlink reactnativebleplx This is likely happening when upgrading React Native from below to or above Going forward you can unlink this dependency via reactnative unlink dependency and it will be included in your app automatically If a library isnt compatible with autolinking disregard this message and notify the library maintainers Read more about autolinking Read more about autolinking Regards Wondering where does the bug comes from Im trying to write b to a device Uint characteristic maxBytes and end up with on the other side Probably something stupid Writing strings do work properly Im using the moddable framework with this basic example trying to set the control characteristic Thanks for the great lib
