Hi I use the default settings but when i activate a new environment in anaconda the prompt of the virtual env information appears in wrong locations above the powerline instead of the left of the powerline Selection Even if I set the POWERLINEPATHshort it is still too long for some path like smap Xu ProjectRelationExtractionrelationclassicationcnnpytorch Is ther any way only show the current working directory like this smap Xu RelationExtractionrelationclassicationcnnpytorch or smap Xu relationclassicationcnnpytorch I have turned off the date but the prompticon on the far right still shows When I am in a directory which is not a git repository there is an white space shown at the end of the prompt Ive tried to uncomment the ifstatement in line to line not work Also tried the ternary expression as this article POWERLINEGITINFOLEFTgitpromptinfo But end up with zsh bad math expression illegal character My temporary solution is add below lines to my zshrc function newCD cd source ZSHthemesZSHTHEMEzshtheme alias cdnewCD But it seems to so ugly and unstable as I changed the behavior of the default command cd so does anyone have a better solution My prompt is green and blue and it does not look well when I use Terminal in Basic theme I have tried to change my theme into Solarized Dark and Light but both do not work And seems having the same problem Could you please kindly tell me what is your terminal theme when you make the screenshot Any suggestions Thanks in advance The right arrow unicode characters dont display correctly with transparency in iterm Their color stays constant with transparency change despite surrounding background color adjusting appropriately Not sure if this is an iterm issue displaying colored unicode but perhaps there is a workaround with the powerline theme With transparency off With transparency at Transparency at If merged this code will add user settings for each of the git icons and colors This also fixes default symbols setting the color to black instead of POWERLINEGITCOLORFRONT POWERLINECUSTOMCURRENTPATH does nothing because it then sets POWERLINECURRENTPATH instead of POWERLINEPATH Feasibly POWERLINECUSTOMCURRENTPATH could be renamed to POWERLINECUSTOMPATH or its behaviour could be directly rolled into the POWERLINEPATH variable by checking if it is unset before setting the default
