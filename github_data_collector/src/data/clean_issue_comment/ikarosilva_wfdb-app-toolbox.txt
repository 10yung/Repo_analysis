I tried both examples of wrann function but no test was generated in current directory Help me wfdbdemo Reading samples ECG signal from MITBIH Arrhythmia Database Reference to nonexistent field WFDBCUSTOMLIB Error in getWfdbClass line javaWfdbExecjavaObjectorgphysionetwfdbWfdbexeccommandNameconfigWFDBCUSTOMLIB Error in rdsamp line javaWfdbExecconfig getWfdbClassrdsamp Error in wfdbdemo line tmecg rdsampmitdb N rdannm adds to chan number to comply with Matlabs based indexing but wrannm does not subtract to revert back to based indexing A fix could be to modify line of wrannm chan num chararraychan chan N First ensure that make check will actually exit with nonzero status if any of the tests fail Second add a rule for quickly running a single unit test If standard error is connected to a pipe and nobody reads from the pipe bad stuff happens Currently standard error output is ignored so this option is doing nothing except slowing things down and causing the program to freeze when the pipe buffer fills up This has some security fixes Long record names are not parsed properly by ecgpuwave resulting in failed annotations I have discovered the issue on the PhysioNet ECGRDVQ database where the record names have a form XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXdathea that is also prepended by the path name of ecgrdvqraw To reproduce run ecgpuwave on the st record in the ecgrdvq database by ecgpuwaveecgrdvqraw ed cd f ab da be ann The resulting annotation file is ecgrdvqraw ed cd ann Note the question mark in the file name So the full file name without the extension and is symbols long The nonMatlab Unixbased version of ecgpuwave returns a similar result I have discovered that the original ecgpuwave implementation Fortran code found at ver has the line character arg f fname desc units which seems to be limiting the length of a record name Simple change to character arg f fname desc units solves the problem PS I do not know where to file the issue as it seems being an issue for ecgpuwave not the toolbox itself However there is no issue tracking system for the original Fortran code of ecgpuwave Additionally I could not find any similar issue on other or even the same database although it seems to be quite easily discoverable no one annotating ECGRDVQ database ever Another solution would be to rename all the files in this particular database records which is quite unreasonable in this case GNU Octave version on x redhatlinuxgnu An updated link to Sassis webpage in the help of ecgpuwave The new link is believed to be corresponding to the old one
