Opening this as WIP for now pending a better description and more testing This gets us very close to solving Followup to this updates the specs under spectools and speclib to use RSpecdescribe on the outer describe block As a user I want to import buttons with their associated dialog by executing this from the CLI binrake evmimportcustombuttons source tmpcfexportbuttonsCustomButtonsyaml As a user I cannot see anywhere in this file that indicates what dialog to associate with the button I imported the dialogs and then ran this command and there is no association Using the command above the YAML doesnt contain a key for the dialog and the API doesnt allow a dialog to be retrieved or specified MIQEXPORT contained a day called dialoglabel Create a Event that will check for Service Request Finished and fetch Service Request ID When serviceprovisionrequest is finished requeststatefinished I would like to update SNowrequestID with the serviceprovisionrequest status using SNOW API If two Catalog Items in a Catalog Bundle are not dependent as a user I want the two different Catalog items in Catalog Bundle to execute in parallel to reduce execution time of the bundle Regex Validator displayed when the Catalog is ordered Add a custom perfield validation failed message Add a custom perfield validation failed message rather than displaying the entire regex to be validated When testing the changes done to the migration workflow we identified a few issues that are fixed by this pull request If the virtual machine is powered on and doesnt have an IP address it will stay in the waitingforipaddress state until timeout And the timeout will fail the migration We register the IP addresses of the VM in preflightcheck method and check the list is not empty When an error occurs the infraconversionjob cancel the migrationtask that in turn cancels the job It leads to a duplicate cancellation RHBZ Please implement a rich text label control that we can use to provide free text The label control should allow Free text input Ideally a small subset of Markdown eg lists headings sizing or something equivalent Ideally allow for dynamic updates like other dialog controls Currently there is no way to add a simple basic label control to service dialogs In order to provide guidance to users you need to either make use of the help tooltips which are not immediately obvious or create a workaround such as a disabled textarea field There is functionality to add Lifecycle Events and the functionality is documented Want to see them in the timeline Want to see list of events that have occurred with VM object As an admin i want to be able to send the provision request through the api providing the details of the user the request should be run by instead of the admin user Admin impersonating the user
