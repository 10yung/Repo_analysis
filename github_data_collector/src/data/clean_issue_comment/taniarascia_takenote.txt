When trying to login via GitHub account the existing OAuth list of access requested is way too much which might be idea Please consider limited access for sign in Id love to use this as a standalone app on android mobile Upon discovering these two things Auth would cost month at users Auth does not grant the ability to get a GitHub token an access repo data I realized Auth is not right for the needs of this project Instead I will create an Express server to serve the front end as a SPA and handle all API requests including getting the GitHub token and everything else we do with GH This will allow the app to be mainly front end only without relying on a thirdparty for GitHub authentication Special thanks to leofrozenyogurt for getting Serverless set up as a potential workaround to the GitHub token issue Describe the bug If npm cannot verify certificates it fails Id like to see an option to disable certificate checking Because i cant run Dockerfile on my workplace To disable ssl check set it in npm config npm config set strictssl false To Reproduce Just set up a proxy or vpn that will inject its own certs or something like that Expected behavior Screenshots npm ERR code UNABLETOVERIFYLEAFSIGNATURE npm ERR errno UNABLETOVERIFYLEAFSIGNATURE npm ERR request to failed reason unable to verify the first certificate Created a lambda function that can be deployed with Serverless As of right now the lambda function lives inside the serverless folder and all the client and secret variables have been set with ENV this is just placeholder as I have not added env Also this PR is still a work in progress and was just to make sure the getRepos function could work with this setup Describe the bug When you make a new note in Safari a red dot appears Inspecting the code it says theres an invalid character This issue does not happen in Firefox or Chrome To Reproduce Make a new note Screenshots img width altScreen Shot at PM src img width altScreen Shot at PM src To Reproduce Log out of TakeNote if youre already logged in Click Log In or Sign Up Note the text under Welcome Expected behavior Id get rid of the text altogether and just keep the Welcome and the button underneath Otherwise you could say Log in to continue but that would be redundant If you plan on adding more login options in the future you could get rid of Continue with GitHub and just say GitHub That way you could use Log in to continue or some other welcome text Screenshots In addition to the issue open re GitHub storage would it be possible to integrate a serverside storage solution Id like to be able to host my own personal TakeNote server that I could access from different computers which seems like a natural extension for a webbased app Thanks Currently the system uses github to log in and store data however that requires a callback URL that fails for local nontakenotedev URLs This is obviously not ideal especially given that the documentation explains that you can run the site using npm start We should consider adding an offlineonly mode that doesnt sync data to the cloud but instead just syncs it locally This will allow easier local testing and also give people the ability to deploy the app on their own personal sites GitHub authentication is complete Now you can log in with GitHub but the functionality doesnt integrate with GitHub yet Instead of saving to local storage all notes in the app will live in a single special Gist and all notes will be a file within that gist Will need to think of some methods of saving settings and categories such as a special Gist containing JSON for all that data Will need to think of methods to revert to default if someone chooses to edit that file
