Hi everybody I am a very big fan of athenapdf it generates amazing pdf when other renders crash However I would really love to get athenapdf working on my raspberryPi Is there any way how you could provide a docker image which would run on ARM processors Alternatively I would really appreciate if you could give me some instructions on how to compile athenapdf on ARM Best Andreas As highlighted by issue the demo site is not functioning at the moment Rather than link to a dead page Ill remove this for now I have a tv samsung UHD with model code UN MU GXPE version FB for a few months when I use the web browser and watch videos on youtube within a few seconds of starting to watch the video the screen goes blank and the message renderer process has c rashed and it reloads my website it used to happen or times and then I could watch my video but now it happens at every moment making it impossible to watch the videos on youtube I want to know how to solve this problem because I dont think it is due to the internet I look forward to your help seems to be down Add documentation for inline file conversion through the microservice to supplement URL conversion that was already documented How can we remove the Resources line from the generated PDF It prevents us to validate our PDFs with another rd party tool and the line itself is apparently deprecated versionv env run in k s error messageexit status athenapdf GtkWARNING cannot open display log meesage Worker processing conversion job pending conversions AthenaPDF converting to PDF AthenaPDF Error athenapdf S nocache texthtml charsetutf false errinfo exit status athenapdf GtkWARNING cannot open display captured errors Error exit status athenapdf GtkWARNING cannot open display GIN ms GET convert Error exit status athenapdf GtkWARNING cannot open display like this issue but the issue say this problem has been solved What is the reason for this problem Can we have a OpenAPI doc or swaggeryml file that documents the API Possibly use redoc to create the apidocs Xvfb needs the directory tmpX unix to be owned by root headless chrome needs a writeable HOME directory enables to run the image for example with u the server can be run on OpenShift and K s clusters with SCC Hi there Is it possible to pass options similar to CLI to REST requests Eg margins Also is there any plan to build other options Eg Custom header footer Paging could be part of footer Thanks
