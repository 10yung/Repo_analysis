Create new eventemitting jobs by using hubot nevent job instead of hubot add job Additionally fixes an issue with list jobs command where it would occasionally return undefined for the room portion Im using hubotcron with rediscache as brain After a restart the job is nonfunctional list jobs shows the following undefined message Add functionality to send commands back into hubot miyagawa hubot new job exec hubot ping hubot Job created hubot PONG Im not sure about the command syntax but it seems workable to me Ive only tested this in the Shell adapter so far Resolves Not sure what the problem could be but I just added the script to our Slackbot and it adds jobs but never executes on the reminders even after changing time zones etc Is this script still working The userreplyto id seems to be different everytime hubot is restarted therefore not a safe option everytime I restarted hubot listing jobs wouldnt return any result I use the jobuserroom by default instead Also added a method list all to list all jobs recorded in the job brain regardless of the channel Great documentation on getting the ability to set up a cronjob in hubot Is it possible to setup a cronjob to hubot perform a function Usually hubot listens for a user command to respond with some text Can this cronjob output the same text trying to eliminate the user input to make hubot respond Our group chat does not require authentication so the bot connects over XMPP HOSTPORT If I create a cron in the group chat right at the time when the cron should run the bot restarts itself It works if I open a private chat with the bot Please let me know if you need any further information
