Is this project using continuous integration services eg TravisCI or Jenkings Or has it used at any point of its lifetime Simultaneous transitions on a single element dont seem to work if using multiple calls to transit For example wtransit opacity queue false duration wtransit scale queue false duration Only scale is animated opacity jumps immediately from its current value to Thus it seems impossible with jquerytransit to animate two different css properties of an object at the same time if the transitions have different durations or delays or if you have other reasons to want to separate the animations into distinct calls to transit This PR adds support for skew transform in no more than lines of code The transforms skewX and skewY were already supported in current version However skew cannot be replaced with them perhaps there is a way to make such replacement but seems hard to do so We may try the following snippets which lead to different styles transform skew deg deg transform skewX deg skewY deg transform skewY deg skewX deg Hello Ive installed jquerytransit over npm and when calling the transition method on any element I get the following error temp transitionx Uncaught TypeError Cannot read property speeds of undefined at rfninitfntransitionfntransit jquerytransitjs at anonymous When adding the duration temp transitionx it works fine Ive been using AnimeJS however it doesnt have a way of returning a value or applying a value without a delay These are two I need for the current project I have Transform properties are a nightmare unless using something like this I cant find anything that replaces this however bugs such as not being able to get scale it always returns regardless is meaning I cant use it Is this dead Can I fork it and start from where you left off Hi When adding jquerytransit to a page using SyncFusion javascript chart it breaks the animation of the chart Kind regards Dan Hi I am using Transitjs to move pages left to right and right to left Firefox renders perfectly this effect but not chrome latest version It delays the page then show as a blink effect Please see the link below so you can understand what I mean by than Thanks in advance It appears that Firefox requires the filter property to have a lowercase f Chrome however requires an uppercase F This commit adds a fallback case for Firefox that attmepts to use detect the filter property if the initial check fails Simple implementation of stopTransition Only reason Im making a pull request is so others can pull this into their own fork since it seems to be a highly requested feature and theres no reason to write it twice The author doesnt seem to maintain the repo any longer Hi The Webpage demos are not working on an ipad
