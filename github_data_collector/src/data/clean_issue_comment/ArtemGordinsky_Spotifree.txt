TravisCI Configuration Features Adds build passfailure indication to READMEmd Allows for easy addition of merge rules based on build status Enables mindlessly simple releases just tag a commit and push it Requirements These changes require the repository owner to perform some setup link the project to TravisCI generate an oauth token for GitHub Releases gem install travis travis login travis token Make sure the token is encrypted update build status url in READMEmd to point to correct travis job Hi Regarding the new terms and conditions which state We ve updated our User Guidelines making it clear that all types of ad blockers bots and fraudulent streaming activities are not permitted Since Spotifree doesnt block it simply mutes do we Spotifree users need to be concerned about our accounts I love Spotifree as much as my playlists Thanks Hi There There is a problem in some ads more than mins lenght spotify doesnt run any song and stuck in starting ads and when spotifree is not open there is not problem like that thanks for your amazing application I would love to add some other languages I can personally contribute to Spanish and Vietnamese and I have seen some typos in the French language An easy PR to start Current release is approaching rd birthday with commits since Would love to take advantage of some of the new features any timeline on pushing a new release Or is there some reference on how to build this from sources Podcasts are being muted by Spotifree presumably because they have a track number equal to But I would guess theres also an easy way to check the audio type to make sure its not a podcast before muting it Or maybe theres an episode number field Tried skimming through the API but not sure where to look Maybe the type key in the Track Have to be playing on a song already and then switch to a podcast Looking at the Spotify URI for a podcast it looks like its not treated the same as a track podcast spotifyepisodeid versus a track spotifytrackid But the web API doesnt seem to have endpoints for episodes Based on this Github issue it looks like this functionality may not be supported yet Although I dont know if that should prevent Spotifree from handling podcast episodes properly New release of Spotify When ad plays Spotifree mutes as expected but ad then never finishes not does the music continue Saw in my console a large amount of logging output log AppleEvents received mach msg which wasnt complex type as expected in getMemoryReference Perhaps a simple fix I had to quit so I could read other outputs to find a different problem I have It would be nice if the user could provide an MP to play in the background while Spotify is muted Apparently you can skip ads now maybe add an option to skip instead of muting
