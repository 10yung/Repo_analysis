In LaTeX one can construct a large open parenthesis with left fracML right Using this with TeX is possible and gives r TeX left fracML right expression left fracML right paste bgroup paste fracpasteM paste L It is not possible to use this as the bgroup is missing the closing dot The correct code would be expressionbgroup fracM L I removed unneccessary paste and empty strings for emphasis on the r plotnew plotwindowc c text latex expTeX left fracML right works text latex expTeX left fracML right Error in bgroup paste fracpasteM paste L invalid group specification r text expressionbgroup fracM L works grafik This could be very nice to have Add phantom support Addresses issue not sure if i was doing it right but I couldnt get whitespace with nor Would be great to support eg hspace cm as well The code TeX hat rho gives the following error Original string hat rho Parsed expression pastehatpasterho Error in parsetext str text unexpected pastehatpasterho Add possibility to use literal underscore and caret symbols Now I cant use them neither in text nor in math modes TeXH H The current dev version is superior to the current CRAN version Any plans for a CRAN release I installed the latest latex exp manually from the binary available in CRAN in a Windows computer without internet I am working in a secure lab environment I am using R with RGui crap I know but I am not an administrator and change requests are slow When I load the package I get a popup message saying The procedure entry point DATAPTR could not be located in the dynamic link library Rdll After accepting the message the R console says Error in inDLx aslogicallocal aslogicalnow unable to load shared object pathtomylocallibrarystringilibsx stringidll LoadLibrary failure The specified procedure could not be found Not sure what is the problem as the file stringidll is in the aforementioned folder The file is the original from the package zip file I manually installed other packages and dependencies like ggplot and they load fine so it seems to be an issue of latex exp Hence my post here Any idea I would like to annotate math formulas on the plot using geomtext and I specified the TeX expression to the label argument in following code libraryggplot librarylatex exp p ggplotmtcars aesmpg cyl geompoint geomtextaesx y label TeX theta printp However it produces following error Dont know how to automatically pick scale for object of type expression Defaulting to continuous Error in asdataframedefaultx i optional TRUE cannot coerce class expression to a dataframe
