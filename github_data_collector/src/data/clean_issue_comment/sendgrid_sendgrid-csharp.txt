sendgridcsharp Version Platform ASPNET NET Version Issue Summary Theres no way to implement SendGrid using this library when the core project is not using async Technical details sendgridcsharp Version Platform ASPNET Core NET Version Issue Summary Tracking issue for and As explained in the pull request it is useful to be able to test internal members in the SendGridClient for regression testing Adding InternalsVisibleTo to the assembly attribute allows us to use internal members for testing purposes Companion PR for This is a PR that acts as a companion to by allowing tests to be written for internal members of the client Without it we can either not write unit tests for internal code at all and forego regression tests or expose the APIs as public Neither of these options seems very attractive hence this PR introduces a third option In order for InternalsVisibleTo to work any assembly it exposes its internals too must be strong signed hence the tests project is now strongly signed with the same key as the SendGridClient project Checklist x I acknowledge that all my contributions will be made under the projects license x I have made a material change to the repo
