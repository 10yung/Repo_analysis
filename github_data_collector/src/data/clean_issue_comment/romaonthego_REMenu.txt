I have a bug that menu doesnt response to touches typeof self weak weakSelf self REMenuItem size REMenuItem alloc initWithTitleMax Size imagenil highlightedImagenil action REMenuItem item size self savingValues calling method every thing going right way menu open and on click it closes but the action method is not called plz help on this why dont update the menu there are some function to consummate Closes It would be great if there is a way to adjust the height of certain rows in the dropdown menu Possibly if the row adjust to the height of REMenuItem Sometimes it is necessary to have a force close mechanism I need this in this scenery tap menu button and quickly press a button to push another view controller without this mechanism the menu appears on another screen as well This File change fixes cases where orientation changes and status bar appearsdissapers and the REMENUs y position is not calculated right Especially on iphone plus where the landscape navbar height is instead of unlike other iphones Also most probably by mistake you have written UIDeviceOrientationIsPortrait instead of UIInterfaceOrientationIsPortrait
