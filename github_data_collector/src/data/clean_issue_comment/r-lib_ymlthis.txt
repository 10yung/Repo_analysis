Just an Idea and not sure how feasible it would be My suggestion is have another function called bodytext with the idea that you can pipe all your normal YAML like this Year YAMLyml ymltitletitlepasteYearreport ymloutputhtmldocument pdfdocument but then have it that you could build the rest of the document by continuing to pipe eg reportYAML bodytextIntroduction Welcome to the final report codechunkplotx y chunkname plot chunkargslistfigwidth figheight bodytextnow that we can see some dots lets write the rest of the report usermarkdownReport path reportrmd I a just not entirely sure how you would tell it which bit goes into the YAML and which in the code chunk body parts of options if I understand how it would work blogdownarchetypes is only looking in the theme folder It needs to search the users archetype folder first then prioritize any there Likewise its only looking at md files and not folders bundles in the archetypes folder May need to make vector behavior safer for taxonomies and other YAML as hugo will often fail when it tries to range over x y instead of x y takes yml and creates files needed for usermarkdowntemplate To match the YAML field and the style of the other yml functions Something like useblogdownopts that sets up rprofile and projectspecific options as discussed by apreshill here Defaults for language newsession ymlthis YAML In the next release Id like to refactor a common pattern to use a function so its easier to maintain Most YAML functions look more or less like this r ymlfunction function yml args ymlblank yamllist list args args yamllist purrrdiscardyamllist isymlblank warnifduplicatefieldsyml yamllist yml namesyamllist yamllist yml Most of the second half can be refactored and theres probably a way to streamline the lists for functions that use entirely toplevel fields as well
