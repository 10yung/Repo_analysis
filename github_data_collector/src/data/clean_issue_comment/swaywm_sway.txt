On sway version I have bound mod and mod to move container to workspace prev and move container to workspace next I would like next or previous to be the same number relatively speaking each time In other words if I am on workspace and only have items on workspaces and and move a window to workspace next I want that to go to not Currently workspaces are automatically closed when there are no windows in it I think the simplest solution to this problem would to disable that behavior Is there a way to set a workspace to require manual destruction instead of it being dynamic If not would you be amenable to a patch that allowed setting workspace properties to do this A large motivation of this is helping use physical space as a memory aid Sways pointer is blurry when using fractional scaling in comparison to other clientseg output scale By sway pointer I mean the pointer for window resizeswaybgwindow drag swaynag is fine blurry version over swaybg blurry crisp version over swaynag good Its really hard to capture on a screenshot but a blurry cursor is a bit larger so I guess scaling wasnt applied to it sway version sway version d ef Jan branch HEAD Hello Im currently testing the version and I have found a what I think could be a bug When a popup is spawned by a XWayland window and I close it Sway refocus the window that spawned the popup Unfortunately the keyboard is not sending any input to the window even if sway is marking this window as being currently focused I can reproduce this issue with several application on current releasecandidate like vscode for instance Let me know if I can provide some details about this issue swaymsg t getversion sway version rc Example is that you two p monitors next to each other with the right monitor rotated degrees Currently when i move the pointer in the middle However it would be great if the position of the cursor would be relative to the size of your monitor Example You leave at the middle of the central screen at cursor position Y You will then have the cursor at Y In practise this would mean your cursor would never be blocked when you move around your monitors if a monitor is adjacent it can figure out relative target position on the other end Im not sure if this should be an option on the input pointer or per output Sway Version Debug Log Relevant portion swaydesktoptransactionc Transaction x e c f

windowfocus event Configuration File Happens with default configuration Steps to reproduce Run the popover example code found here reproduced here It is more obvious if you change the border width on line for the app window to something smaller like Once the window opens switch to floating mode ModShiftspace in default config Then click on the button to make the popover appear Although the popover displays outside of the parent window it doesnt seem to receive mouse events and if focusfollowsmouse is enabled as soon as you move over the popover the parent window and the popover itself loses focus Clicking also seems to send the click event to the window underneath the popover With sway I have the following in my configuration file forwindow appiddeadbeef move window to workspace floating enable resize set move position But when I start dead beef the window goes to the visible workspace on the monitor configured for workspace it is correctly floating positioned and resized I have the following workspace configuration workspace output DP workspace output DP workspace output DP workspace output DP workspace output DP workspace output DP workspace output DP workspace output DP workspace output DP workspace output DP If I set workspace or it will go to monitor DP but on the current visible workspace If I set workspace or it will go to monitor DP but on the current visible workspace It is to be noted that it creates the correct workspace in the tab bar So if I configure it to go to workspace and have workspace visible on my left monitor After opening the app it will be on workspace but Ill have and in the tab bar of the monitor If I remove floating enable or move position it goes to the correct workspace I hope the explanation is clear Right now output configuration might still be applied in several steps several commits Make it so its applied in a single commit See When playing a youtube video in firefox the video region is continuously updated while on other workspaces This was discovered while running wayvnc The FPS printout indicated that there was damage even though nothing was happening on the screen So this is a weird one and frankly might be hard to demonstrate over video capture and I dont have a highenough fidelity camera to try to take a inperson capture Im not even sure its going to come through after YouTube gets done with it This only happens when the scale factor is integer and It seems like it started around the GLLINEAR change going in though its unrelated it occurs at noninteger scales Note that the flickering seems to only repro with Netflix havent had a chance to try other video seems to be worse when there is more to render on the screen and seems to trigger when I change tabs or cause a big redraw maybe generally stops if the tab remains in focus or I move the mouse around on it a bit or sometimes even if I just use the keyboard to shift focus away from it Chrome is my only XWayland client right now so I dont have data for other XWayland clients VSCodium seems to be triggering some edge Intel GPU condition that keeps hanging anything graphical So if you have a K monitor load this video in K and go to you should actually be able to see it relatively clearly The effect is considerably more pronounced in person Sway Version e a b Jan branch master Configuration File I was playing Celeste with fullscreen
