 Screen Shot at PM Hi I am trying to get the cell index in javascript and then using it as a python variable I tried execute this line to capture the cell index node var cellindexJupyternotebookgetselectedindex But I got this message Thrown This line is working in jupyter but the problem is that its javacript variable and not python javascript var cellindexJupyternotebookgetselectedindex Do you have any solution for this problem Trying to import pixiedustnode fails in Python with the following error Pixiedust database opened successfully Pixiedust version Table USERPREFERENCES created successfully Table serviceconnections created successfully TypeError Traceback most recent call last ipythoninput a fd c d in module import

popenkwargs encoding utf But the encoding argument was only added to popen in python see Im not sure if just changing the if to sysversioninfomajor and sysversioninfominor will fix the problem It seems like the working directory for the node process should match the python working directory in jupyter I think related to this would also default the npm location to this same working directory which makes sense and mirrors the behavior of the script node jupyter cell magic Im happy to put together a PR here if needed My expertise is definitely more on the node side and less on the jupyter and python side so feel free to correct any misunderstandings I may have here Is it possible to run a npm package within a cell after its been installed like you would from the command line I have installed shp json with npminstallshp json and would like to then run it with shp json pathtoshapefile outputjson but receive an error saying binsh shp json not found Hi Im experiencing trouble trying to use nodemysql within a pixiedustnode project The cell setup is the following python import pixiedustnode npminstallmysql This works as expected showing the logos of both pixiedust and pixiedust node and then the stats of the module install The problem comes with the nodejs part The code works perfectly in a nodejs project but not within pixiedustnode javascript node var mysql requiremysql var dburl databaseurlcom var con mysqlcreateConnection host dburl user dbuser password dbpassword database dbdatabase conconnectfunctionerr if err throw err var query SELECT usercreateddate from user LIMIT conqueryquery function err result fields if err throw err consolelogresult conend I write it down here as a single block but Ive tried it in different cell layouts to find more precisely where the error is located And it is located in the mysqlcreateConnection call TypeError Converting circular structure to JSON at JSONstringify anonymous at globalVariableChecker homejavieranaconda

Based on which was raised against the sample notebook Logging it here for reference in general run X cells should probably used with caution to avoid unexpected results Running one cell at a time the
