Once I define some factorVars all myVars are treated as categorical in the table I have checked and they are continous in the dataframe I attach code and result Thank you very much tableone categorical continous variables troubledocx Hi Love this library and use a lot on my work I have a question for printing tableone output For binary categorical variable is there an argument to choose which label to use eg In surgeon specialty I have Thoracic or Other value in the variable Instead of printing SPECIALTY Other can I manually choose to display SPECIALTY Thoracic I dont want to use showAllLevels mode because it would also display too many YESNO variables that made my tableone unnecessarily long Thanks in advance Hi Mr Yoshida Thank you and your colleagues for creating a great resource for all of us to benefit from My issue is not so much an issue as a functionality question Is there was a way to vertically align digits on the decimal point using the printCreateTableOne function I get that sending printCreateTableOne creates a matrix object but Im not sure how to align those digits in R Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated reprostructurec Dim Dimnames list cn uniquen Age Stratified by Something c Stratified by Something n uniquen Age Huge fan of tableone This is my first time posting on github Is there a way for tableone to take a continuous variable and calculate its total rather than its mean For example I have a dataset where rows are different pharmacies and one column is units sold of a drug I want tableone to show the total units sold across all pharmacies rather than showing the mean number of units sold at each pharmacy Is there any way to have the table include a comma at the thousands place Current output is this alkphos mean SD Is there a way to get this instead alkphos mean SD hi I thought this might be useful for someone This few lines of code combine table overall and table one stratified and export it to a nice xlsx automatically table printedasdataframeprinttable table stratprintedasdataframeprinttable strat table finalcbindtable printedtable stratprinted xlsxwritexlsxasdataframeprinttable final table finalxlsx One issue I run into in creating various table s is if a subject can select multiple categories the counts are off Example say I have subjects but they are allowed to select multiple races We typically report the total selected in this case or for each race and the total within the race category may not sum to the total overall N in this case I dont think there is currently a way around this in CreateTableOne Id be willing to submit a pull request if this type of enhancement would be accepted librarytidyverse librarytableone dat tibbleid cA B B race cW W B t CreateTableOnedata dat vars crace printt showAllLevels TRUE gives level Overall n race B W What I would like is to be able to say count by unique id and get something more like level Overall n race B W thoughts As brought up in kableone only lets you pass arguments to kable and not to printtableone I think there are a couple of related issues here Right now Im thinking a good PR for this will do the following Move the code currently in printtableone to asdataframetableone with printToggle FALSE to avoid captureoutput change printtableone to something like r printtableone functionx arguments x asdataframex arguments printx Change kableone to something like r kableone functionx kableargs list printargs list need to evaluate arguments as well x asdataframex printargs knitrkablex kableargs Many thanks to your package I want to create a table like below Say I have data like this GramSpeciesCount posA posB negC negD negD How to output first table using tableone THANK YOU Currently tableone object can only be written out using writecsv Suggest expand to writecsv
