Reproduction of the problem I have two line chart in page If changed one of the yaxis of this instances both of them updated I have too similar two line chart So just use a single options json

Angular Sometimes the issue is related with Chartjs instead of ng charts To confirm if the issue shows in a pure Chartjs project it is a issue of Chartjs Pure Chartjs starting template If the issue does not show in a pure Chartjs project and shows in a ng charts project please try to provide a minimal demo of the problem ng charts starting template Trying to plot a financial chart with data from the S P I ran into a strange problem The chart itself is plotted correctly However on the xaxis only about half of the labels and the according grid lines are drawn financialchart I first used the sample code of the Angular Charts Demo which works perfectly What makes the difference is the data used Therefore I also added the data as JSON here Please note there isnt a data point for each day There are of course no quotes on weekends or holidays When I fake the timestamp to be continuous the xaxis labels and grid lines are drawn correctly Also taking a subset of the unaltered data works just fine This problem dosnt occur when I try to do the same thing with plain JS So its definitely a problem with ng charts The code is pretty straight forward HTML html div classchart canvas height

imports all of lodash and is making the bundle size larger than necessary Thanks for all your work clap Im trying to reduce my applications bundle size Just wondering why I have to bundle chartjs Can I not bundle ng charts and load chartjs by using a script tag in my applications indexhtml When I try this I get an error from ng charts saying that chartjs is missing Hi according to Bar chart documentation of ChartJS I am creating chart where I define starting and ending point of each bar as following thischartData data label Crude oil prices Code works as expected but I get TS errors that data types are incompatible ERROR in srcappcomponentsbarchartbarchartcomponentts error TS Type number is not assignable to type number ChartPoint Type number is not assignable to type number Bumps

will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the
