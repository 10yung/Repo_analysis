quiet some headaches The very first child ViewController of the PageBoyViewController gets presented before the parent controller has appeared on screen I added some print statements to the example project Heres an example run viewDidLoad for the PageBoyViewController viewDidLoad for the ChildViewController with ID D C viewWillAppear for the ChildViewController viewDidAppear for the ChildViewController viewWillAppear for the PageBoyViewController viewDidAppear for the PageBoyViewController viewDidLoad viewDidLoad D C F A EF A DAD C F B viewWillAppear D C F A EF A DAD C F B viewDidAppear D C F A EF A DAD C F B viewWillAppear viewDidAppear I find this very confusing How can the ChildViewController enter viewDidAppear before the PageBoyViewController has entered this state or at at least would follow the ChildViewControllers entering of this state immediately I git clone the project and run MacbookPageboymaster USERNAME carthage bootstrap platform ios Checking out

I have nextprevious buttons in the parent viewcontroller as I dont want the buttons to slide with the pages embedded in the pageboy viewcontroller But when I try to call the scrollToPage functions in the parent nothing happens What am I doing wrong My code override func preparefor segue UIStoryboardSegue sender Any if segueidentifier CarouselEmbedSegue let vc seguedestination as ContainedCarouselVC guard let selectedLocation location else return vcthemeColor selectedLocationcolor vclocationToLoad selectedLocation IBAction func slidePrevious sender Any let vc ContainedCarouselVC vcscrollToPageprevious animated true IBAction func slideNext sender Any let vc ContainedCarouselVC vcscrollToPagenext animated true Doing reloadData if numberOfViewControllersin pageboyViewController returns zero after having some view controllers on the screen they still present So I cant clear view controllers The reason is this code in PageboyViewControllerManagementswift guard defaultIndex newViewControllerCount let viewController fetchViewControllerat defaultIndex else return Ive tried dismiss endEditing and isActive false before turning the viewController in PageboyViewControllerDataSource but it seems this doesnt happen soon enough for the crash to happen Steps to reproduce Add two viewControllers one which uses a UISearchController Open the page with the search controller and select it so the keyboard presents Try to switch pages without dismissing the search controller keyboard Experience the following crash I have confirmed that manually dismissing the UISearchController via a different button then switching pages prevents the crash Payment Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInternalInconsistencyException reason Unexpected
