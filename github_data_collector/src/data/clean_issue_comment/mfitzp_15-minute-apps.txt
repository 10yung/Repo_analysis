This is to address issue By creating a callback that generates a new browser window and assigning it to MainWindowbrowsercreateWindow the browser is able to open new windows with Ctrlclick and handle targetblank links In the spirit of this repository I have tried to keep the code simple and minimal A more proper implementation would subclass QWebEngineView or QWebEnginePage but this approach is simple and works Tried to run these projects discovered PyQtWebEngine needed to be installed to get them going Please mentions the version of python and version of PyQt used in description README Python or Python PyQt or PyQt or Both The currencypy uses a fixerio legacy API apifixerio As of March th the legacy fixer API is deprecated to use the service we need a free but registrationbound fixer access token So i believe it is needed to replace python url with python url where of course is your personal access key Hi Thanks very much for this project it is very useful for jump starting PyQt development I found the Minesweeper game particularly interesting and decided to complete its features I thought I would share it here as a PR in case you would like these improvements in your repo for others to learn from make this example game more enjoyable I will totally understand if it is out of the project scope and you reject it I wasnt sure if it was intentionally half finished so people could do exactly what I just did as a fun way to experiment or learn or because the example in its current state is perfect for demonstrating how to create Qt apps from Python Apologies if this project goal is mentioned somewhere but I missed it Anyway the changes I have made are in no particular order allow right clicking on a flagged cell to unflag it when flagging reduce the number of remaining mines shown in the counter widget when unflagging increase the number of remaining mines shown in the counter widget when revealing a mine and losing the game mark the mine that caused game over in a different color when losing the game show which flags were incorrect and keep those that were correct visible when right clicking on a revealed cell intelligently reveal the cells around if the number of adjacent mines matches the number of adjacent flags a feature Windows s winmine has evaluate the winning conditions when all the cells except the mines have been revealed use a common generator function to deduplicate some code and only evaluate the minimum number of cells necessary for the new logic set the window title allow the user to specify the difficulty level or in the command line arguments to expose the otherwise hidden functionality Traceback most recent call last File browsertabbedbrowsertabbedpy line in module import PyQt QtCore ImportError DLL load failed ist keine zul ssige Win Anwendung How would you add a proxy to Mozarella Ashbadger QLCDNumber overflows when input For example input Since integer has an limit of x FFFFFFFor casting it into float using selfstack floatv would be better Patch code
