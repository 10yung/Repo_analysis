Hello at first thank you for bobthefish its superb I have a little annoying issues and I dont know how to start to fix it Before bobthefish I used CtrlRight for wordbyword following in suggest but after Ive installed bobthefish something weird is happening when I use CtrlRight Where and how can change my CtrlRight behaviour back Thank you Hey guys Im facing this situation with the powerline Captura de Teladdedesktop How can I fix the appearance Hello I am using ranger which allows you to spawn a new terminal via shortcut S The terminal will have RANGERLEVEL set and it is advantageous to see if this shell is in ranger This PR implements ranger prompt indicator There is a possibility to show current RANGERLEVEL in prompt setting themedisplayrangerlevel to yes How to handle theme and color settings I use the nord color scheme on my machine and adapted it for this project This commit includes these new features A segment which displays OS type This is especially useful if constantly logging into different computers with different systems and you need to know if you need to type apk apt dnf or yum for example Enable it by setting the themedisplaycurrentos variable to yes Padlock for SSH connection You may enable the padlock by setting the themedisplaysshkeylock to yes Padlock is shown only when accessing the terminal via a SSH session The padlock is displayed before the hostname Split username and hostname segments This enable each segment to be coloured with a different background Set themedisplaysplituserhostname to yes to enable this feature Color root username differently When logged in as a root user background or the color of the username will change to red New colour has been added to the themes for this feature This will add support for nodenv to display the current Nodejs version in the prompt I used the code from rubyenv section to add this functionality Right now its using the themedisplaynvm configuration setting I wanted to keep this PR small I think this should be renamed to themedisplaynode to be consistent with themedisplayruby I can add an issuePR to update this Currently if you add a new file to a subdirectory in a git repo then cd to a sibling directory the untracked glyph will not appear This is inconsistent with the behavior of the other git colors and flags eg if you modify a file and cd into a sibling directory the prompt will still be red and the dirty working directory glyph will still appear Heres an example of the current behavior untrackedglyphmissing This PR modifies the query used to find untracked files so it searches from the repo root instead of the current directory Heres the same directory with these changes applied untrackedglyphfixed This is a clone of with bobthecows comments integrated The fixes for and introduce the use of pwd P to normalize PWD but this prevents the display of HOME as in cases where HOME contains a symlink Rather than passing normalized PWD everywhere this commit proposes to improve path reoslution for githg root directory in the respective functions This commit addresses but has not been tested for On macOS roots HOME is varroot and var is a symlink to privatevar Since bobthefishpwd uses pwd P bobthefishs prompt does not display when PWD is varroot since pwd Pyields privatevarroot Two possible fixes use pwd L instead of pwd P use PWD only Let me know if you want a pull request
