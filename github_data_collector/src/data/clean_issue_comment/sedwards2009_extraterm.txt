I was having some problems with WSL so I restarted WSL but afterwards Extraterm no longer works with WSL regardless of the WSL configuration in Extraterm Ive tried using the default shell or specifying one and setting or not setting the start directory but it never starts up WSL does work in its default terminal and both cmd and PowerShell and work in Extraterm I see the following lines in the log DEBUG Main proxysessionbackend serverPath homezarainiaptyserver py DEBUG main handlePtyCreate ptyId senderid WARN Main proxysessionbackend ptyproxy process stderr python cant open file homezarainiaptyserver py Errno No such file or directory ptyserver py doesnt exist in my home directory in WSL so it obviously cant find it but Im not sure why its supposed to be there Also if I try to open a new WSL tab in Extraterm it shows a Javascript error popup saying ERRSTREAMDESTROYED Ctrl or actually any Ctrlnumber key are not passed through to vim or a normal terminal A very long command BACKENDpostgres pytest tbshort testsapicommonexperimentaltesttriggerdagpyTestTriggerDag testsjobstestbackfilljobpyTestBackfillJobtesttriggercontrollerdag testsjobstestschedulerjobpyTestSchedulerJobtestschedulerverifypoolfull x in this case means the labelnumber and controls for a frame arent visible Version Itd be nice to have a default layout on startup I tend to open the same few windows in a fairly long period of time as Im developing the same things for potentially a couple of months Itd be nice to have a way to when opening the app have it open to the things Im currently working on via a configsettings option If frames are active when trying to activate a pipenv subshell the system pauses for around seconds then prompts a successframe but never activates the pipenv subshell pipenvbug If frames are turned off everything works fine Maybe Im missing something but it seems that every none zero exit status gets framed dont get me wrong I like the functionality but it would be nice to have more control over them in vscode integrated terminal getting annoying num above prompt and non zero exit bugy only when I source integration scripts in configfishconfigfish vscodedemo Font rendering in Windows is really smudgy It looks bolded even though bold is not selected I tried many different fonts and they all looks bolded blurry and smudgy Also don t size doesn t look right Very small for px size Can this be fixed I really the app but the font is a downer Hi I love this terminal Its by far the most feature rich superb and the drag and drop of the tab to pane is a must have I often use command longer than a screen width Everytime I use the backspace key the display is messed up Sometimes the cursor goes the line above the command Im on sometimes it display text that is not what it executes when I press enter I could even edit the prompt header Im on Fedora extraterm zsh ohmyzsh ec I tested with bash it is the same When extratermcommands is disabled I can edit long command line without any issue It was partially mentioned in Please make it possible to configure the tab name in session types From my practice i use separate session tabs configured for managing exchange powercli just powershell and they all look alike after opening sure i can rename but that works only till application restart Hi everyone Once I install Extraterm every shell opens in a new window like this It doesnt matter if its windows cmd powershell git bash cmder I cannot figure out how to set it up to open within the Extraterm window There is a cursor in the Extraterm window but it does not accept any commands Right now all Extraterm seems to do is launch another window and nothing more Is it supposed to work natively out of the box Is there something basic I am missing here Ive read all the documentation and searched github issues but cant see any mention of my issue Im not sure if its relevant or not but here are the developer errors Uncaught Error spawn wslexe ENOENT at ProcessChildProcesshandleonexit internalchildprocessjs at onErrorNT internalchildprocessjs at processTicksAndRejections
