I think it would be helpful if this feature is available Fix zip became a global function with commit b eff dc d c a d ef b So I fixed the code in READMEmd homeuserProjectbuildcheckoutsHydragit SourcesHydraPromiseAwaitswift error binary operator cannot be applied to two DispatchQueue operands guard selfqueue DispatchQueuemain else Swift version swift RELEASE Target x unknownlinuxgnu Ubuntu LTS Hi Malcom Is there any kind of progress block for things like uploading an avatar for example uploadAvatar progress p in Here update progressView for example thendoSomething onErrorshowErrorPopup finallydoSomething Hi guys I have been using this library for a while and I have to say its very easy to work with it I have a concern about cancellable promises specifically the behaviour of a chain of promises when a promise in the middle has been cancelled Lets say we have swift AthenBthenCthenDthenE then in printsuccess catch in printfailed cancelled in printcancelled If for example C gets cancelled while A and B resolve correctly Im expecting that cancelled is printed out but what I observe is that the sequence gets stuck in pending state This behaviour can be checked with the following test that recalls the ones provided with the library which fails for timeout swift func testcancelledPromiseChainable let exp expectationdescription testcancelledPromiseChainable let invalidator InvalidationToken InvalidationToken invalidatorisCancelled true intPromisethen in selftestinvalidationTokentoken invalidator then total in printOperation finished with total XCTFail catch in printOperation failed cancelled printOperation cancelled expfulfill waitForExpectationstimeout expTimeout handler nil If Im not misinterpreting the situation I will open a PR with a suggested fix otherwise please let me know the reasoning behind this behaviour Thanks AT in READMEmd retry is written twice in line It is good to match because the order is different from Index There is no retry in All Feature Hey guys first of all thank you very much for this great library I have dismissActivityIndicator method which returns a promise func dismissActivityIndicatorTany T PromiseT return PromiseT resolve in KVNProgressdismissAnyway resolveany My question is how can I inject it into the promise chain so it is always executed at end Its fairy simple with always and a plain nonasync method but how to achieve the same result with the method returning a Promise help wanted would be an appropiate tag for this question as this is not an issue using swift version of spm and its having trouble installing though server side project is in using Perfect Server Side too many errors to copy and paste here but It tried different major and minor versions and no success What I was wishing for swift allpromiseApromiseBthen resultA resultB in Based on the docs it would have to be swift allpromiseApromiseBthen result in let resultA result let resultB result or swift PromiseVoidzippromiseA promiseBthen resultA resultB in Any thoughts
