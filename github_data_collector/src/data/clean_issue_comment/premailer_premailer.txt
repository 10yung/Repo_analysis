Example to reproduce this using Premailer ruby str FOO DOCTYPE html html head garbage style color red style head body Testing body html FOO p Premailernewstr withhtmlstring true ptoplaintext That outputs garbage n ncolor red n n n nTesting Note how values that were in the head of the html document are now in the plain text output in a somewhat mangled form This is counter to what I would expect namely that generated plain text would ignore and omit any values in the head of the document This PR is a duplicate of but seeing as that one is over a year old I decided to clean it up a bit and resubmit The basic problem here is that with multiple img tags on the same line if the first one doesnt have an alt attribute but a later one does the regular expression will greedily match everything in between and throw it away Example Under normal circumstances the regular expression will convert each img tag to whatever its alt text value is ruby Premailernewimg altbefore then img altaftertoplaintext before then after But here where the first one doesnt have any alt text the entire string matches the regex for a single img tag and the word just is removed entirely from the output ruby Premailernewimg just img altaftertoplaintext after The regex change here is the exact same as the one proposed in but maybe having this based on the latest master will help get it merged in Added a config option to allow dropping unused CSS styles from the document The default behavior is to include any unmerged noninlined styles in a style block at the top of the body However this can result in a huge block of unneeded css that can make your emails very long causing them to get clipped in the client This option lets you turn off that behavior I added a test thats passing for my change but there were a lot of tests failing already which I didnt have time to look at This is still WIP but it reveals the problem I could use a hand resolving some of the remaining fails When using Nokogiri and Nokogumbo the following error comes out of some of our templates NoMethodError undefined method createelement for NokogiriHTML DocumentFragment x bbaaf c Did you mean createexternalsubset Looking a little into the stack trace we see from homevagrantrbenvversions librubygems gemspremailer libpremaileradapternokogumborb in writeunmergablecssrules Hopefully more data to come Run into this issue with b char Example Premailernew if mso hello bworld endif withhtmlstring truetoinlinecss Output DOCTYPE html PUBLIC W CDTD HTML TransitionalEN htmlbodypworldpbodyhtml n The comments have been stripped away and all of the string before b is missing This does not happen if the char is not in a comment See the spec change for the situation that this fixes Dimensions for img in Inline css style doesnt work for outlook on Windows Also dimension attributes width height for img with unit px doesnt work This pull request will extract the width and height from the inline css and set them to html attributes with no unit I get this error Unable to import module main cannot import name etree Maybe it has something to do with this As discussed in
