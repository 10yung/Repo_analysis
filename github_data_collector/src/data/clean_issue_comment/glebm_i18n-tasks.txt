Hi I am using i n reference keys in my yml file eg en greetings hello hello helloagain greetingshello The problem I am running into is when I export the translations to a csv file the helloagain value is having the colon removed so its no longer a reference value If I then manually go into the csv and add back in the to make it greetingshello and then import the translation I now end up with double quotes around the reference like below en greetings hello hello helloagain greetingshello Has anyone run into this problem before anyone got any tips on how to exportimport translation values that reference other values I would like setup following I have user interfaces in my app Admin Teacher Client Admin and Teacher is English only Client is multiple languages I would like to run i ntasks missing so that for en locale it tooks everything into the consideration all interfaces have to be English for other locales de es etc it ignores missing with following setup ignoremissing admin adminmailer teacher teachermailer I dont need translations of admin and teacher in other then English language Thank you very much for any hint how to automate this task Given this code html foobarhtmlslim selecttag foobar optionsforselect data blankoptionlabel t formblankoptionlabel when i run i ntasks unused i see that formblankoptionlabel isnt used When i write it like this it works html foobarhtmlslim selecttag foobar optionsforselect data blankoptionlabel tformblankoptionlabel Any plans for supporing multilines within slim templates The fix described in issue It looks like rails I n defines British English locale as enGB which breaks the current requiredpluralkeysforlocalelocale method Usersmabellrbenvversions librubygems gemsi ntasks libi ntasksmissingkeysrb in requiredpluralkeysforlocale undefined method for nilNilClass NoMethodError Stepped through to figure out that it was engb that was not matching up properly in the hash leading to the nil hash accessing error above This ones a tough one to fix But this seems to work for me ruby def requiredpluralkeysforlocalelocale pluralkeysforlocale return pluralkeysforlocale locale if pluralkeysforlocalekeylocale pluralkeysforlocale locale pluralkeysforlocalelocale end private def pluralkeysforlocalelocale configuration loadrailsi npluralizationlocale if configuration localetosym nil alternatelocale alternatelocalefromlocale return Setnew if configuration alternatelocale nil return setfromrailsi npluralizationconfiguration alternatelocale end setfromrailsi npluralizationconfiguration locale rescue SystemCallError IOError Setnew end def alternatelocalefromlocale re w w match localematchre languagecode match countrycode match countrycodeupcase languagecodecountrycodefreeze end def setfromrailsi npluralizationconfiguration locale Setnewconfiguration localetosym i n plural keys end Ill open a PR later tonight Currently this library seems to use Google Translate API v Google provides a free tier of up to characters when using API v but not for v So it will be nice to upgrade easyinstall and then update i ntasks accordingly when ttpsgithubcomseejohnruneasytranslateissues is resolved It ignores datetime keys but the missing pluralisation keys still appear in the missing translations section Is there a specific rule needed to ignore pluralisations ignoremissing datetime activerecord date datetimei n number devise spree support time helpers Missing translations i ntasks v Locale Key Value in other locales or source pl cannotregistersamplescounting few many pl datetimedistanceinwordsaboutxhours few many pl datetimedistanceinwordsaboutxmonths few many pl datetimedistanceinwordsaboutxyears few many pl datetimedistanceinwordsalmostxyears few many pl datetimedistanceinwordslessthanxminutes few many pl datetimedistanceinwordslessthanxseconds few many pl datetimedistanceinwordsoverxyears few many pl datetimedistanceinwordsxdays few many pl datetimedistanceinwordsxminutes few many pl datetimedistanceinwordsxmonths few many pl datetimedistanceinwordsxseconds few many pl youareaddingitemsfromthetrolleycounting few many It would be nice if there was a command to get the word count of translation values This is useful for getting estimates from translators Hi Im using the command addmissing for keys generation but this also add the default keys like dateabbrmonthnames Can these be ignored I would like to use standard approach in custom validators of my model like that errorsaddbase mycustomerrormessage So it is automatically placed into the scope enactiverecorderrorsmodelsmymodelattributesbasemycustomerrormessage Can I somehow config the i ntasks to handle this translations
