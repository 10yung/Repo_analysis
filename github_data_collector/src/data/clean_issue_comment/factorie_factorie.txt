Hi Im trying to replicate findings of Singh et als Monte Carlo MCMC Efficient Inference by Approximate Sampling link Essentially it uses MetropolisHastings for entityresolution ER on the CORA citation dataset and shows a significant speedup if only a proportion of the factors are sampled In the paper the authors use Samplerank from FACTORIE to create the initial ER model Given that Ive never used Scala before learning statistics in R is there a way to port the model from FACTORIE to R If not how might I implement the proposal function sum of logscores of the sample factors where logscore is crossproduct of adjacent variables under consideration in FACTORIE Any advice with regards to methodology would be appreciated Huge thanks in advance Thank you for providing the implementation for topics over time I am reading the code here although I barely knows Scala and have two questions Please pardon me if I misunderstood the syntaxes Line val topic mean ArraytabulatenumTopicsi if topic timesilength mathssampleMeantopic timesi else If I am understanding this correctly you will give the value of to the mean of normalized timestamps for one topic if no tokens have been assigned to this topic Similarly in line you give the variance if this is the case May I ask why If I plugin the value and to solve alpha and beta it gives me alphabeta Line val timeSmoothing TensortabulatenumTopicsi val m timeMeansi mmmmmm I did not understand the smoothing step here Can you please elaborate on this and the following lines Thank you very much Hi When I try to define a factor template that have varying number of neighbors I got this error Exception in thread main javalangClassCastException ccfactorievariableSeqVariable cannot be cast to ccfactorievariableVectorVar at ccfactorieinferBPFactor

greatly appreciated Hey guys Im new to Factories Is there cubie for DecisionTreeClassifier so that I can serializedeserialize it I want to init ItemizedDirectedModel but I dont know how ot init this Object use addFactors Hi I was wondering if you are planning to officially support Scala Scala is out for quite some time now and a lot major libraries support it Any comment on this would be highly appreciated tldr I noticed that calling contains on CategoricalDomain has what I consider to be unexpected behavior and Im not sure why this occurs or how to fix it In my opinion domainindexvalue domaincategoriescontainsvalue and domaincontainsvalue should all return the same result but they dont as illustrated in the following slightlymodified version of TestCategoricalDomain val domain new CategoricalDomain String Listyes no domainfreeze assertdomainsize passes I added the following lines assertdomainindexyes passes assertdomaincategoriescontainsyes passes assertdomaincontainsyes fails It seems like its standard FACTORIE insider knowledge to just use one of domainindexvalue or domaincategoriescontainsvalue as a proxy for contains but I think itd be nice to either fix this issue or at least make it more obvious to the user that contains does not work so they should use a different method instead eg throw an informative UnsupportedOperationException My first thought was to submit a PR for CategoricalDomain with something like override def containscategory C Boolean indexOrNegativeOnecategory If I dont override the compiler finds a name clash because of type erasure if I do override the compiler says the method overrides nothing So the above is out unless someone knows how to Scala their way around it Im still not even sure why contains doesnt work in the first place and Ive been staring at the debugger for too long So I would welcome additional inputadvice on how to deal with this small but thorny issue Hi I am trying to compile the project with IntelliJ but I get Error not found type EnglishLexer new EnglishLexerreader tokenizeSgml tokenizeNewline tokenizeWhitespace tokenizeAllDashedWords abbrevPrecedesLowercase If I compile with the instruction from the README from command line it works but I would like to use IntelliJ Also how could I set the language of the NER parser to Spanish Regards For the TAC competition we should also view the html tags such as P or P as the line break
