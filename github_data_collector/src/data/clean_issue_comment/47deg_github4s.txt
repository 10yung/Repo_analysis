The following test is extremely flaky Is there a way of traversing with Pagination as explained here I could not find anything in the docs or code So far the only way I could find to do it is to look at the link header in the response headers But seems a very complicated way to do it since all tags are shown as a single string Link relprev relnext rellast relfirst Following along with sbtmicrosite Publish using GitHub s Ive created a token with the repo scope and have Enable SSOd which is required by my environment I was then able to use the Github API to perform some simple tests List commits for my repo List entries for a given tree Despite this when attempting to use publishMicrosite I get error Error committing filesGitHub returned an error Failed invoking with status body

despite supplying the token it doesnt work as advertised possibly in my SSO environment Any assistance would be appreciated Add support for endpoint userrepos as described in Fixes issue In listUserRepos the API called is usersuserrepos This seems to be the incorrect endpoint and be userrepos listUserRepos is documented to have a type parameter that can take the values all public private forks sources or member which seems to fit more or less with userrepos On the other hand usersuserrepos does not even has the value private or public for the type I guess there is a problem with the API being called Provide a general summary of your changes in the Title above Description Describe your changes in detail Adds ability to create a milestone using v API Motivation and Context Why is this change required What problem does it solve add functionality to create milestones so that sprints can be modeled with milestones at regular intervals If it fixes an open issue please link to the issue here How Has This Been Tested Please describe in detail how you tested your changes Include details of your testing environment and the tests you ran to see how your change affects other areas of the code etc Types of changes What types of changes does your code introduce Put an x in all the boxes that apply Bug fix nonbreaking change which fixes an issue X New feature nonbreaking change which adds functionality Breaking change fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change Checklist Go over all the following points and put an x in all the boxes that apply If youre unsure about any of these dont hesitate to ask Were here to help My code follows the code style of this project X My change requires a change to the documentation I have updated the documentation accordingly X I have read the CONTRIBUTING document I have added tests to cover my changes All new and existing tests passed Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above Add milestone create functionality Detailed Description Provide a detailed description of the change or addition you are proposing Context Why is this change important to you How would you use it How can it benefit other users automate milestone creation Possible Implementation Not obligatory but suggest an idea for implementing addition or change use same free algebra as other api resources Adds the create a fork op But when I try to write some tests for this pr it didt work I dont have too much knowledge working with cats but Im developing a pull request for creating webhooks While Im developing in a fork and the process of reviewingmergingreleasing my PR is ongoing Id like to temporarily publish my custom version to Bintray Ive followed instructions but still see two issues added licenses are ignored worked around by setting bintrayOmitLicense true still sbt publish tries to publish to osssonatypeorg ignoring bintray settings buildsbt looks complicated and it seems that temporarily added bintray settings are overwritten at the end
