Im using gitdeploy with Rails and while I have workarounds for everything there are a few things left to be desired and its not fully automatic like it should be assetprecompile task is now wrong because rails has done away with appassets For some reason I have to regenerate my secretkeybase every time I deploy I think this is my fault and Ive taken steps to remove the credentialsymlenc file from my repository so well see if this goes away Thanks mislav I use this stuff on everything Hi I have a private repo on bitbucket with multiple production servers whats the easiest way to one time push and automatically deploy to all of them Alexandersrc alexander git deploy setup r production Usersalexanderrvmgemsruby gemsnetssh libnetsshtransportsessionrb in initialize Objecttimeout is

and also changed many permissions and deleted the master branch It should probably warn against this Instead of them existing at deploy it would be good if you could specify a different directory instead currently you have to edit the git hooks with the new path Where is difference between gitdeploygitdeploy and mislavgitdeploy project Is it possible to use gitdeploy for different Rails environments on the same server I am currently using gitdeploy to deploy to my server in a production environment I would also like to create a staging environment on the same server but have no idea how to usesetup gitdeploy to also deploy to the staging environment in parallel
