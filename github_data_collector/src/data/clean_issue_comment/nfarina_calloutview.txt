 Description Added padding to subtitleView container height Tittle says it all I am wondering if I can set up a touch event using TapGestureRecognize on the calloutview or if there is any other method which has the same results Cheers Hey there I am wanting to increase the height of the view and display a multi line subtitle Is this is supported First off great component I was able to figure out how to change the contentViews background by adding a custom view However the background around the contentView along with the arrow is there an example on how to change that Doing something like this I lose the arrow SMCalloutBackgroundView test SMCalloutBackgroundView alloc init test layercornerRadius test setBackgroundColor UIColor redColor selfcalloutView setBackgroundViewtest I have been getting some crash reports that show the following objc Fatal Exception CALayerInvalidGeometry CALayer position contains NaN nan Is there a reason it would be returning NaN And is there a way I can detect this voidanimationDidStopCAAnimation anim finishedBOOLfinished BOOL presenting anim valueForKeypresenting boolValue if presenting finished if delegate respondsToSelectorselectorcalloutViewDidAppear delegate calloutViewDidAppearidself else if presenting finished self removeFromParent selflayer removeAnimationForKeydismiss if delegate respondsToSelectorselectorcalloutViewDidDisappear delegate calloutViewDidDisappearidself This delegate callback checks for finished I dont think it should Our use case is we are changing the callout visible on the map when the map isnt the frontmost view on the screen when this happens iOS is optimizing the animation and calling this delegate with finished NO This means the previous callout is never removed from the parent and will intercept any subsequent touches screen shot at pm Hi Nick Farina Thank you for this lovely project I need to ask if we can use this CalloutView with Mapbox For latest Mapbox SDK when i tried adding SMCalloutView it gives the linking error as duplicate symbols for various times And when I tried older Mapbox SDK it gave me RMAnnotationh file missing error Another question is how can we increase height of the calloutview I want to thank you for developing this nice replicate of UICalloutView I used these library years ago for iGolestan app now Im using again for another app I have designed a custom content view and layout the subviews with auto layout subviews are some UILabels which can shrink or grow based on their text length here is the final result I achieved smcalloutview with autolayout but problem is here SMCalloutView initially needs contentView frame but autolayouted contentView initially doesnt have any frame until self layoutIfNeeded gets called so I moved objectivec layout now so we can immediately start animating to the final position if needed self setNeedsLayout self layoutIfNeeded before objectivec size the callout to fit the width constraint as best as possible selfframeSize self sizeThatFitsCGSizeMakeconstrainedRectsizewidth selfcalloutHeight as you see in the below gif initially SMCalloutView doesnt correctly show callout display bottom arrow at top but after that callout appears correctly map do you have any idea how can I fix that Strangest thing when I start a session on my iPhone using a MapBox map and SMCallouts all annotations are very responsive as expected However as the session goes on the delegate still reads out a annotation gets touched but the callout takes longer and longer to appear This problem started surfacing around my update to iOS so it might be related Please let me know if you have any thoughts as it is driving me crazy Thanks
