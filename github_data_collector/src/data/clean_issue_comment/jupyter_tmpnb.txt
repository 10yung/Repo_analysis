On my EC instance I ran the quickstart instructions and all the Docker containers went up fine When I access my server through the browser the notebook comes up fine However when I go to create an new notebook I get the following Checking docker logs for that container yields the following W NotebookApp Blocking Cross Origin API request for userKUH vx MsASwapicontents Origin Host localhost W NotebookApp Not Found W NotebookApp POST userKUH vx MsASwapicontents xxxxx ms referer I am trying to use JupyterLab using tmpnb However I am facing some troubles setting it up To avoid duplication of content I am sharing the question I asked on Stackoverflow The question failed to get any response on Stackoverflow Can someone help me out If the proxy loses its routing table it can cause errors when spawning containers For example lets say I create an adhoc container with the user username Some time later the routing table is lost eg because of a new deploy If I try to use that tmpnb the proxy will route me to spawn another adhoc container because its not in the table However since it was created before it still is alive in Docker meaning that tmpnb will fail to spawn the container and will return a response Changing the LICENSE file to current language At least that seems to be the case on the demo server For reference Im referring to this functionality From jrisp on June Hi Im following this guide Ive set up a local installation for a workshop which works as expected Now I need to reverse proxy this installation with my Apache front web server to share public URL to users I need to reverse proxy like this Which implies final urls like for example But when Im doing my ProxyPath rule it always redirect to Is there a way to specify a subpath to jupyter tmpnb I dont know if Im clear ask me questions if needed BTW thanks for all your work on Jupyter Copied from original issue jupyterhubconfigurablehttpproxy Edit I have it working with dockercompose and the yml config but would like to understand what happened with socket connection refused issue Hi Jupyter team Complete Docker newbie here in action trying to deploy an automated tmpnb environment for PyLadies so please

In a vain attempt to fix this I tried changing the owner of dockerdock to ubuntu but that did not work Unfortunately searching for answers has not resulted in anything fruitful All tipscommentshelp will be super super appreciated Edit I should add that Ive run basic docker examples such as docker run helloworld and they do work ok I just tried to do the quickstart but alas it is not working The

dockerpy in requirementstxt or in Dockerfilealpine This is older package last version on pypi is from The newer package is called docker newest ver from Besides the ambiguous name docker package is incompatible with dockerpy I cannot find the list of incompatible changes maybe someone will have better luck I tried to use docker instead of dockerpy in Dockerfilealpine and got a lengthy trace of errors ending with such suggestion TypeError ContainerCollection object is not callable You might be trying to use the old pre API use dockerAPIClient if so If developers decide to use docker package in the future the codebase here needs to be adapted Maybe this is not a big task but I am unable to do it The jupyterhub wiki describes a way to start jupyterhub automatically at startup as a system service Is there a way to similarly host a tmpnb server automatically at startup preferably as a system service as well
