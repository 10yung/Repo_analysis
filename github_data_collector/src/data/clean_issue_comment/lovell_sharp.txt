installation please use instead Normally compositing works great but Ive been occasionally seeing the final composited image to just render the composite input overlay with a transparent background rather than with the background image This has only happened a few times and it has been pretty random but wondering if anyone else has seen this and if it could be a potential bug What is the output

Shell binbash Binaries Node usrlocalbinnode npm usrlocalbinnpm Languages Bash binbash Perl usrbinperl What are the steps to reproduce This seems to be happening randomly so its difficult to reproduce What is the expected behaviour I am trying to composite a background image with an arrow overlay Expected behavior is an image renders with the arrow overlayed over the background image Are you able

arrowBody toBuffer thenresult resolveresult catche rejecte Im using Sharp with Libvips library compiled with magick support Ive tested the conversion of some jp files to jpg and I dont realize why the conversion takes a long time when performed using sharp The conversion process using the convert program takes s convert Dante jp Dante jpg The conversion process using the Libvips library inside a Doker takes sec vips magickload Dante jp Dante jp jpg The conversion process using the sharp library inside a Doker with node x takes sec const sharp requiresharp sharpDante jp toFileDante jp jpg Since the sharp code should run in a lambda function and I have a constraint of sec on the Gateway timeout I ask if I can use some option to speed up the process The version used of sharp is and Libvips was compiled using the following libraries cairo croco curl exif expat ffi fftw fontconfig freetype fribidi gdkpixbuf ghostscript gif glib gsf harfbuzz icu imagemagick jpegturbo lcms nasm openjpeg openssl t orc pango pcre pixman png poppler svg swig tiff vips webp xml xslt zlib The Dante jp file is a M image with the following format magick identify Dante jp Dante jp JP x x bit sRGB u What are you trying to achieve Logreport libvips warnings when failOnError is flagged false Have you searched for similar feature requests Yes What would you expect the API to look like Unsure What alternatives have you considered Work around is to spawn sharp instance with failOnError flagged true record any error message and then to try reprocess with failOnError flagged false Is there a sample image that helps explain I can provide if required Did you see the documentation relating to installation Yes Have you ensured the platform and version of Nodejs used for npm install is the same as the platform and version of Nodejs used at runtime Turns out Ubuntu repositories were quite out of date and I was on npm Using this I was able to get it up to but there is still a discrepancy compared to Node which is on I realize this could be an issue If you are installing as a root or sudo user have you tried with the npm install unsafeperm flag I gave this a try and the previous error about missing my GraphQL dependency has disappeared It has not resolved the gatsby issue however What is the complete output of running npm install verbose sharp Have you checked this output for

sharpblankpng composite input img left top input img left top toFileoutputpng then consolelogdone catcherr consoleerrorerr Dear brandonaaron jo rexxars gasi wjordan What are you trying to achieve I am controlling some bitmap push button and need to generate on the fly a bitmap array each time a value parameter changed Bitmap structure of the push button is Size x That means to have array that means lines with bytes horizontal pixel as shown above Color bit Black xFF white x The first pixel starts from the top right corner And if you see the picture above I need to reverse the bits when sending to the button Use case generating bitmap array from a picture loaded from file bmp png jpeg with size x with bpp or bits per pixel and generate the bitmap array as specified above Dark is bit white nothing Use case generating bitmap array from a picture loaded from file bmp png jpeg and generate the bitmap array as specified above with resizing to x if possible keeping aspect ratio Height but bpp color even it is a picture wit bits per pixel Use case generating bitmap array of byte as show above in the picture size x with till lines with possible auto size position xy wrap space between lines and be possible to invert for each line separately the background Use case generating rectangle line circle with text depending of parameter like this Those pictures could be already generated ina bitmap array as template and with a value we calculate the pixel needs to be disabled or enabled Have you searched for similar questions Yes and most are forwarding to your npm Are you able to provide a standalone code sample that demonstrates this question No sample I generated manually the byte but I found some apps doing this but ould not access the code bitmap managerzip Are you able to provide a sample image that helps explain the question Yes Bit map data is stored in flash NOT RAM so the size of the flash will determine the number of bitmaps Each bitmap will occupy bytes of program memory space A in the bitmap will indicate a dark pixel unsigned char IS DBFRGBbitmap PROGMEM b b b b b b b b Line b b b b b b b b Line b b b b b b b b Line b b b b b b b b Line b b b b b b b
