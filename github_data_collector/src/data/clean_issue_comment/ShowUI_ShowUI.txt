For a UI I would Need to insert a additional row into a DataGrid I have tried this NewDataGrid Name DataGridTest ItemsSource colKonfig CanUserAddRows true Show colKonfig is a PSCustomObject The command Shows everything fine and I can edit items etc but I can not add a row Does somebody knows a Workaround Imagine the following code User ordered FirstName John LastName Doe BirthDate DateTime Age int GetInput User Show When run if you write on the age field you will get an error that it couldnt convert to an int Other types might also be affected Another bigger part of this bug which you might want to split into two is that the validation is performed on PreviewTextInput which will only trigger if the key is textual which means it will not trigger the event on things like space backspace delete CTRLC CTRLV etc This makes the validation really buggy because I could enter spacespacespace into the age field and it would only say it cant convert into an int when I add the To take things another level I could even paste in a string to the Age field and it wouldnt complain at all since no validation is performed It would even allow me to press OK and would return the string as a value of the Age field back to the user which is not intended There is currently a feature of all the controls where you can declare ControlName to try and make blocks of ShowUI that can be reused It doesnt work well and is confusing people keep using that when they mean Name A better approach would be to allow a scriptblock to override the GetValue results That way custom blocks of ShowUI wouldnt pretend to be controls but could still use custom logic to calculate their own value This will be a breaking change for Would it be possible for ShowUI to automatically focus the first named control when a window is shown so that we dont constantly have to do ShowUI OnFocus FirstFocus Hello Jaykul to continue the conversation from here I am picking up this project again the problem I am running into using the MahApps version is that the MetroWindow XAML is not valid and does not contain the MahApps Style You can see the missing assembly references when using NewMetroWindow OutXaml If i switch to the new update previous was it breaks my whole user interface there are many major errors in the new update eg when i set NewDataGrid CanUserReorderColumns true CanUserResizeColumns true CanUserSortColumns true it gives me an error like this SetWpfProperty Cannot find an overload for Add and the argument count Any plans to resolve this issue Suppose a simple tab control window guixaml Window xmlns xmlnsx xmlnsd xmlnsmc TitleMainWindow TabControl TabItem HeaderTab Grid Button Namebutton ContentButton Grid TabItem TabItem HeaderTab Grid Button Namebutton ContentButton Grid TabItem TabControl Window When loaded with ShowUIs XAML parameter button is not accessible Example guips ShowUI Xaml PSScriptRoot guixaml OnLoaded AddEventHandler button Click writehost Button was pressed AddEventHandler button Click WriteHost Button was pressed Output PS C Users Tough C data working tests guips Error in OnLoaded Event Handler on Window At line char AddEventHandler button Click The argument is null Provide a valid value for the argument and then try running the command again After importing the MahAppsMetro dll using the OutputXaml flag will out put the usual content and the xaml Also NewMetroWindow OutputXaml will complain that a window must be a root when it is
