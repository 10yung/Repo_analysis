 akka akkahttp sangriagraphql sbt graphiqlhtml Hi Finally here are some refactoring of the code to better work with latest akka After many tries I couldnt remove the use of the ActorPublisher for the event store because it is much more elegant to manage the buffer inside it and send events when needed as it is already implemented I tested using a Sourcequeue to decouple the buffering from the actor itself but then I had to take care of concurrency access to the actor state with respect to offer success Hope you like it I also did some cleaning to uniformise things in mutations and in the event store which were not really needed but now its nicer I think I can extract them in other PRs if you prefer Added WebSocket subscriptions The resulting code is pretty straight forward Let me know if you have any questions andor improvements
