I read that flux is not open source However this repository is confusing by saying Open source GUI for xflux It would be nice to mention that the xflux daemon is not open source Usually I only install open source software to prevent spyware but I installed this app by mistake since it was misleading If someone has a suggestion for an open source alternative it would be nice also When setting eg an external displays brightness via xrandr or brightnesscontroller the new settings gets immediately reset to the original value Stopping flux before doing that will eliminate the problem Using fluxgui from the PPA and Ubuntu Before opening a new issue for a bug please Check that youre not experiencing an existing issue In particular Issue is very common Install xfluxgui from source if you used the PPA and the PPA is stale This is easy to do and ensures your issue isnt already fixed Thanks Hi fluxgui geeks how to run it on raspberry pi Raspbian OS I installed it manually like on README described piraspberrypi fluxgui fluxgui GdkCRITICAL gdkwindowthawtoplevelupdates assertion windowupdateanddescendantsfreezecount failed Errno Exec format error Critical error Exiting fluxgui GtkCRITICAL gtkmainquit assertion mainloops NULL failed rootuser sudo addaptrepository ppanathanrenniewaldockflux GUI for flux Bugsfeature requests should be directed to I do not develop this only provide a PPA More info Press ENTER to continue or Ctrlc to cancel adding it Hit disco InRelease Get discoupdates InRelease kB Hit disco InRelease Hit disco InRelease Get discosecurity InRelease kB Ign stable InRelease Hit stable InRelease Get discobackports InRelease kB Ign disco InRelease Hit stable Release Hit disco InRelease Err disco Release Not Found IP xxxxxxxxx Reading package lists Done E The repository disco Release does not have a Release file N Updating from such a repository cant be done securely and is therefore disabled by default N See aptsecure manpage for repository creation and user configuration details Hello I just tried to install from source flux It actually works only when i use xflux l g r k nofork in the CLI BUT when i try to launch the GUI i get this error message fluxgui GtkWARNING Theme parsing error gtkcss The style property GtkButtonchilddisplacementx is deprecated and shouldnt be used anymore It will be removed in a future version fluxgui GtkWARNING Theme parsing error gtkcss The style property GtkButtonchilddisplacementy is deprecated and shouldnt be used anymore It will be removed in a future version fluxgui GtkWARNING Theme parsing error gtkcss The style property GtkScrolledWindowscrollbarswithinbevel is deprecated and shouldnt be used anymore It will be removed in a future version Traceback most recent call last File usrbinfluxgui line in module from fluxguifluxapp import main File usrlibpython sitepackagesfluxguifluxapppy line in module girequireversionAppIndicator File usrlibpython sitepackagesgiinitpy line in requireversion raise ValueErrorNamespace s not available namespace ValueError Namespace AppIndicator not available Im using Arch Linux Linux pcpc MANJARO SMP PREEMPT Sat Apr UTC x GNULinux and i have all the python dependencies it needs Love to get some insight Thanks After installing and opening it it gives the message The flux indicator applet needs to know your latitude and zipcode to run Please fill either of them in on the preferences screen and click Close Thing is I cant click or type anything in the preferences screen because when I click OK to close the message box the preferences screen goes away too Theres been no progress on for two years and now xflux doesnt work on either of the computers I the fluxgui maintainer use regularly On the other hand redshiftgtk works great on both those computers So Im thinking that either fluxgui should be abandoned until xflux is fixed or we should add a Redshift backend Is there some benefit to continuing this project when there is a viable alternative in redshiftgtk and seemingly no future for xflux Thoughts Pull requests Hello Would you consider making flux as snap package so that it can be installed on any Linux distro Ive also heard that starting from Ubuntu will be all snap packages instead of current deb packages
