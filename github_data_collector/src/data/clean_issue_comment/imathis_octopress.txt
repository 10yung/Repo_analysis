LINK PARSING XSS RedCloth Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a crosssite scripting XSS attack This flaw exists because the program does not validate input when parsing textile links before returning it to users This may allow a remote attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary script code in a users browser session within the trust relationship between their browser and the server Affected versions All versions Fixed versions Identifier CVE Solution Upgrade to latest version Credit Kousuke Ebihara Antonio Terceiro Sources About a year ago I asked on Twitter for an upgrade guide for Octopress to Octopress I felt like the documentation is either missing or not locatable Will you be adding the documentation for Octopress specifically some sort of

default theme from the previous version of Octopress I am considering uninstalling v and installing v albeit I anticipate gem version grief Any advise for this octopressjekyllgems newbie will be much appreciated BTW It is difficult to determine whether what I read on the web is or is not applicable to v My default assumption is that it is not Thank you for your help I get the following error when
