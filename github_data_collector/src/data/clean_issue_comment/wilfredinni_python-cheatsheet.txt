I think theres some ambiguity in the current wording for continue Statements Current wording is When the program execution reaches a continue statement the program execution immediately jumps back to the start of the loop To me the ambiguity is that it might be interpreted as saying that the loop starts entirely again as though it had not yet been started Less ambiguous might be When the program execution reaches a continue statement the program execution skips directly to the start of the next iteration of the loop if there is one or more remaining bypassing any other code remaining in the current iteration of the loop Ive been reading through the guide and was a little confused by the dedent clarification Just thought one or two more lines here may be helpful about dedent function and why the strip method was used on the print function Python dataclasses Python attrs they are not part of the std from dataclasses are but really really make the code much more readable They are less seen in the wild but really useful to maximize code compatibility Add a new topic to the cheat sheet Classes
