I am currently using FakerinternetsafeEmail and its producing invalid results Right now I have an email address of examplecom returned from that method so something is going awry Ive seen similar when using the plain Fakerinternetemail method except in that case it was missing everything after the Im using Xcode b although this happens under and GM as well When I try to install Fakery using Xcode SPM it throws an error when trying to clone Nimble errortxt Is there something we could do or we just have to wait for Nimble to get fixed I am working with Server Side Swift and want to use Fakery for testing But no matter what locale I use I keep getting a JSON file for de locale was not found error I installed Fakery via the Swift Package Manager using the Packageswift file The swiftversion DSL that was first introduced in CocoaPods has now been expanded to support multiple Swift versions This helps pod authors and gives consumers more flexibility when it comes to choosing which version of Swift to use when consuming a pod The current structure a single enjson file makes it difficult to contribute to this repository When there is more than PR pending once the first one gets merged it always creates mergeconflicts for the one after Hi first of all thanks for this library Id like to report an issue postcode generation is not returning proper values Im using the fakeraddresspostcode method in order to generate random postcode but this is what i get as a result APRUWYZ AHKY I ABEHMNPRVWXY X ABDHJLNUWZ Best Tib It would be really nice to have a feature to setup Fakery with a seed to guarantee the generation of same data on every reseed with same value In case of data generation for UnitTests or UITests this would be a really helpful feature to avoid the usage of static string literals inside the tests Are there any plans to add new features When I try to generate a first name using the ru localization I receive first names for the en localization When I use trTR localization for generating first name I get error JSON file for trTR locale was not found I use version Hi The default random image provider LoremPixel is currently unavailable response Could you consider to switch to another random image provider Thanks
