 Expected Behavior The following code at line of AppKitExtensionswift is referencing elementInserted where it should be elementUpdated swift if changesetelementUpdatedisEmpty reloadDataforRowIndexes IndexSetchangesetelementInsertedmap element columnIndexes IndexSetchangesetelementInsertedmap section Checklist x Reviewed the README and documents x Searched existing issues for ensure not duplicated Description Since the identity component of Differentiable is semantically identical to the new Identifiable protocol in Swift I think it would be beneficial to align the two APIs Motivation and Context This allows us to easily conform to Identifiable as well as Differentiable through a single implementation Proposed Solution Separate Equality ContentEquatable and Identification ContentIdentifiable component through the use of protocol composition for Differentiable Align the API of ContentIdentifiable to that of Identifiable See for implementation details This may be an Apple bug but if anyone has time to give me pointers in diagnosing the root cause I would appreciate it Im seeing a crash failed to demangle witness for associated type DifferenceIdentifier in conformance DifferenceKitArraySectionTapestryProgressSection DifferenceKitAnyDifferentiable Differentiable from mangled name DifferenceIdentifier A Kit DifferentiablePQz The crash trace says it occurs in this line let changeset StagedChangesetsource selfdata target newData And inside that this line null in diffA BsourcetargetuseTargetIndexForUpdatedmapIndexupdatedElementsPointernotDeletedEleme The crash only seems to occur on iOS x devices specifically the old iPad Minis so possibly the key is that it is bit The crash does not occur in builds that are directly loaded from XCode onto a device only on builds that are processed in TestFlight or the AppStore My guess is that this is therefore an Apple bug in how they are recompiling for older devices But if you have the time to offer any clues or hints as to the root cause of the bug so I can try and work around it that would be very much appreciated Great This template thing completely removed what I wrote
