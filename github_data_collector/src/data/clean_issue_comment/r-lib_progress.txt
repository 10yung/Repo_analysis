The example packaged linked to in the C API section no longer seems to exist Hi there I often use basereplicate for simulations but not knowing when my replication will end was killing me Therefore here is a simple rewriting of basereplicate that can use your progress bars For instance librarydplyr replicatepb rnorm pastemean sd This might need some rewriting to conform to your standards naming etc but I thought it could be interesting Kudos for this wonderful package Dan I used progress in a package because I expect it to mostly be used in interactive sessions However I want to make a demo with Shiny for an upcoming conference and I dont see a good way to capture the printed bars and show them in the app I tried using solutions like but only got r printed in my HTML element I could rewrite my package to check for the context and if its Shiny instead of interactive switch to using the Shinynative progress bars but thats not the best solution Are there any straightforward ideas Im missing here Im starting to use Rstudio server and found that progress bars fail to print correctly This is what Im getting r pbartest function pb progressprogressbarnewtotal for i in Syssleep pbtick pbartest pbarserver As a sanity check the same testing function works properly on my local instance pbarlocal Rstudio Server version is if that helps I dont admin have access to update it unfortunately I played around with this question on SO My solution that I packaged there wraps around progress and allows one to use either of the following syntaxes pbfor for i in DO SOMETHING pb progressbarnewformat Something bar percent elapsed pb for i in DO SOMETHING It uses some quirks of the R language but it offers an intuitive interface and avoids the current issue of having to type things You can find more by following either link above The code might be too weird for this package but if you think it might have a place here its yours to take and tweak This is a kind of reboot of this issue I opened up on cli My symptoms with progress are similar to those I describe there ie I have bulk text blowing up my REPL because the progress bars are characters long I use this setting because it makes printing of dataframes and tibbles nicer in ESS So right now I have this in my Rprofile options cliwidth width It would be nice if I could limit the progress bars to chars Hello I get this warning trying to get slot new from an object class R ClassGenerator that is not an S object in RStudio and R version in MacOS Mojave It seems that the packages does not support Jupyter notebook yet Can you please add such a feature Summarizing a Slack discussion progress should provide more centralized support for client packages that expose a logical argument that controls whether progress should be displayed We need a helper we can call as the default strategy and it will have a lot in common with this function Ive nicked from readr r showprogress function isTRUEgetOptionreadrshowprogress user disables progress bar interactive an interactive session isTRUEgetOptionrstudionotebookexecuting Not running in an RStudio notebook chunk isTRUEgetOptionknitrinprogress Not actively knitting a document Related to my readxl usage of a common progress bar spinner actually for a couple distinct steps Could we ever update the format of an existing progress bar Or maybe in the simple case of a spinner
