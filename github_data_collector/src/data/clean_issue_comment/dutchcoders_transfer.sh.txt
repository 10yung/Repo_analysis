Please help me to install this source to Heroku and integrate with Google Drive in If you want to use TLS using your own certificates set tlslistener to forcehttps tlscertfile and tlsprivatekey replace tlscertfile with tlscertfile This could allow multiarch supporting using docker buildx At the very least it enables support for ARM by building on an ARM device References With this PR transfersh has native bindings to the Storj network Previously it was using the S backend and proxying the data through a S Gateway aspacca If needed i can grant access to the Beta Network to try it out I would appreciate a throughout test Hi there This pull request tries to add helm chart feature for transfersh I have currently deployed this chart in my testing cluster Let me know in case of any changes required Server storage crypt uploaded file and tar for securty When download request file untar and decrpyt and send data to user Its supports Gdriver like will it support Google Cloud StorageGCS Only slightly related to After I uploaded a file using curl H MaxDays is there a way to seelearn how much more time until the file is destroyed I would have expected to see that at XEncryptPasswordXDecryptPassword headers work seemingless as in gpg piping shell examples This is the proposal mentioned in At the moment the processes in the Docker containers run as root This is a security problem as Dockers isolation is not perfect and theres a lot of exploits that could make a root user break out of the container its way less of an issue for some random users which are ideally not existing on the host system Some links I picked up quite some while ago I dont have the time to fix and test this right now PRs welcome I guess Some drawbacks I experienced earlier which I dont want to withhold might be useful for the person creating the fix When changing the user ID of the processes in the container the existing volumes whether its a named one or a bind mount to a local directory will require a manual upgrade changing the owner Users trying to use a mount bind might experience issues especially when that mount is already created but its owner is not set to the Docker processs user ID If I should remember any other ones Ill post them here You can make it easier for anyone if you pick a very high user ID for the Docker container processes anything above should suffice
