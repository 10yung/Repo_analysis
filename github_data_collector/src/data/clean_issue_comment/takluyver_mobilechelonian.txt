At the moment the display canvas seems to be anchored as the output of the code cell that creates it It would be useful if the canvas could float be dragged around the notebook so that as a script is built up over several cells each step can be inspected in turn without having to try to scroll back to the display canvas to see whats happening There is an example of a floating canvas in this old notebook turtle repo Hi guys I observed another strange effect when moving the turtle to close to the edge of the drawing area This code example stays away from the borders and looks like I would expect If I use the same code but now extend the line length to hit the edge funny things occur As you can see not only the starting angles of the lines are messed up They should have almost the same degree between them which they do not have Also the degree turn at the end of the first line is far away from being degrees consistently This makes it completely unpredictable how a drawing will look when you come close to the border even once during the drawing process Any suggestions Regards Pascal Hi guys I observed a problem with the title in the corner Moving the turtle closer and closer to the wall results in unpredictable movements In the following example I expected three parallel lines but the closer I move the turtle towards the edge of the drawing board the higher an angle of error I receive What makes it even strange and even more unpredictable is the fact that these unexpected angles CHANGE when I change the length of the forward move In the next example I reduced the forwardmovement to steps an receive a degree error in the drawing of the line starting at Any ideas on this Can you solve this or explain what should be done in order to circumvent this problem Regards Pascal Im curious if anyone has gotten this to work using JupyterLab rather than eg jupyter notebooks Im installing it using cd opt git clone cd mobilechelonian python setuppy install in my setup docker zero jupyterlab setup When running the example I get Error creating widget could not find model which appears to mean I havent done a jupyter labextension install but even if I do that doesnt work Not certain what Fine Manual to read to offer a patch since i havent authored ipywidgets or jupyterlab widgets before I found this module extremely useful for online teaching using Jupyter notebook However there are a lot fo turtle functions not supported It would be great if add more functions to this package In particular position setx sety If you give it a left or right command that has lots of decimals then the turtle performs this action but hangs and will not respond to commands afterwards In my case I can recreate this by wont work tright tforward will work trightnpround tforward Hello maybe I am too new to python It doesnot do anything in jupyter When I run the example with from turtle import Turtle from my python installation it is ok If I use the same in Jupyter TclError no display name and no DISPLAY environment variable With from mobilechelonian import Turtle it is just silent On printt it says mobilechelonianTurtle object at x fa dc eaf so something happens Some inline directive is missing maybe Thank you
