Is it possible to customize the shape and content of a node And also where can I found true documentation about this project From myself Video of bug Process for video I first show that under normal circumstances links from outport to outport as well as loose links are forbidden I then execute a MOUSEUP out of the Canvas we can see that the DragNewLinkState is maintained even though it shouldnt be I then show that even clicking on a port new MOUSEDOWN without a Canvasvalid MOUSEUP happening beforehand this actually creates a loose link I try to delete it the loose link my software crashes this is not projectstorms problem but my underlying model a loose link doesnt create a correct data structure and there is an unhandled null on the target port basically The issue is the survival of the DragNewLinkState in a broken way when MOUSEUP happens out of canvas From Renato Bohler Video of bug Two loose links are created One from source port to the point of the target port but the link is not actually connected to the target port Another from the target port to point seems to be the same issue as perhaps the difference here in the creation of this second loose link is that loose links are forbidden for the software behind video but not video Process clicked hold and dragged any source port released click outside of canvas clicked on any target port It seems that two consecutive MOUSEDOWN actions are causing troubles on DragNewLinkState logic just a guess I am trying to use hook to set up engine File AppDiagramjs import React useEffect useState from react import createEngine DiagramModel DefaultNodeModel from projectstormreactdiagrams import CanvasWidget from projectstormreactcanvascore import AppDiagramcss const AppDiagram function getDefaultEngine var engine createEngine var model new DiagramModel enginesetModelmodel return engine const engine setEngine useStategetDefaultEngine const buildEngine setup the diagram engine var engine createEngine setup the diagram model var model new DiagramModel A create a default node var node new DefaultNodeModelNode rgb var port node addOutPortOut node setPosition B create another default node var node new DefaultNodeModelNode rgb var port node addInPortIn node setPosition C link the nodes together var link port linkport add the models to the root graph modeladdAllnode node link load model into engine enginesetModelmodel setEngineengine useEffect buildEngine return div CanvasWidget engineengine classNamecanvas div export default AppDiagram I got the two nodes draw However when I tried to drag the nodes Its very slow and almost not response I were building a kind of complicated app with list of nodes to drag into diagram Each node came with some attributes Serialized to save and derserialized back from database with contextredux I sorted out all messes and almost done But I just found both useState useReducer kill the performance Hi guys There is a way to disable all interactions except move pane or zoom Thanks Hey guys The issue which this PR fixed is still persist for drag and drop functionality you can check it also in storybook Could you please help with this Thanks Used latest versions for library such as projectstormreactcanvascore beta projectstormreactdiagrams beta projectstormreactdiagramscore beta Cant resolve emotioncore in nodemodules projectstorm reactcanvascore dist should emotioncore be added to the packages for reactcanvascore or is there a reason for keeping it clean I understand that devs may choose to use other ways of styling but the package falls over without it related incase of mutating diagrams the window scrolls to the top automatically Is there a possibility to have input nodes share a link with overlapping segments being link and the split point being different link I am trying to do process flow diagram and divide the links into segments I have a strange problem I have a react frontend with antd integrated I tried creating a view by following the instructions at linkaddLabelHello World doesnt compile It complains saying linkaddLabel is not a function So I comment out that line and then it stops complaing But now I have a strange problem the CanvasWidget mounts but the node and node are not displayed They are present in the DOM though See attached image reactstormerror
