 spin is no longer actively maintained Details Status unmaintained Package spin Version URL Date Unaffected versions The author of the spin crate does not have time or interest to maintain it Consider the following alternatives both of which support nostd conqueronce lockapi a subproject of parkinglot See advisory page for additional details Per the spec Verify that a scope parameter is present and contains the openid scope value If no openid scope value is present the request may still be a valid OAuth request but is not an OpenID Connect request Yet Im using this with Dex and Ive configured idtoken as the only scope and its working Otherwise it waits until its midsigningin someone and then panics and exits What is the recommended way in Rust to verify the JWT that Portier sends I am currently accessing the RSA public components n modulus and e exponent from but then what Id like to use but jsonwebtoken can only read DER encoded keys currently and the other Rust JWT decoders all seem to have the same limitation Any ideas As a grumpy sysadmin I have been able to avoid rust but unfortunately get more grumpy when presented with just install the toolchain and no mention of the dependencies Might be helpful to add a dependencies section for people to run through just before they type cargo install portierbroker and get discouraged by what is a really excellent project Documentation is hard you have to write it in a form that acknowledges the other person is intelligent but have zero experience of what your unique sorry Rust is not used by the build environment is Personally I find a formula that works is either shell script that just does it so the instructions can say run sh buildsh and those interested can dig into the script verbatim walk the user through what needs typing it rarely is much as you can see below though Ubuntu seems broken with its own distributed cargo so worth noting sorry you gotta curl sudo sh Preflight Debian aptget update aptget y install noinstallrecommends buildessential cacertificates curl gettext libssldev pkgconfig curl sSf sh devstdin y source HOMEcargoenv cargo install portierbroker Ubuntu aptget update aptget y install noinstallrecommends cacertificates cargo gettext libssldev pkgconfig cargo install portierbroker NB does not build as parkinglotcore implodes with use of unstable library feature threadlocalstate state querying was recently added see issue This error message needs some context ERRORtokioprotostreamingpipelineclient pipeline error end of file reached before parsing could complete Its my guess that a discovery HTTP request was interrupted somehow I tried to auth using a custom domain setup to use gmail auth but it dropped back to mail loop The matrix protocol is the most promising attempt at fixing email Would anyone in the portier project be interested in doing it with matrix Or can anyone let us know how much work it might be Note Ruma is an alpha rust server Itd be nice to have an API monitoring endpoint that does a quick check of Redis and SMTP connections We could formalise vertxt as this But Im also guessing the thing should be optional and disabled on the public broker It would be great if the broker were installable via the package manager of linux distros out there There could be an AURpackage a gentoo overlay or a build script in the main repo a PPA or an official debian package and so on See also We should add An example systemd An example OpenRC script An example cron key rotation script see For key rotation we should mention the effect of keysttl on clients with cached keys OpenRC
