Hello Im not sure if this as issue or just me When using SadConsoleSettingsToggleFullScreen with a desktop set as x the screen goes blank for a few seconds and then the window will be minimized onto the taskbar After that there is nothing you can do to get the screen back up If I alter the desktop resolution to a smaller resolution x full screen toggle works fine Using the window maximize button works fine also at the high resolution Kind regards Twoshrubs The scrollbar doesnt behave correctly when there is less content to scroll than height of the scrollbar In my case it takes around of the height of the scrollbar to scroll from my second last content line to the last content line Im not sure if this has something to do with SadConsole MonoGame or XNA but my console does not use the keyboard layout that my OS uses which is definitely the behavior I would expect It seems to be either hard coded to American layout or determine the layout from my OS display language I user Windows with Danish keyboard layout and American UI language Not sure if its already possible but it would be great to be able to overlayplace and if possible with zindex an image such as a PNG JPG GIF etc on a console or on a cell I find WindowMessage and WindowPrompt very useful especially as placeholders during the early stages of my projects But they cannot handle a very common use case string input So heres my idea but take it as you will since Im not extremely familiar with the library yet I would suggest adding a new dialog that contains a TextBox control and lets the user type in a simple string It can be confirmed either by pressing enter after typing or by clicking on the confirmation button and canceled by clicking on the cancel button It has two callbacks one for validation and one for handling the result As long as validation fails the dialog cannot be confirmed but it can be canceled The validation callback could return a ValidationResult object basically a bool string Tuple indicating whether the input string was valid and if not why Upon failed validation the why would be displayed above the textbox control The result handling callback would get the result string upon confirmation and null upon cancellation Id imagine the declaration to look something like this c public static void AskColoredString message string confirmBtn string cancelBtn Actionstring resultCallback StringValidationValidator validationCallback StringValidationNone ThemesLibrary library null And heres a mockup of the StringValidation class c public static class StringValidation

pictures into a console Also is there a documentation how to use the ascii renderer A code sample which adds a ascii rendered picture to a console thx for your help and the great product Is there any builtin way to create a multiline InputBox aka InputArea Supposedly it would have a maximum height and automatically add a scrollbar when theres too much text to display at once Also thank you for creating SadConsole From my understanding the SDL package for mac needs to be installed but while the console lib is compiling fine the example just will not run Is it possible to get a quick write up about how to build run on MacOS I tried setting the SadConsoleSettingsUnlimitedFPS flag to true right before the SadConsoleGameCreate line in the SadConsole starter project however the FPSCounterComponent I added is still showing the FPS as locked at see code below Its been quite a while since Ive used that flag but I believe this used to work C class Program public const int Width public const int Height static void Mainstring args SadConsoleSettingsUnlimitedFPS true Setup the engine and creat the main window SadConsoleGameCreateIBMfont Width Height Hook the start event so we can add consoles to the system SadConsoleGameOnInitialize Init Hook the update event that happens each frame so we can trap keys and respond SadConsoleGameOnUpdate Update Start the game
