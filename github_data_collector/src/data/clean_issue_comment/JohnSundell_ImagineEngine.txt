Firstly Id say sorry to ask question here I read the Timelineswift file there is a private Node class in it But I didnt see anywhere outside invoking it So could you help me to understand the usage of the Node Many thanks Issue This change adds an Xcode template for generating Imagine Engine game project for tvOS Just a headsup Ive never actually created a project template for Xcode before so thought it would be nice to try it out and also contributing a little bit Running the Asteroid Blaster tutorial in Xcode playground doesnt render scene Had to search on google for Playground live view is black and found a StackOverflow answer that fixed my issue Visit PlaygroundPagecurrentneedsIndefiniteExecution true Hi John Im resuming work on my platformer and am trying to figure out the best way of determining if a user is in contact with a blockactor in a group My usecase is I have my player who will walk off the edge of an obstacle When he walks off the edge I want to get a notification that hes no longer in contact with the ground so that I can apply gravity See GIF for my current behavior gravity Ive accomplished this by adding the following methods to Actor swift public func isInContactwithBlockGroup group Group Bool for block in blocksInContact if blockgroup group return true return false public func isInContactwithActorGroup group Group Bool for actor in actorsInContact if actorgroup group return true return false I have a plugin that watches for rectChanges and flips a flag which changes gravity behavior swift actoreventsrectChangedaddObserverself scene player stuff in if playerisInContactwithBlockGroup selffloorGroup if selfisGrounded selfisGrounded false Is there a bettermore efficient way of doing this If not Id be happy to open a PR with the change Hi I just tried gave ImagineEngine a try and followed the Walkabout tutorial Somehow Im seeing weird behavior when I click on a horizontal axis right of the player see attached gif Sometimes the player just jumps to the topleft corner of the scene To be sure that this isnt a bug caused by me I copied the content of FinalCodeswift and it still happens Afterwards I modified the code to print some stuff

statements when the bug occured click horizontalTarget verticalTarget playerposition click horizontalTarget verticalTarget playerposition click horizontalTarget verticalTarget playerposition Somehow the position of the player is when it should be Its quite easy to reproduce by clicking topleft of the player and then twice on the right side of the player as in the gif and seen in the logs playerjumpingtopleft There must be a way to run scripts from project template and do pod install or swift build Worst case this could be in the tool chain pre scripts I have done similar stuff for AngularJS and Google Closure in XCode utilizing PLOVR Also how does XCode compile pods such as ImagineEngine Does it just cp this to the app bundle as if it was an so or does it recompile skipping all the parts not used in the my project Anyone know how to add Playground template to XcodeTemplates When Creating new Project I get in iOS section a new iOS Game under the Imagine Enginesection yet I believe it would be cool to have Image Engine Game as template for New Playground A copy of ApplicationsXcodeappContentsDeveloperLibraryXcodeTemplatesFile TemplatesPlaygroundGamexctemplate may or may not suffice not sure where to put my very own custom playground template file however I would like to rotate Actor with UIImage to rotate around a defined pivot point but I have not been able to find how to achieve this When I tried to find a solution the best answer was this What I am trying to achieve demo Issue OK it may be that its more a code review request rather than an actually pull request but still Having a discussion is also great Since we want to look for higher resolutions first we need to set a maximum limit for the scale The maximum screen scale value allowed Its used when there are no assets for textures in proper scales are found private let maxAllowedScale Int IntScreenmaxScreenScale Ive added that to ScreenmaxScreenScale but there may be a better way to do this Also there most probably is something I havent understood in the tests and I may have broken them Or fixed them There is an issue with loading a texture without having created an image it starts looking for other resolutions and thus adding more filenames to imageLoaderimageNames and Im pretty sure there should be a better way I may have missed something obvious
