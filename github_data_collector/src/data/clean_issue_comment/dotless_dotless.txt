Hi There Is there any way to install dotless in net I am getting below error Could not install package MicrosoftExtensionsDependencyInjectionAbstractions You are trying to install this package into a project that targets NETFrameworkVersionv but the package does not contain any assembly references or content files that are compatible with that framework For more information contact the package author I need dotless on WineLinux as a dependency The latest version in is dotlessv zip uploaded on Sep Versions and versions are missing Please upload compiled versions I cannot use Nuget or compile myself dotless since Im on WineLinux I require download packages Any way to fix the dependencies Its trying to install like System dependencies Started in doesnt seem to have this issue Description When LessParse is called with a DotLessConfiguration whose StrictMath property is set to true the CSS contains evaluated calc expressions Steps to reproduce Change the test fixture of StrictMathNoParenthesesLeavesExpressionUntouched to a LessParse call var css LessParsewidth calc px px new DotLessConfiguration StrictMath true Expected behavior css width calc px px Actual behavior css width calc px Cause This change of behavior was introduced in db b dae d f de e a a e where the new constructor of the LessEngine with the DotLessConfiguration parameter does not pass the StrictMath property to the other constructor overload From this page The examples are inconsistent One has add namelesshandler typedotlessCoreLessCssHttpHandlerdotlessAspNet pathLESS verb While the other has section namedotless typedotlessCoreconfigurationDotlessConfigurationSectionHandlerdotlessCore They should both be either dotlessCore or dotlessAspNet For version its dotlessCore but it took me an hour to figure this out Please specify the correct name to use depending on which version of the package is being installed PS My nuget package manager only see as the latest version Im using ASPNET Is the latest version not published to the nuget repo In dotlessSampleWeb Project Siteless file I added a Set Variable as follows windowsizes sm px md px lg px it failed to compile less file

a complex but valid CSS one and other online less compilers seems to be OK with it So it seems to be dotless related I have attached the whole concatenated less file if necessary everythinglesstxt Do you think there is a way to handle that Thank you for your work Kind regards JeanChristophe Chalt I have problems with supporting some LESS features that works perfectly with lessjs boxshadowshadow rest when not shadow false boxshadow arguments when you try to compile the code above using dotlesss it shows a compilation error Running transformation wrong number of arguments for boxshadow for on line in file myless boxshadowshadow rest when not shadow false see In following commit Dependency on MicrosoftExtensionsDependencyInjection for net was changed from to Why Well now running app after upgrade dotless from to gives following exception SystemMissingMethodException Method not found SystemIServiceProvider

config at This happens because return value of this method was changed in following commit and thus downgrade from to ruins compatibility in binary assembly Currently there is no way to supply and instance of a logger you can only pass through the type that you want instantiated and then the DI framework will create a singleton of it It would be nice if you could pass through an instance so that you can trap errors thrown for a specific instance This pull request adds that feature
