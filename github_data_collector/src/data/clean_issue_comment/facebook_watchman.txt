This step uses the Github Releases action PLEASE NOTE While merging this PR make sure to also add a GITHUBTOKEN environment variable for this repository in the repository Settings page Closes I tried to download the latest windows binaries on But When I click the link and try to download the downloaded file changes everytime I have tried many times all failed Could we publish the files in the github release It is more easy for downloading Here I am trying to use watchmanmake to run tests on file changes watchmanmake root feed exec p py run tox My project is called feed exec and I used the root argument to keep changes to tox and egg files from being picked up otherwise it would constantly rerun because tox would trigger itself except it still triggers itself because tox touches the feed execversionpy file on build I cant figure out a way to use watchman in this use case I did manage to use watchman this way watchman watch feed exec version watch homeanarcatsrcfeed execfeed exec watcher inotify watchman j EOF trigger feed exec name test expression pcre py command tox v appendfiles false EOF version triggerid test disposition created But thats really kind of nasty and it doesnt show the actual output of the commands I need to tail this arbitrary file in tmpanarcatstatelog to get any idea of whats going on And worse all the colors are gone from there So it would be great and so much simpler to have watchmanmake support more complicated patterns It looks like the patternstoterms function is where the action happens Note that I noticed that I could make that file hidden prepend path name with a dot but those files are notoriously hard to import in Python so Id rather avoid that Thanks in artifacts dropdown size of mb is shown actual download says mb in safari download list shows zero bytes in finder double clicking on it shows either no files in subdir or you get a permissions error and zip wont open using macos catalina latest production build When on the installation page and following the install instructions below I come to a page on github Clearly this is an error on githubs side they should not give me a if Im not logged in they should ask me to log in But until they have sorted that out it would be nice if watchman supplied a workaround Suggestion Clarify on the install page that you need to be logged in to github to be able to access the actions section Im using Gits fsmonitor tool with Watchman to speed up performance when there are many files However after using the repo Im unable to delete it without closing the watchman process on Windows There must be an open handle somewhere still Im using the watchdel command to remove the watch but the handle still is not closed watchman watchlist version roots CgitForTestssrc rm rf ForTests rm cannot remove ForTestssrc Device or resource busy watchman watchdel CgitForTestssrc watchman watchlist version roots rm rf ForTests rm cannot remove ForTestssrc Device or resource busy handleexe grep B ForTests cmdexe pid DESKTOPLE SIE stole File RW C git ForTests src watchmanexe pid DESKTOPLE SIE stole File RW C git ForTests src The cmdexe process reported by handleexe is the background runner that is running watchmanexe as a child Im struggling to read the code and connect the dots especially because Ive failed to build it locally I see that FileDescriptor has a destructor that will clear the handle and that should be part of the destructor for WinDirHandle which extends watchmandirhandle What I dont see is any connection between the code in watchlistcpp and those types If it helps it is important to note that a query must be asked of watchman in order to trigger this failure This Python test may demonstrate the bug WatchmanTestCaseexpandmatrix class

watchman gives watchman watchman error while loading shared libraries artifactslinuxliblibglogso cannot open shared object file No such file or directory After some guessinggoogling what technically not sure if its correct works is while in the same bin directory doing mkdir p artifactslinux mv lib artifactslinux Ie just put the libs at the artifacts path it was looking for Now watchman almost works but I get watchman T watchman while computing sockname failed to create tmpfbcodebuildergetdepsZhomeZrunnerZworkZwatchmanZwatchmanZbuildZfbcodebuilderinstalledwatchmanvarrunwatchmanstephenstate No such file or directory Im going to fallback to the nonbinary installfromsource route Hi First off all let me say thank you for maintaining awesome docs for watchman they are really thorough and are greatly appreciated However when I was recently familiarizing myself with watchmen Ive noticed that it took me a long time to get a solid understanding of the big picture It looks like the docs do a good job at providing a comprehensive reference but dont have a guidelike page which talks about all the concepts of watchman and how they relate to each other I might want to use watchmen in rustanalyzer an experimental language server for rust and for me it is important to understand how watchman works as a whole rather than to figure out how to do a specific thing like running a command if a css files changes Here are some concepts which I struggled with painting clearly in my mind clocks roots especially what happens if a set of roots changes dynamically guarantees that are provided by watchman ie initial scan makes sure that no file is missed ways to interact with watchman it is a daemon but the docs mainly talk about CLI tool but theres also a socket interface I think that the pages which helped me most were It would awesome if there was a centralized document which talks in brief about each one of them Hello may I use regular expressions to ignore files or directories
