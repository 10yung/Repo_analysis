I have VectorDrawable resource and it has to paths that I want to add strokedasharray to using this library but I dont if thats possible or not and how to do it if it is in fact doable each path has a unique name if that helps Thanks Feature Request I need to manipulate a PathData by rotating it into position BEFORE adding it to a Node think compass needle animation The Needle is kept at heading and needs to be rotated to its starting point before animating to its end point The method is there to convert from PathData to Path but need viceversa Its be great if I could apply a dynamic ColorFilter to individual Path elements within a VectorDrawable and AnimatedVectorDrawable usecase I have a button made up of multiple layers one of those layers is brand related and changes depending on the context of the screen Applying a ColorFilter to the whole drawable affects all layers so the white playpause button on my coloured background is also modified Itd be great to be able to use a LayerDrawable with Kyrie where each layer could be an animated vector drawable and setting the progress on the LayerDrawable would scrub each of the layers accordingly Add a builder that takes an existing vector drawable resource as input to manipulate This would allow Kyrie to be used with MotionLayout Only question is what the behavior of this method should be with infinite animations In other words a method that allows you to scale the duration w a float
