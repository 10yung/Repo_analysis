When updating to on our staging env we found that app was failing to start because there was an ssl error on the mongo connection This is actually ok and should be the default behavior but is a breaking change as the driver on doesnt complain or fail about this ssl issue and renewing the certs fixed the connection problem Should we add a disclaimer under breaking changes about this Seriously need help here I was migrating my Meteor project from to x but to no success Then I am at now Though I managed to overcome the possible incompatibility issues to no more however when I try to run as localhost main page turned blank I believe something not write but any clue how could I effectively troubleshoot it Below shows how the HTML looks like when viewing source html head titleWEB CRMtitle

similar to my situation suggested fix was updating nodesass to from Hi there Cant migrate to due to apollo package installation failure Meteor is trying to compile fsevents to install apollo which is

COMPILATION WARNINGS Hi Guys after several tryouts Id like to post this issue here as well maybe someone faced same issue After successful running I am unable to upgrade Meteor to Following console output is shown meteor update allpackages Errors while initializing project While loading package angularcompilers error Command failed Usersusermeteorpackagesmeteortool z r xaw bqososxx webbrowserwebbrowserlegacywebcordovamtososxx devbundlebinnpm rebuild updatebinary Cannot download HTTP error Not Found Im not sure where to update this dependency nodesass is outdated but I cant find the package which is related to this pinned version of but maybe its even a total different issue Anybody facing this issue as well Thanks This reduces the amount of EJSONclones in the live query system a lot This basically does things Removed unnecessary deep clones when passing data to the CachingChangeObserver Add a way to tell the multiplexer which observeChange handles do not mutate the arguments and therefore do not require a deep clone This makes the biggest difference since by far the most observeChanges come from cursor publications and these do not need deep clones since the DDP liveserver already deep clones the data This should still have the same guarantees when you use the public API Packages which modify the internals of Meteor may break the assumptions which make this optimization possible I verified this is not the case for Kadira and redisoplog Here is an example you can run which logs the amount of clones saved for a simple use case open the app in a couple of tabs and click the button a couple of times the server console will log the difference in EJSONclone calls As described here Im having to comment out a line of copywwwbuildstepjs shellrmrf pathjoindstDir embeddedmobileprovision to get the play button of Xcode to install the app on my device for debugging Here are excerpts from my support issue with Apple that isolated the problem Please provide a descriptive title for your feedback Xcode wont run debugger on iPhone due to wrong A valid provisioning profile for this executable was not found error Which area are you seeing an issue with Xcode What type of feedback are you reporting IncorrectUnexpected Behavior Details What version of Xcode are you using Xcode GM Seed Xcode Description Please describe the issue When I buildrun my App in Xcode on my connected iPhone Plus the app builds successfully installs and then does this see full error message below It works in the iPhone simulator Unable to install Vium App installation failed Code Failure Reason A valid provisioning profile for this executable was not found Please list the steps you took to reproduce the issue Note Ive done all of this a million times over the past two years and except when there are Xcode bugs or real provisioning issues it works Open the Xcode workspace that was generated by a meteor run ios device command Set the signing to accepted values Hit the BuildRun button to install and run the app on my connected wired or wifi either one iPhone What did you expect to happen I expect it to install and run the app as it does successfully on the simulator What actually happened After all the buildinginstalling progress messages instead of running I get a popup with nothing but Failed to install Vium If the phone is locked it does all of the building then waits for the app to be unlocked then provides this error popup Apple Nov at AM After reviewing your feedback we need more information to continue our investigation Please capture a sysdiagnose from your device and attach it here Please also attach a copy of your app that reproduces the issue if possible Can you please reproduce this and then copy your app from your DerivedData directory and attach it to this bug report I d like to take a look at the embedded profile Apple After reviewing your feedback we need more information to continue our investigation The attached app doesn t contain a provisioning profile Can you still reproduce this If so can you attach your project file we don t need sources and a full build log make sure you are viewing all content of the log using the scope buttons at the top of the window before exporting Apple Dec at PM After reviewing your feedback we have some additional information for you The build log shows the profile being copied

Meteor has been finalized and recommended its time to get started on the next minor version Meteor This PR needs its own branch release so that we can continue to merge small changes like package updates directly into devel without having to wait for the Meteor release Also its important to keep all beta n version bumps on the release branch so that packages published from devel will not accidentally depend on beta versions of other packages Most PRs should continue to target the devel branch and we will regularly merge devel into release but never the other way around This PR targets the master branch so that we can see exactly what has changed since the last Meteor release regardless of whats on devel When this release is finalized we will merge it into master and then merge master into devel as usual If youre working on a PR that should only be released with Meteor such as anything that depends on Cordova feel free to target the release branch directly Heres the current list of noteworthy PRs that will be included in Meteor x Update Cordova version from to x Allow to exclude web architectures in development mode via excludearchs x Update MongoDB to x Update Nodejs to v and npm to v Drop support for bit Windows leaving only bit Mac Linux and Windows TBD To help test Meteor before it is released please first update to Meteor by running meteor update andor meteor update allpackages and verify the stability of your application Commit those changes so that you can roll back later if necessary Once youve done that check this PR for the latest betan version and then run sh meteor update release betan in your application with n replaced by the appropriate number If you discover problems with Meteor feel free to comment here for guidance and be sure to include betan in your issue titles Debug APK works perfectly but APK release simply freezes and doesnt give any errors Cordova plugins cordovaandroidsupportgradlerelease cordovapdfgenerator
