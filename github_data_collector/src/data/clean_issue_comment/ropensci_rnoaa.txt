potterzot for the next milestone no rush eg gefstimes and gefsensembles were introduced in but its not clear what they do they are in gefs tests though so thanks for that in addition current parameters could use more explanation for examle for you have additional parameters passed to the connection maybe you could say what kind of parameters users could pass in and how ie in a named list some other way to avoid situations like in this is needed For all fxns that use caching throw a message probably when a cached file is being used probl dont throw any message when a HTTP request is made to get new data when using a cached file would be good to include in the message the created or last modified date of that file so the user can think about whether to delete those cached files or not with a lot of requests messages could get annoying have a flag to turn cached file messages off probably do not want this on by default since then were back to where we are now with users possibly confused about why theyre not getting up to date data Im not sure if this really belongs in the issues or the forum since its more a feature request than a bug but here it goes In some cases stations are missing a lot of data making the autoplot of a meteocoverage object very misleading For example r libraryrnoaa libraryggplot Site SafeHarbor USC get data dat meteopullmonitorsmonitors SafeHarbor keepflags T var cPRCP TAVG TMAX TMIN autoplot plots from first to last date ignoring gaps obscovr meteocoveragemeteodf dat autoplotobscovr Alternative plot showing gaps unique dates mindate mindatdate maxdate maxdatdate dates dataframedate asDatex seqDatefrom mindate to maxdate by day join the original data to all the unique dates temp dplyrfulljoinx dates y dat bydate templocation SafeHarbor dummy column for plotting tempsize NA tempsize whichisnatempprcp plot with gaps in coverage ggplottemp aesx date y location size size themebw geomlineshowlegend F Cool newer from dataset combining interpolated data from multiple sensors for sea surface height and sea surface height anomaly Datasets look easily accessible ftpeclipsencdcnoaagovpubibtracsv r provisionalnetcdf to future proof for future govt shutdowns ftpftpncdcnoaagovpubdataswdistormeventscsvfiles open issue in vcr Hi Scott ASOS one and minute data would be an excellent addition to the rnoaa capabilities Ruben Behnke rubenbehnkesdstateedu PS Im not trying to give you a ton to do lately but rnoaa has so much potential via rjbehnke via rjbehnke
