security fix PRs for this repo from the Security Alerts page details Hello I keep getting this error when trying to open live view on single screen Capture Capture explored some around and found this issue Based on best answer of the issue these are the changes which has to be done windowSimulatorjs Lines if projInfodevServerScript start const child spawnnpm start cwd projInforootPath childstdoutondata data globalmainWindowwebContentssendstart simulator Simulation for reactdevserver else if projInfodevServerScript run devserver let child spawnnpm run reactideserver cwd projInforootPath childstdoutondata data globalmainWindowwebContentssendstart simulator childpid Became if projInfodevServerScript start const child spawnnpmcmd start cwd projInforootPath childstdoutondata data globalmainWindowwebContentssendstart simulator Simulation for reactdevserver else if projInfodevServerScript run devserver let child spawnnpmcmd run reactideserver cwd projInforootPath childstdoutondata data globalmainWindowwebContentssendstart simulator childpid Walla now it works Capture Conclusion Windows os has to spawn npmcmd and not npm which is fine for other os mac v Mojave Screenshot at Title pretty much says it I have seen in places saying just run npm run reactideserver but says it does not exist I think I cannot see my component tree its empty what should I do By default the readme will build a MacOS binary Added instructions for MacOS Linux Windows for clarity For those users that are not as technically proficient as they could be it might be worth pointing out that they will need to modify the following line in packagejson to allow the electron packager to complete As is it will attempt to build a package for Mac OS which will fail on Windows machines Modify this line as follows electronpackager electronpackager overwrite platformwin archia prunetrue outreleasebuilds Electron module methods are been imported already import the electron as named import rather than calling the require every time when a module is been already
