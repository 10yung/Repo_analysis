When I try to remove the last element of a list I expect rlist to return an empty list list However it errors out Is this by design lista c rlistlistremovea Error in applym L any dimX must have a positive length Both your rlist and pipeR packages look ultrainteresting but I am failing to understand exactly how different they are from other packages namely magrittr and purrr I do not understand for instance how pipeR differs from magrittr Similarly I would appreciate a comparison of how list operations differs in purrr and rlist as well as a discussion of how well both packages might work together if they accomplish different things Last and this is purely cosmetic but how about making aliases with underscores in function names eg listfilter in order to have your package blend nicely with packages in which underscores are used to separate the package prefix from the verb eg stringr Thanks in advance for your time and again congratulations for writing up these interesting packages Please see example below I tried listmap and listfirst Im pretty sure it applies to most of the functions Im wondering if this is an expected behavior Having a NULL as the first element of the List of List could happen when I am saving the interim filtered result Applying listclean before any operation I want to do seems to be a bit excessive Can you suggest a better way of handling my situation t lista NULL b listx y clistx y z t listb listx y clistx y z t listmapy Error in evalexpr envir enclos object y not found t listmapy b c t listfirst NULL t listfirst x y Hello and thanks for providing this package I find myself constantly in the need of updating a list with another list like a b c b would add c to the first list and update b to I do the following functionold newlist forname in namesnew ifname in namesold testing for identical here allows to NOT remove NULL element if we update with same NULL element if identicalold name new name old name new name else this allows to ADD not update with listmyNameNULL else it would remove the element as listsomething NULL is same as delete old cold new name returnold Id like to use your package for similar functionality but cant find it in the vignette DO I missed it If not would you consider adding similar functionality Quite often we have R objects instead of lists and we want to access a particular field of a list of objects But this package doesnt seem compatible of doing it Here is an example x listA listbalance B listbalance listmapx balance track setRefClassAccount fields listbalance numeric y listA tracknewbalance B tracknewbalance listmapy balance Error in dots L L object of type closure is not subsettable Hi renkunken Thank you for this very helpful package I was wondering if there is any plan to add mutating capabilities in rlist For instance shouldnt be possible to listupdate inplace eg after doing this yyy listfoo lista b listupdateyyy a a have the following as the result printyyy Text foo fooa foob Sysinfo sysname Darwin release version Darwin Kernel Version Tue Sep PDT rootxnu RELEASEX nodename harryzhulocal machine x login harryzhu user harryzhu effectiveuser harryzhu R version R version Fire Safety Copyright C The R Foundation for Statistical Computing Platform x appledarwin bit R is free software and comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY You are welcome to redistribute it under the terms of the GNU General Public License versions or For more information about these matters see uname a Darwin harryzhulocal Darwin Kernel Version Tue Sep PDT rootxnu RELEASEX x After I install rlist from github I got the error like title puts Need your help devtoolsinstallgithubrenkunkenrlist Hi I was experimenting on d radar package and encountered the following transformation need Im wondering if rlist has a more efficient way of achieving the same The approach might have wider application as its json like Thanks mtcars addrownames var key mutateeachfunsrescale key limit to rows for manageability head byrow functionrow list key row key values lapply namesrow matchkeynamesrow functionnm list axis nm value row nm Here is an enhancement aa listAc Bc results in a dataframe A B NA NA The example provided by timelyportfolio should be very helpful
