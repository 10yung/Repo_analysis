Description Describe your changes in detail This PR wants to support more Julia plot packages in RMarkdown document like PyPlots Related Issue if this closes an issue make sure include eg fix or similar or if just relates to an issue make sure to mention it like Example if introducing a new feature or changing behavior of existing methodsfunctions include an example if possible to do in brief form If the PR is finished then things like using PyPlot use x linspace pi in Julia x range stop pi length y sin x cos x plotx y colorred linewidth linestyle titleA sinusoidally modulated sinusoid should give a plot in a julia chunk in an RMarkdown document Did you remember to include tests Unless youre just changing grammar please include new tests for your change I can run the following code

Julia by juliasetup in each R parallel process Hello I had the same problem as issue failure by setupsame message and also some brutal hanging But I also had success setting up JuliaCall on another install of R on the same machineI can post the logs if needed All in all I have and Only works That installation is special it is referenced in my windows path variable and is also the target for such instructions as R CMD install Does that help IF THIS INVOLVES AUTHENTICATION DO NOT SHARE YOUR USERNAMEPASSWORD OR API KEYSTOKENS IN THIS ISSUE MOST LIKELY THE MAINTAINER WILL HAVE THEIR OWN

general summary of your changes in the Title above Description Describe your changes in detail Explore the possibility of supporting arrow in JuliaCall Need to use Arrowjl as a dependency Add Arrowjl as an optional dependency Add R package arrow as an optional dependency x Have a simple implementation for vectors may involve copies at the current stage Set up the CI tests Related Issue if this closes an issue make sure include eg fix or similar or if just relates to an issue make sure to mention it like is about the efficiency of data transfer betwen Julia and R The mechanism currently involves data copying in the transfer process Since we have mechanisms provided by arrow and Arrowjl it is natural to try to figure out a nocopy mechanism in JuliaCall Example if introducing a new feature or changing behavior of existing methodsfunctions include an example if possible to do in brief form Did you remember to include tests Unless youre just changing grammar please include new tests for your change Kind of like Condajl it would be nice if JuliaCall could install its own version of Julia Julia version at location D Julia Julia bin will be used Loading setup script for JuliaCall Error in juliacmdpaste BaseincludeMain systemfilejuliasetupjl Error happens when you try to execute command BaseincludeMainDRR libraryJuliaCalljuliasetupjl in Julia To have more helpful error messages you could considering running the command in Julia directly How can I fix this error I often experience R session abortion but not every time when using JuliaCall for caculation but could not figure our the exact reason Last time when I want to quite R and hit ctrl d I get the waring like bellow but not the usual questiong asking me to save R work space I have no idea what it
