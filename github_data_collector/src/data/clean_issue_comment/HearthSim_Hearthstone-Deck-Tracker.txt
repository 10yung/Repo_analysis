monitor last known team should display on screen when mousing over individual opponents in battlegrounds Actual Behavior Most HDT features display as expected including the Battlegrounds tier list but the last known teams overlay does not display If I swap to windowed mode and keep the window anything smaller than maximized the overlay displays as expected Steps to reproduce behavior Launch HS via

nonattackingfriendly hero are immune HDT should not exclude Misdirection as it doesnt trigger because it has no valid targets Ideally we count the valid targets all nonattacking nondefending nonimmune entities and only exclude Misdirection if that count is larger than zero Actual Behavior When attacking the opposing hero HDT incorrectly excludes Misdirection as a possible secret even if all other possible targets are immune Steps to reproduce behavior Play against a friend Have them play Misdirection Make your hero immune through eg Time Out Attack the opposing hero with the only minion and observe HDT greying it out LogScreenshots Every time I start hearthstone deck tracker one of a couple of things happens Typically I get a message prompting me to run both programs as an administrator because they have different permissions If not that then it opens normally and goes into no deck mode but will not come out of no deck mode unless I close hearthstone My deck tracker has also stopped updating any new decks Ive made Ive done fresh reinstalls and scanned hearthstone for errors I have confirmed the correct locations for log files and doublechecked the permissions of both programs through my antivirus I have also just disabled the antivirus Nothing seems to work Also I do not code but cant find any information on this that has been posted recently This all started when HDT got an update for galakrond interactions and stuff Expected Behavior What did you expect to happen The tooltip reads boardhand yet it only works for minions on the board Hovering over a card in your hand

not change anything apart from adding an appropriate message to the log I took a look at the git repository but all recent changes look harmless to me I tried wine rc with and without staging patches I also killed my wine directory and reinstalled everything but it still hangs Could this be caused by some server changes To reproduce Install corefonts and dotnet winetricks corefonts winetricks

problemfeature request Please delete any obsolete sections from this template before submitting your issue I think a turn timer could be useful for figuring out how powerful you should be on any given turn You can track the early turns with gold but after gold they start to blur together I recall this was a feature in the original HDT for classic hearthstone so I was thinking maybe this could be done if theres enough interest for battlegrounds too Bug report Expected Behavior Tracker should add copies of Jade Idols when played with Keeper Stalladris active Actual Behavior Tracker adds copies
