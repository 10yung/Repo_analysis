plugin is not installed Install the HTTP plugin ionic cordova plugin add cordovapluginadvancedhttp I have ensured that the plugin has been installed by running both the commands ionic cordova plugin add cordovapluginadvancedhttp npm install ionicnativehttp and removing the Android platform and rerunning the command npx cap add android but I run into the same issue Expected Behavior Describe what the behavior would be without the bug Migrating an ionic project to capacitor and including the cordovapluginadvancedhttp plugin to be able to successfully make HTTP calls within the application Sample Code or Sample Application Repo NA Reproduction Steps Please explain the steps required to duplicate the issue especially if you are able to provide a sample application Take an existing Ionic project which makes use of the cordovapluginadvancedhttp plugin Migrating the project to a capacitor project Running the built application on a device and attempt to make a HTTP call with the plugin Other Technical Details npm version output node version output v pod version output iOS issues only NA Other Information List any other information that is relevant to your issue Stack traces related issues suggestions on how to fix Stack Overflow links forum links etc Not currently listed as a known incompatible plugin in the capacitor docs use same duration for long and short toasts on ios android and web closes make short the default on all platforms make android and ios actually use the duration option I used this test app to test the toast duration inputPlaceholder is set as text so users have to remove it before typing it should be a placeholder that automatically gets replaced when you start typing since it might be considered a breaking change Ive added it to the milestone

issue is created check one or more boxes for the platforms this bug affects x Android iOS Electron Web Current Behavior Last week i implemented push notifications with FCM via Android native functionality and PWA It worked without a problem Today I tried again and i got the following error message in my console Msg ERROR Error Uncaught in promise FirebaseError Messaging This browser doesnt support the APIs required to use the firebase SDK messagingunsupportedbrowser FirebaseError Messaging This browser doesnt support the APIs required to use the firebase SDK messagingunsupportedbrowser After closing the app and removing the app storage in the device settings it works fine again Only after a reinstall of the app it will return to the error seen above I console logged DeviceInfo On first app install the platform is set to web After removing the storage of the app the platform changes to android like it was before the issue My app will try to register PWA notifications when web is returned If android is returned it will send a FCM token to my backend that saves it Expected Behavior I expect it to implement the Firebase SDK after first installation of the app and registrate for Android Push Notifications I also expect DeviceInfo to return android as platform after I installed the app Other related information My project uses a external url to load the app To do this my Capacitorconfigjson looks like the following on the website itself everything works fine appId comdialogPocapp appName buildangular bundledWebRuntime false npmClient npm webDir www cordova server url My app uses the generated service worker from Angular My app also registers FCM for PWA in this generated service worker Code that i use to register my app for FCM

there should be more information please let me know Add plugins Wechat auth login and pay Alipay auth login and pay Currently android done Describe the Bug A clear and concise description of what the feature request is Please include if your feature request is related to a problem The problem I am having is that when I schedule a local notification for a future date the notification will be displayed with the time the local notification was created as the timestamp not the time the notification was scheduled Platform Leave these checkboxes EMPTY until after the issue is created Once the issue is created check one or more boxes for the platforms where this feature should be added Note that certain features may not be supported on some platforms ie no web API is available etc x Android iOS Electron Web Rather than simply calling callsuccess on iOS as soon as a user requests permissions regardless of result this adds a completion that allows the user to await the result in their app and passes back the response or error Also adds an unregister method in case the user wants to stop the app receiving push notifications Most plugin docs have an Example section and every one of them is different Some of them use the plugin inside a class Some of them use the plugin inside an async methodName which is not proper javascript Others use the plugin API directly Some plugins dont have an Example section The docs should be consistent in the code samples
