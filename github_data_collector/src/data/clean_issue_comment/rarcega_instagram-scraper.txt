Fix issues Fix help message for argument proxies There is how to save the metadata information separately from each file Not all information in a single json file Is it possible to add the ability to limit to scraping between location and tag Having the location be a checked before downloading the media would be one way but this may make the process slower due to the asynchronous nature of the program I just want to download metadata to analyze the information posted by Instagram users At the moment it takes too much time because you have to share images and videos Next time you only need to download metadata Is it possible to add a likes argument so the program will only scrape content that has been liked by the loggedin user This is more a question than an issue Although Ive been doing some tests I couldnt understand if the use of lateststamps implies that the destination directory is always emptied in every new query In the OPTIONS section in the readme the lateststamps description specifies This allows the destination directories to be emptied whilst still maintaining history I am willing to do one query per hashtag per day during a week Every query should add only the new media in the destination directory and the new metadata should be added to the file hashtagjson The query I am using is the following instagramscraper myhashtag tag includelocation mediametadata profilemetadata comments cookiejar cookiestxt latest lateststamps timestampstxt Thanks for any help Im not sure what this error is or why Im getting it The login information I provided works as I used it to login into my IG account after trying to run this script What isnt working here When trying to download a private profile its giving error to verify account and cancels download immediately I am following that account which I am trying to download like this link
