I am working on clinical time series forecasting with different architectures including wavenet I came across your wavenet blog post very informative and reproduced the work However I get an error using a codebase with the wavenet model I have tried several times but cant find a solution Please advise Thank you ValueError Error when checking target expected lambda to have dimensions but got array with shape The code is very useful and explained in a very effective way I have one question why the validation error is lower than the training error which seems to be counterintuitive I very much appreciate your insight regarding this Hi First thank you for this incredible job Do you have the requirementstxt file of the environment specification I mean the packages and python version such that I can produce the results Appreciate your help in advance Hi Joseph Thanks for posting this notebook about WaveNet implementation in the context of pure timeseries forecast It is very helpful for me to understand the model However I have the following questions about your implementation in the notebook Why is there no activation function applied to the Conv D layers It looks like all nonlinearity of the model comes from the last fully connected layer Should the dilationrates be according to the diagram Since only last output values are used in the calculation of loss can we truncate the input sequence encodinginterval to the width of the receptive field without affecting training Thanks Hi Joseph Thanks for such a precise notebooks I am wondering are you planning to use attention as part of LSTM to see if it does better Thank you for such a interesting and effective method Im toying with single time series with multivariate input and multistep output Can you direct me to right ways to construct model for my case is it always better for convnet to see entire time series at once how about splitting one time series for multiple training inputs also should I use convnet D instead of D for multivariate time series Im sorry if what Im saying makes no or little sense Im still learning Thank you so much for making your work public
