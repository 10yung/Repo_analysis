Thank you for your excellent work During the style transfer which epoch checkpoint should I choose It seems that no difference can be seen between the generated image on different epochs Hello I would like to learn about Local Max Pooling LMP but I cant find it in all the files Could you please tell me where it is Thanks Hello which version of tensorflow do you use I installed the version but when I run python trainspgandemopy datasetmarket duke gpuid I got the errorImportError libcudartso cannot open shared object file No such file or directory How can I solve it the details Traceback most recent call last File trainspgandemopy line in module import Utilsops as ops File homexiaozhenzhendataLearningviaTranslationSPGANUtilsopspy line in module import tensorflow as tf File homexiaozhenzhenanaconda envstfspganlibpython sitepackagestensorflowinitpy line in module from tensorflowpython import File homexiaozhenzhenanaconda envstfspganlibpython sitepackagestensorflowpythoninitpy line in module raise ImportErrormsg ImportError Traceback most recent call last File homexiaozhenzhenanaconda envstfspganlibpython sitepackagestensorflowpythoninitpy line in module from tensorflowpython import pywraptensorflow File homexiaozhenzhenanaconda envstfspganlibpython sitepackagestensorflowpythonpywraptensorflowpy line in module pywraptensorflow swigimporthelper File homexiaozhenzhenanaconda envstfspganlibpython sitepackagestensorflowpythonpywraptensorflowpy line in swigimporthelper mod imploadmodulepywraptensorflow fp pathname description ImportError libcudartso cannot open shared object file No such file or directory Failed to load the native TensorFlow runtime See Environment Pytorch Python Titan XP Problem I trained directly on the dukemtmc dataset and tested it on the market dataset MAP Top I trained on the duk market dataset and tested it on the market dataset MAP Top I downloaded duke market on your sideThis is somewhat inconsistent with the description of the paperThe reid model is referenced you help meThank you When we try to train the baseline using trainIDEResNET baselinesh we get an error saying that this directory dataimagenetmodelsResNet caffemodel was not found We only found a readme file in imagenetmodels We were wondering if we are supposed to add an ImageNet pretrained ResNet caffe model in this directory If so could you provide a link or tell us where to find it Thanks Hi I notice in your paper you have calculated the multiplequery settings But I cant find the code HiI use CycleGAN to generate images from Market to DukeBut the results are badI find the results in your paper are niceCould you tell me some parameter settings eg epochlearning rateimage size Hi I have some questions about your Direct Transfer results in Table in your paper I make the setting consistent with yours but I cant get sohigh baselines like rank mAP when train on market and test on DukeMTMCreID Actually I always got this result around rank mAP And this result is better than those in the where this result is that rank mAP I wonder that is there some tricks used in your experiments and Im looking forward to your reply
