Greetings I have a proposal to make project compatible with static linking Having gb in nodemodules is not suitable for many cases I managed to compile project with static linking and run simple test However this is not the first attempt to build nodejs native modules and I know how many troubles it usually causes I did it in linux ubuntu bindinggyp main changes are below Crusial part for GCC it never works because the order of libs counts in gcc libraries node installparseEnvjs OPENCV NODEJSLIBRARIES and in the conditions sections I added OSlinux librarydirs echo OPENCVLIBDIR echo OPENCVLIBDIRbuildrelease rdpartylib libraries lopencvcalib d lopencvdnn lopencvfeatures d lopencvflann lopencvhighgui lopencvimgcodecs lopencvimgproc lopencvml lopencvobjdetect lopencvphoto

llibtiff llibwebp lquirc lzlib I used external opencv build without IPPIW support however I think it is possible to have it worked build script usrbinenv bash export OPENCV NODEJSDISABLEAUTOBUILD

NanSetPrototypeMethodctor splitChannelsAsync Split to NanSetPrototypeMethodctor splitChannelsAsync SplitAsync Thanks David I am trying to compile using the DBUILDLIST cmake flag via the OPENCV NODEJSAUTOBUILDFLAGS environment variable through the packagejson since I only want to install the core imgproc imgcodecs modules but in the end when I look at the libs folder it is only installed the core module This is what I have in my packagejson opencv nodejs disableAutoBuild autoBuildFlags DBUILDLISTimgcodecscoreimgproc Is there another way to compile only those modules in the description of the compilation it tells me that they were installed but when I look at the variable cv in nodejs I only show the core module and when I look in the folder nodemodulesopencvbuildopencvbuildlib only the module is core What I can do Hi Is it possible to use library with pkg Harel Bumps handlebars from to details summaryChangelogsummary Sourced from handlebarss changelog v November th Bugfixes fix

enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing
