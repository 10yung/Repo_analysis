I have an app that uses MKRingProgressView Loop diabetes app and I want to get familiar with making changes to the code and figure MKRingProgressView is a easy place to start Is there a way to recompile only the framework cod without xCodes deletethenreinstall for the entire app Or at least without disrupting whatever resident information the app has left on iOS actually Im currently using the app and if I delete it it clears out the address information of the current insulin pod Omnipod is linked This might not be the right forum to ask this I currently have the progress view in a table view cell The progress value sets correctly but there is no animation despite using UIViewanimate Other animations work fine It seems that upon reloading the cell animation works correctly Error this application or a library it uses has passed an invalid numeric value NaN or notanumber to CoreGraphics API and this value is being ignored Please fix this problem I notice rings blinking when I put them in collection view When I reload data cells are reused and updated with the new progress However I can see that the ring is presenting the old values and its progress is updated after few miliseconds Im still debuging this but it seems to be connected with MKRingProgressLayer trying to animate the progress even though its not in a UIViewanimate Is there a future release planned with OSX Support This is the line that crash let ctx CGContextdata data width w height h bitsPerComponent bitsPerComponent bytesPerRow w bytesPerPixel space colorSpace bitmapInfo bitmapInforawValue Im trying to use the example application with the Xcode and iOS GMs here and seeing significant performance differences between the two On my mid inch MacBook Pro the example app absolutely flies working perfectly pretty much Meanwhile on my s Plus its dropping frames left right and centre I tried messing with the usual suspects clear memory low power mode etc but device just keeps dropping frames I know theres a performance difference between simulator and device but it usually tends to be in the devices favour especially with graphics stuff Theres also an OpenGL simulator bug in the GM which might be at play here Any ideas for increasing on device performance I tried but cant seem to find any way to toggle CPUbased rendering like with CIContext for example Thanks I am using this ring progress view inside a collection view When i start scrolling the collection view and the collection view creates another cell it is not smooth I used instruments to see what could be the problem and i noticed that the heaviest function was the method contentImage in the MKRingProgressView class Can you please try to see if is there any way to improve performance Thank you
