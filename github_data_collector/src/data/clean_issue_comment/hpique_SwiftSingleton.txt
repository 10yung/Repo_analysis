Can you provide this code for Swift Changes init to be private in READMEmd Its already private in the swift example file Hi I came along this interesting repo as I was looking for the best way to implement a singleton pattern in Swift As Swift also supports static properties called Type properties in the Apple documentation for structs Im just wondering if this would be an even better solution The advantage Im seeing is that structs as opposed to classes also allow to define static variables directly so there is no need to define a constant like sharedInstance the struct itself could serve for this purpose And as long as you dont define any nonstatic members it would still be a singleton Or am I missing something here EDIT I think I can answer myself The struct approach would not allow to pass the struct over in method calls as it is possible with the sharedInstance singleton instance of the class And if a shared instance of the struct would be created it would be handed over as a value type hence effectively copying it instead of referencing it Am I right
