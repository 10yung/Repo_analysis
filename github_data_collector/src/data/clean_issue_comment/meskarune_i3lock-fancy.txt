de dffe b cb d addb daf a e c fixed the leak of tmp files Il appreciate a lot seeing it land on Debian Thanks a lot for i lockfancy I greatly appreciate it I sometime remove the text lock a blur when Im teaching so I can lock my machine go grab a coffee while my students can still read on the video projector dont know if we should turn this as a feature or not That is fork of work but have fix many errors little fix D jutsuLiterally meaning Eye Techniques images look pretty cool when applied as i locks these images are X pixels and perfectly matches the lock screen size This PR will make it very popular among anime fans as the SharinganRinnegan etc look really good as i lock icons It would be really handy to have an uninstall option in the Makefile instead of having to remove everything manually Added MultiMonitor support to the current version of i lockfancy The main motivation for this was to speed up the script see I also added support for an arbitrary number of monitors see It now takes around s on my desktop and s on my laptop if you use pixelate The method is to build up a filtergraph for ffmpeg The stages of the filtergraph are as follows Blur or pixelate or greyscale the input image Add the lock images Add text This is achieved by creating a small x area which black text is added to and then blurred then adding some nonblurred black text for a more solid outline and finally adding the white text over the top The result is a black shadow around the text so it can be read on any background The reason for the x area is its quicker to apply the blur Missing features and problems No lightnessdarkness detection As ffmpeg handles capturing the desktop now I removed the custom scrot command part so you can no longer set custom flags eg imposing a delay I dont think this is a huge problem as you can create your delay before executing the script Using xrandr to figure out the size and location of all the displays Its probably not ideal but I couldnt find an easier way I was trying to use the n option for i lock in i lockfancy to use in a helper script but it doesnt work binbash killall compton i lockfancy npg compton I want to kill compton before run the i lockfancy but this script only work with i lock This project installs a bunch of icons but only allows two of them to be used and theyre automatically selected This PR allows overriding the automatic behaviour to allow any image to be used and adds a default empty image I have adapted the makefile and i lockfancy so that a custom installation prefix can be specified
