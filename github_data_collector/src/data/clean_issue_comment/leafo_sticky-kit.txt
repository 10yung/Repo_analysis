Got this error when I import stickykit with webpack Uncaught TypeError is not a function at Objectanonymous stickykitjs at Objectnodemodulesstickykitdiststickykitjs stickykitjs at webpackrequire bootstrap My import line import stickykitdiststickykit is working jQuery is working too debugged with a console log I have the right lines in environmentjs and config etc In the config I added this rule as seen in another question but it didnt work test js include pathjoindirname nodemodules stickykit use loader importsloaderjQueryjqueryjquerywindowglobal windowjQueryjquerythiswindowdefinefalse What am I not doing right Look this question in my cumputer I have the situation that the content fits at the time when the query is attached fits perfectly into the container Therefore it is ignored I have an accordion in my content If I open it the height changes significantly and then the sticky element should kick in Therefore I would suggest to add an force flag This flag should grant that the content could be attached anyway The check should be if force height parentheight return When trying to import stickykit there is an error that the module cannot be found This is because packagejson has an entry point of stickykitjs but that file exists in the dist folder To remedy this I converted the coffeescript into the location that packagejson is looking Additionally I added an import of jQuery since it is just assumed to exist this now forces it to exist Hi I have a layout width the search at the left and the result container at the right The result is empty at the first term them I throw an ajax call and fill the result container with the result in infinite scroll My question is how can I throw the stick function in every append of results I have the sticky on other page and it works perfectly But its a static page This can be temporarily bypassed by changing the site to which is an SEO issue but will allow you to click the Scroll it buttons Hi Is there a main reason why this is happening on some pages this one for example and not other this one On the pages where it readjusts it makes the sidebar jittery Thanks Sticky column is jumping to the bottom at the middle of the page When use ctrlf to search a keyword on a webpage normally the browser automatically jumps to the results one by one Now I have two columns on the page with different heights and apply this kit on both columns The script functions well Then I search a keyword and the results in the longer column are located correctly but those in the shorter column not The browser still highlights the word but doesnt scroll to it Is there anyway to fix this
