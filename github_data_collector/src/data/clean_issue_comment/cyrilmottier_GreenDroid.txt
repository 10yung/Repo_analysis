This allows easy integration into maven projects and eclipse using the m eclipse and the androidmavenplugin An equivalent to a PreferenceActivity that manages fancy preferences and an ActionBar A color strip configurable frame that separates the ActionBar and the content of the activity Workaround Quick Action Bar Transparent on press We delay the dismiss of the QuickActionBar widget to give time to the clicked view to refresh its state By moving the specification of layoutheight and scaleType from the XML layout to the style definitions its possible for developers to override the defaults without modifying the base GreenDroid library One may simply override the styles in the application If Im missing some compelling reason to leave these two attributes in the XML layout please enlighten I added projectspecific settings so that Eclipse enforces Java as the target Without this if the users workspace is set to target a different version of Java by default eg some compile errors can result When removing then adding an Item if the item added was of a different type than the previous one for exemple replacing a TextItem with a ProgressItem ItemAdaptergetView would crash when trying to reuse the convertView Added QuickActionWidgets anchor tag usefull if you have one QuickActionWidget by item in a ListView I created a simple extension of the ImageSwitcher class which changes the underlying View to AsyncImageView I had a need for this while writing my own app and thought it would be a good addition to GreenDroid
