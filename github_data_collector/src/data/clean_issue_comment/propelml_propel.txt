 If you put a w b hello c into the inspector it gives an error SyntaxError Unexpected token img width altscreen shot at am src Theres some debate as to whether this is actually a bug since its technically a block scope with labels However the Node REPL and Chrome Inspector parse it in the way one would expect something like this ts tensorset Currently the dataset is specified as a string prdatasetcifar train prdatasetiris It would be better to use actual functions for each example prdatasetcifar train prdatasetiris This allows for type checking on the components of the datasets that is cifar has images labels and iris has features labels thus the docs will better reflect the information people need splitName should default to train Add test and avoid repeating the string New Notebook Insert code here in the code cifar train is mb and mnisttrain is mb accessing a single element from either of these will trigger a download of the whole set Ideally we can split these datasets into mb chunks so they can be downloaded progressively If only one batch is inspected like for debugging only mb will be used Ive already split cifar train images into these files and uploaded them using this script srcmnistts can be removed completely
