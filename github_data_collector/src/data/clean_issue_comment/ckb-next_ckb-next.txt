After updating ckbnext no longer works with my Corsair Strafe RGB after it was working fine on Mojave The software claims I should enable the ckbdaemon in Security Privacy Input Monitoring but I never get the prompt and nothing is there with no way to add software to it Things Ive tried Restarting ckbnext multiple times Restarting the Mac Unpluggingreplugging the keyboard multiple times Running the ckbnextdaemon restart shell script in Package Contents Neither seem to do the trick its a shame because I love this software and this was essential to getting my media keys working on the strafe Version macOS Catalina Beta D e ckbnextreport gz Hardware Corsair K LUX Red LED Corsair CH AP SCIMITAR Pro RGB When ckbnext is running my keyboard is stuck at full brightness and when I try to change the brightness setting either by pressing the brightness button on the keyboard or by changing it in ckbnext the mouse brightness changes instead and the keyboard is unaffected Changing the brightness setting for the keyboard affects the brightness setting for the mouse the values seem to be locked together When I quit from ckbnext the brightness button on the keyboard works as intended I believe that what I am encountering is a bug within ckbnext but as this is my first time writing an issue report in Github I could very well be wrong I recently installed Debian XFCE on my computer and added my usual applications and customizations Since there is no official package for Debian I compiled ckbnext from source via the instructions Ive done this before never had any problems Everything seems to work fineI can change button macros mouse speed RGB theme etc However when my computer is idle and xscreensaver starts the lights on both my keyboard and mouse turn off The only light that stays on is the little brightness icon on my keyboard When I move my mouse to get rid of the screensaver either the mouse or the keyboard will light back up but never both The only way Ive managed to turn the lights back on is to either unplug and plug either the mouse or keyboard back in or go into ckbnexts settings and switch to a different RGB theme and back again to the one I had set While this is not a dealbreaker for me it is a minor aggravation so I thought Id bring it to your attention Also Ive experienced this in the past but for whatever reason if ckbnext is set to autostart in XFCE when I log into my user account the main setting screen always appears even though it is launching with the background command Ive tried to delay the start an option in the settings and Ive also tried autostarting a shell script instead of the default autolauncher with both background and session triedneither seem to make any difference I dont know if I should make a different issue report for this or not My keyboard is the K and my mouse is the Scimitar Pro RGB Im not sure what other information would be helpful but I would be happy to provide it As I said earlier running Debian stable with no packages from testing or backlogs Hello again I was recently looking into basically this blog the other day I was running systemdanalyse security and was met with a huge list of exposed These are basically a set of permissions to sandbox the systemd unit a basic amount To test this I ran sudo systemctl edit ckbnextdaemonservice Service capability restrictions sudo systemctl restart ckbnextdaemonservice I then just checked the general functionality and things all seem to work just fine This can go a lot further but for now its gone from somewhere of exposed to MEDIUM What do you think K RGB Using Linux Mint Under Performance assigning colours to some keys is broken See attachment Screenshot Doesnt work Doesnt work Doesnt affect anything Affect both Mute Off and Macro Recording Off see photo sorry for bad quality but you can see both mute and MR buttons are cyan photo Using the app Im not able to assign a color to the Vol UpVol Down buttons It appears that when I do they values are assigned to the Play and next buttons immediately below them The Vol buttons do light up as expected on the built in schemes Using v on MacOS K RGB with FW X Headset recognized by daemon X Headset recognized by GUI RGB Control Getting errors when sending the message so working on that uncomment the usbsend and itll stall Fixes If you wanna test if the daemon picks up your headset please do and let me know if I need to add more usbids for respective headset tatokis since you did the RGB part My IRL schedule is pretty free all Thursday CST and most of Tuesday afternoon if I need to get on IRC to help with testing What is the programs current behavior Currently the program requires a Kernel extension to be loaded to function properly This requires the user to manually go into System preferences and allow the Kext to load What would you like it to do instead Apple has said that Kernel extensions will be deprecated in a future macOS release The new way to make IO Drivers is using DriverKit This allows the driver to run in user space so the user will not have to manually allow the kernel extension This will improve usability as well as system stability Any other notes comments I saw ckbnext support Corsair LL fans Would it be possible to support QL fans as well QL is the newest LED fans from Corsair and they use Lighting Node Core for LED control LL fans use Lighting Node Pro I just want them to stay on a spefic color Im not a programmer but Ill help you whatever I can Thanks Any other notes comments The ckbnext is available in Solus as ckb as well as a devellopement version as ckbdevel Same version for both currently as far i m aware Despite that It is not mentionned in the wiki
