Sign in with Google temporarily disabled for this app This app has not been verified yet by Google in order to use Google Sign In Is this a new issue or this is something wrong with my setup Im running jupyter notebook as a server on a raspberry pi I also run jupyter notebook in a virtualenv I was able to run jupyterdrive by using the user option Because this is running as a server on my network I initiate jupyter using jupyter notebook ip port But when I go to the notebook interface using my browser I do not get the authorization message Any suggestions Thanks After installing jupyterdrive everything well fine But now everytime I lunch a notebook the kernel working directory is set to the directory in which I started the jupyter notebook server I would like to se the working directory automatically to where the notebookipynb is As our team installed jupyterdrive to work collaboratively so we have relatives paths to where ipynb is Any ideas Thx Charly The license requires that all copies of the software include the license This makes sure the license is included in the wheels See the wheel documentation here for more information Hi Jupyter notebook was released a few days ago I cant seem to get jupyterdrive to work with this update The gdrive folder shows and and shows the files from my drive however when i choose a folder i get a internal server error The terminal that launched the notebook shows the following E NotebookApp Uncaught exception GET filesgdriveLoftrumdocx HTTPServerRequestprotocolhttp hostlocalhost methodGET

what is wrong Im assuming its an expired session If I go to the Notebook Home tab and press the home icon it will eventually reload my drive folder but running notebooks wont ever come back by just pressing save after restoring the browsability in the Home tab If I refresh the page it will reconnect but I fear I think I lose any unsaved changes I need to test that as I notice before I make changes and dont do any changes until the connection is reestablished Im not sure there is a fix for this but thought I would bring it up as no one has reported it from what I can see I cannot recreate the issue by simply disabling my connection and reenabling but perhaps it is because I do not wait long enough for the session to be invalid Jupyter Ubuntu MetadataVersion Name jupyterdrive
