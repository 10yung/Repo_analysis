 Google no longer supports the Drive desktop app Replaced by googlebackupandsync and googledrivefilestream I installed mysql first then found out the tool I was using can not connect to MySQL Then I uninstalled it and installed MySQL explicitly It worked but now I cant seem to connect to the server and I am not sure if it is actually running or not For info getting the following message when installing webpicmd WriteChocolateySuccess is deprecated and will be removed in v If you are the maintainer please remove it from your package file What is the purpose of this choco package repository For example I might be interested in maintaining a package or two It would be better if I joined a community of people doing that instead starting my own repositoryfeedwhatever Im aware of but thats just a switchboard to coordinate maintainers I havent been able to locate a hub where maintainers congregate and actually do and share work This repo looks like it could be that place Is it okay to create a pull request for package X here If not where else Thanks This is now installed along with the python application and isnt required as a stand alone package there are incorrect download links for mysql versions there is a commit here that fixes it can it be merged Im not sure what the reasoning is behind using the Cream distribution for Vim rather than the official distribution I thought maybe the official Vim installer was using some wacko installer method but I checked and they are both using NSIS While I do understand the if it aint broke dont fix it mindset however this is broke The Cream distribution includes the windows right click context menu item for Edit with Vim however on choco uninstall vim it doesnt remove that context item Further the official Vim windows installer either from the Vim FTP or from the Vim Github release includes an additional context menu for Edit with existing Vim which is useful if you already have Vim running The Cream installation lacks this Plus its official so why not use it Would allow user to override default installation directory So ideally the idea behind chocolatey is that you can install and uninstall packages cleanly However the vim package is highly broken on uninstall First running choco uninstall vim actually fails to uninstall anything at all which means you have to uninstall via the uninstaller in addremove programs However even running that uninstaller fails to remove the shell extension which has to be removed manually in the registry so the uninstall process is extremely dirty Suggestions Add an option to install without the shell extension by manually removing the relevant registry entries Fix the uninstall process generally by running the uninstaller properly in silent mode and manually removing those registry entries for the shell extension
