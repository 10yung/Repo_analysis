 Problem The CA certs that are bundled with traveling ruby are expired This is problematic because we can no longer verify certificates in https requests Solution Mozilla has public Certificate Authorities CA available in its source tree cURL parses this certdatatxt and extracts CA Root Certificates into PEM format and makes it publicly available on their website Every time traveling ruby is released bundle it with cURLs most up to date ca certs Assumes we trust Mozilla and cURL Verification that problem exists taking a look at the cert expiration dates quinsmbpshared quin openssl x enddate noout in cabundlecrt notAfterAug GMT How can I build ruby binaries for other arch for example mips and arm Using rvm to build ruby on that machine was succeed docker was available too How does the packaged binary protect source code I am concerned that people will be able to unpack the binary and view the proprietary source code of my application When I start rake on linux centos machine then I get the following error Start yum update ERROR Command failed usrbinyum installroot varlibmockepel x x root releasever install buildsysbuild Error Cannot retrieve repository metadata repomdxml for repository core Please verify its path and try again YumRepo Error All mirror URLs are not using ftp http s or file Eg Invalid releaserepoarch combination removing mirrorlist with no valid mirrors varlibmockepel x x rootvarcacheyumcoremirrorlisttxt rake aborted Command failed with status setupruntime a x r runtime homeinstanatravelingrubylinuxRakefile in block levels in top required homeinstanagemrubygemsrake exerake in top required Tasks TOP default package package x travelingruby linuxx targz output x bin runtime x ok See full trace by running task with trace When peeking into the yum conf that gets thrown in root I see that there is a mirrorlist being used that got moved to archive servers Can someone tell me how I can build otherwise cannot execute binary file Thanks for the useful tool though first I am following the instruction on the Github page but I got a cannot execute binary file on AWS Lambda So I try to test on my local and get the same error message Here is the error UsersxxxDocumentslambdaruby tmprumbdarubybinruby line UsersxxxDocumentslambdaruby tmprumbdarubybinrealruby cannot execute binary file UsersxxxDocumentslambdaruby tmprumbdarubybinruby line UsersxxxDocumentslambdaruby tmprumbdarubybinrealruby Undefined error The above error shows up when I want to run the wrapper I went through the bash file and feel like maybe its because of the binary ruby in binreal folder Im testing with the Hello World tutorial without the rake part made the package with the linux x binary and run it on VM Ubuntu bits and it showed the hello world message Before run it on VM OpenBSD bits I installed bash and copied the bash file from usrlocalbin to bin since the shebang used is binbash However when running it shows this error message sem titulo Im a newbie in linux so Im not sure if its my mistake or if its not supported because it needs a diferent binary for OpenBSD Consolidates issues Traveling Ruby currently supports Ruby and Ruby for Linux and OS X For Windows only Ruby is supported This is because the RubyInstaller project hadnt released Ruby binaries last time Traveling Ruby saw some work Were a bit past that x point now What is the necessary work for getting Native extensions working with Windows Document building for windows Win api giving issue creating packages for Windows windows version supported Another approach to Windows packaging which FooBarWidget agreed might be a good approach Native extensions support for Windows This issue consolidates Update Gem support Support gtk gem Bump Bundler version to support newer gems Addition to the docs for gem maintainers Installing to any directory with spaces in the path failed because of GEMHOME and GEMPATH having not enough quotes around them and ruby failing to parse the options from RUBYOPT when the r option had spaces in it Fixed this by adding the necessary escapes to add doublequotes around the env variables and moved restoreenvironmentrb to the librubysiteruby folder which is in the ruby load path so the r option doesnt need to reference the full absolute path Fixes As a starting step I need to get the gem dependency unfext working with traveling ruby what kind of things would I need to change I can do the work just would appreciate some guidance Thanks
