SSE requests texteventstream dont work properly no events are transmitted to the client if proxygzipcontenttype is nonnil and gzip is in the AcceptEncoding header because under those conditions the response gets chained through GzipResponseWriter even if no compression is being done This change will bypass the GzipResponseWriter if there is a Accept texteventstream header I have my secure service running on HTTPs using following options new HttpServerOptions setSsltrue setClientAuthClientAuthrequired setKeyStoreOptions new JksOptions setPathCertificatejks setPasswordpassword setTrustStoreOptions new JksOptions setPathcacscombinedprodjks setPasswordpassword When i connect to my service at https localhost getToken using chrome i get pop up to select certificate and after selecting certificate i am able to call this service fine I have registered my service in consul with protohttps option But i am unable to call this service using fabio My use case here is service registered in Consul is HTTPs and fabio is runing with HTTP and not as HTTPs Is it possible to call this upstream HTTPs service such as http localhost getToken How to use jks certificates with fabio With current set up of i try to query my HTTPS upstream service using fabio i am getting folowwing error cannot validate certificate for ipadress because it doesnt contain any ip sans Hi folks Using logroutesformat all the Fabio logs appear to be broken Dec fabioi ec ac dcac e f fabio INFO Updated config to Dec fabioi ec ac dcac e f fabio INFO Updated config to Dec fabioi ec ac dcac e f fabio INFO Updated config to Changing to logroutesformat delta it doesnt actually show anything at all in logs Only logroutesformat detail seems to work now Thanks in advance Can we use fabio as gateway service And is it possible to create cliuster of fabio All good things come to an end History Fabio started as a small line loadbalancing experiment during my time at eBay in Amsterdam to replace our insane loadbalancer setup and worked much much better than I expected It made routing dirt simple and pushed the responsibility for the route to the service instead of coordinating releases between microservices and the DevOps team It also hit some sweet spot for the HashiCorp Consul users which now had a supersimple consulenabled load balancer and HashiCorp noticed very quickly This was with go and consul My team was the largest Go team in Amsterdam and to the best of my knowledge we were the only ones running large scale big money production critical stuff on Go Very exciting times Fabio would have probably never seen the light of opensource if there wouldnt have been emilevauge with and my colleagues pushing me to opensource Fabio I got mocked for the choice of name bc of the italian actor but that died off quite quickly when the Github stars were flying in Emile and I even met briefly during a Go conference in Paris where I presented the project for a couple of minutes Fun times and some healthy competition Ive added features that were helpful to us and others Was involved in longwinded discussions in what should and should not be in the project and probably neglected to build a more active community of committers around the project Maintaining an opensource project is a lot of work It does not get easier if it becomes somewhat successful For a long time Fabio had a leg on HAProxy because of reloads without restarts For an even longer time it had one on Traefik because of the TCP proxy with SNI support I remember writing that code forking the Go TLS code and getting something working in a couple of lines which was so useful You are all awesome Joyent added features to Fabio like the grpcproxy and countless contributors have found bugs workarounds fixes features improvements and the project has become bigger and more successful than I could have ever imagined With million Docker pulls Fabio seems to be driving some serious websites I got insane performance numbers with Fabio running on a core machine from some companies where Fabio replaced an expensive loadbalancer for free But times change emilevauge went ahead and built containous around traefik HAproxy can handle reloads without restarts and Caddy with the awesome autoTLS came along Ive got an offer to turn Fabio into a company and turned it down then worked for HashiCorp for a while and left again now working full time on batteries and injecting Go into the industrial manufacturing industry Ive moved on mentally and also in terms of my commitment Without the extraordinary help of leprechau and pschultz over the last year the project would be in much worse shape I think it is time to let go and find a new maintainer If we cant find one then this project needs to go to the software graveyard Ive never done this before so Im curious who would be interested and what to look out for Thank you all Frank Schr dermagiconair The current tracing implementation sets the operationName of every fabio span to the configured tracing service name This makes it difficult to distinguish between traces in the Jaeger UI as seen here this is with FABIOTRACINGSERVICENAME set to
