The API example shows how to create a tarbz file using Stream stream FileOpenWritetarbz Path using var writer WriterFactoryOpenstream ArchiveTypeTar CompressionTypeBZip zipWriterWritePathGetFileNamefilename filename Since theres no ArchiveTypeNone How can I compress a single file to bz directly Similar to unix command bzip testtxt In reader it is judged that the tar file uses gzip stream But in archive the targz file becomes a gzip file At this time all entities are empty I couldnt find anywhere in tararchive to set up its file stream SevenZipFilePartGetCompressedStream skips all the previous files in the Folder This involves decompressing them and discarding the decompressed data So when reading the content of the Entries in order we keep decompressing the same data that we have already decompressed for every subsequent entry in the same CFolder May I suggest that the folder stream be cached e g by only recreating if we need to read an entry earlier in the folder than the last one so we dont end up like Shlemiel the Painter Shlemiel gets a job as a street painter painting the dotted lines down the middle of the road On the first day he takes a can of paint out to the road and finishes yards of the road That s pretty good says his boss you re a fast worker and pays him a kopeck The next day Shlemiel only gets yards done Well that s not nearly as good as yesterday but you re still a fast worker yards is respectable and pays him a kopeck The next day Shlemiel paints yards of the road Only shouts his boss That s unacceptable On the first day you did ten times that much work What s going on I can t help it says Shlemiel Every day I get farther and farther away from the paint can Hi All I need to know that RAR file is password protected or not before it upload to the serverCan you please give information on this Thanks Regards Thus when using ReaderFactoryOpen I get an error of Cannot determine compressed stream type Supported Reader Formats Zip GZip BZip Tar Rar LZip XZ Hello I am getting exception SharpCompressCommonInvalidFormatException Invalid Rar Header at SharpCompressCommonRarHeadersRarHeaderFactoryReadNextHeaderStream stream SharpCompress exampleszip contains two rar files Can extract them using zip or WinRar but no luck with SharpCompress Maybe these are RAR archives which are not supported at the moment it is stated in TODOS list on a main page Need to use async IO now Guidance for ASPNET spells it out Look to where ValueTask can be used Unable to extract certain rar files Getting error message Invalid Rar Header But i could extract few files with same code Unable to extract files compressed using WinRAR bit ries
