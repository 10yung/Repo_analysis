Hello Thanks for this package What is the best way to remove the shortcuts please pip uninstall jupyteremacskeys and reinstalling jupyter through conda did not work Reason for uninstalling is that ctrl w is a browser shortcut to close tab Thanks Love these bindings Its so hard to switch between emac and jupityer However once I start using some of the keys I expect ctln ctlp to go up and down Ctln works ctlp brings up the print menu Hi any chance you can bump the version number and push the latest to the pypi repo The latest it has for this is from October and were hitting the issue you fixed with e a wrt python compatibility Thanks Hey I was doing something like this in my customjs and recently decided to turn it into an extension to be able to choose between the different key maps I looked around to gather ideas and I took the CtrlY remap and line wrap ideas from here The extension has now been integrated at or heres my branch in case youre interested I added a link back to here in the README to give credit Thanks First off I love this thanks a lot The ctrln shortcut doesnt work for me though while ctrlp does Im using Firefox both with and without keybindings for all GTK text boxes Any suggestions
