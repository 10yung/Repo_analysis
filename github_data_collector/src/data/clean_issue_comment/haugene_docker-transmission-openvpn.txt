I am very sorry if this is a dumb question Ive set up two containers with the dockercompose file provided here when i start the proxy container it starts the transmissionvpn container too so far so good the containers keep running but if i try to connect to the rpc via the proxy container i get a Bad Gateway Error in my browsertransmissionremote client is this a bad transmission config or a bad container setup my dockercomposeyml transmission image haugenetransmissionopenvpnlatestarmhf capadd NETADMIN devices devnettun restart always ports dns volumes etclocaltimeetclocaltimero

reach SOMETHING Thanks Describe the problem Hello all I am new to dockers transmission and just about all of this so please bear with me I am running container station on a QNAP Be with the latest firmware and updates When I execute the commands below to create a docker for transmission the docker creates but only runs for about seconds before stopping Below is the command I used to generate said docker I tried swapping out the VPN config files with other known port forwarding servers but I do not believe that to be the issue I would assume the docker to continue to run even though the VPN failed to connect or error out Any and all help would be appreciated Add your docker run command docker run capaddNETADMIN d nametransmission v shareCACHEDEV DATAContainerDownloaddata v

NetherlandsUDPovpn Hi My issue is the following Everything works fine until PUREVPN closes the server vleuno ovpnudppointtoservercom Or my transmission openvpn only uses that apparently So suddenly RESOLVED unable to resolve the host address vleuno ovpnudppointtoservercom name or service unknown How do I change this is there an ovpn somewhere i can edit Knowing that the vleuno ovpnudppointtoservercom is available Thank you very much What all would be needed to add support for ExpressVPN Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe NA Describe the solution youd like Wireguard is becoming more popular and I would like the project to support NordLynx technology from NordVPN Describe alternatives youve considered I have tried other containers that support NordLynx but the biggest drawback aside from them being in their infancy is that I would have to run another container for Transmission Additional context NA I am using it since fews days and it is working without any issue see the screenshot with one of my container is unhealthy It could also be interesting to explain that according to the Docker Teams there is no plan to manage a restart or stop of an unhealthy container an unhealthy docker just run until it it stopped by a command this could beeasily done by a bash command that invoke a docker ps command to list all unhealthy containers and restart it i could give you the code if you want scheduled in a cron job you have a H H running container Regards and thank you for you great job Image Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe First of all thank you so much for the amazing Docker image It works like a charm for me That being said whenever possible I like to use a specific version tag for running my containers rather than latest When looking at the images available on Docker Hub I noticed that while the latest image which I m using for now was released months ago the last version tag was released over months ago Furthermore the release notes here on GitHub mention that there are some known issues in the release which are solved in the latest tag Describe the solution youd like If it wouldn t be too much problem please release another stable version of this image under a version tag and publish it to Docker Hub Thank you I am running Docker on Synology DSM and hoping someone can help out with a guide explanation I would like to direct the web traffic from other containers namely Jackett Sonarr and Radarr through haugenetransmissionopenvpn container ie so that Jackett Sonarr Radarr etc are running through the same VPN I have configured for Transmission Ive read various posts online which lead me to believe that this is possible but I cant quite fit all the pieces together to make it work Failing that a guide on how to setup Jackett to use the transmissionopenvpn containers proxy server would also be great I have zero coding knowledge so as much of a stepbystep as possible would be greatly appreciated I have added environment variables to my current docker containers using the Synology DSM gui not sure how to go about editing docker containers any other way on Synology Many thanks Hello i just findished setting up a Pritunl VPN Server and was wondering if you could add support for Pritunl VPN in the future D let me know if you need anything from me D
