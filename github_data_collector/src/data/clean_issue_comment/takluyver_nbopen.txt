I ran the nbopen installation and activation commands on Windows I am using a new installation of Anaconda Python distribution new as of last week python m pip install nbopen python m nbopeninstallwin Then I doubleclick on a Jupyter notebook file the interpreter Command Prompt flashes but the Jupyter NB file never opens up I saw this behavior about months ago the first time I tried it What is the fix for this nbopen doesnt work with my setup so Id like to undo the changes Ive made nbopen fileipynb returns to prompt if there is a running Jupyter process that it can use nbopen fileipynb otherwise starts a new Jupyter process in the foreground not returning to the prompt It would be nice if there was an option to always go into background eg emacsclient n never hangs eg nbopen fooipynb opens the JupyterLab interface if fooipynb doesnt exist instead of creating it Ideally it would create an empty file of that name and then open it with jupyter I bet the tricky bit is that you have to guess at the format of the file based on the name nbopen works from the terminal but I have a problem after I install the mac app using the osxinstall Once the installation is complete I get the following error while opening the app Not been able to use it as it tries to connect to python forever I have installed the nbopen and executed python m nbopeninstallxdg but the icons have not changed for ipynb files I recently updated to conda and nbopen no longer works Rolling back the installation fixed nbopen but broke everything else I have this problem when trying to integrate while file management system on Mac running macOS Mojave Solution
