Hello all Ive been loving SwiftyGif so far When we implemented it we noticed gif animations are playing at different speeds on iPad vs iPhone Heres a few videos to showcase what I mean iPad iPhone Any ideas about how to fix this Trying to load a gif file to start and stop animating it but every time showing invalidFileName error but my file name was similar to the gif file I tried renaming the file couple of time but it is not accepting anything even though the name matches the gif file Please help I found a simple to reproduce logic bug in version gifImage try UIImagegifName animatedgif imageViewsetGifImagegifImage loopCount let index isSelected gifImageframesCount imageViewshowFrameAtIndexindex expected behavior see last frame of image without animation actual behavior The displayed gif is animated continuously I have to show a gif in iOS app launch This is my piece of code it is working fine in iOS but app is crashing on launch in ios let logoGifImageView UIImageView guard let gifImage try UIImagegifName abcgif else return UIImageView return UIImageViewgifImage gifImage loopCount In pod file I have added SwiftGif like this pod SwiftyGif Can we get time of animation for gif I am using this library and need time if any one know tell me D For the life of me I cant get the GIF to display Is there something Im missing here var outgoingMessageView UIImageView outgoingMessageView UIImageViewframe CGRectx llamaViewframemaxX y llamaViewframeminY width bubbleImageSizewidth height bubbleImageSizeheight outgoingMessageViewdelegate self if textIsValidURL true printURL is valid outgoingMessageViewimage bubbleImage let maskView UIImageViewimage bubbleImage maskViewframe outgoingMessageViewbounds outgoingMessageViewmask maskView outgoingMessageViewframeoriginy llamaViewframeminY let url URLstring text outgoingMessageViewsetGifFromURLurl manager defaultManager loopCount showLoader true else outgoingMessageViewimage bubbleImage Set the animations labelanimation zoomIn outgoingMessageViewanimation zoomIn Add the Subviews viewaddSubviewoutgoingMessageView printoutgoingMessageView added The delegate lets me know it runs successfully via gifDidStart gifURLDidFinish Checking outgoingMessageViewisAnimatingGif tells me its still running Checking outgoingMessageViewisDisplayedInScreenoutgoingMessageView tells me its not being displayed It finishes almost immediately but its the same in your example project yet the gif still loops and displays in your project Ive changed loop counts imageviews not running via a mask as I intended and instead just a UIImageView changed the GIF urls all to no avail Help Using the latest SwiftyGIF version Hi kirualex Could you check with branch I tried to refactor to make a single CADisplayLink It still required some work but for now it works weird Gifs animated too fast and it takes a lot of CPU usage Could check why its happening Steps to reproduce create UIImage with UIImagegifName from a local GIF file bundled in project create UIImageView and set GIF with imageViewsetGifImagegifImage manager SwiftyGifManagerdefaultManager loopCount play GIF animation once with imageViewstartAnimatingGif wait until animation completes force playing GIF animation once again with imageViewshowFrameAtIndex imageViewstartAnimatingGif Expected result GIF starts playing back again from first frame Actual result GIF moves back to first frame but stays stopped We also tried adding an updateCurrentImage call with no luck What are we doing wrong Environment SwiftyGif version Xcode B
