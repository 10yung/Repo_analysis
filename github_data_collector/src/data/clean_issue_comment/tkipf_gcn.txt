Hi Thanks a lot for your work I have a graph dataset in which each graph has its own adjacent matrix feature matrix and label matrix How can I train the model on this kind of dataset HelloI have a question In your code features testidxreorder features testidxrange and labels testidxreorder labels testidxrange might mean shufflingbut why I remove thesethe accuracy decrease to Hello thank you for your work I want to ask in the code only set the number of iterations not the batchsize and epoch so where are these two set Thank you very much Dear tkipf I have a question in our current project and I need your help For example there is a human being consisted of six lines a matchstick men and I need to detect the head hand and the joint This matchstick men may have different pose the length of arm and leg may be varied or the armleg may be missed I want to use the graph neural network to solve this problem However in my application one matchstick men is a sample which is different from that in graph neural network Is my understanding correct For this application do you have any suggestion Thank you for your time Dear kipf Have you also tried with MNIST dataset for this method I see this is node classification and I wonder if this model can work with MNIST or any other of image dataset with cora A N x N X N x D Y N x E with MNIST or other images A D x D X S x D Y S x E Ex D Features x S Samples E class If I want to implement this model to try on image dataset such as MNIST I wonder how this code can be changed to use Thank you In this paper there is a description of complexity In practice we make use of TensorFlow Abadi et al for an efficient GPUbased implementation of Eq using sparsedense matrix multiplications The computational complexity of evaluating Eq is then OECHF ie linear in the number of graph edges while I cannot get the result ie OECHF More specifically I think it should be OE H maxC F which is much smaller than your result Could you give some explanations about this Thanks very much Hello First nodes in cora that you are considering as TrainSamples are those node indexes are or something else in Adjacency Matrix To be exact it is possible to edit the file utilspy However when I run trainpy it can not recognize the modified utilspy Instead it runs the original utilspy which is located in the path that C Anaconda Lib sitepackages gcn py egg gcn utilspy Can you help me Thanks a lot Hi tkipf i run GCN on NELL dataset I have watched the closed issue and edit the code but i still have the same problem this is the errore output Traceback most recent call last File homehikarigcngcntrainpy line in module adj features ytrain yval ytest trainmask valmask testmask loaddataFLAGSdataset File homehikaricondaenvsGCNlibpython sitepackagesgcn py egggcnutilspy line in loaddata txextended splilmatrixlentestidxrangefull xshape File homehikaricondaenvsGCNlibpython sitepackagesscipy py linuxx eggscipysparselilpy line in getitem return IndexMixingetitemself key File homehikaricondaenvsGCNlibpython sitepackagesscipy py linuxx eggscipysparseindexpy line in getitem return selfgetarrayXslicerow col File homehikaricondaenvsGCNlibpython sitepackagesscipy py linuxx eggscipysparselilpy line in getarrayXslice return selfgetrowrangesrow col File homehikaricondaenvsGCNlibpython sitepackagesscipy py linuxx eggscipysparselilpy line in getrowranges jstart jstop jstride nj File csparsetoolspyx line in scipysparsecsparsetoolslilgetrowranges ValueError row index out of bounds Process finished with exit code Can you tell me how to fix this Hi I have very different question but related to graph auto encoder I was going through this paper recently which is focusing on node classification and clustering methods I tried the model and running on cora citeseer and pubmed dataset since all three datasets are available in X feature matrix and adjacency matrix A format But I am really confused how they are doing clustering on Coil and mnist dataset Actually my main question is how to convert mnist and coil dataset into XA format so I can feed it to GCN or other networks Can you please take a look into it Thanks in advance
