Every time I click the reports button it brings me back to the select model page on the demo The reports are something I need to determine the worthiness of this tool Thanks No where in the install docs is imagemingifsicle mentioned dependancy I was building this on archliux so there may be something weird happening becasue the OS is configed differently but in this case I dont think so because after I did npm install imagemingifsicle I didnt get the build errors any more Error Running concurrentdist concurrent task Warning Loading imageminjs tasksERROR Error Cannot find module imagemingifsicle Loading gruntkarmajs tasksERROR TypeError Cannot read property prototype of undefined Warning Task imagemin not found Use force to continue Aborted due to warnings Execution Time UTC loading tasks ms Total ms Use force to continue Aborted due to warnings When using the app for the first time Im exposed to and the Load Model button makes me want to load a couple to get an idea of what can be created The question is where can I find sample Threat Models that can be loaded This issue raises the concern about simplifying the model creatingloading process I would like to remove the create and load pages and put them all into the main splash page Below is the current WIP for the intended new create a threat model page which evades the load and create pages In my opinion its more smooth simplified loadcreate models all on a single quickstart page Is there any guidance to wrap authentication around this tool along with SSL TLS I can create threats and drag and drop stencils The thing I cant figure out is how to connect the stencils with lines If a person has to read the documentation to figure that out it may be that the UI needs some more refinement In the attached screen shot I created a simple diagram and added to threats My Threat and My Threat but cant seem to figure out how to add them onto the diagram so does that functionality not exist yet Would be a nice feature to have a set of prebuilt threats vs having users create every threat themselves A good place to start would be the OWASP Top list Todo Currently some of the layers are rendered out of order Render each layer on their own canvas merge canvas layers see color is a little different as the jsplumb chart and some css effect is not render normally such as the dotted border px dotted gray this may the issue of html canvas cc Pana and The filerevusemin is not working properly in renaming the images in the code A temporary fix has been pushed where it ignores images
