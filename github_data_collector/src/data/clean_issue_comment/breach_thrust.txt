Moved closing Go code ticks to apply formatting ive downloaded Version but when selecting it in the Finder and using Get Info it shows Version fixed Go formatting Really wanted to use this but I noticed it hasnt been touched in yrs Has this project been abandoned Flaw in Go Documentation This could be old documentation from an older version but it no longer works and Im including the reason and solution From the READMEmd First download with go get u githubcommiketheprogrammergothrust Go package main import githubcommiketheprogrammergothrustdispatcher githubcommiketheprogrammergothrustspawn githubcommiketheprogrammergothrustwindow func main spawnRun thrustWindow windowNewWindow nil thrustWindowShow thrustWindowMaximize thrustWindowFocus dispatcherRunLoop Problem Go thrustWindow windowNewWindow nil windowNewWindow does not accept string type for the first parameter but a new struct Options windowgo Go type Options struct RootUrl string Size SizeHW Title string IconPath string HasFrame bool Session sessionSession commandsgo Go type SizeHW struct Width uint jsonwidthomitempty Height uint jsonheightomitempty By providing a struct for windowNewWindow you can solve this issue Example Solution Go import githubcommiketheprogrammergothrustlibdispatcher githubcommiketheprogrammergothrustlibspawn githubcommiketheprogrammergothrustlibbindingswindow githubcommiketheprogrammergothrustlibcommands NEW Required struct SizeHW func main spawnRun thrustWindow windowNewWindow nil OLD thrustSize commandsSizeHWWidth Height NEW SizeHW struct thrustOptions windowOptionsRootUrl Size thrustSize NEW Options struct thrustWindow windowNewWindowthrustOptions NEW Using the options thrustWindowShow thrustWindowMaximize thrustWindowFocus dispatcherRunLoop This is tested under Windows Can someone push me in the right direction why my build fails I tried python scriptsbootstrappy python scriptsupdatepy python scriptsbuildpy Attachment buildtxt Creating an innovative browser with thrust would be great but some extensions are really needed Would it possible to access the Chrome store and allow installing extensions one day I was investigating using Thrust as a replacement for a utility that we built in Qt using the QWebView Im not sure if Im overlooking something but is it possible to interact with the Javascript engine from the nodejs javascript Im trying to avoid rewriting large portions of this so Im battling issues now where all of the codelogic is in the C and were basically just using the QWebView to render HTML To be more specific it would be great if something like this could be done javascript requirenodethrustfunctionerr api window apiwindow rooturl indexhtml windowshow windowonload functionerr thisexecuteScriptalertHi I take it this is not possible to do with Thrust I would need to modify all of our files to utilize the webview tags The file input field still returns a fakepath which makes it hard to implement a proper file open dialog Is this intentionally Im wondering what the best practice for a file open dialog would look like apart from uploading the file Could you give any recommendation here
