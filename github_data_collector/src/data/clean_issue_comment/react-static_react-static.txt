 Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Ive been setting up a Content Security Policy CSP for a reactstatic site and Ive noticed that the way static html is generated currently requires scriptsrc unsafeinline and stylesrc unsafeinline policies Adding these policies opens up XSS and other attack vectors so Id prefer if the site worked without these policies Looking at a reactstaticexamplebasic site there are two issues One is an inline script with the route info html script typetextjavascript windowrouteInfo JSONparse template READACTEDmystaticsitesrcpagesindexjs sharedHashesByProp data path sharedData siteData script And two divs with the following inline style html div styleoutlinenone tabindex rolegroup Describe the solution youd like It would be great if there was an option to not to include the inline script and load the route info from the routeInfojson at the cost of performance Im not sure where the outlinenone style comes from and why its necessary but it would be great if that could be excluded somehow as well Describe alternatives youve considered For the inline script one could compute its hash and insert a meta tag with the CSP option scriptsrc hashalgorithmbase value but Im not sure how this would play with additional CSP configurations eg from headers Happy to provide a PR with some guidance ARE YOU LOOKING FOR HELP OR

IMPLEMENTATION IT WILL BE CLOSED IMMEDIATELY AND YOU WILL BE DIRECTED TO JOIN THE SPECTRUM COMMUNITY Bug Internet explorer with compatibility found in the guide does not work Static routes will show a and when using things like useRouteData or withRouteDate the site will never load There are also no consoleerror messages so Im not sure where the issues lies Environment System OS Windows CPU x AMD

access the current path to set current active item and also some other operations based on current user location Ive used Reachrouters Location API and it working on browser but in build time i gets errors that location is undefined Yes thats obvious because document and window is not exists in node So what is the right way to do that Im looking for a document for this problem Ive also opened a question in Spectrum but no one answered Thanks Get current path in v Version reactstatic When I set a nested page that contains the character in the path argument within getRoutes of staticconfigjs I end up with an unwanted character at the end of the resulting URL So for example if I set the path to examplepost the resulting URL will be examplepost For some reason the extra character is being added at the end This happens on dev and when doing yarn build When I prepend a parent path the string everything works as expected For example if I set the path to postexamplepost instead I DONT end up with the extra character NOTE I only hardcoded the path string for debug purposes Heres some screenshots Screen Shot at pm Then after doing yarn build Screen Shot at pm Prepending a parent path works Screen Shot at pm Then after doing yarn build Screen Shot at pm Environment System OS macOS CPU x IntelR CoreTM i U CPU GHz Memory MB GB Shell binzsh npmPackages reachrouter axios babeleslint

Reproduce the problem Base your steps off of any freshly installed reactstatic template Create routes with nested blog post pages Set the path string with a character without any prefixparent path eg

projects await axiosget But I get an error saying Error socket hang up Is it some CORS issue I tried using this approach but to no avail Is there another way Hi I am new to reactstatic I like how it easily enables me to generate static web pages with react and markdown I found that mdx plugin will automatically generate route for mdx files but how to get correspondent routeData from the mdx file thanks I just fetch the upstream on my fork of the repo and merged that in my own master branch zsh git checkout master git fetch upstream git merge upstreammaster Everything worked OK but Im stuck with a dirty master branch zsh On branch master Your branch is up to date with originmaster Changes not staged for commit use git add file to update what will be committed use git restore file to

coreautocrlf setting to false from input without any luck either Reading Im wondering if PNG should explicitly be set to binary in gitattributes unclear what to do for sketch files So lets say that I want a Dynamic route with a url parameter I can do this using reach router like this html Router Post pathpostpostId Dynamic pathdynamic Routes path Router Lets say that for Post pages I want to render statically a part of the view such as the menus and so At runtime I want to query the server for the Post data but show something to the user while it is loading Since this is a Dynamic URL if the user uses it directly as I understand it the whole bundle will be loaded before showing anything Is there a way to show something to the user a loading page for the Post while he waits for the bundle to complete downloading
