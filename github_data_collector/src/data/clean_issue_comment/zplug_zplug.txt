source the git version output contains nonnumeric version components git version git version rc g d d d zplug cannot detect the git version with this output and it fails to start Change the version pattern to extract a part that starts with a digit For the example above zplug will detect the git version as rc g d d d This is good enough for the version check while there would be no false positives Before Submitting Please read this instructions carefully If it is not reported according to this issue template it may be closed unconditionally In accordance with Issue Type you should

loading by using pmodload such as modulegit For these modules zlug only load the first one with pmodload and then stop load remaining code in initzsh Of course this problem can be fixed with use tag

domain zplugsh seems to be for sale Depending on the used DNS server there seems to be DNSSpoofing My Provider is a big german Company Their DNS Server seems to redirect zplugsh to a phishing site I suggest to remove or update the link Sorry for not writing more had an accident I have a question Im submitting a Zsh gitignore template to the githubgitignore template database Currently the entries are zwc zcompdump zplugin So the question is does zplug create any files or directories in the plugins path They could be submitted with the template Replaces every occurrence of Perl with equivalent awk or sed commands Also removes unused zplugutilsshellunansi function which also used Perl This PR removes the Python dependency for logging In particular I implemented string escaping directly in
