TouchBarSimulator kills Touch Bar on MacBook Pro inch model Touch Bar goes to black when I start TouchBarSimulator IMG hardware MacBook Pro inch software B Closes Also upgrades Defaultsframework to v and uses its tieToLifetimeof obsoleting and removing the version in glueswift This is espeically annoying when positioned above the dock and it blocks the ability to quit apps Screen Shot at PM I m not sure if there s a way to have Touch Bar Simulator detect when these menus are being shown behind it and quickly fade itself out but that would be the optimal UX in my opinion I don t think it should hide for app name bubbles though Just for right click context menus MacOS Catalina Instal latestl TouchBar Simluartor version Clicking on any of the actions does not work No matter what app I use underaneath any click on the touch bar has no effect For example clicking on esc does not close the simulator I believe this was working with the previous TouchBar Simulator Though I upgraded from one version of Catalina to the latest so that might have also caused the issue Thanks We also need to use AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions to prompt for access if needed at launch See for examples We can also listen to when the access is given The touch keyboard is not working Beta B f We need to get the app notarized for Catalina Upgrade Sparkle Enable Hardened runtime Add notarization handling to the build script Id like to use SwiftUI and Combine in the app to simplify state handling and drawing Some ideas Use Slider instead of our custom slider class For example here Use Combine publishers instead of our custom glue state binding Use SwiftUI views here Use Combine instead of our custom NSControlonAction thing Probably worth making a Combine extension to simplify when you just want the callback right away without any transformation Make a propertyWrapper for our AssociatedObject class so we can more easily use it swift AssociatedObject var foo true Anything other ideas This issue requires you to have advanced Swift knowledge It has a bounty so its expected that you do a good job on it When docked to the bottom of the screen Touch Bar Simulator covers up dock icon labels When I used the floating window option before docking was a thing I would always float the window px or so above the dock to make room for the dock labels Would be great to be able to define this possibly with a lil slider in the menu bar above transparency If this feature is added my recommendation is to have all four corners be rounded if the Touch Bar simulator window is not directly against the edge Fixes Set cornerRadius to
