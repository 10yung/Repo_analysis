MarkPieszak Making this project to work with core show warnings about obsolete spaservices and nodeservices what seems to break this kind of solutions at future net Im starting a new project and would like ssr from net core running node or whatever solution but is seem that it will be officially deprecated so this great project this kind of ssr integration will not be keep working if update could you please help me to see or point me to how aspnet core angular ssr integration should be in a future maybe no way I open the folder and try to debug the client source code But I cannot set a breakpoint at the specified line and debug the client side source codes one line by one line correctly There is always a few lines difference between the line of code the cursor is set to and the real line of code I am debugging There is no issue to debug the server side source code I just download the latest version and try to run it then get this compiler error This problem is from aspnet one workaround is found here Basically the workaround is to put LangVersionlatestLangVersion inside the main PropertyGroup at the top then no error anymore I post here to help anyone who have the same problem The terminology being used might be whats confusing me To me prerendering means creating static files at compiletime and serverside rendering means rendering on the server at runtime anything that wasnt prerendered Im trying to find the equivalent code to what is found on the UniversalStarter repo which will loop through paths and prerender aka write static files for each route Does that exist in this repo If so where is it and how does it work Where are the files saved I have tried running the template and whenever I have to refresh it even locally it takes seconds to load the images There is a massive delay before the distdist folderevent gets loaded And itself takes almost seconds to finish loading in the background Is this an expected behaviour If you get this random error on Mondays yes on Mondays likely it is related to a Webpack bug that has to do with a message asking for donation only on Mondays TypeError processgetuid is not a function clijs See details here Changing the timezone to a country already on Tuesday or upgrading to webpackcli fixed the issue Obviously the solution is the latter to make the starter work PS clueless why this didnt crash last Monday but the timezone change and the new version did the trick Probably the starter should use a more recent webpackcli version Alex I have just downloaded the latest aspnetcoreangularuniversal and I am getting again this error index Uncaught ReferenceError prebootInitFn is not defined I have been trying to get mime maps working on this repository Every http request to unknown mime types On IIS

Default VS angular template works without adding mimemap for properties file Is there a way to configure the webpack configuration so that assets styles scripts properties in angularjson file are included in the finished build What I mean is that there are usually properties for assets styles scripts in angularjson file where you can mention additional files directories That is helpful to include additional global styles and also the file order in those property arrays are maintained after generating the clientside angular pages But I did not find anything like that in this starter At the moment it looks like only css files that are referenced in styleUrls property are getting included Is it expected that global style files should be manually referenced on Layoutcshtml I am not very experienced with the webpack build system So am I missing something here Receiving the following dump when running a prod build but not for a dev build ERROR in
