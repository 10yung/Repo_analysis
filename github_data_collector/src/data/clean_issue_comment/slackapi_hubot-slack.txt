Attachments Logs screenshots screencast sample project funny gif etc Description User Groups allow multiple users to be mentioned in one go or to build a sort of dynamic dispatch messaging system like oncallresponder that can be set to different users based on a rota Hubot has a respond callback which will trigger when Hubot is mentioned Currently this callback is not triggered by a usergroup

Expected result No reply from Hubot Messaging Hubot with hubot test ping does however result in this but is not using the user group Actual result A reply from Hubot of pong I am writing a Hubot script where I want Hubot to listen to a particular slack channel for a specific command If the command comes from this channel only then Hubot should respond to it I want to implement this on a script level so I do not want to whitelist or blacklist channels I can achieve this using robothear and an if condition but I was wondering if there s a better way to do this I welcome your suggestions Description Describe your issue here Manual Review Some vulnerabilities require your attention to resolve Visit for additional guidance High MachineInTheMiddle Package httpsproxyagent

hubotslack version node version OS versions Steps to reproduce Expected result What you expected to happen Actual result What actually happened Attachments Logs screenshots screencast sample project funny gif etc The slack rtm client handles reconnections automatically but when it does so subscriptions for presencechange events are lost This means after one or more autoReconnects presenceChange events will not fire Fix Ive taken a stab at fixing this in a fork and confirmed it works as expected Im not a javascript coffeescript programmer tho so I had a scoping issue with presenceSub in botcoffee that I got around by inlining What type of issue is this place an x in one of the x bug enhancement feature request question documentation related testing related discussion Requirements

issues and avoided creating a duplicate issue Bug Report Reproducible in hubotslack version node version OS versions Steps to reproduce The simplest way to see this is to watch the debug logs but you can also create a simple hubot script that does something on presence changes robotpresenceChange msg callback Connect hubot to your slack instance Start the slack client monitor for Received presence change update message in debug logs for your connection disconnection events by starting quitting client use tcpkill or some other tool to disrupt hubots connection to slack hubot will reconnect monitor for same presence change messages Expected result The messages should keep firing Actual result They dont because the subscriptions for presence change events dont get created on the new connection Attachments Logs screenshots screencast sample project funny gif etc Description Marking this as question because Im not sure its a bug Ive noticed that the enter and leave events are missing a timestamp I will talk about only enter events from here on because leave events behave the same Most things in the eventHandler return a timestamp from eventts or eventeventts Enter events do not source coffeescript else if eventtype is memberjoinedchannel this event type always has a channel userroom channel robotloggerdebug Received enter message for user userid joining channel receive new EnterMessage user The only thing it passes to receive is user and you can see as much if you consolelog what you get when using robotenter as a script developer you have user data and thats it My use case is Id like the robot to apply emoji reactions to the message for the enter event in Slack but that action requires a timestamp and a channel I can get the channel from room kinda but I dont have the message timestamp To be honest its not clear to me whether that RTM event even contains a timestamp or not because the documentation for memberjoinedchannel does not include a timestamp in the example even though the example in the blog post introducing this event does include one Whats for sure is that the messagechanneljoin did include a timestamp and probably its frequency would be sufficient for my use case but we moved away from using that in If the RTM event memberjoinedchannel does include a timestamp this is perfect and I will create a pull request to try to propogate that timestamp to Hubot How can I find that out If it does not have one then it is probably intentional and in that case how can I work around the nowmissing messagechanneljoin which has the timestamp I need Sorry for the wall of text What type of issue is this x question Requirements x Ive read and understood the Contributing guidelines and have done my best effort to follow them x

hubotslack hubotinteractivemessages Summary My companys Hubot has been facing some repeated ratelimiting issues and weve found that hubotslack has been missing the diagnostics we need to be able to figure out the cause This adds some new event emitters to let user scripts listen in for these events So far Ive added emitters for every message thats posted and whenever a rate limit occurs An open question for me on the latter is whether theres any other place that rate limiting might come up and whether theres any detail that I can include in the slackratelimit event in order to allow consumers to gather meaningful actionable data cc aoberoi Requirements place an x in each x Ive read and understood the Contributing Guidelines and have done my best effort to follow them x Ive read
