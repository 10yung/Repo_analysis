Is it possible to increase the time of the state ON maybe sec of the receive ans send leds when a code is receved or sent It would be nice if OMG also had a web user interface like Tasmota for changing parameters online A console included in the web interface similar to Tasmota would also be useful for debugging Thanks This PR adds support for these weather stations Venus W W Auriol H tested Hama EWS Meteoscan W W I tested this script on ESPWROOM Hi is it planned to insert a WEBGui always active where to modify the functions of all GPIOs pin and a console where to see any messages such as the TASMOTA This to avoid every time to compile the Firmware when i want to modify something HI is it possible to use OMG with the IR sensor as of Volkszahelerorg which is a smartmeter for Electricity There is a SMB Protokoll to interpretate the Code and the related SW is here In principle they use currently a PI but a ESP in my view could do the same Hello I tried almost everything I think to get the openmqttgateway installed on my esp but dont succeed in it Error I get at this point is ZgatewayBT error class BLEAdvertisedDevice has no member named getServiceDataCount Error below

Yes at least for the switch entities they are most likely going to be used Looking at it from a higher perspective currently gatewayname is used in the MQTT messages and mac address is used for constituting uniqids these are used by hass internally Currently I use gatewayname as a unique name in my environment and my local mods make them part of the name so I can distinguish in hass from the entity name which OMG it is so I know which rfbridge in my case processed the messages this defeats the purpose of preventing duplicates I would like to suggest following modificationssuggestions leave uniqid as they are they are used by hass internally define an identifier in userconfigh which becomes part of the name of the entities eg omg eraseomg restart omg erase etc define an identifier for part of the MQTT message send only shared between all OMGs so duplicate prevention works use then entity name as discussed earlier omg erase omg erase as part of the MQTT message send to the OMG so only that particular OMG reacts to the command I realize this makes things more complicated but at the moment gatewayname is used for multiple purposes creating sort of conflicts between duplicate prevention and identification hii find a bugand it can reproduce When i input the configuration in wifimanagerrouter ssid and passwordmqtt username and passwordand mqtt server ip and port It can connect the router but in the log it still connect the log WM WM Connection result WLCONNECTED WM lastconxresult WLCONNECTED WM AutoConnect SUCCESS WM STA IP Address connectedyeey saving config failed

hope you can help me fix the bugIf it is not a bugplese tell me how to do i need the gateway and i think it is a great thing that you create it thank you Hi Related to issue which had the request for a status LED on the Sonoff RF Bridge I would like to request the option to invert the LED The WIFILED on the RFBRDIGE R is connected to GPIO Defining ledinfo will indeed light the LED However it seems to be inverted Lighting most of the time and turning off during transmission Would it be possible to implement a inverse option on the leds like the define LED PININVERSE in the Espurna code Hi im running rc wiht RF receiver and DHT on platformioino i enabled defaultenvs nodemcuv rf sometimes i find the nodeMCU halted with this continuous message on serial wifi disconnected wifi disconnected wifi disconnected wifi disconnected wifi disconnected wifi disconnected wifi disconnected wifi disconnected wifi disconnected wifi disconnected wifi disconnected wifi disconnected when i press reset button the system restart correctly Is it possible to do an automatic restart in this case
