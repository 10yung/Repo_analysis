Hi This is related to the issue on the main github neuronteamvscodeipe comment I have install this fork and still cannot open the out panel After I initiate the output panel I can see the log stating the package is trying to Starting a Jupiter Kernel at location anaconda bin and it will say Erro could not start Jupyter could not be executed automatically I am on MacOs Version and latest version of this fork I am quite new to vs code if you need more information please tell me how i can get the system log for you Thanks for looking into it sorry for duplicate commentpost for the same issue Hi I switched from main branch to this beta version trying to solve Internal Server Error when trying to run notebooks on a Jupyter server started from a Conda env While it seems to be able to start the server even though I am not sure how to check that VSNotebooksBeta keeps throwing this server error even for a line notebook saying python import numpy as np What can be the cause of it Am I doing something wrong Is it odd that even after installing the beta version I still experience same moduleNotFound error when I try to import a module that is in the custom environment Importing the module in the terminal after activating the environment works but it doesnt for VSNotebooks Beta cry Wanted to open a thread for ideas for notebook innovation I am working on a blog post to detail my ideas around a graph based notebook it should be published within the next weeks considering python files under the same directory file py def fn printcalled file py import file file fn file py can be successfully executed by python interpreter but if you execute the cell using VSNotebook youll get an error ModuleNotFoundError No module named file This bug may be caused by the fact that the temporary jupyter notebook file is created under a temporary directory unlike the one used by real jupyter which is permanent and cannot find other python files in workspace Hi Most of my coding with Python is in a remote Jupyter Notebooks I would like to execute code there In example I would paste a link to running Jupyter Notebook session and when I execute code in VS Code it passes it there I find that when I run same code segment twice the results will be stored in new cell Is it possible to add option to act like jupyternotebook that all output from running same cell will remain in same cell Same as issue in VSNotebook repo request for jupyter plugin like experience Very important feature I would love to add variable exploration to this extension If you have some ideas on how you would like to see this implemented please add a comment to this issue Fixes WIP needs to be merged after
