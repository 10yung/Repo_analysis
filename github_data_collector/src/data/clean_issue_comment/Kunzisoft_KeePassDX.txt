Hello In the importexport functions the possible additions and very useful is the QR code generatorreader function for secure password movement between databasesusers would be really nice Espected action display passwords usernames etc or the full entrygroup as a QR code scan QR codes to quickly find an entry scan QR codes to add the scanned text to your Keepass database For what Used to transfer database entries or group from one Android device to another eg if you want to securely share credentials with a friend or family member Espected behavior open the entry you want to share select Show or generate QR Code from the options menu dot menu open the QR code generator in KeePass DX on the other device select Scan QR code from other device scan the code from the display of the first device you are asked wether you want to search and open an entry or create a new one select the group where you want to add the entry and click Add entry Select Save If this feature could be made I would even be quite willing to pay to see it added Feel free to contact me about this Thank you for your excellent work PS Sorry for my Bad english Im French Describe the bug With compressed database files after the database is modified in KeePassDX it will no longer be readable in KeePassXC A temporally solution for now is to save the database uncompressed To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Create a database in KeePassXC and have some data in the database over kb in compressed size Open the database in KeePassDX and edit and field and save the database Try opening the database in KeePassXC it will give the error Error while reading the database Unable to decompress binary but the database can still be opened in KeePassDX Version beta from FDroid via Android To Reproduce use KpDX to open a readonly file using a third party file explorer and create an entry maybe from Android itself might work i used Material Files from fdroid saving an entry should save and let you know about the progress of it if any errors occurs the usual red bad should appear at the bottom like the other errors in the app what actually happens is that the progress bar flashes and nothing else happens and the file is not edited nor an error about the readonly state or failed to read is shown I apologise if I missed it but it says this app does FA I cannot find this where is it If not please add this feature thank you for this amazing app it is really appreciated Magikeyboard wont open the keepass app when I click the keybutton The other buttons work as expected If I open an entry in the app beforehand the keyboard gives me the option to fill in the username and password as usual its just when I try to open the database from the keyboard it is not working It has worked before with the same device and database It might be the miui that broke it The formfilling has the same problem but I dont use it Keepass Database Created with Windows KeePass Location stored locally synced with syncthing Version beta Build libre Language English Device xiaomi mi t Version miui global Android Screenshot com kunzisoft keepass libre Screenshot com kunzisoft keepass libre We recently worked with KeePassXC to add OnlyKey support for challengeresponse so now you have two options YubiKey or OnlyKey for challenge response with KeePassXC While these issues mention support of challengeresponse through other rd party apps I wanted to suggest a different approach that would allow users to use all Yubikey models not just the NEO and OnlyKey The idea is to keep using the device of your choice on desktop OS with KeePassXC but on Android dont use the device instead use the Android keystore This would be a lot more user friendly and avoid lots of potential technical issues like NFC issues USB issues etc Here is how it would work On Yubikey or OnlyKey device you load your HMAC SHA key You use your device with KeePassXC or KeePass on desktop OS with challenge and response v KBDX On mobile you use an app like KeePassDX and have the option to import an HMAC SHA key in the app by typing it in or maybe by QR code typing would be fine for first run KeePassDX imports this key to the android key store and protects it with fingerprint So now you can open your KBDX on desktop OS with your device or on Android with a fingerprint The Android keystore according to this supports HMAC SHA so you would be able to generate the challengeresponse in the app with the key never leaving the Android keystore I think from a user experience perspective this would be a game changer All that is required is a fingerprint on mobile and its backwards compatible with KeePassXC I usually keep direct links to web pages where I change passwords on sites
