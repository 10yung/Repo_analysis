Trying to create SRP for LogRhythm and getting this error General Validations There is some problem with the xml Either a node is not properly formed or some attribute value is missing Can someone tell me what this means and how to fix it if you collect the informations from a remote system most of the data is useless because the script is reading informations from the current security context which is of course my own remote login and not the user currently logged on the infected computer To do a good and full investigation it would be important to get informations about the user who triggered the infection any solution for that Hi I the share option doesnt seem to be working Command is psreconps remote target share netShare share and keep getting back You must get the data off of the remote host Try using the sendEmail parameter
