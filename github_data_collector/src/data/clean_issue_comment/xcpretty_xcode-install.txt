in load from usrlocalbinxcversion in main Exact command run is xcversion install The command prints two lines after a while ApplicationsXcode app valid on disk ApplicationsXcode app satisfies its Designated Requirement During this Xcode app is in Applications After the command completes however Xcode app is deleted from Applications and xcversion list shows no installed versions When you uninstall an xcode version and automate this behaviour you may end up in a lot of wasted disk space by having unavailable simulators installed As an easy first step we could simply delete unavailable simulators upon uninstall Pull request is already provided I initially ran xcversion install and it looked like it installed xcode but it disappeared from my applications so Im not sure if its a spotlight issue although I cant seem to find it on my machine However I need at least version but when I try to install any version now including I get the following error and nothing changed to my knowledge xcversion install Traceback most recent call last from UsersOSxrbenvversions binxcversion in main from UsersOSxrbenvversions binxcversion in load from UsersOSxrbenvversions librubygems

XIP Please remove UsersOSxLibraryCachesXcodeInstallXcode xip if you suspect a corrupted download or run xcversion update to see if the version you tried to install has been pulled by Apple If none of this is true please open a new GH issue However it still randomly goes back to original undefined method match error as above when run again Ive noticed the certificates for xcode v are all expired since a few days ago for the xip files even downloaded directly from apple dev site Not sure if theres a work around for this In order to reduce disk space we should delete all unavailable simulators once an xcode version gets uninstalled I also had this in mind to do for an install as maybe developers remove their Xcode versions via the Finder but it violates the single responsibility principle I guess What do you think Theres very little to say tried to download different versions recently and always get the same error after an hour or so jm xcversion install Please provide your Apple
