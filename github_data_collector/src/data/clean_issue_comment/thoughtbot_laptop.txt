Because gpgsuite is no longer supported for El Capitan homebrewbundle will return with a failure and exit the entire script without continuing through the rest of the install This is solved by removing gpgsuite from the brewfile portion of the script This does not seem to affect the requirement of asdfnodejs as it will autoresolve the dependency with brew install gpg asdf was available as a brew formula before it was introduced here Why not install it with brew Currently most developers have picked up a stack to work on usually employing the use of a frontend framework such as that of React or Angular or Vue These could be a good addition to this setup we could install npm packages or cli tools for whichever language a developer prefers or whatever is available dont how to work on this per say but could be a good exploration option Any thoughts I keep getting an error in the appendtozshrc function saying Usersmezshrc Permission denied Readout from home ls la shows lrwxrxrx me staff zshrc zshrc Any ideas what the issue here may be Thank you The plugin autodecrypts messages which exposes users to EFAIL vulnerability Closes Hey friends researchers have found a vulnerability that prompted EFF to make this recommendation Our advice which mirrors that of the researchers is to immediately disable andor uninstall tools that automatically decrypt PGPencrypted email Until the flaws described in the paper are more widely understood and fixed users should arrange for the use of alternative endtoend secure channels such as Signal and temporarily stop sending and especially reading PGPencrypted email The laptop script includes gpgsuite From what I can tell gpgsuite autodecrypts emails by default When I try to install laptop I get this error message when installing

think its a good idea to install XCode command line tools at the beginning of Mac script xcodeselect install Related to laptop and ThoughtBot open source It would be really nice to have a clear sense of what has changed I happened to notice in the README that this project switched to using asdf which is cool but Ill have to dig through the commits to see what else has changed since last I used laptop May I suggest adding a PR template with a checklist item of updating the changelog I have downloaded and installed this script on an existing user on a Mac and everything works fine but then
