This package doesnt seem to work with Composer Autoload Ive seen that a similar issue was already opened but I dont seem to be able to make this work Right now as a workaround I had to put this in my own projects composerjson autoload files vendorwpbootstrapwpbootstrapnavwalkerclasswpbootstrapnavwalkerphp But this is not needed with other packages that I use and I would prefer it wpbootstrapnavwalker could load itself as well Thank you Is there a way to easily add classes to elements of the dropdown submenus in order to correctly style them and their child elements Right now they always get the default styles which is a white background whit blue highlight Is it possible to somehow pass list of classes to add to the relevant elements when the WPBootstrapNavwalker is instantiated This would make it easier to always keep the relevant styling because by directly modifying wpbootstrapnavwalkerphp all customizations would be lost when updating to new released versions As an example with a simple dropdown with just one sublevel I think that the elements that should be able to receive list of classes should be uldropdownmenu linavitem adropdownitem I dont know what could be the best way to accomplish this but like I said a suggestion could be to have variables containing list of classes passed down when instantiating the class in a similar way of the Wordpress core function wpnavmenu I have the challenge that I need to change uldropdownmenu li itemscope to divdropdownmenu adropdownitem bgtransparent and dont know how to do it Does someone know PS Basically I want to create a basic Bootstrap markup as overall project requirements need the markup to be exactly like this no css tweaking screen Thanks for contributing this super helpful I just ran into a limitation that I thought might impact others I had not run into an issue with this before but I needed to control dropdown menu alignment and found I could not I added the following within startlvl replacing line if isset argsdropdownmenuclass classes explode argsdropdownmenuclass else Default class to add to the file classes array dropdownmenu Then usage looks like such dropdownmenuclass dropdownmenu dropdownmenuright The following code wouldnt work when escaping html in the title attribute using ACF plugin php function mywpnavmenuobjectsitems args foreach items as item image getfieldimage item if image itemtitle img alt itemtitle classimgfluid src image title itemtitle return items addfilterwpnavmenuobjects mywpnavmenuobjects Removing eschtml fixes it Changes proposed in this Pull Request Add li and a menu elements role attributes in accordance with accessibility best practices See Testing instructions Scan with Add menu item type checking for WPML support When using the WPML plugin while using this nav walker the menu item is displayed with escaped HTML instead of just outputting HTML If the menu item does not contain a flag we can safely strip all HTML tags Fixes Changes proposed in this Pull Request Added wpmllsflag check in the menu item title to ensure flags are displayed correctly otherwise just strip tags If the menu item type is not wpmllsmenuitem just escape the html Testing instructions Use this nav walker while adding a WPML language switcher to the same menu Add the following only if this is meant to be in changelog Proposed changelog entry for your changes Please consider adding PHP versions in Composer config require Is it or pattonwebz Gain benefits of static analysis You also find two fantastic value objects in this PR Was Hello Actually I am new in Laravel I tried to run this command php artisan ui bootstrap but an exception has occured Error localERROR copyC xampp htdocs Connect resources jsbootstrapjs failed to open stream No such file or directory exception object ErrorExceptioncode copyC xampp htdocs Connect esources jsbootstrapjs failed to open stream No such file or directory at C xampp htdocs Connect vendor laravel ui src Presets Bootstrapphp ErrorException copyC xampp htdocs Connect resources jsbootstrapjs failed to open stream No such file or directory at C xampp htdocs Connect vendor laravel ui src Presets Bootstrapphp return void protected static function updateBootstrapping copyDIRbootstrapstubsbootstrapjs resourcepathjsbootstrapjs Exception trace copyC xampp htdocs Connect vendor laravel ui src Presetsbootstrapstubsbootstrapjs C xampp htdocs Connect resources jsbootstrapjs C xampp htdocs Connect vendor laravel ui src Presets Bootstrapphp Laravel Ui Presets BootstrapupdateBootstrapping C xampp htdocs Connect vendor laravel ui src Presets Bootstrapphp Please can anyone help me
