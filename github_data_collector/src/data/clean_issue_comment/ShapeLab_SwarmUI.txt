Can you help to check if this is an invalid if statement and make the correction please Name initRadio Purpose initializes the Radio with the SPI communication first and then the NRF L chip Input Output none Return Notes bool initRadiouint t id uint t initOK HALRCCMCOConfigRCCMCO RCCMCOSOURCEHSE RCCMCONODIV output HSE clock on MCO if SPIInit if initOK initNRF L P Any idea what would be involved in getting this to work for a d space so we could use this for controlling drones Hello Id like to compile the zooidmanager on VS Windows but am having some errors Could you please offer some tips Thanks Michael I dont know if it your duty I think think there maybe a misspell in swarmstanford websites But anyway I want to let you know Tracking Our system uses a projectorbased tracking system for robot position tracking as shwon below Using a high frame rate Hz projector DLP LightCrafter from Texas Instruments Inc a swequence of graycoded patterns are projected onto a flat surface Then the photodiodes on the robot independently decodes into a location within the projected area The instruction for setting up this projectorbased tracking system is included in the repository swequence should be sequence How to make the touch sensor circuit Or is it available at any online electronic stores HelloWhat is the function of the projector Do you need a special projector or an ordinary projector Look forward to your reply thanks anyone have found the seller I want to know how to charge the batterylooks like not so easy to do thatif we can use wireless charge technicalthat will be more easy to use If I try to add that function to robothow many you guys want to buy If the amount is nearly pcsit should be executable a sequence of graycoded patterns are projected onto a flat surface Then the photodiodes on the robot independently decodes into a location within the projected area If I am right the projector just sends out a graycoded pattern message a map it doesnt know the coordinates of the robots and it doesnt communicate with other parts And the mini bots will use the photodiodes to get the pattern and decode the pattern to know where it is in the projected area map When it is received the command from the receiver it will compare with the goal and its current coordinate decoded from the projector to adjust its tracks How the graycoded pattern is generated and how mini bots can use photodiode to sense its location is there any speciality about the photodiode on the bots Hi When i try to run any of the project files i get a load error referring to Software libs openFrameworksCompiled am I missing something fundamental here Regards Ingman Hi I am a th grade Science teacher looking to make his classroom more exciting and interesting I was wondering if someone would help me build these for my classroom I can pay for the parts and the cost of using a d printer I just am very limited in time and knowledge of robotics Any help or information would be great
