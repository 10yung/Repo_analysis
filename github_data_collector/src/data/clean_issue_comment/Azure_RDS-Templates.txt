Im trying to deploy the WVD management App into Azure AD tenant with enable MFA so I cannot use the user and password as mentioned in the documentation Is it possible to deploy the application only when the service principal used has contributor permission on the resource group only but RDS owner permissions I have used the ARM template from portal to deploy the management app with the service principal option set to true and provided the SP credentials I made sure the service principalApp registration has the needed API permissions and the redirect URL I have also updated the API app reference using the provided powershell updateWvdMgmtUxApiUrlps however the app still seems not authenticating Is the deployment using service principal supported using the ARM template Or I need to follow the powershell guide in the portal Old path on row in variablestf at Old path New path This change is needed because WVD doesnt support the N variant of Windows Hey when running the

exists when i tried troubleshooting it is asking me to give a unique application name i tried changing the name also but still showing the same error img width altweb error src virtual machines deployed agent installed registered with key generated in wvdmanagementux website GetRdsSessionHost returns full list of servers however The web UI does not show any of the hosts for this particular host pool There isnt much to help me diagnose this issue from what I can determine Hi there We have hosts in our host pool When the scaling script runs it sets both RD Hosts in the host pool into drain mode and noone can connect to either resource I have specified the minimumNumberOfRDSH as My understanding would be that at least one of the RD Hosts would have AllowNewSessions to be true while off peak so that people could access at least one of the servers then once onpeak the other server would start to allow new sessions Pleas see the below output from before and after running the scaling script BEFORE RUNNING SCALING SCRIPT GetRdsSessionHost TenantName WVDTenantName HostPoolName hostPoolName SessionHostName EGAWVD MLBEGANETAUS TenantName EGA WVD TenantGroupName Default Tenant
