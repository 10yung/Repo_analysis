code and the amlwwalker code This branch should only contain the changes required to get QML to work without using GODEBUGcgocheck Im not an expert in cgo or QML but I know that this branch works for me His comments in issue Hi All I ran into this error a while back I can briefly explain what is going on here goqml passes or receives I cant remember a pointer to a pointer to C code within the qml libraries Doing so means that the Go garbarge collector cannot see whether the pointer has been released by the C code This can lead to memory leaks so in go this was made a forbidden thing to do and is only detected at runtime So hence the error cgo argument has Go pointer to Go pointer githubcomSjBqml solves this in its latest branch however SjB doesnt seem to be monitoring the repo so I have forked it and although my knowledge of the low level api to the qml libraries is unknown to me I am managing the code to make the examples work and plan to make small changes to make it convenient to use going forward You can find it at Im using it now actively so I can help people get set up if they are struggling with post qml and Go A go version go version go linuxamd go get gopkginqmlv

for QML model I try slice and mapbut them not work intbool work But how I can update data in model without change size len in demo modelviewdelegate Are there any plans to include this in some form There are multiple libraries offering this but they all seem to require owning the mainthread As does goqml
