Good day Im Sean a uni student trying to follow through this very impressive work But i have faced a problem which i was looking at for a week but still couldnt solve it So I was following through this ipythonsoccerpredictions project I did gcloud compute instances create ipypredict image containersglobalimagescontainer vmv zoneuscentral a machinetype n standard scopes storagero bigquery which was successful and it created a VM instance named ipypredict Then since gcutil doesnt work any more i typed in gcloud compute ssh osy googlemailcomipypredict zoneuscentral a This connected to the VM instance that i have just created Then on VM instance i typed in docker run fhoffaipythonpredictionsv Then it gives the the following error and it stops running WARN Included extra file etcsupervisorconfdsupervisordsshconf during parsing WARN Included extra file etcsupervisorconfdsupervisordextraconf during parsing WARN Included extra file etcsupervisorconfdsupervisordipythonconf during parsing INFO RPC interface supervisor initialized CRIT Server inethttpserver running without any HTTP authentication checking INFO RPC interface supervisor initialized CRIT Server unixhttpserver running without any HTTP authentication checking INFO supervisord started with pid INFO spawned ipython with pid INFO spawned sshd with pid INFO spawned gitpullpredictions with pid INFO exited gitpullpredictions exit status not expected INFO success ipython entered RUNNING state process has stayed up for than seconds sta rtsecs INFO success sshd entered RUNNING state process has stayed up for than seconds starts ecs INFO spawned gitpullpredictions with pid INFO exited gitpullpredictions exit status not expected INFO spawned gitpullpredictions with pid INFO exited gitpullpredictions exit status not expected INFO spawned gitpullpredictions with pid INFO exited gitpullpredictions exit status not expected INFO gave up gitpullpredictions entered FATAL state too many start retries too quickly I have checked the supervisord config file and the log files too The log file says fatal destination path homeipyipynotebookssoccer already exists and is not an empty directory fatal destination path homeipyipynotebookssoccer already exists and is not an empty directory fatal destination path homeipyipynotebookssoccer already exists and is not an empty directory It seems like the error is caused by restarting the gitpullprediction over and over again without successfully running it But im not sure exactly how to solve it Is there any way to go through this problem good good
