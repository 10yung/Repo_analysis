in the dropdown menu of the editor called Active catalogschema it is not automaticall loaded Each time I connect I have to select the default schema in the Active catalogschema combo again In it worked like a charm It happens both in oracle and ibm db I haven t tried with other databases Steps to reproduce if exist Include any warningerrorsbacktraces from the logs Please find the short guide how to find logs here Hi In the SQL Editor in Auto complete include information about the index linked to the column True when it exists False otherwise Include information about the index on the existing card where it shows information on the data type precision scale etc Example dbeaverindex Apache Phoenix has mixed schema mode Some tables are in schemas while others are not they have schema NULL We need to support both ways in Generic driver We can create virtual schema default and put all orphan tables there Generic meta model additions are required Thank you for reporting an issue

to filter a foreign key column in the Data tab of a table by clicking the filter icon on the column header clickfiltericon However instead of displaying the Filter by dialog an error dialog is displayed errordialog Steps to reproduce if exist I can deliberately reproduce the issue by doing these actions click the filter icon click Define Description in the Filter by dialog choose the primary key column as the description However it appears that with some tables the Define Description configuration is set to the foreign key tables primary key by default and the error occurs as soon as I click the filter icon Perhaps that is due to an algorithm being unable to automatically deduce a suitable column to use as the description Use the following SQL to set up the tables to deliberately invoke the error SQL create reference table CREATE TABLE referencetable refid NUMBER PRIMARY KEY numbercol NUMBER NOT NULL anothernumbercol NUMBER NOT NULL create table with foreign key CREATE TABLE foreignkeytable id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY refid NUMBER NOT NULL anothercol NUMBER NOT NULL add foreign key constraint ALTER TABLE foreignkeytable ADD CONSTRAINT MYFK FOREIGN KEY refid REFERENCES referencetablerefid insert data INSERT INTO referencetable refid numbercol anothernumbercol SELECT level level level FROM dual CONNECT BY level INSERT INTO foreignkeytable id refid anothercol SELECT level level level FROM dual CONNECT BY level Issue appears similar but in that case the issue was not reproducible Include any warningerrorsbacktraces from the logs The error log
