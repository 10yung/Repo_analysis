GOROOT Environment Variable Operating System Linux Expected Behavior When starting the Merlin server with a QUIC listener by specifying proto hq the Merlin Server would start and listen on port UDP Actual Behavior The Merlin Server just exists The ListenAndServeTLS function returns the no such file or directory error The source code was modified to retrieve this error The error is in reference to the x certificate Steps to Reproduce Behavior Start Merlin Server ie merlinServer proto hq Misc Information The error seems to surround generating a x inmemory only certificate A valid work around is to generate a x key pair and save them in the datax directory This will prevent the listener from generating an error Prerequisite x I have read the README x I have search the opened closed issues

Operating System Ubuntu Expected Behavior Setting agent to all in a module would not generate an error when executing a module Actual Behavior Setting agent to all and executing the module generates an error Steps to Reproduce Behavior Merlin module shellcodeInjection set Agent all agent set to ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff Merlin module shellcodeInjection run ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff is not a valid agent Misc Information ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff is meant to be a broadcast identifier Merlin should cycle through all available agents and create a job There were no agents checked in when this error was generated The error message should state that no agents were found not that the broadcast identifier is invalid Pull Request PR Checklist x I have read the CONTRIBUTING

interface allows for creating agents with different transport options much more seamlessly Still requires a bit of heavy lifting on the server side to define behaviour that might come at a later date

Bugfix Modification Removal Security Description Adding the ability to generate agents from within Merlin Workinprogress but wanted to get visibility over some of the approaches that could be taken to allow this in order to get feedback etc Add the ability to issue a jobs command and see all jobs per agent along with their status Some status could include created This is when the job has been entered into the server but not sent to the agent sent This is when the job has been sent to the agent from the server
