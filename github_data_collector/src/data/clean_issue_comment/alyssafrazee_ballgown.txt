I am using a ballgown R package to Run the differential expression analysis Following is my pheno data example I have two conditions and replicates ids Treatment cell sample drug wt C sample drug wt C

have any suggestion to why it doesnt like the pData Thank you Hi I run this and its working properly But i also want to add ENST ids What is understand is to change geneNames to the name allocated by ballgown to transcripts id in this syntax tname ballgowngeneNamesbgchrX I am able to get that name Can you please help me for this Code I am using resultstranscripts stattestbgchrX

differential gene expression I have the six sample in my data set The final list of differential gene expression obtain from the ballgown contain no sample name from which I can calculate the number of DE gene in corresponding samples how I can get the information number of differential expressed genes in one sample and so in second third and so on Hello Thank you working on this tool its quite useful However Ive not been able to generate plots using plotTranscript using the master version nor the devel branch for ATRX that has multiple transcripts in my ballgown input files from stringtie Im using plotTranscriptsgeneMSTRG gownbg measFPKMsamples sample colorbytranscript where MSTRG is the ATRX geneID from stringTie Error in smalldat colIndex incorrect number of dimensions Using the same command Im able to generate the plots from the examples Is there something Ive missed or is there a workaround Hi I am using the ballgown package I have encountered errorThe script is
