Hope to support Chinese lunar calendar I have many events in my calendar and use the shortcut of itsycal to pop up the calendar along with my events However when there are many events its hard to find the current or upcoming event Itd be great if when I open the calendar it automatically scrolls to the current event Perhaps a horizontal line is used to indicate the current timeevent Thanks for the great work I am running Itsycal on Catalina and when I try to open the preference the app isnt responding and keep showing the calendar on top of the screen I have to force exit the app using activity monitor I wonder if there is a solution to this problem When I open Itsycal it apeare a warning windows Move Itsycal to the Applications folder Itsycal must be run from the Applications folder in order to work properly Please quit Itsycal move it to the Applications folder and relaunch privatevarfoldersqqdthxdpmd d sqxkwjp yb gnTAppTranslocationD A B EF AF C FE A DD dItsycalapp in fact I was copy the app to the Applications folder and run on it It was good to have weekend red highlight By default system time clock has its own systray time format stored in defaults can you read initial value from its content or also store it backwards defaults write comapplemenuextraclock DateFormat string yyyyMMMdd EEE Hmm Not sure what it means but when I try to send money Im getting Sorry you dont have the permission to send a payment Please request for access from the account owner And for sure it referening to your account not mine Anyway money is evil just Thanks you Hi First of all I really love this app and Im using it daily Great job So my issue really is around URLs in calendar events Before the last update I was able to click a link in Itsycal and it would take me to the online meeting but now the URLs are deformed and are no longer clickable Special characters no longer work as well so maybe theres an issue with encoding Screenshot at Hi sfsam Could I translate it into Korean Thanks Would it be possible to show a clock or at least the exact time with seconds in the popup when you open Itsycal Sometimes you need the time with seconds and Itsycal would be the perfect place for it I know you can give a custom format including the seconds in the menubar but perhaps there should be two separate formats for in the menubar short Wed Feb to show as a first line in the popup Long Wednesday
