why the method for updatepbest for mopsocd and smpso is different Im always frustrated when I try to see the plot of highdimensional points using parallel coordinates I wish you could use Nasseh method Despite the parallel coordinates popularity it might not be the best choice as it is not compatible with our previous understanding of uptothree dimensional points as dots Using Nasseh method is a proper alternative to parallel coordinates in such cases as it visualizes highdimensional points as tailed dots CMaOPs are needed At present most of the constraint problems on platEMO are CMOP As DASCMOP has been updated I sincerely hope that platEMO can update DASCMaOPs It could be possible to use the variables in Search Space on metrics functions instead of Pareto Front only Add optional argument to the output function In order to add more flexibilities to specify the outputFcn parameters I add some optional arguments to it In addition now the data storage path in the original output function GLOBALOutput can be specified now Test case Defalut function call style without any output function parameters is compatible matlab mainalgorithm MOEAD problem DTLZ run N evalution save Test case When mode is set to you are able to pass a function handle as an output function matlab mainalgorithm MOEAD problem DTLZ run N evalution save mode outputFcn testfunc arg arg Here is an example implementation of testfunc matlab function testfuncobj arg arg obj is GLOBAL object other is argument savetestmat obj end Test case If you only want to pass parameter to orignal output function to specify the output path you can replace function handle by matlab mainalgorithm MOEAD problem DTLZ run N evalution save mode outputFcn MyData Now the output path is changed to MyData Describe the bug Open application and type main in the command line the GUI will hang and application not responding Expected behavior GUI should start regularly Screenshots If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem Desktop please complete the following information OS Mac OS X Browser Chrome Version receive parameter settings from users for metrics function For preferencebased evolutionary multiobjective optimization it is necessary to receive parameter settings from users for metric calculation like RHV RIGD from While this is not feasible in present PlatEMO RMetric Evaluating the Performance of PreferenceBased Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization Using Reference Points function MOEADGRGlobal algorithm HN Wang Z Zhang Q Gong M Zhou A July A Replacement Strategy for Balancing Convergence and Diversity in MOEAD In IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation CEC pp IEEE delta The probability of choosing parents locally operator DE Copyright c BIMK Group You are free to use the PlatEMO for research purposes All publications which use this platform or any code in the platform should acknowledge the use of PlatEMO and reference Ye Tian Ran Cheng Xingyi Zhang and Yaochu Jin PlatEMO A MATLAB Platform for Evolutionary MultiObjective Optimization Educational Forum IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine Written by Lucas Farias Parameter setting delta GlobalParameterSet Generate the weight vectors WGlobalN UniformPointGlobalNGlobalM Size of neighborhood T ceilGlobalN Detect the neighbours of each solution B pdist WW B sortB B B T Generate random population Population GlobalInitialization Z minPopulationobjs Optimization while GlobalNotTerminationPopulation for i GlobalN Choose the parents if rand delta P BirandpermsizeB else P randpermGlobalN end Generate an offspring Offspring GlobalVariationPopulation iP DE Update the ideal point Z minZOffspringobj Global Replacement allgTCHmaxabsOffspringobjrepmatZGlobalN W bestgTCHminallgTCH Chosenone findallgTCH bestgTCH P BChosenone randpermsizeB Update the solutions in P by Tchebycheff approach gold maxabsPopulationPobjsrepmatZlengthP WP gnew maxrepmatabsOffspringobjZlengthP WP PopulationPfindgoldgnewT Offspring end end end function Score HausdorffPopObjPF metric max Averaged Hausdorff Distance O Schutze X Esquivel A Lara and C A C Coello Using the averaged hausdorff distance as a performance measure in evolutionary multiobjective optimization IEEE Trans Evol Comp vol pp Aug Copyright c BIMK Group You are free to use the PlatEMO for research purposes All publications which use this platform or any code in the platform should acknowledge the use of PlatEMO and reference Ye Tian Ran Cheng Xingyi Zhang and Yaochu Jin PlatEMO A MATLAB Platform for Evolutionary MultiObjective Optimization Educational Forum IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine Written by Thiago Santos professorufopbrsantostf cGD GDPopObjPF cIGD IGDPopObjPF Score maxcGDcIGD end
