 Disable nomodeline as a security precaution One of my installsh starts nvim and that reads the other installsh paths from stdin This prevents them from running Ive solved this by using finds exec to run the installshs find name installsh exec sh c I think this may be a selfcreated issue but the battery status addition in my Bash profile seems to be leading to accidental visual line overwrites When I wrap the line Terminal and iTerm have trouble figuring out the length of the line and it overwrites on top of my existing text and then if I delete back to the prompt even lets me delete part of the prompt Any idea what I might be doing wrong Are there settings I should be adjusting in either the prompt or batterystatus files Screen Shot at AM Certain libraries and plugins eg neomake may have zsh files in test folders These are not intended to be sourced when starting up Some systems dont allow direct access to the sysctl command at the regular user level This gets around that by checking if we can access the command directly from zshes commands magic variable Hi thanks for the best dotfiles yet Now to my problem Currently when being in a detached HEAD state the prompt throws up and always shows a warning that fatal ref HEAD is not a symbolic ref and shows an incomplete prompt eg in dotfiles on This PR fixes that and displays in dotfiles on detached HEAD Maybe the message could be tweak a little maybe show commit sha but is in my opinion way better than throwing an error Hi First of all great job with your dotfiles i was looking for one since a long time and yours dotfiles are amazing My issue is a problem with tmux and i dont know how to fix it just because im new with tmux and still learning it I run your script on ubuntu with WSL issue If anyone can help me it will be nice
