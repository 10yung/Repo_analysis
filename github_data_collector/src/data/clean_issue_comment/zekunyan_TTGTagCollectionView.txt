 TTGTagCollectionAlignmentFillByExpandingWidthExceptLastLine item Instead of adding configurationtextFont can you also add a NSAttributedString propertly contentSize delegate method is getting called but the selection delegate methods are not calling in swift TTGTagCollectionAlignmentFillByExpandingWidthExceptLastLine item TTGTagCollectionAlignmentFillByExpandingWidth TTGTagCollectionAlignmentFillByExpandingWidthExceptLastLine It would be nice to be able to set accessibilityIdentifier on the tags easily If I want to add this myself do you have a recommended place to do so I looked at the code briefly and I might be able to add a tagAccessibilityIdentifier in the config then set that identifier when a tag is being displayed As tags are essentially buttons the accessibility property isSelected is also needed I use accesibility identifiers for UI testing to be able to see which items are selected and which are not unfortunately this tool does not seem to easily support this right now
