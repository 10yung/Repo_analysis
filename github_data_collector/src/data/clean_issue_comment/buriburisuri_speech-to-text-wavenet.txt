how do you specify inpu channels and output channels in conv d layer So that this would be deployable in a google deep learning container And thanks for developing speechtotextwavenet I am learning about CTC losses and wonder why the CTC losses are so high I am doing your project but for another language and dataset and found that the loss is around Is there any explanation about this WaveNet seems to classify a frame based on the samples within the frame where as RNN models infer information from the previous frames and current frame to classify the current frame Is it true If so is it not inefficient How about adding RNNs after WaveNet and before classification Thanks SR Hi This is excellent work BTW I wrote the sox program in and its nice to see people still using it Cheers Lance I am running the pretrained model in a docker container After doing the speechtotext conversion and printing the output the code always dumps core python recognizepy file xxxwav W tensorflowcoreplatformcpufeatureguardcc The TensorFlow library wasnt compiled to use SSE instructions but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations W tensorflowcoreplatformcpufeatureguardcc The TensorFlow library wasnt compiled to use SSE instructions but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations W tensorflowcoreplatformcpufeatureguardcc The TensorFlow library wasnt compiled to use SSE instructions but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations W tensorflowcoreplatformcpufeatureguardcc The TensorFlow library wasnt compiled to use AVX instructions but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations W tensorflowcoreplatformcpufeatureguardcc The TensorFlow library wasnt compiled to use AVX instructions but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations W tensorflowcoreplatformcpufeatureguardcc The TensorFlow library wasnt compiled to use AVX F instructions but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations W tensorflowcoreplatformcpufeatureguardcc The TensorFlow library wasnt compiled to use FMA instructions but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations speech to text conversion shows up here Segmentation fault core dumped hello thanks for publish this code i have compiled youre code in python in google colab service and enable gpu mode i have installed requirements tensorflow and sugartensor when i compile trainpy i encounterd this message warning tensorflowcoreplatformcpufeatureguardcc The TensorFlow library wasnt compiled to use SSE instructions but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations W tensorflowcoreplatformcpufeatureguardcc The TensorFlow library wasnt compiled to use SSE instructions but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations W tensorflowcoreplatformcpufeatureguardcc The TensorFlow library wasnt compiled to use SSE instructions but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations W tensorflowcoreplatformcpufeatureguardcc The TensorFlow library wasnt compiled to use AVX instructions but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations W tensorflowcoreplatformcpufeatureguardcc The TensorFlow library wasnt compiled to use AVX instructions but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations W tensorflowcoreplatformcpufeatureguardcc The TensorFlow library wasnt compiled to use FMA instructions but these are available on your machine and could speed up CPU computations the during of one epoch is hours in VCTK can i help me to fix this problem very very thanks I datapy TRAIN set loadedtotal data total batch I sgtrainpy Training started from epoch step train sb C Hello I pulled the docker image and run a docker container when I am trying to run python recognizepy file assetdataLibriSpeechtestclean flac I get the following error rootb bfbeb speechtotextwavenet python recognizepy file assetdataLibriSpeechtestclean flac Traceback most recent call last File recognizepy line in module wav librosaloadtfsgargfile monoTrue sr File usrlocallibpython distpackageslibrosacoreaudiopy line in load with audioreadaudioopenospathrealpathpath as inputfile File usrlocallibpython distpackagesaudioreadinitpy line in audioopen return rawreadRawAudioFilepath File usrlocallibpython distpackagesaudioreadrawreadpy line in init selffh openfilename rb IOError Errno Is a directory rootspeechtotextwavenet any feedback would be great thanks Costas When I try to load model for visualization using Tensorboard I can see data from tabs Scalar Distribution and Histogram Although tab Graph is loaded it shows me nothing but a big white picture So I guess that it cannot read from file graphpbtxt PLEASE help me for fixing this THANKS for advance
