Hellowonderful u I want to train the model on the LIVE dataset and test on TID Howeverthey have different labeldmos for LIVEmos for TID I noticed that some articles will give that A nonlinear mapping based on a logistic functionalways applied to FR measures is applied for transforming the quality measure into a certain rangeWe randomly split the TID into and is used for estimating parameters of the logistic function and for testing the transformed prediction scores So I find the FR measures transform method in Howeverwhen I use the above method the test results SROCC is so low and so different with the other cross dataset test results I want to ask if you know the certain method of transforming DMOS to MOS or any advice for me Thank you very much
