 function viewDidLayoutSubviews line let isLandscape itemViewboundswidth itemViewboundsheight this is not the device direction It would be nice if there was a way to prompt the user for delete confirmation before an image is deleted I was thinking we could add a separate delegate method called shouldRemoveGalleryItem so we could make sure that the user wants to delete Ive created a PR here Another option is to make GalleryImageViewControllerdeleteItem a public method so we can supply our own delete button in the header or footer and call the deleteItem method ourselves I didnt create a PR for this option but let me know what you think Add delegate method shouldRemoveGalleryItem so users can be presented with an alert prior to deleting an image shouldRemoveGalleryItem has a default implementation so that existing users of this library remain unaffected is it possible to load image using URL instead of download to UIImageView first When I swipe really fast on the image viewer to dismiss it sometimes it doesnt do the smooth sliding dismiss animation but jumps up and down then disappears It looks like a glitch See the gif RPReplayFinal Krisiacik This is a great open source project but it looks like its dying due to lack of updates I know how hard it is to keep up with issues and PRs Would you consider moving this repo to Github organization andor allow other developers commit access That way more people could help to maintain this project and keep it alive It would be a shame for it to die When testing our app with iOS we see that hiding the status bar no longer works Looking into the source code I can see you move the application window above the statusbar window which seems not to work anymore
