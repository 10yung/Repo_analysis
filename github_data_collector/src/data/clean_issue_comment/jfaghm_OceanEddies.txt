Hi there We are trying to use EddyScan to simply draw hulls around eddies in the GOM HYCOM from SSH We can get the code to run just fine Where were running into trouble is how to visualize the hulls created by EddieScan as the centroids are in degrees Lon Lat but the other attributes of the hulls are in pixels which we think are linked to the area map however its not clear where the pixel IDs are or how we could use the output in any way other than in the GUI visualizer Any thoughts Many thanks Quote from readme Below is an example for using scansinglem assuming current directory is eddyscan Find all anticyclonic eddies sshslice ncreadsshdatanc Grid No such sshdatanc file found in the eddyscan directory Dear SirMadam I have a problem to run the script in the Persian Gulf area I have ssh files and area map and other files specific for the area but it returns Scanning SSH data for eddies Iteration ans Invalid areamap using NaN for eddy surface area Subscript indices must either be real positive integers or logicals Error in bottomupsingle line sshExtended sshdata end threshold end sshdata sshdata threshold Error in scansingle line eddies bottomupsinglessh lat lon areamap ctype varargin Error in completerun line anteddies scansinglesshdata lat lon datesi anticyc scantype areamap sshUnits SSHUnits can any one help me to solve it I can send all of my data if needed Sincerely Dear I am not familiar with python And I want to learn about it Should I install Python to run and modify the code of you which is in python Hi Im a freshman in the field and confused about inputs and outputs I have run the eddyscanm with the CMEMS SLA data However in the scripts SSH is input so I dont know whether SLA is appropriate for the scripts In the outputs Im confused about the units of the variables In addition all I need is the latitude longitude of eddy center maximum amplitude and radius of the detected eddy Are Lat Lon SurfaceArea and Amplitude corresponding to the latitude longitude radius and maximum amplituderespectively right Hello I followed the instruction mentioned in A daily global mesoscale ocean eddy dataset from satellite altimetry and I could run the setup SSH data The input was dtglobalenphyvxxcl ncgz which extracted from ftpftpsltacclsfrCoreSEALEVELGLOPHYL REPOBSERVATIONS datasetduacsrepglobalenphyunfilteredl v and results were following items lonmat which contains matrix latmat which contains matrix SSH mat SSH mat SSH mat Datesmat I expected to have a matrix as SSH output but I had just matrix Maybe I have not used right input file Also following errors reported Error using scansingle line Error Invalid SSH data size should be lengthlat lengthlon Would you please advise me how to solve this problem Best Regards Boshra Hello My concern is if the matlab codes you are providing are prepared for SLA data or for SSH data In the paper it says that you used SLA data but in the codes it is written SSH everywhere I am asking because I am getting pretty different results on the eddy polarity if I am using SLA or SSH With SLA the most common eddy polarity in the Mediterranean computed as ant cycant cyc looks like a random map while with SSH it makes sense Thanks Hello First of all thank you for making this tool freely available Im using MatLabs version to track and characterize the eddy field around Cape Verde Everything worked fine However Im getting seemingly incorrect geographical patterns for the rotational speed eddiesinsiderotspeed daysv I posted a similar result in a comment related with the same issue What bothers me the most is the close to zero speed values Is this problem related with the tolerancetracklnn or the processeddiesandtrackstolerance Or am I doing something wrong Greetings Cl udio Cardoso Hi Its a great work for your team to provide such an validate method to detect eddies Using your code I studied statistical characters of eddies in the South China Sea In order to compare results through your code and Cheltons dataset from to we limit amplitude biger than cm and lifetime longer than days Compared with Cheltons dataset lots of characters of this codes have validate improvements eg number of eddies frequency polarity amplitude However mean geotrophic speed and radius are much smaller than Cheltons This is rahter confusing According to geostrophic equilibrium if radius is smaller bigger the geotrophic speed is bigger smaller Take cyclonic eddies for example cheltonetalcycars faghmousetalcycars Would you mind explaining this phenomenon I am looking forward to your reply Best wishes jfaghm addpathprojectexpeditionsalindellFullEddyViewerdatacode Why this line is there in the prepareeddydataforviewerm Is it required
