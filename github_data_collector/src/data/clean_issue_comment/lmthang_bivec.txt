If i want to train another bilingual embeddingwhat should i dothe file which is called data kalign really make me confused Looks like the previous code was not saving to disk target embeddings Using only GetWordHashunkword to check whether the unk token is included in the vocabulary can fail if there was other token with the same hash Using SearchVocab function instead solves the problem Would it be possible to have some more guidance on how to run cldc part Thank you Currently when bivec is trained without evaluation option target vector is not saved This request moves the SaveVector for target language out of the evaluation scope so that the target vector is saved regardless of eval option
