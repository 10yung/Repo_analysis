Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe When I send a image with a high resolution for example to Gotify server the image is very large in the display Describe the solution youd like Apply a default size px for example in the display or show the image as an attachment Having an option to show the created datetime instead of timeago for messages see here Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I want to create and maintain a platform independent dockercompose file to build my home automation system on any hardware x VPS or Arm SBC Describe the solution youd like It would be useful therefore if Gotify were to use the Docker MultiArch build process so that it only be referenced by gotifyserver regardless of which platform it is running on Describe alternatives youve considered I could attempt to do the build process myself but it would then mean it would slowly drift out of sync with any updates and Watchtower would not work unless I went in and rebuilt the image myself when I knew there was an update Additional context The MultiArch build process also builds more Arm versions than just v for example it also builds v and arm which would enable wider support of devices older Pis or performance gains on more modern arm devices Hi all Im trying to replace Pushbullet and am brand spanking new to Gotify I just installed the server and now am looking for a client that I can install on my windows machines to popup notifications as they come in like PB does Is there one available TIA Have you read the documentation x Yes but it does not include related information regarding my question Yes but the steps described in the documentation do not work on my machine Yes but I am having difficulty understanding it and want clarification You are setting up gotify in Docker x Linux native platform x Windows native platform Describe your problem Hi I would like to inquire if theres any plan for a desktop client Yes the web app is functional with sufficient features however the web pushbased notifications will not work after the tab is closed Even if we employ a service worker in the background it still will not work after the chrome process has exited Such limitation makes those who want to view notifications on a for example a windows desktop quite difficult However I understand the weight of maintaining another desktop app so this is not submitted as a feature request rather as a question So are there any plans for a basic desktop client Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe No Describe the solution youd like A way of configuring the server to listen on a unix socket For example you could join the listenaddr and the port into a single option called listen Then the listen option could either get passed localhost or unixtmpgotifysock Describe alternatives youve considered na Additional context na Hi It would be nice if the web app provide a way to search and list the messages Also would be nice if the cli app can do that too thanks Have you read the documentation x Yes but it does not include related information regarding my question Yes but the steps described in the documentation do not work on my machine Yes but I am having difficulty understanding it and wants clarification You are setting up gotify in Docker x Linux native platform Windows native platform Describe your problem I was just curious if there are any plans to have the WebUI clean up old clients that are no longer in use or perhaps reuse the same client Its somewhat annoying to see a client created for each and every WebUI login and from a security perspective I dont like that all these tokens are out there until I manually delete them all Of course I can go in and delete them though this is somewhat tedious and it would be really nice if there were a way to avoid this in the first place Cheers Selection Anyone with a Server behind HAProxy I always got Timeouts after Minute Already tried difference timeouts but nothing helps Thanks Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe This is a feature request to provide amd bit builds of gotify server available for download Currently OpenBSD isnt a download option See here Describe the solution youd like I would like to be able to download a tar gz file of gotify server then uncompress which would run on OpenBSD amd Describe alternatives youve considered None I think development should switch to whatever current platform theyre using now to OpenBSD See here Additional context I will give a thumbs up once an OpenBSD amd bit build is made available
