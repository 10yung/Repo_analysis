Description If you change the fab alignment mode and replace the menu in the BottomAppBar the items get replaced times It looks like the icons are flickering Expected behavior There should be a smooth transition of the items if they change the side in the BottomAppBar Also the animation should not be affected if in this time the menu items change Source code

result on rc No change has been made apart from material version Screenshot Android API version Material Library version alpha and above Device Nexus X emulator with Im using a LayoutMediator to set the text I tried to see if the text was not getting set Heres what the layout inspector gave Screen Shot at PM and the textview properties Screen Shot at PM Description The component doesnt feel responsive or snappy due to Overzealous and slippery horizontal scrolling where accidentally scrolling too fast skips several pages rather than snapping like you would expect from any normal ViewPager Honestly this is the most finicky and annoying thing ever Laggy and jittery not fps horizontal scrolling on at least my own device and emulator Forced animations and sometimes even ignored click events after clicking dates because a circle is filled with a grey reveal animation that causes a delayed visual cue In comparison to a traditional DatePickerDialog this is a step forward in terms of design but a step backwards in terms of responsiveness Android API version Material Library version alpha Device Oppo Find X Emulators When the user needs to declare a password we always have a second edittext with the hint confirm password We would like that when the show password eye is clicked also this second editText shows the passwordhides it Currently you can set an onClickListener on the eye and implement your own logic but if you do this you override the super logic there isnt a public way of getting the PasswordToggleEndIconDelegate so one could add a listener to it Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe We need the possibility to define the Password Transformation Method to be used when the password is hidden why We want to aovid the letters are being shown on input despite its only for a second we dont want the input is being seen at all As far as I know this is currently not possible Describe the solution youd like Support for the Slider component to have a lower bounds value and an upper bounds value Additional context See the Material Design specs Description Full description of issue here Expected behavior Screenshots andor

TextAppearance passed either as collapsedTextAppearance or expandedTextAppearance is ignored Describe the solution youd like The simple solution seems that if either collapsedTextAppearance or expandedTextAppearance have textAllCapstrue the text would be capitalized or probably provide attribute for CollapsingToolbarLayout that would take care of it Describe alternatives youve considered Passing already capitalized String as title Description The material catalog has the option to go edgetoedge as is recommended by Google The automatic scrim as described in the docs is not applied Quote from docs However when the user is in button or button navigation mode these buttons dont change color Instead the system applies a translucent background so the buttons stay visible However the system can only do this if the app targets API level or higher I tested this in my own app and the material catalog app I even updated the catalog app to targetSDK as the docs say But on my Android Q emulator a scrim is applied but on SDK level for instance it is not Expected behavior A scrim should be applied if the user uses the older button navigation on all android versions Left SDK right
