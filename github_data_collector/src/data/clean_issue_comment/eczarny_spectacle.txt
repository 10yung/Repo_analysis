This project is not being actively maintained Unfortunately after almost a decade of onandoff development I can no longer dedicate the time needed to be a responsible maintainer of this project Spectacle will remain available for download but please use at your own risk The source code will continue to be free and open to anyone so feel free to make Spectacle your own Just came across as I was setting up a mac from scratch today The end of an era will miss the glasses icon in the menu bar spectacle has been a great productivity tool Thanks for all the work youve done Undo function does not work on double monitor setup When I move app from screen to screen I cannot undo it I really like the tool and I use it for years lately I got a to work on a windows pc and I actually think that the way the snap is working on windows is better It is hard to explain exactly the shortcuts but it feel very natural Do you think it will be possible to implement a windows mode Currently Full Screen actually triggers the native fullscreen that takes over all monitors I very often find myself using ShiftOptionMaximize on windows to make them take up the entire screen without entering the native fullscreen mode If none of these words are actual terminology thats meaningful sorry heres the difference I mean Fullscreen currently does the same thing as the green dot here I would love to see an additional option to do the ShiftOption variant of that same green dot Thank you for the work you put into this app I love it To Save Battery Turn display off and not put the system to sleep pmset displaysleepnow Allow the user to configureset his own combination of keys for this I think it would be nice to add an option to make the window full height on the current display Im wondering if this feature already exists or not if not Dont you think that it would be beneficial for many people to have that feature Id love to be able to switch focus to a specific window by typing a few letters of its title this would entail enumerating all active windows and Cocoa compliant tabs and having a separate hotkey to pop up a search widget which could hang off the menu like the Spotlight of yore but would be a godsend for those of us who have RSI andor trouble moving their hands to and fro the keyboard no more CmdTabbing everywhere I press from menu or use key combination for going to pushing window to next display but it does nothing I hear just default mac sound for unsupported key combination like in terminal if you type controlz I have MacOS Mojave Spectacle When I try and run Spectacle I get an error message saying Build Error Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code img width altScreen Shot at PM src
