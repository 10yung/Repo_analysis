callbacks on iOS Cause Basically we were not accounting for the fact that source application is no longer shared on iOS for applications that are from different application security groups See Followup We need to add back the sanity checks that are being bypassed by this fix It seemed more important to get the fix out quickly Also need to update the documentation to include instructions for adding code to invoke FBSDKApplicationDelegate from SceneDelegates openURL method This should fix Test Plan Test Plan With the native app installed build and check that the delegates are invokes correctly for a simulator device running and Both Should work Make sure that the sample app includes the SceneDelegate code availableiOS func scene scene UIScene openURLContexts URLContexts
