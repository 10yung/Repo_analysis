Now you have provide realtime waveform spectrum Can you also add the realtime spectrogram please Hello I am trying to use this code on a raspberry pito make a live oscilloscope as a prototype for my modular synthesizer I have main errors one says File homepiDesktopWaveformviewer py line matplotlib tk SyntaxError invalid syntax I tried bypassing it by commenting it with a but it brought up File homepiDesktopWaveformviewer py line in module import pyaduio ImportError No module named pyaudio To resolve this I have tried running install commands in the terminal updates upgrades all that sort of backend stuff but its still not working please help Hello Mark First of all all thank you very much for the very nice video on youtube with great ideas and the script that you provide on your website Those are very interesting projects Im trying in macOS and run then code of Spectrum analyzer that you provide with the following code Notebook for streaming data from a microphone in realtime audio is captured using pyaudio then converted from binary data to ints using struct then displayed using matplotlib scipyfftpack computes the FFT if you dont have pyaudio then run pip install pyaudio note with samples per chunk Im getting FPS when also running the spectrum its about FPS import pyaudio import os import struct import numpy as np import matplotlibpyplot as plt from scipyfftpack import fft

continuous wave forms without having any inputAfter connecting michrophone also it is giving the same waveforms alwaysoscillations How can I make it take my live speech and show it as wave form Thanking you Im a bit new to Python and some of the modules used here Odd errors that Im just unable to troubleshoot thismanagerwindowsetGeometry File usrlibpython tkinterinitpy line in getattr return

speakers are fully functional Running in a Python virtual environment Note Im able to run python audiospectrumQTpy successfully in the same virtualbox Works just fine Any clue as to whats going on here Many thanks to Mark Jay for the youtube videos and this github repo enabling us to better learn how Fast Fourier Transforms FFT work reference Lets Build an Audio Spectrum Analyzer in Python pt the waveform viewer Mark Jay Published on Sep Lets Build an Audio Spectrum Analyzer in Python pt the spectrum viewer Mark Jay Published on Sep Lets Build an Audio Spectrum Analyzer in Python pt Switching to PyQtGraph Mark Jay Published on Oct The two steps conversion of audio data to numpy array seems buggy to me It should take into account and afaik it does not that the most significant bit of every second byte has negative weight ie the numeric representation is in twos complement Perhaps a good starting point is to use this one step conversion datanp npfrombufferdatainp dtypei which lands in the range and add an offset if desired
