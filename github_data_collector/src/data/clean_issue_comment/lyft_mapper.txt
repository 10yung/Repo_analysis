 Hey guys Id like to contribute with this changes in NSDictionary and NSArray to use Swift literal dictionary and array keith can you take a look at this please Issue I am trying to map a dictonary where the keys have for example gcmmessageid How can I use the Mapper to not see those as a path The Mappable protocol uses NSDictionary and NSArray in its convenience methods swift public static func from JSON NSDictionary Self public static func from JSON NSArray Self Since Swift continues to move away from Objective C with I would propose to change the types to String Any and Any String Any so it integrates more naturally in Swift development Or is there any good reason to prefer NSDictionaryNSArray over these
