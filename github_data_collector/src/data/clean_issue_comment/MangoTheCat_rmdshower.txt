I thought Id be nice to upgrade to the latest upstream shower which offers some interesting new features Also makes it easier for users if the upstream docs are in sync with this package This is still work in progress and I might have broken things Ill use this in my own work and try to test fix all the features Thought Id raise this PR already to let people know that this is being worked on Will update this conversation once I think its ready for review Im only using the builtin theme and this probably breaks compatibility with the custom themes TODOS x pass on progress bar arg x pass on aspect ratio x pass on colorkey x fix code highlighting x fix shout color x fix multiple heading per slide maybe compatibility with theme pkgs such as earl mango etc set up automatic CI for skeleton enable remaining pandoc features maybe source out the pandoc template to a separate repo enable skeleton for RStudio again deleted because of code duplication example currently just lives in well example A change in Pandoc broke title slide translation Hi there After upgrading R to ver and consequently the packages rmarkdown and rmdshower I cannot render my own presentations created a few weeks ago I get the following issue The code in my source file title imgfig png is rendered pimg datasrcimgfig png alttitlep rather than pimg srcimgfig png alttitlep The issue affects the following setup macOS High Sierra R version rmarkdown And it works flawlessly on a Linux machine regardless of the upgrades Debian GNULinux jessie R version rmarkdown Heres the output block in my yaml header yaml output rmdshowershowerpresentation selfcontained true theme material incremental true katex true ratio x This returns the following error when knitting pandocexe Could not fetch slidesfilesrmdshowerpackagestylesscreen x css slidesfilesrmdshowerpackagestylesscreen x css openBinaryFile does not exist No such file or directory Error pandoc document conversion failed with error In addition Warning message running command CProgram FilesRStudiobinpandocpandoc RTS K m RTS slidesutf md to revealjs from markdownautolinkbareurisasciiidentifierstexmathsinglebackslashimplicitfigures output slideshtml smart emailobfuscation none selfcontained template C RLibrary rmdshower rmarkdown templates shower resources defaulthtml incremental slidelevel variableratio x variablekatexyes mathjax variable mathjaxurl variableshowerurlslidesfiles rmdshower variablethemematerial variableshowerthemeurlslidesfilesrmdshower highlightstyle pygments had status Execution halted Hi great work on this rmarkdown shower template Does the title slide of this rmarkdown version deliberately deviate from the original shower framework I particularly like the latter is it possible to recreate it in the rmarkdown version I see that if I change the fill attribute of the path tag in rmdshowernodemodulesshowerribbonimagesribbonsvg I can change the ribbon color But is there a way that I can pass that attribute through the Rmd file Could a ribboncolor argument be added to showerpresentation Or is there a way to do this with CSS In getting rmdshower to work with ari I came across two small tweaks to options that I think would be useful numbered anchors Currently slides have titlebased anchors slideshtmlintroduction I think numbered anchors are better for slideshows slideshtml and for ari they are required to advance the slides This can be changed by removing the autoidentifiers option from pandoc markdown I would just make this default behavior base presentation view shower slides control whether default view is the overview of slides or the first slide by switching between body classshower list and body classshower full I would add an option to showerpresentation baseview with list as default but also taking full ari also needs full view Happy to do a PR with these if you agree and are still maintaining the package This is a placeholder to remind me to tell dougmet that we need to rerelease rmdshower on CRAN otherwise it doesnt work with the new rmdshowermango theme the CRAN release still uses the old theme
