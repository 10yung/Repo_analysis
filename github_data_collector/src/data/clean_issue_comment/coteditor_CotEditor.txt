Our IT consists of terminal sessions from clients on our local server To be able to edit files on the server in a comfortable way we send the file to the client with scp edit it locally with CotEditor sshing following command ssh q mbimacmblocal t ApplicationsCotEditorappContentsSharedSupportbincot wait filetxt and then scp the file back on the server Normally this works perfect but in some cases and on some Laptops we get this error message File ApplicationsCotEditorappContentsSharedSupportbincot line in module mainargs stdin File ApplicationsCotEditorappContentsSharedSupportbincot line in main appopenpath File ApplicationsCotEditorappContentsSharedSupportbincot line in open selftellopen POSIX file formatpath isasyncTrue File ApplicationsCotEditorappContentsSharedSupportbincot line in tell raise error subprocessCalledProcessError Command ignoring application responses tell app ApplicationsCotEditorapp to open POSIX file Usersmbetpckal end ignoring returned nonzero exit status With a large file lines selecting a line to the right with shiftcmd quickly highlights the line but selecting a line to the left with shiftcmd has a delay The larger the file the longer the delay in highlighting the line If I select a word with optshift there is no delay Im using MacOS Catalina and CotEditor Its really not efficient to run script by clicking Scripts ScriptYouWannaRun or rightclicking Scripts ScriptYouWannaRun If I need running a script highfrequently it really annoys me since keybinding is not allowed to scripts Is there a way to bing keystokes in the Preferences to self defined scripts Im using MacOS Catalina CotEditor v MAS It should be admitted that the write to console command is a great feature in v but its so limited as to found The timestamp and running script name line The prefixed spaces each line following the timestamp and running script name line is unnecessary and annoying problems the line height the space between lines too close font ligated text in the timestamp part is ligated or not monospaced as declared font family maybe monospaced as declared but not same as the editor font I set in the preferences cannot the prompted small console window to the most front expected it would be better if cot supports tabs in console window such as create new console window create new console tab commands supports clear console command adds options to turn off the timestamp and running script name line and the prefixed spaces supports text settings like font family font size line height letter spacing better IF there will be Console tab in the Preferences supports being attached to the main window to the right to the bottom supports Currently I must press optionescmacos to get the associationI wonder if you can add this feature thx CotEditor System macOS Version Language English Environment CotEditor System macOS B Language Japanese Short Description Steps to Reproduce the Issue Expected Result FIrstly thanks for a great little editor Could you add a save as function In a typical workflow we often incrementally make changes to existing files but need to keep the original unchanged for testing version control etc Currently we have to copy and paste into a new document to save as a new file Then have to remember the exact filepath and filename of the source file to keep our filing system neat It would be great to have SAVE AS and have that offer up the current file path as the save location and the current filename with string copy or appended before file extension If this feature has been asked and rejected before I am sorry but it is worth considering again Environment CotEditor System macOS B Language Japanese Short Description PHP sting when i use as a string value at PHP its line is recognized for commentout Steps to Reproduce the Issue ffdede it is stress because this line is recognized commentouts color from ffdede to EOL ifk moji ltDIV stylebackgroundffdede gthogehoge ltDIV gt else moji Expected Result refer to Steps to Reproduce the Issue There should be an option to check spelling only on comments and strings the spelling feature is useless for code as most of the code is underlined as misspellings CotEditor System macOS Version Build G Language English As previously mentioned in it would be great to be able to press tab for autocompletion as in accordance with other editors including Sublime Text CotEditor System macOS Version Build G Language English
