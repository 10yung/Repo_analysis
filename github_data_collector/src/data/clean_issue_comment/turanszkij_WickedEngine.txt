Translator tool can mess up boneobject parenting hierarchy and causes the model to blow up Not exactly sure of the conditions but happens a lot ShadowResolution Is there a setting I need to tweak I dont remember this being a problem before build SPIRV got some error the file cullingShaderHFhlsli is exist but a fatal error reportted cullingShaderHFhlsli file not found buildSPIRVerrorslog Most visible in less detailed shadow cascades Controller test is very bare bones need better way that visualizes inputs playerindex change vibration effect change LED color Documentation should be rewritten basically Some large refactors should be finished first like Would be nice to add a system diagram Decide the convention I saw there are some member with lower camel case others with upper camel case or something like resultpassed maybe good would be to have lower camel case for struct members IE TextureDesc Remove all shader specialization and keep only Shader with ShaderStage maybe What do you think MSAAResolve should be part of RenderPass and not expose it like it is now In Vulkan it is generally recommended to do this as part of a renderpass so shouldnt maintain a version that is potentially less optimal than it should be DownloadResource is currently designed to stall the GPU but easy to use However this is not good practice and difficult to implement in DX and Vulkan Instead DownloadResource functionality should be removed and instead add the ability to CopyBufferCopyTexture or CopyResource Readback staging buffertexture Like GPU queries it will be up to the user to ringbuffer downloading resources Helper functionality could be added just like GPUQueryRing to safely read back resources without stalling the GPU
