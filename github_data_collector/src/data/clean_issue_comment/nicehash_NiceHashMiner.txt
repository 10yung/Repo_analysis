Hello NHML version is Every minutes permanent restart miner Algorithm not changed Bug use case x Ti work on Cuckaroom GMiner Please fix this bug See Video Hey guys Not sure whats happening but with each release i am seeing more and more issues and less and less miners working and benchmarking Firewalls are set correctly nothing else is blocking the miners I am seeing constant restarts connection errors Object reference errors etc and not so much mining these days Happy to provide the logs but wanted a general opinion if this is just me or others are getting the same treatment This may sound stupid but Im little confused over the commands to write For example in Claymore we just have to put strap or donatelevel Do we have to include the or the and can we use space Here is what Im trying to add in my parameters donatelevel enablehttrue strap cclock cvddc mclock mvddc Im I doing it wrong NOTE this issue tracker is for NiceHashMiner bugsfeature requests ONLY If you need general help or have a support question related to NHM OBSOLETE or NHOS please look at first and open a ticket there if your issue is not specifically NHM related For general help there are several community resources available such as There is a documentation available so please check it out first If you dont find the answer there please create a new issue that follows requirements stated below To keep development of NiceHash Miner streamlined please make sure the following are true before posting an issue Please make requests in English The issue has not already been reported Relevant log files are included generally logs logtxt The issue is with NHM and not inherent of miner executables This can be verified by launching the miner manually and looking for the error The issue is relevant to NHM specifically and not to the NiceHash service NHOS or NHM see above Specifications of setup such as NHM version Windows version and hardware are included Note this is a guide you can delete this text

DeviceDetectionPrinterexe ocl p UNKNOWNERROR when calling clGetPlatformIDs for number of platforms del OpenCLdll Ive been running NiceHash for about a year plus but Ive come across a new error It started with v and is still an error in I noticed it when I upgraded my GPUs to watercooling The load on each will drop to using Cuckatoo just randomly Log File gives the following error Error occured while getting API stats An error occurred while sending the request Only way I can clear the error is to restart If I close nicehash and reopen neither GPU shows up Any thoughts Hello Setup ti x When I bench ti with NBMiner Algo Result is instant NONE When I bench a with NBMiner Algo NBMiner use Ti NOT It is a second post about this This problem exist since NHM minimum Obviously I perform some clean install of NMH and drivers GL miner Im currently using WIN x RX G and CPU I K When I launch both cpu gpu mining after few hours the GPU stop working I get theses messages How do I make this watchdog script I just started NiceHash it is operating only on the CPU I have two Titan RTX that are displayed but show ERROR in the stateus line What would cause this
