e kapt An exception occurred javalangNullPointerException Screen Shot at unresolved reference error for ActivityPostListBinding I saw some tutorialexample where Coroutine is used instead of RxJava andor RxAndroid Do you think it could improve the code and make it easier to read andor implement Reporting one issue while following and implementing your code Under package netgahfymvvmpostsbase Class BaseViewModel Unresolved Item DaggerViewModelInjector In the code mentioned as netgahfymvvmpostsinjectioncomponentDaggerViewModelInjector So please let us know if its class or interface Hi I copied the code you wrote hoping that it would be a good start for me to write good Android applications applying the Android Architecture Components and two of the most used libraries Dagger and Retrofit and I am confident your way is a good way because by what I could see from Googles sample codes theyre similar but simpler I know there isnt a correct way but more efficient ways and that is why I write this issue hoping you or someone else can help me and probably other people with this problem While inspecting what I have copied it came into my mind about a way to refactor certain parts of the code to adapt it to several different view models Lets start with the ViewModelInjectorkt class The inject method expects a PostListViewModel as an argument and then this same method is initiated in BaseViewModelkt a class that will probably be extended by many other view model classes I wanted to try to refactor it and make it more generic and accept a T type as a parameter but none of what I did help I no longer have my attempts either Because the way it is now the way to support many different view model classes is if I write something like this in ViewModelInjectorkt kotlin fun injectFoofooViewModel FooViewModel fun injectBarbarViewModel BarViewModel and then in the BaseViewModelkt do it like this kotlin init injectFoo injectBar private fun inject when this is FooViewModel injectorinjectFoothis is BarViewModel injectorinjectBarthis Im sure there is a way to fix this and write it in a way that is better is there not I hope someone can help me with this Thank you Changed DI mechanism from Dagger to Koin
