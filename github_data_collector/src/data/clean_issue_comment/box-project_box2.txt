Some dependencies are abandoned Package phineexception is abandoned you should avoid using it No replacement was suggested Package phinepath is abandoned you should avoid using it No replacement was suggested Package herreraioversion is abandoned you should avoid using it No replacement was suggested Package herreraiojson is abandoned you should avoid using it Use khergejson instead Package herreraiopharupdate is abandoned you should avoid using it No replacement was suggested Package herreraioannotations is abandoned you should avoid using it No replacement was suggested I have written a Docker image from official php alpine image to use this amazing tool docker run v PWDapp ebuildyboxv build Tell me what do you think about Complementary PR for Unfortunately where I work we still use svn to version control And I had to make a copy of the project and git init then git commit to being able to build Current CI tests are failing Eg build Fatal error Class phpseclib Crypt Common AsymmetricKey not found in varwwwhtmlkowboykitcomhtdocsphpseclibCryptRSAphp on line Is throwing every time I use includeCryptRSAphp Dialog helper was deprecated from should be replaced by Question helper Breaks on asking for the passphrase to a private key when signing phars with openssl Temporary workaround when installing box as an isolated composer dev dependency is to manually requiredev symfonyconsole for If you have something like json output buildfoophar main binfoophp basepath src Then the real path of the main used is CWDsrcbinfoophp and the output should be CWDsrcbuildfoophar but actually is CWDbuildfoophar There is a tool called cgr for composer global require that install every tool that needs to be globaly available in their own custom folder It does so that each tool dependecy dont infuences other tools dependencies This means that the logic that was previously used by the autoloader location code for box is broken For some reason the code used to look for the last autoloader in the folder structure the one closest to the root folder I have no idea why it was doing so For cgr to work it needs to be the first one found that needs to be used I have changed the logic accordingly in this PR as well as removed some dead code an option that was never used Any comment PHPs Phar class sadly requires that the output file names extension must be phar Hence the output directive for box will always need to be named phar However I always like to rename my executable Phar archives to just the basename I use composer not composerphar and box build not boxphar build etc Clearly I can rename my output many different ways command line Makefile Composer script etc but Id really love to have a selfcontained process where box can rename myappphar to myapp before exiting
