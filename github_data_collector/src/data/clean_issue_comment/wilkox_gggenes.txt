The font size of the legend is too large if many different genes are shown in the gggenes plot Is it possible to change the size of the legend I tried themelegendtextelementtextsize themegenesbasesize None of them worked Hallo first of all this is a absolutely wonderful visualisation tool for gene maps I want to draw gene maps with differing composition of genes due to mutations and frame shifts This means that in each line different genes are missing Still I want the maps to be aligned according to overlapping genes Screenshot from Here all lines are aligned to genE like in the example but not line Which should aligned to protD How it would be possible to extend this alignment feature Is this package going to support polar coordinate
