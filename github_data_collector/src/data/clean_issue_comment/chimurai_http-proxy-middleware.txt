help here I have some dynamic route namespaces defined by a config file A config entry looks like this yaml catalog name catalog address type page version v When the browser makes a request to catalogassetsstylescss the proxy should send that request to Ive tried multiple ways to configure the proxy as shown in the SO post but none of them work I see no evidence that the requests are even reaching the proxy code since Ive added hooks like the one below without observing any console output js onProxyReq proxyReq req res consolelogHello Im being proxied now proxyReq req res The server just responds with a The proxy works fine for other routes Ive defined but I cant figure this one out I do have this proxy working using the request library with this code js const assets expressRouter appusepnameassets assets assetsget async req res return requestpaddresspversionassetsreqpathpiperes Im just not sure how to correctly adapt it to use the httpproxymiddleware Help is appreciated thanks If you answered Yes If this is a question on troubleshooting your setup Stack Overflow would be a better place to ask for help Please check if your question hasnt been already

If this is a discussion you may delete this template and write in a free form If you answered No You may delete this part of template I would like to use proxy with So if path does not match simply open httpserver url and do not proxy it Example no proxy needed no proxy needed proxy to xyzabccom is this possible to do with this middleware The example code does not work as intended Steps to reproduce Use the example code var express requireexpress var proxy requirehttpproxymiddleware var app express appuse api proxy target changeOrigin true applisten Expected behavior This should create a proxy for api to The debug output should look like this HPM Proxy created api Actual behavior It creates a proxy for to The debug output looks like this HPM Proxy created Workaround As provided in the core concept in the READMEmd move the api from appuse to proxy Like this appuse proxyapi target changeOrigin true This example works as intended the debug output looks like this HPM Proxy created api Setup This happens in express httpproxymiddleware node v Windows Build I did not test this with other combinations yet I hope i did not misunderstood anything If so feel free to tell me and close

have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems
