Our PBX is using RTP Port Range but Telephone App has RTP Portrange hardcoded in accountConfigrtpcfgport RTP Port Range should be freely configurable When a call is made from an external source like opening a URL or from the Contacts app the first enabled account in Telephone is used Telephone should present a dialog for selecting an account for such outgoing call Telephone seems to be the most sleek and minimal in the positive meaning app I could find Unfortunately in combination with an AVM Fritzbox the user experience is currently rather low IMHO we have at least the following topics to improve Support all HD codecs instead of limiting codecs to G only Support internal call transfers Support Fritzbox address book although a web research only reveals articles explaining that this is not implemented on the Fritzbox side Probably there is more Are there plans to improve those topics For example the current solution to force G as codec works and reduces the call quality compared to eg Zoiper Being able to select the codecs to use for a SIP account would probably already help here I have a jabra headset and I connect using bluetooth The headset works great it is visible in the bluetooth selector and it is connected I configured the bluetooth device in the telephone app as the input and output device When I start bluetooth and then the telephone app all works But after some time later in the day when I get a call the headset is not propertly intialized This also happens when I start a call I can head in the headset that the headset starts to connect little beep however it seems to bee too late for telephone app or something I get not audio and my phone partner neither The solution then is to quite telephone app restart and then it works It seems to me that I did not have this problem a year ago it might have been introduced with some bluetooth changes in MacOS Is this a known issue What can I do about it When we run out of credit with our VPBX provider placing a call fails with a Service Unavailable error The error message is only visible for about half a second and then vanishes as the call window is closed almost immediately All thats let is a sec history entry When a call fails the history should say Service Unavailable instead of sec We have a configuration with two accounts with separate VoIP providers If we use a short and soft ringtone we often miss calls because were not wearing the headset at all times If we use a long and loud ringtone it stops us hearing the other party if a call gets in on one account while theres an active call on the other Possible solutions which occur to me a Allow configuring a nd ringtone to use while theres an active call other products use a short beep to indicate a call is waiting b Show vistual indications but no ring for the nd call c Just deliver a BUSY signal on the nd call and dont ring Unfortunately the two providers use very different user ids so we cant use issue as a workaround Hi Ive set the tel protocol handler to Telephoneapp using RCDefaultApp When I open a tel link Telephone opens but doesnt start a call How do I fix that In Germany it is common to include the local dialing prefix in parenthesis even when international number format is used for example Because Telephone just ignores parenthesis it incorrectly calls the number but the zero should be ignored and the number must be called instead Hello during call if I transfer the call to other number I hear calling in my ears and recipient answer to me not to transferring call Thank you My SIP provider needs ue to send a SIP INFO event to emulate hook flash before sending call transfer invite that SIP INFO must contains a header with c applicationhookflash and SDP with Signalhf Is it possible to implement as an option of Telephoneapp
