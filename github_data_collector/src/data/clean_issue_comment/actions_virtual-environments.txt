failed on Azure DevOps this week due to unexpected removal of Microsoft SDKs Windows v A bin NETFX Tools path from build environment Build is using vmImage windowslatest Issue is easy to fix by updating to latest SDK Problem Problem is that this update of image is not documented in the release notes Virtual environments affected macOS Ubuntu LTS Ubuntu LTS Windows Server R x Windows Server Describe the bug libcurl is not in the final image as it is replaced by libcurl when installing curl on Ubuntu It is still installed during the process which leads to other packages being uninstalled because of incompatibilities Area for Triage See for areas Question Bug or Feature Choose Question Bug or Feature Bug Virtual environments affected macOS Ubuntu LTS x Ubuntu LTS Windows Server R Windows Server Expected behavior libcurl is not installed at all Context I am trying to build this image on Google Cloud I managed to change the builder start from an Ubuntu LTS image and complete the process but when starting a new VM from the resulting image I could not connect to it with SSH SSH authorizations and users are managed by which provides systemd services running on the machine They are preinstalled on GCPprovided images but if you ever need to create your own images the packages to install are documented here Actual behavior I ran the packer build in debug mode checking on the builder VM the process as it went along In the script scriptsinstallers basicsh is run which in turn in line installs libcurl Installing libcurl conflicts with libcurl which is required by curl so libcurl is removed and with it googlecomputeengineoslogin In line curl is installed which will bring along libcurl and uninstall libcurl The result is that libcurl is not available but unfortunately googlecomputeengineoslogin was already removed so all future SSH connections fail Note I only tested this on the Ubuntu image I dont know if it is also present on the version Software updates Nodejs v
