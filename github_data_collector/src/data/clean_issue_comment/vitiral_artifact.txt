The link to the flash card challenge under Starting Your Project is And it should be I have done a rewrite and reimagining of artifact I wrote it in python The rewrite is NOT compatible with this version think of it as beta You can view the rewrite here Usage of where on windows rather than which Slicing of ExtendedLength Paths using regex on windows as a workaround to stdprocessCommandcurrentdir not accepting them Hello Im interested in using Artifact for a project but Im developing on Windows I downloaded the source and have attempted to compile both mdbook and cargoweb are installed but even with both of them in place any post release of artifact fails to build with the following error Compiling artifactlib v C Users Josh Documents GitHub artifact artifactlib error failed to run custom build command for artifactapp v C Users Josh Documents GitHub artifact artifactapp Caused by process didnt exit successfully C Users Josh Documents GitHub artifact target release build artifactapp f e ceebe buildscriptbuild exit code stdout Build Script Started Checking dependencies stderr thread main panicked at whichwhere doesnt exist Os code kind NotFound message The system cannot find the file specified src libcore resultrs note Run with RUSTBACKTRACE environment variable to display a backtrace warning build failed waiting for other jobs to finish error build failed The backtrace seemed pretty long and unhelpful The most prominent note in it was several occurences of unresolved external symbol emscriptenasmconstint If someone is willing to point me in the right direction Id love to do what needs to get done to get this working I tried to cargo install artifactapp in order to update artifact only to realize it tried to build v which failed btw and that the artifact crates available were super old How come Maybe you should just drop the cargo install from the tutorial I then realized that I originally just installed the binaries While Im there latest release v panics when I just invoke art with no argument I guess it should probably display some help info stdout Build Script Started Checking dependencies ERROR Missing binary dependencies their binaries must be put in targetdeps mdbook This is not how it should work obviously See Right now the tutorial uses WAY more detail than would actually be used in a project To avoid pushing users into a pitfall of overspecifying their project I need to be more upfront in the docs that the highly specific nature is for demonstration but not a representation of how an actual project would be specified The latest version available on scoop is reddit post Artifact does a fair amount of allocationsdropping of values lifeguard scratches an itch that Ive had for a while to try to avoid the performance impact
