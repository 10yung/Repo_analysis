Im about to start a new project and I would like to use QOR features specially the admin dashboard Will this work with the Go ORM code generated from SQLBoiler Hello I have a small question In my project I want to get in the admin records from an external database I get this data from Grpc How can I draw them in the admin panel r admAddResource modelsNotification rFindManyHandler funcresult interface context qorContext error getNotification notificationGRPCGetNotificationsReq res err notificationAccessClientGetNotificationsnotificationAccessCtx getNotification if ok contextGetDBGetqorgettingtotalcount ok resultint lenresNotifications return nil var notificationViews make modelsNotification lenresNotifications for i v range resNotifications n modelsNotification nTitle vTitle notificationViews i n result notificationViews return nil type Notification struct Title string jsontitle Text string jsontext Type string jsontype So I heard some company is using this so I come to take a look You have nice stars on githubmmm ok lets see Get Started the first thing that you do is copy paste the maingo file and that file has githubcomqorqor unused import so from the start the compiler will complain removing it gives http panic serving runtime error invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference goroutine running nethttpconnservefunc xc c homemegosrcnethttpservergo x panic x e e xef homemegosrcruntimepanicgo x b importing it for sides effects just starts and ends the server Can you please update the Get Started page so new developers like me can start using whatever youre selling I have searched in google for documentation or learning video or more example about qorauth but I found nothing unfortunately qoradmin without qorauth is unusable can any body make video or something else about using qorauth with qoradmin and qorauththem can I use qoradmin with another auth plugins qor Hi Can qor support right to left cultures like ArabicHebrPersian Finish GET adminproducts Took ms Hello It is more question than issue I am trying to implement custom Resource that reads the data not from DB but from some customzied source it implements FindManyHandler and FindOneHandler callbacks And everething is fine but I can not find a posibility to use a general paging data like offset and page number and must reimplement the logic from in my FindManyHandler to have a pisibility to use paging otherwise i can not extract this info from current context i have changed qor admin to propagate paging data the same way as You are propagating contextSetDBdbModelsResourceValueSetqorgettingtotalcount true but may be there is a more elegant solution for this rt
