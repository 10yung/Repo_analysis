Example Theres a model with id and name When the autocomplete makes the search it looks for the name and displays the name I would like to search for ID or Name and I would like for it to return me in this format ID Name instead of just Name How can I accomplish that without changing the gem all is fine with autocomplete except on remote trueajax forms autocomplete totally broken on ajax success how could I fix it Hi I need to add two or fields to autocomplete field I see many of the links says that it is under pull requestIs that true if not can you please help me in this case My controller is user and User belongs to location In my controller I have autocomplete location namedisplayvalue funkymethod What I need is along with location name the User should be searched using postcode in location Model Here is my location Model def funkymethod selfnamecapitalize selfpostcode end I use Rails and Mongid as my backend Thanks in advance menu is undefined on like of the jQueryuiautocomplete file Added ability to use active record scope for search It enables using complex queries use OR JOIN other tables etc in search Example usage In model just add scope with lamba and one parameter In this example it is called autocompletebynames ruby class User ActiveRecordBase scope autocompletebynames lambda query selectuserscontactname usersbusinessnamewhereuserscontactname LIKE query OR usersbusinessname LIKE query query query def namewithid businessnameblank contactname businessname id end end In controller in autocomplete call use just id if you dont want any other column to be selected from database or if you use select in your scope and add new option searchscope and specify the name of your scope autocompletebynames ruby class UsersController ApplicationController autocomplete user id full true displayvalue namewithid searchscope autocompletebynames end All other autocomplete options work with this I dont see why the json returned always has to have the same value for label and value A lot of actions would be simplified if I could return a column of my choosing for eg id in the value field and search column in the label field def jsonforautocompleteitems method extradata itemscollect do item hash id itemidtos label itemsendmethod value itemsendmethod extradataeach do datum hash datum itemsenddatum end if extradata TODO Come back to remove this if clause when test suite is better hash end Can you please setup compatibility with It will make setup and use much simpler see diff of readme Ive noticed that simpleform eagerly fetches records for an association Example erb fassociation foo as autocompletecollection url foopath Thats completely unncessary since the collection is never used for the autocompletecollection type The whole point Im using this type is because the data in that table is very large Is there a way we can add an empty collection option collection somewhere How do I prevent elements mentioned by the updateelements hash from being cleared as soon as the user starts typing I only want them being updated if an autocomplete item is explicitly selected This should be configurable because I have other use cases where I prefer the default behavior This is my use case scenario We have a list of field pairs description url for a nested set of links attached to a post The user will enter some text into the description auto suggestions popup to suggest links found by the fulltext indexer and creating an internal link if selected like post or download If the url field is already populated the purpose of changing the description may be solely for editing purposes while the url should not change This does not seem to be supported I could work around this by using a custom select event but actually that looks like a general use case to me and should be integrated into rails jqueryautocomplete
