How to replicate Put mouse on one of the element menus and move it up and down really fast repeatedly Some of the element menus will continue to show the hover border Ive tried testing with other buttons but I havent seemed to replicate it it seems to occur when a lot of buttons switch at once Update It appears OnMouseLeave sometimes runs on the wrong button Here are some logs of the menu buttons Position aX aY I filtered out any enterexit events that matched up Enter FROM Enter FROM Leave FROM Enter FROM Leave FROM Enter FROM Leave FROM Leave FROM Enter FROM Leave FROM There are a lot of Enters that dont have a Leave and Leaves that dont have an Enter users report that the mac version is broken due to a problem with the build server title Probably due to sending one update request to the official server and one to my server If I m correct the builds do not use GCC s link time optimization from what I see in SConscript I suggest to start using it for release builds It can be easily enabled with the flto switch and provides a quite smaller and more optimized binary Tested on Linux and worked without any changes This PR adds new Velocity sensor element to the game Already supports serialization features Usefull for detecting particle velocities in game This changeset makes the game store powderpref in the preferred userspecific directory obtained through calling SDLGetPrefPath Question This probably should also be expanded to also cover screenshots and saved simulations Do you agree If so I will amend the patch to also cover those cases Question Should this feature be optional and selectable at compile time eg via a Sconscript option At the moment a lot of functions in TPTs codebase have mostall of their variables declared at the beginning of the function The goal of this WIP PR is to fix that Why Im presenting my changes so early So I can receive feedback to make sure Im not messing something up The large number of commits is to make reverting or fixing any one file easier For me who is bad at git and they will be squashed as I move to different parts of the codebase This PR adds a new element LITH or Lithium ion battery This PR implements keyboard bindings for The Powder Toy It adds an option in the options window that opens up a new view to which the user can configure hot keys for the main switch block of hotkeys found in GameViewOnKeyPress These are stored as prefs and whenever a key or combination of keys is pressed we look up if we have a binding for it and if we do it executes the identified function By default all the current hotkeys in the GameViewOnKeyPress switch block are added and stored in prefs if the user does not have any keyboard binding prefs already New functionsroutines that need to be added as a future default keyboard hotkey can be done so in KeyboardBindingsMaph Reserved keys and key combinations can likewise be added in ReservedKeysh Note that configuring a key that has already been added as a binding or is a reserved key will not work and the UI control will revert to the previous assigned hotkey
