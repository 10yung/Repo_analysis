During the course of scripting in iPython while using this extension all of your code is centered Restarting iPython restarting the laptop and uninstalling the extension with pip still doesnt solve this problem All my code is centered and now unreadable in iPython Please help with how to completely remove this extension and return alignment of all code in iPython to normal Not sure if this project is still maintained but on the off chance anyone is listening BeautifulSoup has a sort of obnoxious warning if you dont explicitly tell it which HTML parser to use Thats a particular problem for this IPython extension because it frequently creates new soups triggering the warning frequently The fix is to explicitly specify an HTML parser here and also in the p shortcut That in turn requires some way for me to tell the extension which parser I want probably configureipythonbeautifulsoup would be a good place to do that CSS styles of displayed pages override the IPython notebook interface styles with URLs like eg Without using IFrames Im not sure whether its possible to avoid this without something like def cleanedbeautifulsoupcopysoup copy BeautifulSoupunicodesoup for node in copyscript nodeextract here for node in copystyle nodeextract here return copy EDIT Also JS
