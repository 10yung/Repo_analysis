Branch fixmaximumselection IOS Currently I faced the problem that the first button in the actionsheet is somehow animated with a scale transition if you present the ImagePickerSheetController which looks really weird This is my code which is from the example code let presentImagePickerController UIImagePickerControllerSourceType source in let controller UIImagePickerController controllerdelegate self var sourceType source if UIImagePickerControllerisSourceTypeAvailablesourceType sourceType photoLibrary controllersourceType sourceType selfpresentcontroller animated true completion nil let controller ImagePickerSheetControllermediaType image controllermaximumSelection controlleraddActionImagePickerActiontitle Photo Library secondaryTitle Add Selection handler in presentImagePickerControllerphotoLibrary secondaryHandler numberOfPhotos in controlleraddActionImagePickerActiontitle Take Photo handler in presentImagePickerControllercamera secondaryHandler numberOfPhotos in presentImagePickerControllercamera controlleraddActionImagePickerActioncancelTitle Cancel presentcontroller animated false completion nil As you can see I set animated to false cause this seems like the only solution for me Does someone else have the problem or a solution for it I present ImagePickerSheetController with animation set to true but what happens instead is I see perhaps the last frame of an animation in The background color fades in but the picker itself basically just appears Hello Laurin great library you have here thanks for sharing it Love the animations and general structure of the code Im at the tip of the fixmaximumselection branch Just had something of a basic question about the intentpurpose of the two ImagePickerAction rows once at least one image has been selected From what I can seem to see both actions will fire the same handler though we can have separate titles for them The example usage refers to Add Comment which may well be useful keeping in mind it would apply to N photos In order of importance to me Id love to either Hideremove that first ImagePickerAction if and only if images have been selected or Alter the handler that fires for that first row so I could pop a modal text field to ask for comments say Not sure how Id know when that happened though nor can I currently get to the handler Handler instance member as its both fileprivate and a let to boot Thanks in advance for your or anyone elses thoughts The app crashes in the ImagePickerSheetController deinit method screen shot at In Apples document You access the contents of a fetch result with the same methods and conventions used by the NSArray class Unlike an NSArray object however a PHFetchResult object dynamically loads its contents from the Photos library as needed providing optimal performance even when handling a large number of results in PHFetchResult The method to improve performance is require Image in collectionViewCellForItem method lbrndnr Are you able to get specs to run easily I had to do a ton of work to get them going Looks like you prefer Carthage which is but Im old school and still use Pods so I added KIF and Quick Nimble via a Podfile So that involved using a workspace and changing IPSCxcodeprojprojectpbproj to be compatible Exposed waitForViewWithAccessibilityIdentifier and friends in KIFExtensionsswift Looks like you used to maintain a fork of KIF but its been deleted These methods are not available in KIF v latest On the upside it would be easy to get TravisCI running Ive used it w Pods enough to be able to get that going Thoughts on all this Feels like I must be doing something wrong When I use the sheet inside a popover the background view has a wrong frame Looking into viewDidLayoutSubviews the view of the ImagePickerSheetController is in fact wrong as is the enclosing popoverView To fix this I added two lines of code inside viewDidLayoutSubviews let sheetSize CGSizewidth viewboundswidth height sheetHeight if let popoverPresentationController backgroundViewframe CGRectorigin zero size sheetSize Scrolling in the pickers collection view is very choppy x Investigate accessibility for images
