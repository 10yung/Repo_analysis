Used b on ipados When I save a state and then try to reopen the state tapping on the picture snapshot while in game the app crashes If I reopen the app and launch the recent save state it opens and runs fine This happens on multiple games with multiple emulators Overview Adds a GitHub action bot to automatically squash and merge approved pull requests Requirements Code owners approvals meet setting for repo Any required testschecks in GitHub repo settings are passed Pull request has the autosquash label Detail This action runs on PR open update etc It will only execute though if all preconditions are met which are configured in the settings from GitHub The GitHub API has a flag called mergable which means there are no conflicts all peer reviews and automation bots are passed etc Basically does the PR have a green checkmark If so this bot will squash and merge the PR Why squash and merge The history is maintained in the metacomments Squash is easier than rebase for XCode projects with Apples shitty Xcode project format which is a pain in the butt to rebase Why rebase and not merge though The main reason is the clarity of reading history A bunch of merges to and from developing into a feature branch are difficult to follow The small changes are largely irrelevant once a feature branch is merged into masterdevelop and in the event of regression its easier to find the squash commit to undoing rather than tracing a zigzag of merges between a feature branch and develop Version comprovenanceemuprovenance Reason No reason found Full stack trace includes UIKitCore

if Im wrong some games really do not play well if theyre dropping frames and they use frameskipping Some FPS games are really affected by this some almost becoming unplayable at times If possible try to handle it somehow in the way emulators like GEPD and UltraFast handle overclocking It could improve perfomance in all N games If the goal is to keep accuracy then its not really required to implement such a thing but it would improve playability What does this PR do This will set the devices native FPS and allow for the Emu cores to selfmanage their FPS based on their selfemulatorCoreframeInterval for a smoother sync experience UIScreen mainScreen maximumFramesPerSecond will list the max device FPS for fps on iPhone fps for the and fps ProMotion devices accordingly Should also help and work on tvOS to regulate between and but this is currently still untested Btw noticed that the selfemulatorCoreframeInterval settings for the cores should also be revisited to report a more accurate decimal fps at some point Where should the reviewer start Check out the visual frame limiting on ProMotion devices with the Genesis Core using the scroll test on the p suite The Mednafen core is not able to scale to the native Promotion FPS and is still locked to a fps max How should this be manually tested Swap between the old and new lines of code and check the Xcode GPU debug for reporting of the max FPS and check visually if the new version looks smoother on ProMotion devices Any background context you want to provide Continued process to improve the VSync behavior in Pv Any thoughts JoeMatt jasarien braindx hey guys i found a very annoying bug when emulating PSX and i think all other platforms my setup is as follows iPhone pro screen mirror to Apple tv some projector in my bedroom whenever i enable screen mirror sound keeps playing but only the latest frame before enabling airplay is displayed video stuck without airplay mirroring its all good What did you expect to happen Expected i should be able to see the output not only the latest frame What happened instead Actual only the latest frame before enabling airplay is displayed video stuck What are steps we can follow to reproduce this issue Reproduce Run a PSX game Enable screen mirroring to any AirPlay device i used ATV and Hear sound but only see the last frame before enabling mirroring
