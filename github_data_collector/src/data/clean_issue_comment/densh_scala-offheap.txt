Do you have any plans to add Scala support This happens in certain cases when the data class is defined in a different file from where it is used Reproducer Support of multiple dimensions for Arrays would be very useful It should support following basic operations update put element at given key get apply return underlying value in an Option contains remove foreach map mapValues transform transformValues toMap Implementation could use ideas from nondebox Map It should support following basic operations apply check if argument is contained in this set add remove foreach transform map toSet Implementation could use ideas from nondebox Set Find first element fulfilling given predicate If no value is found then it will return either emptynull value of data class or empty Option proposed in It would work like oneelement offheap array Optionempty would be just a null reference otherwise it will point to address containing value of this Option The use case for this class is return value of some offheap collection methods such as find or get in Map The implementation could be based on utilSortingquickSort Im not sure if we should also support sortBy function since it would require client to provide a reference to an onheap implementation of Ordering typeclass Perhaps our interface of sortWith or we could name it just as sort in that case could take additional mapping argument with identity function as a default value Scan the array from leftright with cumulative result as offheap array
