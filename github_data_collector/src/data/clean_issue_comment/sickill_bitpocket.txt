On my PC I would like to set up two slaves One folder for syncing from servera and an other folder for syncing from serverb Both servers contain different data Is this possible with bitpocket How does bitpocket distinguish between deletecreate AFAIK for this to work you need a list of all files of the last sync It would be nice if you could explain your solution in the README This is a different idea to the performance from With this idea the stream of the Rsync tree listing is MD d in sync with the rest of the analyze processing If the two trees match according to the MD hash then it is safe to assume that the trees match exactly and the sync can be aborted without further processing or inspection Overall this results in about a reduction in the CPU time of the analyze phase of the sync Hi Marcin I found your script being really cool For a long time I was looking for a simple solution to sync some folders to my cloud provider strato here in germany They have a nice rsync interface but no direct ssh access So I made some changes to allow for a rsync only operation n on init I also added some waittimeout for remote locks Additionally I added some b basedir for any run this allows for easy execution from any directory Still on the way with some testing Maybe you are interested Anyway many thanks for the great script Best regards Andreas In this mode the files synced in both the pull and push phases are not put into place until the completion of the phase Instead the updated files are staged into a bitpocketstaging folder Once all the changes are staged they are moved into place If the phase is interrupted perhaps due to network connection quality then no changes are reflected This is especially useful when the changes being synchronized include software or data whose changes should be reflected as a whole This has the caveat of requiring a bit of extra space on the source and destination systems as extra space for all changes is required However it has the advantage that if interrupted the staged partial files can be used when resuming the transfer This can greatly speed syncs over shaky network connections This patch causes bitpocket to crash nicely if rsync does not completely cleanly Also includes PR Also uses the rsync option partialdir which is safe to use in case of network error but saves some bandwidth for errorprone network connections
