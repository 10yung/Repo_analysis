Automate graph creation Hello For my project I would like to automate the process of graph creation Currently raw takes the data and ask the user to make two decisions Select chart Map the variables I would like to automate these two steps My algorithm will be choosing the appropriate chart type and variables So in this way I would like to change the workflow of raw a bit Can someone guide how to do that What files needs to be changed So far what I understood is controllerjs gets the user input and triggers the rawjs to provide a suitable model This then calls to the model and model dimension function which further connects to the appropriate chart script Then somehow it connects with directivejs I could not understand completely what is the role of directivesjs For this work I really need to understand the raw at the deepest level Can someone provide guidance to that Thanks I was following along with the guide for adding a chart Using the exact code that is specified in the guide and here At runtime you see an undefined error TypeError Cannot read property linear of undefined It seems as though the latest version of d no longer uses this linear method var xScale d scalelinear should be var xScale d scaleLinear Unless ofc there is a need to lock the version of d package Hi Guys Ive been circulating rawcharts to colleagues who havent any experience with d or data vis before and while they like the capabilities they found it difficult to get started and have feedback the following When new people start using rawcharts It is difficult to know which example data sets work well with which charts you seem to need to know the data structures for the charts before you start which make it difficult for people who are new to get started The workflow at the moment is Select Example Data add your own Select chart type Configure Maybe swap around to Select Chart Type Add Data Select Example Data Configure This would mean that you can then show the sample data sets that work best for a selected Viz and even maybe have a default config for the data so that it shows an output sooner Rawgraphs website doesnt work on Internet Explorer Can anyone suggest how to make it compatible with IE Current error Mixed Content The page at was loaded over HTTPS but requested an insecure stylesheet This request has been blocked the content must be served over HTTPS index Mixed Content The page at was loaded over HTTPS but requested an insecure stylesheet This request has been blocked the content must be served over HTTPS index Mixed Content The page at was loaded over HTTPS but requested an insecure stylesheet This request has been blocked the content must be served over HTTPS index Mixed Content The page at was loaded over HTTPS but requested an insecure stylesheet This request has been blocked the content must be served over HTTPS contentscriptbundlejs Uncaught TypeError cquerySelectorAll is not a function at MutationObserveranonymous contentscriptbundlejs anonymous contentscriptbundlejs childList async L purpleboxjs anonymous purpleboxjs Y purpleboxjs directivesjs Would it be possible to package this as a LibreOffice addon What sort of work would need to be done Is like alluvial diagram but the elements are disposed in a single circumference I would like to be able to execute a SPARQL query to a SPARQL endpoint directly from RAWGraph I propose to add the ability to select SPARQL as source here rawgraph Minimal features needed Input field for SPARQL endpoint Input field for SPARQL query ideally with SPARQL syntax highlighting enabled Optional A way to provide a userpw for the SPARQL endpoint We created the library d sparql which returns a JSON object oriented at what d csv is doing It is properly converting RDF literal data types to native JavaScript types I think this would be a great starting point for implementing it We would be happy to help on that but I would need some pointers about where in the source code we would have to add that to get an idea of the complexity This is related to which simply seems to pass a SPARQL query string Hello I found a link to in Wikidata Query Service see screenshot of WQS below But does not seems to work For instance if I try to add the following URL the error message is displayed Whoops Something wrong with the URL you provided Please be sure it is the correct address It seems that is expecting a URL of type which is not the case of the WQS URLs Window
