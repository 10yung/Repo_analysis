Hi thank you so much for the source code Besides could you please provide the resulting image of the degradation model I am not familiar with caffe I test the pytorch version and find it do not reach the best performance Hi thanks for your sharing I dont know how to calculate the number of parameters of M R Parameters of memory block are x x x x x x x x k So the parameters of the six memory blocks are at least k x k How is the k in the article calculated Hi tyshiwo Thanks for your excellent work I have read the MemNet paper and I find that in table the Memnet parameters is K Im confused by the total parameters The default model is M R with depth In every residual block there are reluconv structure x x x so I just calculate the conv parameters x x x x x and I calculate the total parameters which are roughly M So Im confused by the total parameters Can you point out the actual method to calculate the parameters in your paper Thanks a lot To generate the input of JPEG Deblocking use MATLAB JPEG encoder to compress images Could you illustrate the MATLAB JPEG encoder Is JPEG compress algorithm or other tools Thanks Recently I use python caffe to test your modelbut the effect is shitAnd I use python opencv to read the imagechange the input channels to RGBuse the matlab formula to change channels to ycbcrBut I also get a bad resultCould you help me to fix it
