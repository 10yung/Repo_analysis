Hi Im trying to install your beautiful component inside an existing framework using cocoapods After pod install Ive copied AdaptiveController into the project drag drop copy if necessary and added AdaptiveController into Target Dependences in the Build Phase of my project In a framework I cant add AdaptiveController into Target Dependences in the Build Phase so I have this obvious compile error Framework not found AdaptiveController How can I fix this These do not appear to work nothing happens when I try the font face and size and the image doesnt scale up when only the image is showing Carthage support to download with Carthage The name of the project is adaptivetabbar but the description says AdaptiveController is a Progressive Reduction Swift module for adding custom states to Native or Custom iOS UI elements
