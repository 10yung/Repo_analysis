Looks like I never actually submitted these upstream my apologies Resolves Moving REPLesent class into a replesent package Forgot why this was done and it broke tests so removed it padNewLine adds an empty newline after rendering a slide then moves the cursor back up so nEnter doesnt cause the slides to jump due to scrolling Split to Resolving conflict against toplevel io packages vs scalaio Split to I would like to use REPLesent in sbt console Is this possible A slew of errors pop up if I try to load REPLesentscala The readme says We recommend you install and use the full Scala distribution the scala command instead of just the sbt console so it seems like it is possible I would like to run some spark snippets in my slides and sbt console works perfectly for this The full scala distribution raises quite a few dependency conflicts I have already implemented an export for the whole slide deck in my fork very hackish hence no pull request needs to be done right and does not support slides with builds currently It requires ansifilter to convert the rendered slides with all color codes etc to HTML Maybe something similar could be done for exporting to PDF LaTex or whatever for online publishing I have already implemented line numbering for embedded code in my fork very hackish hence no pull request needs to be done right Hidden code blocks would be a nice addition Sometimes you need to execute some code but that code should not be shown to the audience for the sake of simplicity eg some import statements Nevertheless it should still be executed Instead of creating this alias alias REPLesentscala Dscalacolor language nowarn i REPLesentscala Now you can add something like this to your bashrczshrcetc function REPLesent pathtoREPLesentreplesentsh When you pass it an argument with a presentation file it will load it without having to write any code in the scala REPL
