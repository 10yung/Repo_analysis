Hi adrianb thanks a lot for all of this really appreciate it I was wondering if its possible to get the aligned images Your FaceAlignment class as the name suggests should provide such functionality but I cant seem to find any examples that does the actual alignment Would you kindly show us how to do this as well Is it possible to use RetinaFace instead of SFD Hello I want to use my own network for face detection so I tried to pass facedetectorNone to FaceAlignment class but it gives me an error Is there any functionality to pass cropped faces or its bounding boxes to the getlandmarks method Hi I need a clear picture with facial landmark numbers which are clearly visible for my research Kindly help me asap It seems like we can crop faces here but that the total purpose of this project is to detect faces rather than to actually align them Are we aware of any other projects out there that go the last mile and use the result of this project to then croprotatetiltstretch the face to a canonical position and pose which can then be used for training in another network Hi adrianb How to get the multiple landmark predictions for the image with faces in it and how it chooses just single face from all detected faces after sfd to get the landmarks Like the below output test When dealing with single channel images the following error was raised Traceback most recent call last File facealignpy line in module lms fagetlandmarksfromdirectorydir File usrlocallibpython distpackagesfacealignmentapipy line in getlandmarksfromdirectory detectedfaces selffacedetectordetectfromdirectorypath extensions recursive showprogressbar File usrlocallibpython distpackagesfacealignmentdetectioncorepy line in detectfromdirectory predictions imagepath selfdetectfromimageimagepath File usrlocallibpython distpackagesfacealignmentdetectionsfdsfddetectorpy line in detectfromimage bboxlist detectselffacedetector image deviceselfdevice File usrlocallibpython distpackagesfacealignmentdetectionsfddetectpy line in detect img img nparray ValueError operands could not be broadcast together with shapes I see that it is a numpy array I am interested in the landmarks for the eyes From the numpy array I am not able to infer which of those values are related to eye Please help at the earliest possible I am in need of this data for my PhD research changed the builtin keyword to a generic name using builtin keywords in python is a bad idea even if it is allowed
