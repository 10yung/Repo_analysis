Hi I think Zeitwerks gets messed up by Bundlers reverserubygemskernelmixin internal method Ill do my best to explain the initial issue and what Ive found so far On the app Im working on we had an issue where Karafka wouldnt fail on launch launched with bundle exec foreman start karafka raising a LoadError file not found appchannelsapplicationcable As the path is a folder and not an actual ruby file it seems like it shouldve been autovivified instead of being required by the app So I went digging some more and it appears that even though the require method defined in libzeitwerkkernelrb is called at the beginning of the application initialization as soon as the app reaches configapplicationrb more specifically BundlerrequireRailsgroup Bundler tries to setup which includes a call to reverserubygemskernelmixin resetting Kernelrequire to its original version and overwriting Zeitwerks modifications to it I dont really know how to fix it and I dont know why we only encounter it when launching our karafka process and not on the rails server one but Im open to ideas on how we could solve this For now we had to resort to defaulting back on the classic loader which Im not a big fan of but does the work I also have opened an issue on Bundlers repository bundlerbundler If you have the same issue and stumbled on this here are some workarounds weve found Falling back to the classic autoloader configautoloader classic in configapplicationrb Using a binstub bundle binstub library in the Procfile for the library instead of the bundle exec call service binlibrary instead of service bundle exec library
