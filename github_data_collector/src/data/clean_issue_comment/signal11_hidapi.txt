Hi I am using the hidlib to make a project both on windows and linux int res unsigned char buf buf x buf COMMAND MODE xcc statesignature SIGNATURE memcpybuf state sizeofSTATE res hidwritehandle buf ifres return when I try on windows everything is workbut on linux res return As I am creating an app in kivy python using buildozer a wrapper for pythonforandroid where a buildozerspec file needs to be maintained and I simply wrote hidapi as requirement but it seems not working when says import hid Basically the idea is to allow users to configure hidapi without using iconv as icvon may have dependencies that may not be supported Hi there I cant find any U F device when I use hidenumeratevid pid function in Window build I try to test in Window Its OK Please help me if you know the reason why Hi all I wrote a simple app to send data to LED strip device Using the library statically linked there are no problems Then I wrote another program with the library dynamically linked The device is not opened This is my code lwsluserDevices n struct hiddeviceinfo pInfo pHidEnumerate if pInfo struct hiddeviceinfo p pInfo whilep lwsluser X X s S s n pvendorid pproductid ppath pmanufacturerstring pproductstring p pnext else lwsluser empty n hidfreeenumerationpInfo Open the device using the VID PID and optionally the Serial number wchart sn handle pHidOpen x A x E sn lwsluserfnOpenp snS n pHidOpen sn if handle lwsluser Device not found n return CMDRETERR lwsluser device handle X n handle return CMDRETOK This is the output Pointers ok Open device hidinit Lista devices A E null null C null null BDA A ff null null fnOpen xb dcda sn Device not found closeLedStrip handle hLibrary The device is enumerated but not opened Any idea Thanks regards Hi There I would like to use hidapi in a program that Ill release under LGPL As far as i know a LGPL program is not allowed to use GPL code Can I still use hidapi in my LGPL code Witch of the following two licenses should I use Cheers Cedric Dear Sir Thank you for your library I assume that I plug my HID device to USB hub I try using SetupDiGetDeviceRegistryProperty SPDRPLOCATIONINFORMATION in hidenumerate function but I cant get port number Please let me know if you have an ideas for this case Thank you so much hello i use your libraries Hid Java on My Ubuntu all is fine to detect devices and read them parameters but when i call HidDevice hidDevice hidServicesgetHidDevice null i have null result its a FreeStyle Libre device and its detectable with hidServicesgetAttachedHidDevices im trying to find the problem im sure its the Path HidDevice path vendorId x a productId x serialNumbernull releaseNumber x manufacturernull productnull usagePage x usage x interfaceNumber but the function return Null there is any problem with the path path if i cant to connect to the device i cant communicate with him any suggestion Thanks a lot Hi Thanks for such great project Recently I am using hidapi to test my bluetooth On Ubuntu I can communicate with my bluetooth devices when I link myproject with libhidapihidrawso things go well But when i turn to windows something goes wrong I have compiled hiapilib hidapidll successfully and i run the application hidtest but none of my bluetooth found Is hidapi support bluetooth on windows Or what can cause this issue As USB host am evm board is connected with dlp module through USB HID V The test function uses hidtest in hidapimaster open source Running the test function on the ti am evm board failed to call hidopen Why did the call to hidopen fail Do you need to write dlp driver on single board Usb and udev libraries are currently used Are there any restrictions on the version of the library Thank you rootam xxevm hidtest no device unable to open
