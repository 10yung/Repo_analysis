 When I select the text field enter a text deselect and select it again two bugs appeared The cursor starts at end of parked text not at ending of typed text The font style is the same of parked text Havent been able to consistently reproduce but Ive seen it a few times Not sure how easy this is to fix given the current design but Ive noticed its possible to bring up the CutCopyPaste menu on the parked text area Theres still some bugs with the caret when there is no text which is kinda interesting untitled None
