When you have a map like this onoremap silent key call TextObjectFunctionCR Upon typing cw the text object wont be changed right away Youll first see the call command get typed fully in the commandline before actually going through which adds a noticeable delay and general unexpected visual noise Reverting to solves this problem If the behavior is not clear enough Monday I can post a short second video demonstrating what actually happens Currently I cant due to bad internet My other bindings do not work at all when using athame like fzf or lf I did not find anything about this in the FAQ Im assuming I configured it wrong installed through AUR or it does not support other commands with athame mode This project is awesome and I feel lucky to have found this Ive tried various code escape sequences plus but it seems that the cursor shape doesnt change Id like to replicate my Vim behavior of having block cursor for normal mode with line cursor for insert mode Although I dont entirely grasp how this works under the hood it looks awesome Is there any way I could use kakoune instead of vim Would I have to modify code When I send something from tmux config to just created window it cuts off first character What solves that problem temporary fix that does not break it for people not using athame is adding to the beggining of the line While typing the plugins such as zshautosuggestions and zshsyntaxhighlighting do not get the memo that the line has changed However their hooks apply just fine when autocompleting with tab so I suppose it should be possible I look into athame for a place where to possibly fix it However it is currently beyond my knowledge If you could point me in the right direction I will attempt to fix it Im wondering if theres an easy way to specify what vimrc athame should use My current vimrc and athame do not play nice On the other hand no vimrc and athame seem to get along just fine eg throwing in a ATHAMETESTRC Im willing to contribute a patch if this doesnt yet exist I would probably do so as a file list in a shell variable For example export ATHAMEVIMRCFILEShomeuserconfigvimrcForAthame vim homeuserconfigvimrcForAthame vim In addition I would probably add the following to the invocation of the vim process vim cmd let gathamerc S vimbedvim S athamerc or whatever is currently done Thoughts Right now multiline commands are effectively broken into separate lines by Athame This is baked pretty deeply into how Athame works but it would be nice to change because Vim would be especially useful for editing multiline commands The prompttoolkit project is getting a lot of traction and was chosen for IPython Its written in pure modern python so integrations should be relatively easy Is it possible to integrate with it jonathanslenders what do you think Thanks I have the plugin installed When using zsh with the athame patch the updown no longer work with this plugin Any idea how to solve this Thanks
