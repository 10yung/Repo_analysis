The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

Security Alerts page details The library duplicates the drawing on the said devices but it works perfectly fine in Desktop Chrome Browser however when you toggle the device to iPad pro it has the same issue like the other devices Is this project maintained If not are there any good alternatives it cant drawing when my link open from dingTalk or weChat on iPhoneX and iPhoneXR but is ok on safari browser The canvas just like added disabled when open the link from dingTalk and weChat it worked on other iPhone mobile and all android mobile can you help me resolve the problem The examples show a method of how to do an undo process but youre required to manually modify the data array and redraw it This update puts the undo function into the signature pad as a base method and modifies the data array to track brush sizes throughout the drawing process so that brush minmax is not lost during the redraw process This change adds the addFromData function which adds points to the SignaturePad

experiencing problems where people will just input one or two dots and submit the form it is attached to As of now you can only check wether the canvas is filled or not It would be great if it were possible to see a percentage or define a threshold for it to be considered filled The drawing is broken on iOS devices I can draw straight horizontal lines but if I try to draw vertical lines it draws only a point and the page scrolls up and down instead of drawing I verifified with XCodes iOS Simulator that it worked on iOS devices The bug can be also reproduced with the official signaturepad demo A quote from Safari s release notes Added support for onefinger accelerated scrolling to all frames and overflowscrollelements eliminating the need to setwebkitoverflowscrolling touch Changed the default behavior on iPad for wide web pages with responsive metatags that require horizontal scrolling Pages are scaled to prevent horizontal scrolling and any text is resized to preserve legibility Could this be the cause of this bug
