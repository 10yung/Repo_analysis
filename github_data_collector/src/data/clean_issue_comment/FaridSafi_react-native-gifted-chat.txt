KeyboardAvoidingView behaviorpadding keyboardVerticalOffset SafeAreaView Expected Results There is no gap below the text input bar Just like the st screenshot Additional Information Nodejs version React version Expo React Native version reactnativegiftedchat version Platforms iOS Android or both Android Issue Description So for the chat i push to a new screen this screen renders with all the messages and giftedchat itself without keyboard showing at first but when the keyboard shows up slides from right to left and kind of making an entire screen slide animation so if I wrap my giftedChat with an ImageBackground the ImageBackground also slides and looks like a double screen push whenever I tap on a chat room How can I fix this undesirable effect Issue Description Build fail with syntax

version React Native Web version rc reactnativegiftedchat version Platforms iOS Android or both web TypeScript version Issue Description This feature would be beneficial since we often want message bubbles to respond to touch For example if you tap a message on Facebook Messenger the sentdeliveredread status is displayed below and the sent date is shown above the message Right now Ive been able to implement this with gifted chat except one minor detail I would like to add a touchable to the background so when I tap off the message I can hide the date and message status The closest Ive gotten so far is by adding a TouchableWithoutFeedback to the chat footer and setting the zindex to position it behind the message bubbles but I couldnt figure out the right zindices to get the touchable above the background but below the message bubbles I think it would be a good feature and add some flexibility to gifted chat I would be open to attempting to implement this myself if I get some good feedbackguidance here Issue Description A have a project uses reactnativegiftedchat dependency while adding to project using yarn I produce error like that Resolving packages error Command failed Exit

When the Chat is opened the window scrolls to the bottom automatically We would love to scroll to the first message that was not read yet by the customer Is there a possibility to scroll to a specific message by offset or maybe even id Important would be also that it scrolls to the beginning of the message since our news provider tends to send super long messages Scrolling options could be by id of the messages or by a set offset or something Expected Results The Chat scrolls to the beginning of a dedicated message Additional Information Nodejs version React version React Native version

user avatarnull Expected Results Render as initials Additional Information the bug is in this line in messagetsx renderAvatar if currentMessage currentMessageuser currentMessageuseravatar null return null This should be removed to solve the issue ps Ive forked fixed but cannot build The following enhancement would be great Some Chat UI designs dont have image icon next to the bubble ie WhatsApp Would be great to have some flexibility to show or hide bubble icon how to load new messages received from backend without scroll to bottom keep scroll position so user can scroll to bottom manually or click to scroll to bottom component
