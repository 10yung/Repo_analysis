ReadOnly bacon boolean type State ReadOnly functionalImmutableFengShuiBacon boolean const state State functionalImmutableFengShuiBacon true const selector OutputSelector State any OutProps createStructuredSelector bacon state statefunctionalImmutableFengShuiBacon const result selectorstate works fine with createSelector though How am I to write a selector that has no dependencies I dont see this mentioned in the docs If I have a reselect selector that does a heavy calculation but doesnt depend on anything other than the root state directly then what should I use If I just do state do heavy calculation return result This is bad though cause I can expect the heavy calculation to run on every render even if the state doesnt change Do createSelectorstate state state do heavy calculation return result That function requires at least one dependency so I use state state as the dependency this is awkward but gives me the memoization I need Maybe defaultMemoize is what I need
