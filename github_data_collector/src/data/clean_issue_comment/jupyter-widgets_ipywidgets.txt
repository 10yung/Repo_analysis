PREFIXsharejupyternotebooktemplatesLIBRARYNAME and are picked up by the extension See eg I propose that starting with ipywidgets we install all the documentation notebooks in the sharejupyter directory The notebooktemplates name could also be called examplenotebooks As soon as we elect such a path to be the official example notebooks directory we should do this for other packages as well Note there would be a constraint for such notebooks is that they do not depend on other resources that are local to the notebook path because they would be open in the current working directory of the notebook user or we specify in the notebook metadata what ought to be copied alongside the notebooks Hi Firstly widgets are amazing Now Im trying to create an interactive plotting function with a signature like interactivelyplotdata plotfunc kwargs To do that I want to pass the function I want to interact with some arguments which interact is to ignore eg python def plotfuncdata kwargs return dataplot def interactivelyplotdata plotfunc kwargs wrapped functoolspartialplotfunc datadata return interactwrapped kwargs However functoolspartial doesnt behave as expected in this context interact is still demanding that data be treated as a widget Heres a minimum example that demonstrates my problem python from ipywidgets import interact from functools import partial updatewrapper This is to avoid the error AttributeError functoolspartial object has no attribute name def wrappedpartialfunc args kwargs partialfunc partialfunc args kwargs updatewrapperpartialfunc func return partialfunc def gdat x printdatdat from inside g return dat gplusdat wrappedpartialg data interactgplusdat x which raises Traceback most recent call last File hometegn

abbreviation for argument rformatname ValueError cannot find widget or abbreviation for argument dat I dont understand how what Ive done is different from the use of functoolspartial in this answer I could possibly get around this by using closures but I really would rather not I would also eventually like to do something similar but with methods Passing click coordinates to the backend For now just for Buttons For some reason when I create a tab with identical VBox contents the second tabs graph object becomes shorter truncated The logical expectation is they should have the same width Here is a sample code to create such bug from ipywidgets import import plotly import plotlygraphobjects as py fig pyFigureWidgetlayout plotlygraphobjsLayouttitle box widgetsVBox fig tabcontents children box box tab widgetsTabchildren children for i j in enumeratetabcontents tabsettitlei j displaytab I suspect this has something to do with Figure widget from plotly As I have tried other standard widgets and it displays without problem How do I fix such issue I am currently making a multiple choice quiz in Jupyter Notebook using radio buttons for the answers from the latest release of ipywidgets The quiz renders LaTeX as expected on the first render when the code block is first run However upon subsequent renders the LaTeX in the answers does not render appropriately while the question Label widget renders LaTeX just fine In order to get the LaTeX in the answers to render I either have to restart the kernel and restart the web page and run the code block again or and interestingly hit the run button ctrl enter of the code block twice very fast to get the LaTeX to properly load Additionally when I click on any of the radio button options the LaTeX of the answer options is converted back into plain text no matter which way I get the LaTeX to previously render Any help on resolving this issue would be much appreciated Thank you This is a PR made with help from jasongrout to allow for deferred init for widgets when eg dynamically loaded into JLab using The previous Custom Widget has now been removed from the documentation see as it was using patterns specific to the classic notebook As mentioned in this comment we could instead have a tutorial based on the TypeScript tutorial similar to the Let s Make an Astronomy Picture of the Day JupyterLab Extension Adding backgroundcolor to ToggleButton Checkbox Valid Adding fontfamily fontsize fontstyle fontvariant fontvariant textcolor textdecoration to ToggleButton Adding backgroundcolor color fontsize to labels and all text inputs Adding fontfamily fontstyle fontvariant textcolor textdecoration to labels
