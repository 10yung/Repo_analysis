For some usecases it would be nice to be able to not set a startend date for a bundle of games We have a lot of games for sale and so sell them in packs of However we were forced to set the end date to some date far in the future instead of being able to make the bundles permanent It would be nice to either not have to set an end date or at least not not show the ends in info on the sale site GIF On mobile and on pc with a small aspect ratio cover image that on right side appears however on pc with wide ratio its gone I just want a banner on top not cover or screenshots now I noticed there are buy now button with tight aspect ratio banner and cover image are same or now In cases where a game is run on the itchio page download keys dont allow the user to access the games page My request is for a similar thing to download keys that instead is like the secret link in draft mode but you can create multiple revoke them etc All the same as download keys but links that get you past the restricted page option In itchio gives creators the tools to make smart choices about Our strong emphasis on empowering creators show in how build itchio Unless Im reading this wrong this would instead be Our strong emphasis on empowering creators shows in how itchio is built When you comment on other peoples games in a jam theres a submitted badge in the comment next to your name that links to your own submission However this badge is only given to the account that submitted the game If you were a contributor to a game ie an admin on the game page this badge is not shown I wouldve expected each contributor to receive this badge as well This is important if games are submitted using a company account but people are using their personal accounts to comment on submissions Noticed that the number of entries and possibly ratings too is always pluralized on the jam pages Theres an edge case where its singular ie entry instead of entries eg PastedImage PM When adding a credit card in dark mode the credit card fields have dark text Card No CVC Exp and Postal Code On card error card input error etc input text goes red like usual from Stripe I think Havent tried this on other devices sorry detailssummaryImage with CC info scrubbedsummary p Screen Shot at AM p details detailssummaryBrowser Infosummary p MacOS Chrome Version Official Build bit Operating system OS X IP address Javascript enabled Yes Cookies enabled Yes Flash version Not installed Java version Not installed Websockets supported Yes WebGL supported Yes Language enUS Browser size x Screen size x Color depth bit Your full user agent string is Mozilla Macintosh Intel Mac OS X AppleWebKit KHTML like Gecko Chrome Safari p details I wasnt too sure where I should put this since it would affect butler itch and the itch website If possible when I push a release using butler Id like to be able to schedule when it goes live ie passing an argument of something like release DDMMYYYY hhmmss I feel having something like this would help in lining up things like scheduled social media posts etc Also quick question about the blog post writing can you use the optional publish date to schedule blog post releases a href relnofollow noopenerPhasera a href relnofollow noopenerlibGDXa This jam is using a targetblank href to host entries Each of these projects has an https site Those who have already purchased the game can not download version There is only the demo version of proposed What to do Thank you
