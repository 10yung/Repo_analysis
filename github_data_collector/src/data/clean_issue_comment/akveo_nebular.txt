submitting a check one with x bug report X feature request Issue description Current behavior When our nbContextMenu is empty or null we have to handle an ugly ngIf around that element Potentially having twice the same tags but just one with the nbContextMenu attribute and one without Expected behavior The nbContextMenu could simply disconnect the dynamicOverlayHandler when the item list is empty rather than calling a validateItems That way we could support receiving the menuItems later or not having menuItems at all in some cases Steps to reproduce nbContextMenu null or nbContextMenu should just be handled Nothing should show Related code Other information Angular Nebular Angular Nebular The new version of Eva changed the NbSelects option list container offset from to px The only way I can think of customising this property is through inheritance providing a new component Is there a way of customising this value with token strategy We will close this issue if you dont provide

appears that active state is set to the first NbMenuItem if the URL contains a queryParams something My understanding is that pathMatch property is setting the first matching NbMenuItem in the menu as selected on every URL change so no matter what you chose in the menu the top item will always get active styles applied Expected behavior active styles are toggled per NbMenuItem selected Steps to reproduce My submenu contains the items that link to the following pagesreportwidgetnaviID f a c a aee b edc fe a pagesreportwidgetnaviID cd c d cb d ecff d a pagesreportwidgetnaviID d f df a a f c a pagesreportwidgetnaviIDb ee bd ee b e c f d b Clicking on any of the items will update URL and do other business logic but will not set the selected item styles to active Related code Not sure how

nbdatepicker datepickernbdatepicker That works fine but I want to put icon into nbInput like this I couldnt find any example about nbIcon in input Have any ideas about this Hello I am facing an issue with refreshtoken support mechanism As far as I understand Nebular handle refresh token by invoke of isAuthenticatedOrRefresh method While sending a bulk of http requests to the server Nebular handler recognizes that a refreshtoken is needed and sends a lot of requests per each request for refreshtoken instead of waiting for one refreshtoken to return In that situation the first refreshtoken request returns ok and the corresponding http request gets the required data with no problem BUT the other requests fail Attached you can find the result as we get them on Network capture Please advise how should we handle refreshtoken while working with Nebular Is it a bug or wrong way of implementation Thanks in advance I want to be able to show the menu items according to their permissions the user user has permission to see the dashboard and iufeatures and the admin has permission to everything appmodulets NbSecurityModuleforRoot accessControl user view dashboard uifeatures admin view

nbcardbody but it still seems to use the default values which appear to be coming the theme I have also tried using the NgStyle method and this doesnt work either I have even created a function in my typescript component to try and call that but that doesnt appear to work either I am at a bit of a loss as to what might be causing the problem Do I need to create a CSS class and then apply it to the nbcardbody
