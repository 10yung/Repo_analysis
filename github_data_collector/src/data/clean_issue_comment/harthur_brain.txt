Hi I try to learn to detect the gender of names The TrainingData looks like this input output h f input output h f input output h f input output h f input output h f input output h f input output h f input output h f My code Do you know what Im doing wrong Thx You have two flows Train and Run I import it to NodeRed and press the inject node to Train it I get this in the debug window TypeError May not write null values to stream If the demo doesnt work I am a bit worried Hi I am trying to use brain for training RSSI and sensors coordinates as inputs and position as output in xyz normalized in single number can you suggest on data modeling this into brain inputs x y z distance x y z distance x y z distance output x y z as position i get constant error while training even up to iterations Regards So I try to run this project here is the steps I take not sure if it is correct sh yarn install When it asks Couldnt find any versions for esprimasix that matches Please choose a version from this list Use arrow keys Choose Then create a file like basicjs var assert requireassert brain requirelibbrain var net new brainNeuralNetwork nettrain input r g b output black input r g b output white input r g b output white var output netrun r g Run node basicjs to see the result Hope it help If I running single my script to recognition a charecter then Neral Network skip layer input but if require it from server Hapi error occur at line And I resolved it thisbiases i j layer node layer node bias thisweights i j layer node layer node weightstoArray Ill do like to know can I reopen this repository I train my network on a set of data containing car data year of fabrication mileage type model as input and price as output I try to predict price for another car but output is NaN NaN is not even among the values in the training set so this seams like an issue with the brain module My code is on GitHib Gist here On NeuralNetworkprototype initialize method For loop improvement has been made Removed the unnecessary condition check if layer for each iteration on loop In the past I have used Brainjs and some other JavaScript based machine learning libraries but unfortunately I have found them not matching my needs Thats why working on my personal projects I have developed the idea of creating a different approach by myself So sorry to be here to talk about another project but I would really like to receive some opinions and suggestions from experienced people that being into this specific field could help me to set useful and shared expectations By the way thanks for the great support given to Brainjs so far The library is called DN A and is on harthur I was looking at your profile and saw this Why do you not maintain these projects anymore If you dont have time to do that why do you not search somebody to keep them alive
