This is a very early attempt to add support to skip the stage part of Merge Conflicts All changes connected to MergeState is a second part planned to do a CompleteConflictResolution without doing the stage part I have not managed to get that part working yet The change in sideResolver class MergeConflictsView is a quick dirty fix to as I see it an existing problem So in the end there are quite few changes so far connected to the added Skip Stage functionality The reason for this change is the plan to use mergeconflicts together with GitHub Desktop In some cases you lose the possibility to commit in GitHub Desktop if the change is staged Support custom project path for conflict detection And To be compatible with the case where the path may be git root path Give other package author the ablity to programmed detection confilct usage js atompackagesgetActivePackagemergeconflictsmainModuledetectsomeGitRepoPath I work on files over a mount and running mergeconflicts takes about minutes to load Is it possible to ask it to only search a particular folder in the tree rather than everything in the current tree Sometimes git is drunk and we need to keep both local and upstream changes It would be nice to have a button for this Quite possible I missed something visually while using this tool If that is the case just let me know I had two conflicts in the same file I clicked on the use ours button The update to the file was made in atoms buffer I was completely clueless how to move to the next conflict quickly I did not see a button the footer UI and scrolling wasnt really an option as there were a few thousand lines between the different conflicts I ended up needing google to get me to atomiopackagesmergeconflicts so I could figure out the key combo Felt like there should have been a UI button on the footer interface mergeconflicts v Hi Ive started a discussion over at the minimap project about a highlighter for merge conflicts in the minimap Could you elaborate on how you do detection for that stuff so maybe someone can work on a plugin Im not adept enough in coding to even try that myself The highlighted lines overlaps and they occupying all the width of the screen

top of other panels If Atom tree view is open the bars will temporarily display over that If the mergeconflict panel is open the bars will temporarily display over that It looks like this is mostly due to the animation on open but some still persist You can see that its overlaid on minimap and part of the Atom window below screenshot from screenshot from The notification that the file is ready
