In order to let us help you better please fill out the following fields as best you can I am x Here about something else Issue description We need to move the Plugin Page away from the wiki as its unable to generate the page anymore Screenshot from Possible Alternatives Use Github Pages Split page in multiple pages Remove it altogether Im leaning towards Github Pages Since description seems to be read from bootcmd definition and this is not easy to see in the documentation even the examples dont use it see maybe it is better to change this code to not produce an error in the command flows list when no description is available In order to let us help you better please fill out the following fields as best you can I am Reporting a bug Suggesting a new feature Requesting help with running

with auto triggered firststep if I used the command that triggered the first step The first step still reruns My question is How can I check if a flow from the same user is already running so I can end it in the above case Steps to reproduce Flow stepone steptwo End stepone is auto triggered and depending on the input from user either end or move to steptwo on stepone just use the same command that triggers stepone again Additional info In order to let us help you better please fill out the following fields as best you can I am Reporting a bug X Suggesting a new feature Requesting help with

of telegram backend Telegram uses a nonmono spaced font so when showing the result for some formatted commands the output is not well formatted for example status command Telegram allows for the use of markdown to indicate mono space fonts but Im not sure what would be the best way to make this available to errbot Screenshot from It would be nice to have this behavior available at least for some commands When creating a dynamic command plugin that uses the argbotcmd function there is no obvious way to pass multiple arguments to the Command object as is the case when using the Decorator pattern with mutiple arguments This pull request adds a new method appendargs to the Command object which can take arguments and keywords Below is an example of how this code would be used HelpCommand

Errbot version OS version CentOS Python version Using a virtual environment yes Issue description We are using errbot with Slack My problem is that starting the bot takes a really long time minutes Im wondering what could be the cause for the slow start FYI our slack environment is huge k members and k channels Steps to reproduce start the bot watch the logs Takes about minutes to start Additional info If you have any more information please specify it here It adds a LOT of noise in Errbot as the API is way lower level than the previous version this is basically a pure socket to Slack json
