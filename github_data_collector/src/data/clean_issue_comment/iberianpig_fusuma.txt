Recently when I use my touchpad in Ubuntu I find it can not work when I use my finger gesture When I run the fusuma manually I get this error varlibgems gemsfusuma libfusumadevicerb in block in

libinput I had a had time with xdotool It seems it refuses to work properly or do it more that once in a while I solved it jumping to other libraries that do similar In this case I used xte and wmctrl It would be nice if this alternative solution enters in configyml commented out I did not mess around with configyml and I dont know if you can comment things out If you can a commented header explaining what configyml is would do the trick so we know we can comment out other things Anyway I write down here my configyml and a code I found on the internet that helped me sot it our Hope it

MANJARO SMP PREEMPT Thu Dec UTC Distribution Manjaro Linux r n l Desktop session gnome I have used the gsettings set orggnomedesktopperipheralstouchpad sendevents enabled command btw I know a similar issue has already been posted but none of the solutions mentioned in those issues worked for me I have not downgraded my libinput because I dont know which version would work I was writing some code in visual studios jumping from application to application when I noticed random letters being typed mainly s and a keys After looking a little closer I figured out that these keys are entered every time I make a gesture Is this a way to stop this happening Description It does the pinch in shortcut when I pinch out fingers So does the reverse The problem only happens with fingers fingers pinch inout gestures are working properly Ive fix the problem temporarily by reversing the shortcuts in the configuration file My entire configuration file Though I think Its just a minor bug swipe left

viceversa I know this is expected as some tutorials on the internet suggest to reverse the commands to balance the behavior However setting altRight instead of altLeft and viceversa doesnt produce any change So I cant understand To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Swipe left Swipe right Expected behavior Swipe left should go back in a browser swipe right should go forward Versions fusuma

Usually fusuma works as intended reacting to gestures immediately but sometimes it consistently takes a few seconds s to execute the command It doesnt matter if the command is ran at startup or manually in a console Moreover the whole OS Ubuntu in my case freezes while the gesture waits to be executed even the cursor stops blinking To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Do a gesture
