The config docs for authenticating to private repos dont talk about ATHENSGITHUBTOKEN but they should What is the problem I am trying to address Adds documentation on Athens docker images How is the fix applied Added documentation on Athens docker images moves some documentation from the walkthrough to the new page Mention the issue number it fixes or add the details of the changes if it doesnt have a specific issue Fixes On every commit we push a new image to docker hub This means that people can lock their Athens deployment to a commit sha without worrying about it changing from under their feet ie Canary builds as well as without having to wait for our official releases The dev releases are kept in a separate docker hub repository here However this is not mentioned anywhere and it would be great to include in our docs maybe a new section called Docker under Install Athens or just on the home page What is the problem I am trying to address Currently the helm chart does not allow you to specify annotations to be applied to the Athens pod How is the fix applied annotations field added to valuesyaml which is utilised by the Deployment to add extra annotations to the Athens pod Mention the issue number it fixes or add the details of the changes if it doesnt have a specific issue No issue number Fixes Also adds a new dev formatter so things look prettier than Logruses TextFormatterIm tempted to make it even more fancy but for now it works One of the main confusions is that GoEnv disabled our Request Logger Middleware if the GoEnvproduction That is mainly because we just fmtPrintln the log line where we should be using our proper logger We should make it so that the middleware is always in use and if an Athens user wants to not see these logs then they can just set their LogLevel to something higher than INFO In a related note maybe the Request Logger Middleware should always log DEBUG instead of INFO What is the problem I am trying to address Provide details on the reason for the validation failure How is the fix applied As part of the response message for the ValidationHook the response body can optionally contain a payload If a payload is detected a message is logged similar to that shown below WARN Module githubcomgogiteagiteav Reason Reason for warning Description Detailed description of warning httpmethodGET httppathgithubcomgogiteagiteavv mod httpurlgithubcomgogiteagiteavv mod handler GET githubcomgogiteagiteavv mod It is the responsibility of the ValidationHook endpoint to determine if a build should fail or continue Fixes What is the problem I am trying to address Underscores are not properly escaped resulting formatting issues here How is the fix applied Escaping the underscore What is the problem I am trying to address Typo in documentation How is the fix applied Fix spelling Mention the issue number it fixes or add the details of the changes if it doesnt have a specific issue Fixes None
