Just hangs after selecting yes Pressing e for exec is mentioned in the READMEmd file but it seams it is not implemented After a while the list of containers shown in ctop doesnt match docker stats Cant provide much more than that at the moment ctop version build bd ae go Docker version build d d Ubuntu LTS Its unclear what the NET speed is referenced as Please switch to a standard format such as KB kb kB Kb KiB kib Kbps kbps etc List of bugs Ive seen StoppingStarting containers freezes the app Stoppedremoved containers are still present with red status next to its name at the bottom Sometimes when you restartstart containers the stats are Pressing e on a container will open a shell and then using a text editor will show weird characters on the left side From what Ive seen does not have these issues This is a WIP for the moment naive approach to adding colors to ctop Open to conversation on this but at least wanted a PR against it for posterity Fixes Has a nasty habit of just exiting in log view either initially or via a crash fault after awhile If it doesnt decide to just terminate upon startup first There is already a packaged version for Arch Would be great to also have it packaged for ubuntudebian via apt Even a PPA is fine It would need a different name because sudo apt install ctop actually installs this Some stuff often takes some time and an indicator showing its still running ie the ssh connection has not died would be great Especially before the first load when the screen is completely blank and when doing stuff like restarting a container or loading logs Was updated k s branch from master branch Resolved conflicts Added script for preparing minikube for testing kubernetes connector not work yet
