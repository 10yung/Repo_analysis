x New feature nonbreaking change which adds functionality Breaking change fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change Checklist If youre unsure about any of these dont hesitate to ask Were here to help My code follows the code style of this project My change requires a change to the documentation I have updated the documentation accordingly I have checked that the changes are working properly x I have checked that there isnt any PR doing the same x I have read the CONTRIBUTING document Hello everyone Its been over a year since this project was released The feedback so far was phenomenal and it seems that some people really find this project useful despite my initial thoughts Id like to make the second version of it and I need your opinions on it The idea is to introduce a completely new structure similar to the secondsstarter kit Things I would like to include in the second version Make the project accessible and add accessibility category Introduce visually pleasing dark mode At least one new category eg Computer Science Make it with Gatsby so many things out of the box Add the ability to share questions Individual pages for each question better SEO I guess Remove expertise tags at least visually so many people complain about it Add about page A form to submit new questions without GitHub account Host the project on Netlify A random interview simulation What do you think about proposed changes Would you like to see something else What current parts of the projects do you like the most Id love to see a Dark Mode feature implemented I find myself browsing this site at night on my phone and I think having the option to toggle a dark theme would greatly improve the experience for certain scenarios like night time browsing Although there are many ways to implement this I found a straightforward approach via this implementation example Looking forward to seeing if anyone else is interested The question csssiblingselectors seems to give a partially wrong answer As per W C spec the tilde combinator does not work the way its described in the answer Instead its almost the same as the combinator except that the element following the combinator doesnt have to be placed immediately after the one before the combinator On a side note the W C seems intent on changing the combinator names in fact this appears to have happened already in the currently active level spec The general sibling combinator was renamed to subsequentsibling combinator and the adjacentsibling combinator changed to nextsibling combinator One might consider using these names as well
