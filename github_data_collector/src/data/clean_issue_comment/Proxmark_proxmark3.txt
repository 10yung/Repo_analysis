proxmark hf snoop db Buffer cleared bytes db Skipping first sample pairs Skipping triggers db Trigger kicked Value Dumping Samples Hispeed now db HF Snoop end Why cant I eavesdrop data Normal APDU responses have a maximum total size of bytes thats bytes of data and a twobyte response code Extended APDU responses can have a maximum total size of bytes bytes of data and a twobyte response code The proxmark firmware currently supports a maximum response size of bytes which is bytes of data and a twobyte response code This is normally adequate but in some cases larger return values need to be handled For example the root CA certificate in a Tesla Model Key Fob is somewhat larger than bytes When requested the entire certificate is included in the APDU response There is no way to fetch subsets in order to build up the certificate over multiple APDU requests the only way it is returned is as a large chunk Supporting the maximum theoretical byte length might not be practical Java Card itself doesnt support larger than but seems too small Please consider doubling or quadrupling the maximum supported extended APDU length Using HF a snoop command to packetcapture in proxmark Cannot

this repository but I hope someone will be able to help me anyways I found on the internet the Proxmark III getting started guide That guide mentions devkitARM and that it needs to be installed in version release Unfortunately the link to this version is down and I need exactly this version for another project of mine unrelated to proxmark I searched your forum and wiki and found this old revision of a wiki page where it says you need devkitARM r but the download link is dead as well I looked through the forum and found various mentions that devkitARM is required or isnt required in some cases I guess thats why it was removed from the github wiki page but I was unable to find a working download link and I really need that version of devkitARM r Does anyone of the proxmark team still happen to have a working download link for devkitARMr i linuxtarbz If not does anyone have a working link for any other version Maybe I can get it to work with some other older version as well but it doesnt work with the versions that are currently available for download from the devkitPro team I really need that old r and the PDF file I found is the only hit on Google that contains any information about that so Im hoping anyone reading this issue report will be able to help me Im sorry for using this bugtracker for a request that has nothing to do with proxmark itself but the mail address on the webpage wasnt working I received a Undelivered Mail returned to sender error mail and I wasnt sure how to best contact you This current situation aside I am maintaining an archive of all devkitARM devkitPro versions I could ever find at but most of the old versions are only Windows builds Maybe some of this will be helpful for you at some point and I would be glad if you could help me complete this as well if you have any versions that arent in there yet Best regards Leseratte I noticed when I close all windows created by QT at once using Close all windows in Windows the client will just exit The command line window with the client is running is of cause not in the list of windows when using Close all windows When closing every windows on its own this does not happen I am not sure if this is only Windows related I tried it on Linux Mint but the QT windows are not grouped there so I can only close one by one Its required to compile on aarch and doesnt hurt on other platforms
