 lubridate not an option too many deps maybe but no time zone support that I need Rcpp and BH though pretty heavy though we do already import tibble so Rcpp is already needed eg r chdefcategoryn cat cOpen Closed Pending generate a vector of categories consisting of either the term Open Closed or Pending Possibly allow variation to be controlled as well r x DateTimeProvidernew formatxdatetimebetween format YMd eg could be maybe r librarycharlatan FooBar R R Class FooBar inherit BaseProvider public list foo function superrandomelementletters x FooBarnew xfoo j xfoo y xfoo f i opened an issue in R github repo a while back and winston responded recently I think i opened it with charlatan in mind That is methods from a parent class that children inherit id rather not show to the user just to make it a cleaner interface Try Winstons suggestion Ive seen duplicate names in the personproviders that Ive worked with eg frFR had Margot twice in the firstnamefemale vector I can imagine there are duplicate names in other locales A thorough sweep should be performed on all locales All name vectors in all locales should be sorted alphabetically for cleanliness Many of the vectors already are But a sweep should be performed I havent been able to find an example in the faker packages of other languages but then maybe I have missed existing stuff The idea would be to have something similar to MissingDataProvider but instead of replacing the picked values with NAs itd modify them slightly to make them invalid for stuff that can be valid eg phone numbers have a given format or just different eg for people names I guess making an element different isnt too difficult but making it invalid is a bit more effort cc isteves Maybe in the vignette An example where one would create a dataframe with missing data via cc higgi
