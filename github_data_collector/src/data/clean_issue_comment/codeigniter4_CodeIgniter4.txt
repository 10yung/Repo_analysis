Description Fixes using filters on properties in arrays Problem is related to the use of character in filters as character is handled as OR in regex This makes replace singe get multiple matches which in the end leads to multiplied data by number of characters Additionally I have added test case testParsePairWithAbs in ParserFilterTest Initially I was thinking to modify the existing tests to check for nested array elements as well But this will require changing almost all the test methods So Ive added the new test method based on testAbs which checks that abs filter works in various nested array properties Ive noticed some style issue CodeSniffer replaced if countkeyVal to if countkeyVal So I also included this change in the commit This PR Fixes Checklist x Securely signed commits x Components with PHPdocs x Unit testing with coverage x User guide updated x Conforms to style guide Bug redirecttoparam returns url without param If param has not value it removes param param param In php if you open page with param in GET array you will see this array param Redo of Wrong single quote Hello It seems that there is a problem with the layouts and I think that this is due to obstart obflush in the renderer It will be easier to explain my problem with an example public function send string email viewemail Send email script here return viewconfirmation View email extends a layout x with a section called body View confirmation extends another layout y with a section called body Sometimes but not always viewconfirmation displays the body section of email and confirmation The renderer merges both sections even if the layout is not the same This is really annoying For the moment I try to prefix all my sections in each layouts but it would be better if I didnt have to do this kind of things All models have single pager Opportunity to change parameter whith we get current page Models now dont work with GET page fix in userguide attributes type is array but in code type is string Description I wanted to use CodeIgniter in an Oracle environment Also it was determined that support would be provided because ORACLE was described in the document Checklist x Securely signed commits x Components with PHPdocs x Unit testing with coverage x User guide updated x Conforms to style guide The design of the program to get the insertId of this PR is not so good Please good solution Description Issue Checklist Securely signed commits x Components with PHPdocs x Unit testing with coverage User guide updated Conforms to style guide For postgres db doesnt work for php spark migrate command The migrations table and the table specified in migration is always created in public schema and not in the schema specified in the env file Correct migration only works by specifying database schema directly in the app Config Databasephp file
