This pull request changes the value of the license property in packagejson to a standard machinereadable SPDX license identifier Ill be honest This is a semiautomated pull request I started by using dat to review metadata for all packages on npm looking for packages updated sometime in the last year that dont use a valid SPDX license identifier in packagejson I used my own npm module spdxcorrect to guess what license you were after MIT A quick manual check and a few shell scripts later and this pull request was born npm doesnt require that you use a valid SPDX identifier but its strongly recommended Try npm help packagejson and search for License Other source code package managers like Maven for Java and RubyGems for Ruby recommend the same Why care about SPDX A machinereadable standard makes it possible for programs rather than just people to review a module or even an entire codebase to make sure that licenses are compatible Whatever the reason strong personal conviction company policy terms of a business deal SPDX makes it easier to collaborate with others when licenses can be a problem and helps take opensource software to more places Given that npm has a ton of modules but also handles dependencies in a novel way I think a little license hygiene could help npm build amazing new relationships between communities that lawyers have long kept apart Though this PR was semiautomatic my responses to any questions you have wont be I cant give legal advice over GitHub but Im happy to answer questions about SPDX or point you to good resources on related problems Thanks for your contribution to opensource software K Just installed for first time never had this working before First test was to upload a jpg but received an error saying SSL is required filr candmjpg Uploading candmjpg xml version encodingutf rsp statfail err code msgSSL is required rsp Error uploading file Is this something Im doing wrong on my end did flickr change their interface or is it something wrong with filr Thanks for the help J you could store meta data file names and type in the exif jpg essentially being a zip file anyway also you could have a actual image of what the file represents say a picture of the radiohead album or whatever
