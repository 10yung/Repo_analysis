How can I handle the case in which the object I am tracking goes outside the screen Sometimes when it reappears it is found and it starts tracking it again but in other cases instead it starts tracking other objects when the original tracked object goes outside the screen Thanks Hi The purpose of mine is to use Object Detection methodslike RefineDet to detect object and then use Object Tracking methods like SiamMaskdeepsort to track the object How should i do Could it be possible to combine the RefineDet with SiamMask I read train function in trainsiammask then saw that have no evaluation step on val dataset Thats why meaniou iou iou are not displayed during training time Can anyone explain for me I tried to see the testing results in my laptop with only bag and ball For this I only kept these two files in homesamihaSiamMaskexperimentssiammasksharptestVOT CustommaskrefineSiamMaskVOTVOT and in homesamihaSiamMaskdataVOT but I am facing a ZeroDivisionError as bellow Please help with suggestions to solve this I can see from paper that size for templates features should be x x but because of this condition actually it is x x Can anyone explain How can we run it for our own dataset and what is this pth file and how do we generate this pth file How do I fixed this warning rk loadhelperpy load pretrained model from checkpointe pth rk loadhelperpy remove prefix module rk loadhelperpy Warning missing keys refinemodelpost weight refinemodelv weight refinemodelpost bias refinemodelv bias refinemodelpost bias refinemodelh bias refinemodelpost weight refinemodelv weight refinemodelpost bias refinemodelv weight refinemodelv bias refinemodelh weight refinemodelv weight refinemodelh bias refinemodelv bias refinemodelh bias refinemodelv weight refinemodelh bias refinemodelv bias refinemodelh weight refinemodelv weight refinemodelh bias refinemodelv bias refinemodelh bias refinemodeldeconvweight refinemodelh weight refinemodelv bias refinemodelpost weight refinemodelh weight refinemodelh weight refinemodelh weight refinemodeldeconvbias rk loadhelperpy missing keys rk loadhelperpy used keys File homekihongmountHardksonTrackSiamMaskmasterexperimentssiammasksharpcustompy line in forward out selfpost Fupsampleselfh out selfv p size RuntimeError The size of tensor a must match the size of tensor b at nonsingleton dimension SiamMaskmasterexperimentssiammasksharp bash runsh checkpointe pth When I tried with my own data set I got this issue Environment cores CPU GB memory Linux Centos The model have been sucessfully run on my own video but tracking cost around s for each frame per frame the track speed is only about FPS Can I improve the tracking speed on CPU AttributeError Custom object has no attribute trackrefine How can I do when I run python toolsdemopy resume SiamMaskDAVISpth config configdavisjson or bash testmaskrefinesh configvotjson SiamMaskVOTpth VOT The error will appearBut I find Custom have this attribute in the code and I dont change anything in the download code whats wrong with it and how can I deal with it
