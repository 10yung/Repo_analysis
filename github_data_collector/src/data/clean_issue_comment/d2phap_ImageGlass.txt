The displayed date in the title bar is the creation date of the file A option to change that to the modified date or better DateTimeOriginal EXIF Data would be nice Problem For Pictures the displayed date and time is the time they where moved from the camera to the pc creation time and not when they where taken modified date DateTimeOriginal EXIF Data Following picture was taken at but ImageGlass shows it as ImageGlass grafik IrfanView grafik From Google Group A request to add pinchtozoom when using precision touchpads I have confirmed that touchpad swipe to scroll works in IG This seems to be tied to Mouse Wheel actions is there a specific set of touchpad gesture messages we can support Determine which Windows touchpad gestures we can support From Google Group I have all my JPEGs in Adrobe RGB color profile and this program does not display colors correctly See attached image You can see the desired colors when using Windows Photo Viewer but not Paint Photos or a browser From what Ive been able to determine an image may be marked with a color profile but not via an ICC Color Profile Instead they use an exif metadata tag called the Interoperability Index aka InteropIndex In the case of this user the InteropIndex is set to Adobe RGB ImageMagick MagickNET do not recognize this exif tag and provide the image to us with the sRGB color space The following line of code will get us the value of the InteropIndex var test imgMGetAttributeexifthumbnailInteroperabilityIndex where imgM is our MagickImage object The known values of the InteropIndex are R AdobeRGB R sRGB Suggested approach Add code to look for this exif tag and verify the image is in the desired color space If not we should convert the image color space Submit an issue to MagickNET requesting they use the desired color space in this situation A I have to change edit app for Open with feature ImageGlass ImageGlass Currently navigation goes in one direction Left is previous image Right is next image Request is to add support for swapping that so Left is next image Right is previous image ie RTL navigationreading order While were at it going to mention support for swapping the PgDnPgUp navigation direction too cheers Please add below feature Display thumbnail instead original photo until the photo is loaded Image Preview cc Is your feature request related to a problem Only two points are related to a problem Im frustrated that I must use the context menu to Start and Stop an animated image gif There should be a dedicated button on the Page Navigation window for this When I click View PreviousNext page the animation starts playing on its own This trivializes the Page Navigation feature It shouldnt do this I cannot navigate only through different frames If I have a fouruniqueframes animation that has frames for visibilitytiming purposes Ill have to navigate through unchanging frames before I get to a different one I wish I were able to navigate through unique frames only The button seemingly does nothing in the Page Navigation menu If it does nothing it should be removed Additional context Im glad the MultipagePage navigation feature was added Before this I had to open an image editor to view gifs framebyframe By the way this is unrelated but the Issues section of ImageGlass on GitHub is very organized This is great Most Issues dont come close to being this organized System information Windows OS version Windows Pro ImageGlass version To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Start ImageGlass by opening a TGA image or load a TGA image in ImageGlass with CtrlO Observe the image is rendered upsidedown Actual behavior TGA images are rendered upsidedown in ImageGlass Expected behavior All images formats should be rendered in the correct orientation Screenshots TGA image of letter A rendered in ImageGlass Id love the possibility not only to resize the thumbnailpane but to save the new size permanently System information Windows OS version Windows Home Version OS

add screenshots to help explain your problem Additional context I believe commit a b a c d c aebd ca ae bf b improved ToolbarButtons changed some default configs values by d phap caused this issue specifically the change to line of Helperscs to alter the delimiter from comma to semicolon Assuming only people that have customized their ZoomLevel in the past would experience this issue I hand edited the XML file AppData Roaming ImageGlass igconfigxml to change the delimiter to a semicolon and the application started normally following that change
