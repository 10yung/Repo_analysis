 Describe your issue I have mostly copied the example to use SCAF when I test it with the camelbobj the one also shown in the tutorial page at SCAF section it works fine but when I try to use other objects even very simple ones it does either of things it crashes at line caused by line returning an empty allbounds array making so that primarybound is not valid crashes at line with Error Numerical Issue On top of this on certain meshes it works but the output is not what I might expect meshzip Any idea on what am I doing wrong typedef EigenMatrixdouble EigenDynamic EigenDynamic

more tips I am dealing with the task of Picking Faces with libigl I have found Picking tutorial very useful but I realised as well that for big meshes it takes too much time I stumbled upon this link Even though I tried so hard to implement the solution you had suggested to replace iglraymeshintersect with iglembreeEmbreeIntersector using interectRay for my project I am unable to make it work Specifically I installed embree I created an Embree intersection structure iglembreeEmbreeIntersector ei and I initialized eiinitVcastfloat Fcastint Then I tried to replace iglunprojectontomesh which is inside the callback function look at Picking Tutorial code with the following code which i found on libiglexamples repository wins EigenVector fx y EigenVector f windx y iglopengl unprojectwins s

realised that i should include unprojecth include iglopengl unprojecth as i did I found the library in this link I got the following LNK errors img width altmyerrors src Unfortunately my programming skills in C are not so advanced If youd be so kind I would really appreciate it if you could give me some help or guidance Describe your issue Im using pythonbinding applying principal curvature using the command v v k k iglprincipalcurvaturev f but Im getting the error Process finished with exit code interrupted by signal SIGSEGV v are in this format and f are As well if I used the gaussian curvature it prints out the results but with giving nan values nan nan as well the error in the title Please any help Check all that apply change to x Windows Mac OS X x Linux I have tried the dev

So its really neat that libigl includes a sparse QP solver and overall this activeset implementation is solid However it has severe performance problems that prevent it from being useful at scale which I wanted to bring up in case yall ever consider improving this function In particular activeset uses minquadwithfixed to do the inner iteration solves That function in turn runs a QR decomposition on the constraints to check whether or not they are indefinite this QR decomposition happens every inner iteration On the one hand in theory this is needed since the active inequality constraints could suddenly become linearly dependent with previously independent inequality constraints but it absolutely kills performance Maybe theres a better way to check linear dependence Or at least some way to tell activeset to always assume linear independence of the constraints ie often you can prove this about your problem in advance Check all that apply change to x X Windows X Mac OS X
