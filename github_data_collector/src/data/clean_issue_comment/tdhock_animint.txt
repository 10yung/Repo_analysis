jimhesterwithr d yaml cran Hi I am facing the same error when running the example I changed my ggplot version as suggested by you in a similar thread but now I get this error Error in asvectory attempt to apply nonfunction Appreciate your help This branch implements a test that fails for infinite data This used to be working when we saved the built data to tsv files before axis updates See screenshot below Left the current animint code which renders segments incorrectly outside of their panels Right rendering in In ggplot infinite data are rendered on the edge of the panel screenshotinffull Note also that the DOM panel shows that the JavaScript code is not able to tell the difference between positive and negative infinity they are both read as NaN To fix this I propose to modify the compiler to replace InfInf values with the appropriate finite values that correspond to the panel border positions scale limits These scale limits will be different for different showSelected subsets if axisupdates is on faizankhaniit do you have any ideas about where to change the compiler in order to achieve this TODO add a test for infinite values in a plot with axis updates rather than explicitly writing structurelist classanimint we can write animint Currently through this PR we have axes updates for most geoms The computation for data subsets to be used during updates is done in the compiler This works for most cases but due to the limitations of the compiler it does not work properly for some examples We want axes updates to handles all the cases of single selection variables One possible solution as tdhock suggested would be to move the whole computation to the renderer since there seems to be no efficient way to handle this in the compiler Any other suggestions as it is scales are trained before removing NA rows which will not be plotted an example where this is problematic but not a huge problem is described in comments in testrenderer textR In general selected aesthetics are to let the plot designer answer the question how should the geom look after it is clicked right now in animint we use a simple heuristic which is not configurable by the plot designer when a geomrect is clicked we set its border stroke color to black Otherwise it has no border Using selected aesthetics we could say colorNA and selectedcolorblack when any other geom is clicked we set its alpha opacity to more than the value that was specified in the R code using selected aesthetics we could say alpha and selectedalpha or alpha and selectedalpha The idea of selected aesthetics is to make this behavior more configurable so the designer can change what the geoms look like after they are clicked However if you implement this new feature please make sure to respect these settings as defaults viswaraavi here are detailed answers to your questions For this example p ggplot geompointdata tips aesx totalbill y tip colour sexsmokerselectedcolourRed we will have all the legends selected and all the data is shown and the legends will respond to mouse clicks and update selection that is correct However the selectedcolour will have no effect since there is no clickSelects aesthetic specified selectedcolourred means that the point color should be changed to red when the points clickSelects value is selected What will be the difference between specifying colour and selectedcolour Is it that if we specify colour all the variable will be shown with colour red But with selectedcolour we want only selected variable to be in colour red selectedcolourred means we want to change the point color to red when it is clicked has no effect if no clickSelects is specified colorred mean we want the point color to be red when it is not clicked If this is the case then if multiple variables are selected then will all have red colour If variables are not selected what colour will they have again if you do not specify clickSelects then none of the points will be red they will all be black ggplot default if you do specify clickSelects for example r p ggplot geompointdata tips aesx totalbill y tip clickSelectssexsmoker selectedcolourRed then I would expect all points corresponding to the selected sexsmoker are red and other points are black When the user hovers on the element the respective legend text gets highlighted and gets bold with increase in font size When hovers out the legend text becomes normal we need to specify nonstandard geom params such as geompointchunkvarscvar var faizankhaniit implemented a PR which was rejected by ggplot now we have to wait until ggplot figures out a solution to the issue until then I suggest we continue to depend on Faizans validateparams branch
