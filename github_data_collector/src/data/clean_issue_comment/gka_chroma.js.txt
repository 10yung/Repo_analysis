Would you accept a pull request adding tint and shade functions These would mix the colour with white and black respectively at a given percentage CSS Color Level adds the HWB space to CSS It would be nice to add it to chromajs Would you accept a pull request for this Issue suggests making HWB an alias for HSV but I dont think this makes sense I tried to deploy the library as a webjar on as I want to use it in a Vaadin project Unfortunately the license is not recognized and the deploy is not possible Is it somehow possible to standardize the license and use a single license instead of the both licenses specified right now It would be nice to have a method colorFormatstring or colorModelstring to be able to find out what color model is used in a given CSS string Like this Specifically the functionality would be useful for automated checking of readability I assume there are other ways to achieve this with Chroma however it would be nice to have semantic methodsproperties that convey the intent of the functionality chroma r g b a will work fine We can see the alpha channel properly set in the chroma object and chroma r g b a alpha returns BUT chroma h s l a will not consider the value a We can see the alpha channel set to instead of in the chroma object and chroma h s l a alpha returns Hi Im doing a website that should analyze pictures of a Rubiks cube and extract its colors to reach a solution In order to do that I am taking the average color of every square of the cube faces x squares per face resulting in colors My problem was how to find the color of each one of the faces I tryed some stuff and got this The function receives all the colors in my case and the size of each color group in my case the amount of extracted colors that belong to a cube face It will return colors divided by representing each face of the cube javascript groupCloseColorscolorsRgb IRGB groupSize number const resultColors chromaColor let colors colorsRgbmap r g b chromargbr g b new Arraycolorslength groupSize fillgroupSize forEach const sample colorssplice const colorsCloserToSample colors mapcolor color distance chromadistancecolor sample sorta b adistance bdistance slice groupSize map color color colors colorsfilterc colorsCloserToSampleeverycs cs c const result chromaaverage colorsCloserToSample sample resultColorspushresult return resultColors Example of input and output I think that maybe this would be a good addition to chromajs what you guys think In a Vue Typescript project hue is not found on Cubehelix Property hue does not exist on type Cubehelix start rotations hue gamma lightness scale Version typescript tslint In node no problem chromacubehelixstart rotations hue gamma lightness scalecolors ffab a f d f ff fca ff ffab packagejson chromajs typeschromajs I think the hue function signature is just missing from typeschromajs here though I didnt dig far After modifying typeschromajsindexdts things appears to be compiling OK interface Cubehelix hueh number Cubehelix Say I have the colour red and an array of colours black white burgundy Is it possible to do this const resembles chromaresemblesred black white burgundy resembles burgundy
