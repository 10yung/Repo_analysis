 Version RC January Maven JavaDocs This is an early release for to allow preparations for the breaking API changes and cleanups Please check out the wiki page Whats different in from time to time for the details and migration guide API changes Remove fromFuture Scheduler overloads Remove a pointless concatMapIterable overload Rename to combineLatestArrayDelayError Remove MaybeonExceptionResumeNext Bugfixes Fix FlowableflatMap not canceling the inner sources on outer error Documentation enhancements Prettify Flowable JavaDocs validator Improve JavaDocs of Completable and some others Improve JavaDocs of Single Improve JavaDocs of Maybe Improve JavaDocs of Observable and fix similar issues elsewhere Cleanup JavaDocs for parameter validation all around Improve wording of operators Add operator matrix wiki autoextractor Simplify return sentences in JavaDocs Other changes Bump junit from to Enable javac parameter saving in class files Bump buildinfoextractorgradle from to Add nullability annotations to type arguments Deleted unnecessary NPE tests Add Official Gradle Wrapper Validation GitHub Action Operator argument naming should match between base classes on the same operators For example Observablebufferboundary vs FlowablebufferboundaryIndicator Sourcelevel comparison would be too complicated so reflection can be used for this provided the class saves the argument names Javac has this option that must be enabled in the IDE and in buildgradle groovy compileJava compileTestJava optionscompilerArgs parameters taskswithTypeJavaCompile optionscompilerArgs parameters An extra test is preferrable to remind users enabling this option java void methodint paramName deliberately empty Test public void javacParametersEnabled throws Exception assertEqualsPlease enable saving parameter names via the parameters javac argument paramName getClass getDeclaredMethodmethod IntegerTYPE getParameters getName There are some common operator names across all base classes these should match as well The current ParamValidationNaming can only check explicit argument validation ie the method body lists requireNonNull or verifyPositive but not overloads delegating to those methods thus lacking the explicit argument validation themselves I dont think this can be automated therefore each base reactive class source should be manually examined and expanded with the missing throws declaration Flowable Observable Maybe Single Completable ParallelFlowable There is currently an Observable cleanup PR in the works please wait for it before doing this issue Edit Perhaps checking if the typical method parameter names such as bufferSize prefetch capacityHint source mapper predicate etc appear in throws declaration Many code changes in x can be done independently but updating the new Whats Different in xmd would conflict This issue tracks which changes should be eventually described in the file Introduction of the Supplier interface Callable

review the operator set point to RxJava Extensions project add fancy descriptions like in Backpressure update wording remove unavailable operators fix image links make sure examples are in Java

TransformingObservablesmd review and add new operators fancy like X Whatsdifferentin md fine Writingoperatorsfor md expand fusion topics example operators X Footermd fine x Sidebarmd not sure if this is actually displayed as there is the Sidebarmdmd too Sync the two x Sidebarmdmd reorganize a bit list categories under all operators remove v references move v pages up I assembled a fresh evaluation of RxJava and Reactor performance under various usages and found the following deficiencies in RxJava x Flowableempty appears to be consuming a lot of memory See if a nontrampolining Schedulersfrom could improve asyncpipeline performance Check why ObservableblockingLast has more overhead than its Flowable counterpart Check why there is a lot more overhead with ReplayProcessor and ReplaySubject compared to v Check why there is a lot more overhead with UnicastProcessor and UnicastSubject compared to v Check why ObservablefromArray is somewhat slower with longer sources than Flowable Check why ObservablefromIterable is slower with longer sources than Flowable Optimize ObservableconcatMap for scalar inner sources Check why FlowableflatMapIterable is drastically slower than Observable and

still refer to the old names potential exceptions change in the code and the javadocs arent updated to match missing backpressure scheduler sinceannotations and outdated information in each of these changing things from consonant to vowelsoundstarting doing a searchandreplace and not replacing a with an or viceversa to match Also sometimes changing singulars to plurals or viceversa by searchandreplace which causes its own set of grammatical headaches if you see any documentation that uses the passive voice you can almost always make it clearer and less prone to misinterpretation by rewriting it in the active voice URLs for marble diagrams are copyandpasted the name of the operator is changed but the widthheight values in the img tag are not so that the right image appears but in the wrong dimensions there were a couple of these in the javadocs last I looked
