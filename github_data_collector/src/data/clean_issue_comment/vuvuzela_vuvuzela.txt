Hi please check the flowing function golang func TestG Add t testingT X RandomG randReader fmtPrintlnX Y newG AddXX fmtPrintlnY Then Y is always bn G Depends on Please review this first Depends on and these just move mock packages from alpenhorn to internal With this test running you can run vuvuzelaclient in another window connected to the local servers and send messages etc It is skipped by default because it runs forever Window go test v vuvuzelaiovuvuzela run TestRunVuvuzela Window vuvuzelaclient username aliceexampleorg debug home tmp url Dear davidlazar Could you be so kind to generate exe for the rest of us who are mere Windows users wo compiler See questions inline Depends on Will later add tests for latency for I created an account on the site and received a token but did not register during the delay hours Now I can not register its too late nor recreate the account using this very same address If the address dead or is there a way to receive a new token for it After registering with an email address on the site and receiving a token I proceeded to run the client vuvuzelaclient username myusernameexamplecom Failed to generate new Alpenhorn client fetching latest dialing config config expired on EST go version go darwinamd echo GOPATHUsersmyusernamego The client should take into account the latency to the coordinator when deciding when to send its onion for a round We can make Vuvuzela immune to passive traffic analysis by implementing Karaokes optimistic indistinguishability This mostly involves changing the Vuvuzela client to send messages in every round and to do something reasonable when messages are dropped
