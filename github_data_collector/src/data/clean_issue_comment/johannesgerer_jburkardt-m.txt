The original code produced points that were actually not uniformly distributed on a sphere The points were on clearly distinguishable spirals with larger gaps between them You can see the difference in the attached figures the number of points is I have not numerically checked whether my code is correct but it directly implements the equations in the paper and the resulting points look exactly like the example figures in the paper Also I failed to find an email address of John Burkardt hence I did not contact him in this issue new old
