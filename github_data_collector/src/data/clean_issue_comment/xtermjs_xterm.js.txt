This is a minor issue but should be relatively easy to correct While great care has gone into namespacing style rules for multiple xterm instances one small detail has been overlooked The problem is that all CSS keyframe animation rules share the same blinkblock name Because of this all instances will share the last defined keyframe rule so that every instance will have the same cursor color regardless of theme The following excerpt from an xterm generated style block illustrates the problem style keyframes blinkblock backgroundcolor rgba color rgba backgroundcolor rgba color rgba

uniquely identify the render owner to the end of the keyframe rule name as follows style keyframes blinkblock backgroundcolor rgba color rgba backgroundcolor rgba color rgba xtermdomrendererowner

Details Browser and browser version Any OS version Any xtermjs version Steps to reproduce Create multiple DOM rendered xtermjs instances within the same HTML document Assign different themes to each instance specifically cursor and cursorAccent Transfer focus between the different instances to see the cursor color remains the same as the last one defined Fixes Several sequences handlers of InputHandler show a different behavior than in xterm or officially specced in VT manual DEC STD ICH should not work outside of scroll margins for leftright DCH should not work outside of scroll margins for leftright SU should add scrolled out lines to scrollback under certain circumstances DECSTR lots of attributes are not reset DECRQSS fix SGR reporting decide how to deal with unsupported features that are still reported DECSCA DECSCL LRM commented out no DECSET DECSCNM DECSET does not clear altbuffer DECSET blinking cursor why disabled DECCOLM reset is currently broken already fixed in DA DA responses are way off SGR blinking is implemented in attrs but does not work in renderers SGR remove dead branch for p Tracking issue for better Unicode version support Things to do create a build tool based on to extract needed Unicode information for a specific version automate version addon creation as far as possible with the build tool options to treat ambiguous character as double width better Unicode support in general bidi and grapheme support long run conceptual work towards a better unicode handling in terminals via terminalwg Causes issues for ports in URLs and Windows path drives Hi Im developing an application that consume telnet protocol data from an application using websocket and an core functionality missing is the ability to switch between linemode and chractermode and switch localecho on and off base on server side request Whats the best way to achieve this Thanks Right now the canvas size is changed based on windowdevicePixelRatio one idea is to disable this type fo scaling see how VS Codes minimap doesnt change when zooming and then scale manually by applying a multiplier to relevant numbers Applies to WebGL and canvas renderers Details Browser and browser version Firefox OS version macOS Finnish keyboard xtermjs version Steps to reproduce Type tilde space or tilde n Observe that instead of getting and you get and Description For me on macOS Fnnish keyboard with Safari and Chrome a tilde space results in and tilde n results in as it should But on Firefox a tilde space results in and tilde n results in Interestingly this behavior difference can be seen but a bit differently for some reason on the home page example terminal If you enter tilde space there on Safari you get nothing at all Same for tilde n But with Firefox while tilde space gets you nothing a tilde n gets you Not sure why its working differently there Debug logging shows the following when typing tilde space on Firefox xtermjs sending data Array xtermjs sending data Array xtermjs parsing data For tilde n it shows xtermjs sending data Array xtermjs sending data Array xtermjs sending data Array xtermjs parsing data xtermjs parsing data The sending data log lines reported by xtermjs also match what Im seeing being sent to the onData callback Note that there are differences in browsers and platforms with regards to what is reported when entering composed characters from eg compositionend vs input vs keydown vs keypress events I should add that nothing is being sent until you hit space or n That is the initial tilde that starts the character compose does not result in any callbacks firing whch is correct The sequence of keyboard events recording by attaching a custom keyboard handler using the Terminal API for tilde n is on Windows Firefox with Finnish keyboard is the following keydown Control target textareaxtermhelpertextarea key Control charCode keyCode keydown target textareaxtermhelpertextarea key AltGraph charCode keyCode
