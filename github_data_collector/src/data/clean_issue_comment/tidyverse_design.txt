How add retired label rewrite description to describe why the retirement took place rewrite examples to focus on translation from old to new syntax keyword internal remove from pkgdown index give file a retired prefix Basic idea each package has a copy of the generic and the default method The default method falls back to the the generic in the other package setting an argument so you dont get stuck in an infinite loop R dbplyr export dbdesc functionx UseMethoddbdesc export dbdescdefault functionx Existing generics dont have default methods so ok to pass unconditonally to if crosspackage Original dbdescdefault implementation stop No applicable method for Generic applied to an object of class classx call FALSE else dplyrdbdescx crosspackage TRUE dplyr export dbdesc functionx if crosspackage deprecate when called directly use deprecatesoft if developerfacing use deprecatewarn if userfacing lifecycledeprecatesoft dplyrdbdesc dbplyrdbdesc UseMethoddbdesc export dbdescdefault functionx Existing generics dont have default methods so ok to pass unconditonally to if crosspackage Original dbdescdefault implementation stop No applicable method for Generic applied to an object of class classx call FALSE else dbplyrdbdescx crosspackage TRUE crosspackage function crosspackage FALSE crosspackage The main limitation is that when both packages are loaded at the same time youll get a conflict for every generic But I think this is ok because people generally ignore conflicts anyway So that you override them with something TRUE ie lazydtdt immutable FALSE would be better as lazydtdt mutable FALSE From lionel This would mean that some functions would have a quiet parameter verbose by default and others would have a verbose parameter quiet by default Maybe the general principle is that the name should be guided by the nondefault usage so that when reading code you dont get doublenegatives Im curious what your thoughts are on when a user should be expected to use bare variables vs strings as arguments I couldnt find discussion on this so far so apologies if this has already been covered although I did see this phrase Neither the namesto nor the valuesto column exists in religincome so we provide them as character strings surrounded in quotes Stated around this section of the tidyr vignette So my thoughts are this Bare symbols should be used to reference something that already exists or will exist and not to denote options except for boolean TRUEFALSE For example an existing column in selectdata barevar A new column such as in mutatedata newvar barevar But not myplotdata colour red linetype dotted I know its been discussed previously but I find default names from janitormakecleannames to be much more readable and consistent in their style with other naming conventions I currently default to including namerepair janitormakecleannames when using namerepair however it would be great to have something similar to makecleannames among the default options for the namerepair function Thanks as always for a great set of tools The namesRmd section doesnt render now that tibblesetminimalnamesx no longer exists Its used like so Consider an unnamed vector ie it has names attribute of NULL r x letters namesx Repair the names to make them minimal r x tibblesetminimalnamesx namesx Where does this sort of function live now and whats it called cc lionel krlmlr When should you use an interactive menu instead of an argument And how should you do it Why to do it how to do it
