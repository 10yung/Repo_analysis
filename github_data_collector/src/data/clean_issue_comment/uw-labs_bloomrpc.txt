 Looks like never came out I used brew to install it So now I have to build it from source to get it fixed Sometimes we use buffer as a response but It is difficult to read a buffer So I made this

deprecate old assertionmethods e e ba dad a Security The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on

complex install process Clicking the View Proto button begins to slide in a new view but the UI resets itself before the transition finishes bloom This happens with any proto I try The recording was made with the following syntax proto package hello service HelloWorld rpc SayHelloSayHelloRequest returns SayHelloResponse message SayHelloRequest optional string name message SayHelloResponse optional string value Im using v built from source on OS X here is my question Every time we use bloomrpc to test a single grpc method we have to input the rpc address and token when we switch env from stagging env or development env or prod env we need to do the same again which is time wasting and boring So I wonder if you guys have plan to refactor those two parts to make it more handy here is what I thought can we manage grpc address and meta input bar classify by env So we can reuse the address and meta when we test a single grpc method just like postman does end thanks for building such a useful tool I have a grpc request which request params would be token eyJhbGciOiJIUzI NiIsInR cCI IkpXVCJ query username santa This can not be executed because BloomRPC giving error Expected
