Would it be possible to add a feature were I could addremovechange node on graph and then export new modified graph Say with ONNX protocol PyTorch models can be saved in TorchScript format as well Details about TorchScript models Can we add the support for TorchScript models The serialization details can be found here So far the major problem is that in the zip file no graph is saved instead script is saved You may want to call some utility function to generate the IR to get the graph Is there roadmap for supporting operators of loop type For example ONNX Loop Caffe ONNXWhile I failed to load MB meta file generated from charrnn model with python and tensorflow It is loading forever I am wondering what is wrong with these files Show D and D tensors as graph or color plot Investigate adding canvas limits and using browser scrollbars
