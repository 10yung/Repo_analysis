Describe the bug when I filter my records and need first it gave me and the count is more than and in my DB I only have records To Reproduce make this query Expected behavior I expected to filter my records and gave me the first Screenshots If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem Versions please complete the following information Connector MongoDB Prisma Server eg prisma CLI eg prisma darwinx nodev OS Ubuntu other dependencies prismaclient prismabinding gave me same results with the both Describe the bug Embedded fields in MongoDB are not included in the result of a Prisma query The question is What is the point in having embedded fields if it takes another query to fetch them Btw this behavior was already mentioned in but no action was taken and the issue is closed The suggested workaround by using fragment is not feasable with the Golang binding Please take care of this To Reproduce I will use the example project dockermongodb in the following description The relevant part of the data model is type Post dbname posts id ID id wasCreated DateTime createdAt wasUpdated DateTime updatedAt title String content String published Boolean defaultvalue false author User comments Comment type Comment embedded text String writtenBy User Clone and switch to master branch I assume this branch contains the latest examples for Prisma x Enter godockermongodb subfolder Deploy Prisma and MongoDB with dockercompose f dockercomposeyml up d Run prisma deploy to populate the database Init the Go module with go mod init githubcomprismaprismaexamplesgodockermongodb Build the application with go build Run the created binary by entering dockermongodb The first part of the output should look like this formatted for better readability Retrieved all published posts ID e c

community news Content xc Publishedtrue The embedded fields are clearly missing When looking into the database I can see that the embedded fields are present Expected behavior Regarding the Golang binding the embedded fields should be part of the parent struct to avoid a second query Versions Connector MongoDB only applies to MongoDB embedded types do not exist in MySQL or PostgreSQL Prisma Server tested on latest docker container prisma CLI prisma linuxx nodev OS Ubuntu Describe the bug The generated prismago file is missing Or and Not fields in every WhereInput struct when using

prisma generate with the latest Prisma CLI and rename prismaclientprismago to prismaclientprismasqlgo Open prismaprismayml and add the following line databaseType document Run prisma generate again

namespace overlap see error message for line I can create a complete example if it helps to debug the issue Versions Connector MongoDB should not depend on the connector Prisma Server tested on latest docker container prisma CLI prisma linuxx nodev OS Ubuntu Hi Im trying to export data from my Prisma server running on Prisma Cloud I created the app back when a default MySQL database was included before it became Heroku or bringyourown but now I dont seem to have any way to export the data without knowing the management API secret of the server And Im not sure if the was ever exposed to me so is there any way to obtain this Im logged in via the CLI as well For the record Im getting the following output from prisma export client fileTypenodescursortable row field array ms Exporter Exporter errors Exporter Exporter message Your token is invalid It might have expired or you might be using a token from a different project Exporter code Exporter requestId Exporter Exporter Exporter ms Note that I hadnt deployed in several months so I am behind on the latest changes I ran prisma deploy and received the following warning Global You are migrating from the old datamodel syntax to the new one Make sure that you understand the listed changes because the semantics are different now Then perform the deployment with the force flag So if I force a deployment will my server calls still work I have not changed the code in my serverjs file recently Not loading Slack invite form doesnt work
