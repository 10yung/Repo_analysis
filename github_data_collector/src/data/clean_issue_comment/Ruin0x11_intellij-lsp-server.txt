The animated images URLs in READMEmd point to nonexistent Archiveorg has copies of the images Code completion with snippet parameters Symbol usage highlighting Find usages Go to definition Go to implementation Diagnostics Kotlin support After following the installation steps I got this error No language server is associated with this buffer I am not sure on what end its on Ifs its on the lspintellij side or the lspserver itself Im sorry but the instructions in the readme are insufficient to me I dont even know what gradle is nor where should I run the command gradlew clean buildPlugin I also cannot find the exact version of Intellij here This project requires IntelliJ IDEA but I can only find Do you have any idea where I can find it Thanks Hello Im interested in adding a feature to show javadoc Is this a good idea Should I start with a simpler feature to get my feet wet is this already being worked on etc Any tips for getting started with development Other than Contirbuting What are the critical intellijlsp functions to consider Hi there Thanks for this very promising project I love anything that gets me out of an IDE and back into Emacs Your critique of eclim is spot on it is both slow and finicky about project setup The biggest differentiator to me at least is the ability to fix issues automatically In eclim it is clunky and takes a crazy amount of time to apply the change but its still faster than checking the flycheck error and manually applying a fix I would be happy to take a shot at implementing the functionality but all of this lsp stuff is so new to me Im not sure how to begin Any pointers Thanks again When I open a Java file in emacs which causes the client to connect to the IDE the IDE is closed immediately so Im not able to use the debugger The autocompletion in Emacs works well so the IDE is still alive but the Window is gone I can see the process in details view but it doesnt appear on the Apps in Processes view I was trying to implement the rename command with a decent amount of success until I found that you had a branch rename for it with some advancements on it Is that branch going somewhere or should I just submit a PR with my implementation Hi I was about to give it a try and see if I could make it work on phpstorm However when just cloning te project and running gradlew buildPlugin I receive the following error Caused by javalangArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at orgjetbrainsorgobjectwebasmClassReaderreadUnsignedShortClassReaderjava I havent used gradle before I think the project frame should not be hidden away from the user as a default Some users might think its a bug I did until I found the toggleProjectFrame function This seems like an easy fix if it were to be done I can definitely submit a PR about this if needed A killer feature of Intellij is the ability for you see the implementation by bytecode decoding following included sources or even downloading sources Have you put any thought on implementing this
