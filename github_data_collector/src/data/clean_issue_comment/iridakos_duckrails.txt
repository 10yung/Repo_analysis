The request header the client sends looks like it Authorization abc Then at body content section at DuckRails I tried to read that value this way var header headers Authorization split But when I test the response I get a Ok but with this error DuckrailsError TypeError Cannot read property split of undefined Am I reading the headers in a wrong way docker run nameexampleiridakosduckrailsreleasev

containing long headers Which takes very long to copy past to a new one It would be great to have a button in a mock allowing to dupplicate a mock A modal would show asking which name we want to save the mock as Thanks DuckRails Running on Docker I was just playing around and wanted to dynamically change responses headers When I tried returning a JSON object with a headers key I get a Were sorry but something went wrong To validate that I was writing the JS correctly I just grabbed your example code for the response body added the headers key and returned it Here is the code var date new Date datesetDatedategetDate MathfloorMathrandom var obj headers currentpage MathfloorMathrandom startedreading datetoDateString return JSONstringifyobj Expected Headers would now have a currentpage and startedreading key in my curl Actual Return code HTML with div classdialog div h Were sorry but something went wrongh div pIf you are the application owner check the logs for more informationp div Is possible run request http with javascript into responseBody the of mock I need to import other lib for decrypt content responseBody dummyjson is a useful template engine that lets you create dummy json data very easily Hi guys Im wondering if there is any way to log body of incomming requests Thank you in advance
