There is no setWindowIcon method available from Net The lack of documentation is surprising Im new to all of this so It confuses me alot how to even beginn a project Could someone have a look and verify which modules need to be installed for a minimal QmlNet to work And add this to a wiki Additional Questions Does Visual Studio need all these C dependencies if QT have them Is there a way to

desired details Hello First of all thanks pauldotknopf and all contributors to make the dream to have a C crossplatform UI library come true This fits perfectly my needs But theres a lack of documentation and I can understand because the project is pretty new I could contribute on writing it oh god if only I could I have not a lot experimentation with C nor with Qt although for the last one I have a bit but still its from school memories and I truly need to know the uses cases and more in depth the usage best practices and bad practices etc The quick start is good to setup the library The first tutorial thanks Jodeldiplom is basically the same as the quick start and the second is quite good but not enough because there are no signals The PhotoFrame example is well detailed but as a beginner in this language I cant get to understand whats underneath the surface and how it works And I think to make good things you must be able to understand every part of the program There cant be magic working stuff and for that I would really like to dig It has been days than Im looking at the source codes opening them trying to make changes to understand But wow I feel terribly bad because I cant get anything to work when I want to add a feature For example ive been trying to add signals to the Contacts tutorial from Jodeldiplom to make the Contact list dynamic No success I dont know if its because I have signals on other types than string or int that are showed in the examples I dont have excuses I should be able to make it work since its not that hard I understand the Quick Overview but I would like to know more about the library Thank you ListView in QML needs a ListModel to populate data Also you need to define a delegate to define how data inside a model should be displayed in the view Link After working more than years with Qt Ive found this as one of the best features of QtQml Most important you can use property binding of model element in the delegates It means by changing the model data all the delegates will update themeself No extra refreshes are needed Now it seems that these property bindings are no longer working in qmlnet Its a huge drawback if there is no solution considered Ive prepared a simple example The sample is attached This is a ListView in Qml with a simple delegate The data are comming from Net model Whenever user clicks on the each row I try to change title of that row The title is changed successfully yet we cant see the change in the view the title is remained fixed though its changed in the model Therefore it seems that the Net models are making all property bindings gone unless there is a solution Im not aware of that Ill appreciate if anyone can help me Examplezip is it possible to use inside qmlnet any hint about where to start would be appreciated Please give some examples how to use Qt native i n tools such as qsTr in QML
