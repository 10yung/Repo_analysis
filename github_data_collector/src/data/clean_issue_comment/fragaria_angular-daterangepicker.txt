I have scenarios where there are multiple ranges which have the same min and max dates In such a case selecting the lower ranges shows that the topmost range with the same dates as selected instead of the one that was actually selected Can you help me with this Hi In case of custom date range options there is no way to know the label on which user clicked on even thought there is provision provided in the bootstrap daterangepicker it seems there is hook missing in the directive to access that information Using version If I change the value of clearable through an AngularJS expression from true to false the Clear button label does not change to Cancel as it should Is there any option for the Hijri calendar If not chance in the future Addresses and The only possibly controversial thing is that Ive namespaced the package into fragaria organization on NPM Also Travis is enabled and should publish automatically to NPM on every pushed tag Hi Im trying to add your date picker which is great to my project in the filters section My problem is that the filter box is a small popup box on the right To make your date picker work I had to make the filters wider whats not the best solution as we dont need as much space Instead it will be better to be able to position the calendar with the css or class Please have a look at the positioning here Ive noticed that the position is calculated in JS what makes it much more difficult to adjust img width altscreenshot at src Many thanks for your work Hi When setting predate values with min max it gives error angularjs TypeError astartDateisValid is not a function at fvalidatorsinvalid angulardaterangepickerjs vmdateRange startDate momenttoDate endDate momenttoDate vmminDate momentsubtract dtoDate vmmaxDate momentadd dtoDate Here is the screenshot of console debug test Bower jquery angular moment bootstrapdaterangepicker angulardaterangepicker Some application does not use the moment into global scope so implementing a way to specify a custom moment declaration in order to have the component working properly
