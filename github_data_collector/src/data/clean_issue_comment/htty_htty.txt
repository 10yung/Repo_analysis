is it possible to set a default configuration for example set a header etc HTTYTempfilePreservingExtname handles this incorrectly under Ruby v x I set an Authorization header with headerss perform the request which works fine but when I cd to another path I need to set the header again which doesnt feel right htty v It would be useful to have a command that is capable of taking the current request uri to the previous one Like how the back button works in a browser Please implement support for HTTP and SOCKS proxies htty should pick up the HTTPPROXY environment variable by default and the user should be able to specify override this setting via the command line eg proxy or noproxy When the prompt line has more characters than the terminal has columns the cursor gets displayed overwriting the previous line When my terminal is wide enough heres what it might look like if I hit enter three times Cursor is at end of the last line and the rest of the line is empty However when my terminal is not wide enough bookcomv idhttp A F Fmoviepilotcom Fposts F scrapetrue bookcomv idhttp A F Fmoviepilotcom Fposts F scrapetrue bookcomv idhttp A F Fmoviepilotcom Fposts F scrapetrue bookcomv idhttp A F Fmoviepilotcom Fposts F Cursor is below the first letter b of the last line and the rest of the line is munged content from the line above Currently bodyset uses Readline directly to take it s input from the standard input since we support multiple input devices we should also take care of multiline input directly into the InputDevice instance Every command should have something like needsmultilineinput and every instance of InputDevice should act accordingly Would be cool to have a command that takes the request s body straight from a file Would be even cooler if we could auto complete the file name with the file on the file system To do that we should extend the current autocompletion and make it relative to the commands every command could expose a completepartial method Otherwise we could extend bodyedit to take a file parameter Or both smile
