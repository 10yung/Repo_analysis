The message should give more information about what is working and what not I found this useful for my own local evaluation of Spline I figured it might be helpful to add to the repository Spline is not initialized properly Using Python version default Aug SparkSession available as spark from pyspark import SparkContext from pysparksql import SQLContext from pysparksql import SparkSession import pandas as pd SC SparkContext SCsetSystemPropertysplinemodeREQUIRED SCsetSystemPropertysplineproducerurl SCjvmzacoabsasplineharvesterSparkLineageInitializerenableLineageTrackingsparkjsparkSession Traceback most recent call last File stdin line in module File C SPARK spark binhadoop python lib py j srczip py j javagatewaypy line in call File C SPARK spark binhadoop python pyspark sql utilspy line in deco return fa kw File C SPARK spark binhadoop python lib py j srczip py j protocolpy line in getreturnvalue py jprotocolPy JJavaError An error occurred while calling zzacoabsasplineharvesterSparkLineageInitializerenableLineageTracking zacoabsasplineharvesterexceptionSplineNotInitializedException Spline is not initialized properly at zacoabsasplineharvesterdispatcherHttpLineageDispatcherensureProducerReadyHttpLineageDispatcherscala at zacoabsasplineharvesterSparkLineageInitializerSparkSessionWrapperenableLineageTrackingSparkLineageInitializerscala at zacoabsasplineharvesterSparkLineageInitializerenableLineageTrackingSparkLineageInitializerscala at zacoabsasplineharvesterSparkLineageInitializerenableLineageTrackingSparkLineageInitializerscala at sunreflectNativeMethodAccessorImplinvoke Native Method at sunreflectNativeMethodAccessorImplinvokeUnknown Source at sunreflectDelegatingMethodAccessorImplinvokeUnknown Source at javalangreflectMethodinvokeUnknown Source at py jreflectionMethodInvokerinvokeMethodInvokerjava at py jreflectionReflectionEngineinvokeReflectionEnginejava at py jGatewayinvokeGatewayjava at py jcommandsAbstractCommandinvokeMethodAbstractCommandjava at py jcommandsCallCommandexecuteCallCommandjava at py jGatewayConnectionrunGatewayConnectionjava at javalangThreadrunUnknown Source Does containerbased spline work correctly I try to run them according to the documentation however the splinewebclient component has a problem connecting to consumer with URL ArangoDB driver converts the returned data type to Scala right now but everything deeper in the structure stays in java types Convert the whole structure to Scala before handing it to the higher layers A good deal of Splines commons module could be moved to a newly created ABSA OSS Commons project Is spline support atlas integration Where can I find a guidthanks Background Optional One aspect of clarity auditing lineage is understanding who ran the query or transformation Many compliance regimes require knowing who access what and when Further which spline does is to capture the how of the transformation or query Question Does Spline capture any form of user identity is it feasible to capture the identity and to do so as transparently as possible eg in flight recorder mode on a multitenant cluster Hadoop or Databricks Thank you Opposite and complimentary to the Backward Data Lineage Traces how the data is used errors are propagated down the pipeline Background Optional Spline Performed a Spline testing on current process however when clicked on Detailed lineage graph gear button nothing showed up Question We just try to figure out if the issue comes within our code or Spline There are some exceptions yes several similar exception but pretty much the same cause while running our Spark code ERROR CodeGenerator failed to compile orgcodehauscommonscompilerCompileException File generatedjava Line Column Redefinition of parameter aggexpr orgcodehauscommonscompilerCompileException File generatedjava Line Column Redefinition of parameter aggexpr These errors should be pretty benign as our final results generated correctly but not sure how it impacts Splines result We have some code on rdd but it is for the dataframe so I dont think they are RDD api and should pick up by Spline val tableDf sparksqlblah val releaseDate tableDfwheretableDfitem releaseDateselectvaluerddmapgetString toLocalIteratortoListhead Where to find Spline log to track any exception or error from Spline Thanks in advance for any advice
