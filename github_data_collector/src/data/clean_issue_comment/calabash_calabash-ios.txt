I am trying to dismiss a springboard alert on the client using deviceagentdismissspringboardalertContinue When I checked with deviceagentspringboardalertvisible It returned false even when the alert was present on the screen This always worked and is working with all other versions except for ios Currently I am trying to input a password in a textfield placed on a springboard alert But command keyboardentertext throws with Keyboard is not visible however keyboard is present on screen Auto dismiss springboard alerts is disabled I looked into the code and it seems that query for keyboard into dockedkeyboardvisible function fails to get the right value The setup used for testing is iPhone iOS Xcode Ruby with rbenv calabashcucumber runloop macOS calabashios keyboardentertextpassword DEBUG

Keyboard is not visible calabashios My Xamarin Forms application interacts with some hardware and needs permission to use Bluetooth andor USB to function at all so we end up triggering a permissions dialog at startup It caused me to bump into this issue but I think this is an inelegant solution If there are things that can go wrong if the application does them before Calabash finishes loading I feel like loading Calabash should either block until it finishes or provide some mechanism to notify me it is finished For example I wouldnt mind inserting a loading page to my application and have Calabash is complete part of the criteria for that pages dismissal That would allow me to notify the things that communicate with hardware its OK for them to progress A delay works but is inelegant I have to guess how long and environmental changes could make this problem rear its head again Xcode calabashcucumber runloop iOS Simulator iPad Air rd generation When I execute method entertextsome

NSException Abort trap Overview Main wiki page The links say to refer to the Xamarin Documentation for Calabash which is no longer visible but instead redirects to an article about Test Cloud to App Center Migration It also contains a link to the Xamarin Forums which is itself inaccessible Hello everybody I have just tried to run our tests on the newest simulators iPhone XR and iPhone XS Max and it was launched and seemed to work but experienced the issue with device resolution it started to run but when it went to tapping on some element it used wrong location for it and tapped on near one Let me explain why I think that the issue is related to this I compared iPhone X where resolution is equal to x pixels and XR x pixels so I was able to use query index for getting the first child element from the whole view and received the same size for some element in pixels It hasnt to be like that because of different screen sizes resolutions To prove that I compared iPhone SE with iPhone where resolutions are not the same and query returned to me different sizes of the chosen element Please let me know if somebody knows any solution Thanks in advance By the way I used calabashcucumber
