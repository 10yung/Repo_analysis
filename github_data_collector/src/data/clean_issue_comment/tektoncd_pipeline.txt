Notes Fixes Filter multiple git secrets when using GitHub Apps Expected Behavior When using GitHub Apps we have multiple tokens and therefore k s secrets one for each GitHub Organisation the App is installed into When triggering a pipeline we want to mount the correct token that matches the GitHub org with the git owner of the pipeline request Actual Behavior Multiple secrets are matched when the credsinit container spec is created so we can have the wrong token mounted for that pipeline Steps to Reproduce the Problem Have multiple git secrets in a namespace with different tokens used for different GitHub Orgs Additional Info PR that shows an approach that is working well for us on its way it might be easier to explain a proposed solution using that Expected Behavior When processing the output of a pullrequest resource if the number is empty create a new one and add comments etc to it Additional Info githubcomjenkinsxgoscm doesnt seem to have support for creating PRs to move this forward that would need to be added first Changes Fixes Issue by adding the ability to disable certificate validation in the client interacting with the git server performing actions related to the use of the pipeline resource of type pullrequest To disable user specifies sslVerify parameter in their resource with value set to false Value is true by default Submitter Checklist These are the
