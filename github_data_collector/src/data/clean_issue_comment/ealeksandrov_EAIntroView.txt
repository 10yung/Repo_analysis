Please support Swift Package Manager There is a guide on how to release modular projects which also includes making it work with SPM How should I scroll the desc view if I have large text scrollingEnabled is not working for me The parallax feature of your EAIntroView I believe is not documented Also when you say parallax in EAIntroView its the iOS s parallax and not the scrolling parallax Are we going to have this in the future Thanks G How can I change the height of skip button I placed page control to vertical center is it possible to show Intro With Custom View From storyboard instead of Nibxib file about EAIntroPage you have three attribute property nonatomiccopy VoidBlock onPageDidLoad property nonatomiccopy VoidBlock onPageDidAppear property nonatomiccopy VoidBlock onPageDidDisappear But it has limitations I hope you can provide some other attributes such as property nonatomiccopy VoidBlock onPageWillAppear property nonatomiccopy VoidBlock onPageWillDisappear like UIview life cycle Being able to add some other attribute like UIView life cycle would be appreciated Thanks for the consideration It would be great to be able to customize the skip actions Some apps need to perform some operations when the intro is skipped Plus the alpha fade when intro is skipped assumes I guess that the intro controller is presented on top of the app This is not necessarily the case In my situation it just adds a fade to black animation before dismissing the intro view which looks a bit strange Being able to customize the skip action block delegate or simply being able to override the skipIntroduction method and declare it in the h would be appreciated Thanks for the consideration
