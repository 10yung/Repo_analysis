I have an older vs project that Im trying to get up to or and running into all sorts of problems in the migration process I found this tool and was hopeful but both the and versions are giving me the same message that the project is unsupported WRN Unsupported project XXXXX type BB D F D D BC ED F B INF No projects have been found to match your criteria It is an older NET Core ASPNET project Is there a particular reason it is not supported Can you think of any other options VS itself fails to migrate it because dotnetmigrate is no longer around Kind of at a loss right now We have a nuspec file that contains this dependencies dependency iddotnet dependency idvfpoledb version dependency idvcredist dependencies The lack of version attributes seems to be causing a null ref exception

attribute is required this nuspec is used to create a chocolatey package and I guess chocolatey isnt so strict I get it if you dont care to support a nonstandard file format However it would be nice if the tool gave a better message as to the problem The generated project reference dll files and its supposed to reference the nuget package so instead of any dll file which is defined in HintPath ItemGroup Reference IncludeAutofac Version Cultureneutral PublicKeyToken af b da processorArchitectureMSIL HintPath packages Autofac lib net AutofacdllHintPath PrivateTruePrivate Reference Reference IncludeSystemDataDataSetExtensions Reference IncludeMicrosoftCSharp Reference IncludeSystemNetHttp ItemGroup ItemGroup ProjectReference Include AutofacExtrasPlugins AutofacExtrasPluginscsproj ItemGroup It should be ItemGroup PackageReference IncludeAutofac Version PackageReference IncludeAutofacExtrasPlugins Version ItemGroup These packages are defined in the file Packagesconfig Also these Assemblies are reference by default in the project so no need to reference it System SystemCore SystemData SystemDrawing SystemIoCompressionFileSystem SystemNumerics SystemRunTimeSerialization SystemXml SystemXmlLinq First of all THANK YOU for this useful tool Great job In my old csproj file I have all cs files to compile specified When I migrate csproj to new format all cs files disappear and new implicit logic to include cs files to project is used Is it possible to leave all cs files in csproj for new format as well Couldnt find any related issue to this one Thanks Hi there i just tried to create my own tool based on Project To Migrate Library as the readme describes Sadly dotnet add package Project To Migrate Library fails because that package does not exist on nugetorg Did i miss something or is it just not available there If its not available there could you publish it there And thanks for this great toollibrary When upgrading or cleaning up csproj files that have inline PrivateAssets attributes on PackageReference items the attributes are incorrectly removed Example PackageReference IncludeMicrosoftCodeAnalysisFxCopAnalyzers Version PrivateAssetsAll becomes PackageReference IncludeMicrosoftCodeAnalysisFxCopAnalyzers Version I am not sure if this occurs with any other inline attributes but all attributes should be preserved on upgrade Thank you for the tool it makes a great job Could you migrate the PreBuildEvent and PostBuildEvent too Because without changes no macros like eg ProjectDir are replaced anymore But if you would convert them into tasks then they are replaced again eg Old PropertyGroup PreBuildEventProjectDirPreBuildEventbat ProjectDir ProjectDir TargetDir PropertyGroup New Target NamePreBuild BeforeTargetsPreBuildEvent Exec Command quotProjectDirPreBuildEventbat quot quotProjectDir quot quotProjectDir quot quotTargetDir quot quotDevEnvDir quot Target Details can be found Thank you and best regards Helmut Version used How to
