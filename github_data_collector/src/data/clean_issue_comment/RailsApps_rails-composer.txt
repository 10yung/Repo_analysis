Upon completion of the steps in composing a starter app today as Ive done many times I discovered that it did not update any of the files and basically just created a new rails app without any of the composer juice that normally happens when using this excellent app I have not had this trouble in the past and just started today So what has changed you ask Nothing that I can think ofI did update to Mac OS Catalina but have composed apps with the same process between then and now without issue so I feel like its not that I did recently update Xcode through app store so that is a potential cause But I have agreed to the new terms etc etc I also allowed full disk access to terminal and Xcode in the privacy settings list in the system preferences I am using RVM and have updated it Any help to point me in the right direction would be greatly appreciated Would love to get back into my workflow as soon as possible Here is some output of the first bit of the composition rails new m exist

found rg foobar gitignore line error parsing glob war invalid use of must be one path component gitignore line error parsing glob orig invalid use of must be one path component gitignore line error parsing glob swp invalid use of must be one path component From the gitignore manpage Two consecutive asterisks in patterns matched against full pathname may have special meaning A leading followed by a slash means match in all directories For example foo matches file or directory foo anywhere the same as pattern foo foobar matches file or directory bar anywhere that is directly under directory foo A trailing matches everything inside For example abc matches all files inside directory abc relative to the location of the gitignore file with infinite depth A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or more directories For example ab matches ab axb axyb and so on Other consecutive asterisks are considered invalid So I think these entries in gitignore should be changed to diff git diff gitignore diff git agitignore bgitignore index b c dbdb f c agitignore bgitignore dbsqlite tmp various artifacts war war rbc sassc rspec pickleemailhtml Here are some files
