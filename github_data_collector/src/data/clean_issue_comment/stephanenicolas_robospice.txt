How can I use xmlrpc request I have my own object which handle everything very well and returns data response I want to keep using my object to do network related task and finally willing to save to realm All work should be done by my object but I still want to use robospice to handle all background thread Is it robospice suitable for my case please help Im totally screwed with asynctask Im using account manager to fetch data for different user account and finally Im saving it to realm as default account The problem occurred whe I switched account in case asynctask running and it never stoppes which leads wrong data on wrong account Ive got this new error for users using android androidappRemoteServiceException Bad notification for startForeground javalangRuntimeException invalid channel for service notification Notificationchannelnull I can reproduce the error on emulator using API level Ive found this topic The error is not systematic and depend on the robospice service if the service is completed when onDestroy is called no crash if the service is still running crash Im not that the crash is due to Robospice but I do not use notification manager in my code and it always crash when leaving the app with service un background Here is the full error in logcat EUncaughtException androidappRemoteServiceException Bad notification for startForeground javalangRuntimeException

RoboSpice interact within the new MVVM Architecture Components introduced at Google IO Considering wed have a data layer consisting of repositories which fetch data from a web API and store that data inside an ORM all of this without taking lifecycle into account and the view layer not knowing anything about the data layer thus not being able to startstop the SpiceManager inside Activities and Fragments Ive tried to search the issues for relevant threads and the best I could find was this one from years ago Architecture Components reference Here is the error message comandroidbuildapitransformTransformException javautilzipZipException duplicate entry orgapachecommonsioCopyUtilsclass If I try to include it in the following way It gives some bugssome request doesnt gives the response compile comoctoandroidrobospicerobospicespringandroid exclude group orgapachecommons module commonsio compile commonsiocommonsio Hello I am looking for a way to download a file from server I see two options one of them is to use BinaryRequest but it works only if you pass the total path of the file for example and I need to send parameters to the server in this way apiSomeServiceTranslationFileLanguageen in that request I send the parameter en and RS responds with a JavaioFileNotFoundException The other way is to make use of RetrofitSpiceRequest InputStream MyInterface here I send my parameters like any other request however the response is treated to be parsed by GSON An exception occurred during request network execution Failed to invoke public javaioInputStream with no args retrofitRetrofitError Failed to invoke public javaioInputStream with no args Have any suggestions How do the new background service limitations in the newest Android O Developer Preview affect RoboSpice Even on earlier releases when the Activity goes into background and a request hasnt finished yet a blank notification is being shown Reference BigBinaryRequest doesnt allow customizing request headers passing auth headers Tried overriding loadDataFromNetwork request to create HttpURLConnection instance and setting headers but seems like loadDataFromNetwork is a final method at BinaryRequest and hence cannot be overridden Is there any way to use BigBinaryRequest with headers I would like to get benefit of cache file too Otherwise I could make use of normal request and write received byte array Thanks This method was working fine in version But to fix one issue We upgraded robospice version to After that removeDataFromCacheClass clazzm Object cacheKey is not working Is it known issue or we are missing something in latest version Hi i am using this library in conjunction with spring using the class SpringAndroidSpiceRequest here is my load data from network Override public T loadDataFromNetwork throws Exception HttpHeaders headers new HttpHeaders headersaddAccept applicationvndgithubv json headersaddAuthorization UsergetCurrentUserAuthenticationValue ifmHttpMethod HttpMethodPUT headersaddContentLength ResponseEntityT entity getRestTemplateexchangemUrl mHttpMethod new HttpEntityheaders mResponseType mResponseHeaders entitygetHeaders return entitygetBody the problem is that for some reason mResponseHeaders is missing some headers in particular one that is called Link the header exists if i send the same request via web browser using the DHC plugin am i doing something wrong any ideas I ran into Robospice by looking at another Android project From my understanding Robospice has the ability to convert POST requests to binary before sending them over the HTTP protocol am I correct Can Robospice convert the binary data back to something human readable I would appreciate any information regarding the issue
