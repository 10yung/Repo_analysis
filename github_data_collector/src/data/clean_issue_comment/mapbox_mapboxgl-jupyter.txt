 When I create the Viz object and try to pass in a different colorfunctiontype value eg step the Viz display maintains the interpolate function even though the attribute in the Viz object has been changed Any ideas on why this is happening Not sure if this is only a problem in recent IPython versions but for me every plot is accompanied by UsersbrettvenvsmodelsrcipythonIPythoncoredisplaypy UserWarning Consider using IPythondisplayIFrame instead warningswarnConsider using IPythondisplayIFrame instead Seems safe enough Each time I open a pull request I no longer see the report from CoverageCoveralls on the test coverage Is there an update to that would fix this img width altScreen Shot src I am trying to run the example Jupyter Notebook in masterexamplesnotebooksscaleannotationipynb Ive set up my environment with conda conda install c condaforge mapboxgl The file paths Ive tested relative path mapboxgljupyter scaleannotationipynb data healthcarepointsgeojson templates circlehtml up directory path mapboxgljupyter scaleannotationipynb data healthcarepointsgeojson templates circlehtml local mapboxgljupyter scaleannotationipynb healthcarepointsgeojson circlehtml All of these give me bash miniconda envsjupyterenvlibpython sitepackagesjinja loaderspy in loadself environment name globals first we try to get the source for this template together with the filename and the uptodate function source filename uptodate selfgetsourceenvironment name try to load the code from the bytecode cache if there is a miniconda envsjupyterenvlibpython sitepackagesjinja loaderspy in getsourceself environment template p joinselfpackagepath tuplepieces if not selfproviderhasresourcep raise TemplateNotFoundtemplate filename uptodate None TemplateNotFound circlehtml Hi Itd be great if we could edit the title of legend Currently the name of the colorproperty is being rendered as the title for the colour legend A new feature to edit the legend title name would be helpful if the name on colorproperty doesnt make sense Thanks Adds support for identity and step expression types for colorfunctiontype radiusfunctiontype or heightfunctiontype Closes and If you pass a GeoJSON dict with single apostrophees in it the notebook fails to render the map eg properties address foo bar
