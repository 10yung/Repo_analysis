HTTP servers are capricious or sometimes give wildly different results depending on the parameters AcceptLanguage HTTP redirectionHeaders change based on different UA strings etc That might be an idea for a feature Build a static binary for httpdiff then create the smallest possible docker image to hold it This uses an intermediate builder container to compile the binary as an unprivileged user then creates a runtime image to hold the binary Add config to build and test the image on CircleCI
