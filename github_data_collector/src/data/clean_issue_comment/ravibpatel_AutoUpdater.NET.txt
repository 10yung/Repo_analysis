Here is my first attempt at setting up a new Net Core WPF Class Library Project and a Net Core WPF test application related to issue Please give it a try and see if it works as you want it to Here are some details AutoUpdaterNETCoreWPF this projects implements the AutoUpdaterNETStandard just as the AutoUpdaterNETWPF project did Added MicrosoftWindowsCompatibility as a Nuget dependency Added MicrosoftToolkitWpfUIControlsWebView as a Nuget dependency AutoUpdaterTestNETCoreWPF This is the test project similar to AutoUpdaterTestWPF that will use the AutoUpdaterNETCoreWPF to update Use selfcreated window for downloading and installing progress Hi It would be possible to set the operation timeout now timeout its the default timeout of FtpWebRequest min Thanks Hi guys our team would like to customize a little UI Left top corner icon Left icon near progress Font for speed and downloaded MBs labels Background of form Background of progress bar Maybe I will do this in separate branch just wanted to know that my request will be reviewed relatively soon Many thanks This might be a feature request depending on if its intended or not I would like to set some of the installer arguments in code One example would be querying the registry to check if the program is installed in a peruser context and appending MSIINSTALLPERUSER to installer args Ive tried doing this by creating a callback AutoUpdaterOnCheckForUpdateEventargs and adding what I want with argsInstallerArgs foo but whatever I add seems to be ignored Is this intended as AutoUpdaterNET only reads args from the retrieved XML file or am I doing this wrong delete files by XML list xml version encodingUTF item version version url changelog mandatoryfalsemandatory delete itemafileitem itembfileitem delete item Title pretty much explains the problem The only thing I do is run AutoUpdaterReportErrors true AutoUpdaterStart I confirmed that the endpoint is reachable ssl certificates are fine by opening the link Still the software thinks that it cannot reach this destination By saying There is a problem reaching update server Please check your internet connection and try again later I check the code but couldnt find a clear reason why this message is shown The xml contains xml version encodingUTF item version version url changelog mandatoryfalsemandatory item If the updater is located in C abc abc when the updater extracts the contents it extracts to the location C abc abc However if I want the contents to be extracted to C abc how do I do that Thank you
