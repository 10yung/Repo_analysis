 APP app API API Please check what is issue why cannot play this audio file This is the file Since Apple is formally deprecating AudioGraph url in favor of AVAudioEngine going forward are there any plans to migrate this great project towards Swift and the newer AVAudioEngine Framework Perhaps there is already something else that can replace it It appears that StreamingKit doesnt work when you attempt to launch audio from an app in the background on iOS tested with Beta the latest at the time of posting It returns an STKAudioPlayerErrorAudioSystemError when you attempt to play the audio Whats more if the app has attempted to launch some audio in the background and is then brought to the foreground the same error can be found when trying to attempt to play audio in the foreground so possibly something thats failing on initialisation the first time the library gets used If you open the app and try play something in the foreground only then it works fine its only an error if the app is launched in the background and attempts to play some audio eg launched using SiriKit in our case This doesnt appear to be an issue on iOS Addittionally on iOS standard AudioPlayers do successfully launch in the background so its not a iOS beta issue effecting all audio playing its definitely related to StreamingKit specific to iOS If the video URL is given to the streamingkit does the player supports playing the audio of the video file Is there a way to play the next song My scene is like this I use P P to transfer the aac data stream directly to accData how to deal with it to play better I will cache the data first then reach a certain value after there is local then use setDataSource and Both queueURL and playURL will be played repeatedly cant stop pause or empty the thread are still there Is there a good solution suppose im setting up custom time for song is minutes but song is only or minutes than after completing that time that song repeat itself if appDelegateaudioPlayerduration appDelegateaudioPlayerprogress appDelegateplaySongstrUrlarrSongobjectat indexas AnyObjectvalueforKey audioFile as String After or min when song completed above function called but that gave me Datasource error
