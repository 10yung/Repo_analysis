EventEmitter has no Observers But when I try putting the html to upload the files in the app component its working Can anyone tell me what to do If I want to do it from the appselectfiles component Thanks in Advance Adding the ability to handle failed uploads This is done by adding the load event on the XMLHttpRequrest and looking for a status Instead of bubbling an error I went with the approach of setting the file UploadStatus to Failed new enum value and pushing it in the observable state with a type of failed I felt this would be the least disruptive and most simple to implement I put thisoptions concurrency maxUploads I Browse more than maxUploads it allow only files and rest put into rejected list I Drag more than maxUploads it allow only files and rest put into rejected list But when I browse some files and drag some file then maxUploads fails This happens when we drop email from outlook to chrome The default drop effect in chrome is taking it as MOVE instead of Copy We can fix this by taking the dragover event and changing drop effect Something like this Angular component HostListenerdocumentdragover event dragOverev DragEvent void if ev evdataTransfer evdataTransferdropEffect copy evdataTransferdropEffect copy can we include this feature inbuild to ourlibrary resolve Why cant I use ngxuploader after I upload the file and the server reports an error I hope that after the server reports an error I click the upload button and still upload what should I do Description Currently allowedContentTypes for input options only seems to accept very specific MIME types The expected results would be that the allowedContentTypes array would match how a DOM input acceptallowedContentTypes performs Specific Issues Noticed mismatch on blanket MIME types image audio specific extensions dae dxf Reproduction Using the demo ts and html files append options to include allowedContentTypes image dae This results in the input rejecting all image files and dae extension files Append input acceptimage dae and image files and dae extensions are no longer rejected but are the only files allowed to be selected for upload i has been added as shorthand for install and save is defaulted to true in latest npm cli The replacement LoC in the readme is equivalent shorthand that may help save folks time for this and other installs ERROR in
