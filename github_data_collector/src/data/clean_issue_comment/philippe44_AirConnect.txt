I have following every step but stuck on execution after I called aircastosxmulti l on terminal this is how far it goes aircastosxmulti l main Starting aircast version v Dec br main no config file using defaults Start Binding to any tips Thanks so much for creating this philippe I know that the latency is not supposed to allow for synchronized audio and video Sometimes you might get lucky because the videotoaudio delay will almost match the HTTP player delay but it is not reproducible and will not be stable over time However Ive discovered something quite interesting If I use these parameters I can get the audiovideo to sync perfectly on a Mac for many many videos It is extremely reproducible In rare cases where it doesnt sync if I just refresh my browser tab its back in sync xml latency latency drift drift Based on some initial testing the only requirement is that play it from a Mac computer Im extremely curious if the key to this whole thing is the audio encoding and perhaps there is a delay being caused when the encoding is not in a preferred format If that is true the latency could also potentially be calibrated by timing the conversion from different formats into a preferred format I did some initial testing with FFMPEG but I didnt have any initial luck getting a video that was offsync to insync by varying the acodec parameter Also note that this doesnt work at all from iPhones but the audio encoding could be changing there as well Im sharing these details would be great to know if others can reproduce these results or have other insights Insync Offsync FYI This does not work if I stream using an iPhone on the same videos Set up AirConnect running on Raspberry Pi Google Wifi mesh network Sonos PLAY latest firmware as of Dec Mac havent tested other OS Note Sync is not impacted regardless of browser or player format even downloading the video then playing in QuickTime works fine Hi all Just made the leap to bit only world of Mac OSX downloaded the latest binary of airupnp v Nov and from the previous version under Mac OSX I am not not getting any response from my Sonos speakers It appears the binary has bound to the correct only IP address in this case but not response from the paging Ive confirmed via Network Utility that port is open Any thoughts I saw a thread that something similar happened for some users on earlier versions of Mac OS X any generic fixes known by the community Thanks G Hi Phillipe Thanks for your hard work and am looking forward to get it to work to get my sonos speakers to work better for me For some reason AirConnect seems to connect to my speakers but not make any sound I am using a Raspbarry Pi Model B as a platform Please see below log piraspberrypiDesktopAirConnect airupnparm I main

bumped into this I read it booted the pi and brought your code to run I read all your advices and I m still a bit confused with the volume thing There is a group of sonos play speaker Both play music over airplay from my iPhone at different volumes Your advice to lower the volume to zero to synchronize the volume does not work On speaker is ignoring the new volume and plays always on the same volume I deleted the group and and created again without any solution Wenn I adjust the volume you can see in the sonos app that only one speaker really changes the volume Any further advice Regards Joe Would it be possible to get AirPlay with AirConnect I Saw on to Mac that AirPlay was just cracked and immediately thought of AirConnect This would be so cool if this was added to AirConnect Im trying to debug an installation running airupnp ARM version on a Raspberry Pi where all the Sonos devices are being correctly discovered and the RAOP advertisements are being correctly sent but the AirPlay targets are not appearing on Apple devices on the same network Other native AirPlay devices are appearing on the Apple devices and the airupnp ones did also appear temporarily on one occasion The Apple devices are connected on WiFi Im awaiting the results of a test with a wired device The obvious hypothesis is that this isnt an AirConnect issue but that something in the network infrastructure is impeding the RAOP advertisements So Im looking for any suggestions folks might have about what to investigate what troubleshooting steps I should try etc This is a remote installation so I have access to the Raspberry Pi but not to anything else on the network Thanks for any suggestions Just reporting this for completeness Im observing a minor issue where there is a short ms burst of audio emitted from the Sonos player shortly after an AirPlay stream has been paused Ie the speaker stops playing for a moment then theres a short burst of sound It appears only to occur when a track is paused before it reaches the end If the track runs to the end the audio burst doesnt occur This behaviour seems repeatable Im streaming with the FLAC codec and I have latency set to f Hi Philippe Occasionally Im seeing a significant delay s before airupnp Sonos speakers appear in Apple AirPlay menus Seems only to affect iOS devices not macOS Its all or nothing either I see all of the airupnp speakers or none It doesnt happen with native Apple Airplay devices AirPort Express Apple TV Sonos speakers with AirPlay Sometimes the iOS device needs to have its WiFi toggled to fix the issue Bringing up the AirPlay menu on a different iOS device seems to kick the device experiencing the delay into showing the Sonos speakers Observed on multiple iOS devices Observed in multiple households with different network equipment Im running the latest version of airupnparm on a Raspberry Pi under Raspbian This is a relatively minor usability wrinkle but it would be nice to resolve it Any idea what might be going on Im happy to help with debugging etc or code changes if I can get a hint of what needs to be changed Thanks Peter Hi Thank you very much for this awesome project Can you take in consideration adding a convolver to this Like shairportsync is doing as an example Thank you
