 PINDiskCachem ERROR B BCCB D B EF FC ABD E E C FCFC couldn t be removed because you don t have permission to access it I keep seeing those I notice PINMemoryCache had some usage for trim to age limit recursively Every time ordering the createdDates for trim to age is so expensive and we dont use the sort of container any more for other scene So instead of sort the container we could delete the expired objects with a for loop directly Time Complexity n n expired count n Key difference is utilizing NSCache internally to allow the system to purge memory if needed Locking is not managed by PINPurgeableMemoryCache as NSCache is designed to be threadsafe TODO Decide how to handle TTL Age limit etc requirements Add tests to ensure it works similar to PINMemoryCache within reason Ideally benchmark performance of memory cache with this change If my disk size is more than default size it gets trimmed to default size on initialising PINCache Due to that my images are downloading again and again and getting stored in disk I have set the byteLimit to MB too When more and more data cache in DiskCache the startup can cost a lot of time and before that we can not get data from disk cache Im using a PINDiskCache to store roughly images when it reaches the disk cache limit specified After the cache reaches its limit it looks like nearly every call to setObjectAsyncforKeycompletion to add an item to the cache triggers one trimDiskToSizeByDate call This call sorts the metadata array so the code ends up sorting this same array repeatedly We could mitigate the costs of this sorting by either throttling the trim to once every s could be configurable or by using a data structure like a priority queue I could submit a Pull Request for configurable throttling of the trim if needed thanks Hey folks Itd be great if you could observe changes to the cache say if the object at a particular key was set youd be able to subscribe to notifications of those changes Im not sure how itd be implemented though perhaps adding an NSNotification to the setObject methods Any suggestions Im filing a bug based on our conversation starting here It appears to be a side effect from adopting the PINCaching protocol img width altpincache bug to file src Cache clearing via the ageLimit can be too slow when too many items expire all at once This can hurt appstartup performance As far as I understand it this is slow because we check file timestamps and remove files one at a time Removing directories is faster than removing files so if there were some way that the disk cache could optimize this to remove directories Random ideas Persist the oldest timestamp and do a quick check in the beginning to just wipe the full directory Downside Must wipe entire cache Add layers of inner directories grouped by some time interval Then we can wipe huge chunks of the cache efficiently The semantics of how this could work exactly need more looking into Downside Invalidates caches for existing users and is complex
