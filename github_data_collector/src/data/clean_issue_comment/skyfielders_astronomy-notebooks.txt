This makes a separate issue out of what was mentioned elsewhere I am not able to rebuild the inline image output for both Interactive DEarthSatellitesipynb and Interactive DSolarSystemipynb For those two notebooks all the inline images turn out as black rectangles I do not have this problem with the other notebooks suggesting some interaction with mayavivtk stuff I am using Xubuntu i in a virtual machine The following web pages illustrate the issue The notebooks themselves are in the jepblackinlineimagesissue branch
