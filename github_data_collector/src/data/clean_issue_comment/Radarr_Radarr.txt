Ubuntu Server LTS It is running behind an openvpn tun and I have a pretty strict firewall setup However I have been using Sonarr for a while with no problem and I just setup Radarr tonight All

a movie to a better version couldnt import movie destination already exists Looks like Radarr wont remove the old file and replace it with the new one Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I would like to download the original language version of a movie in all cases unless when it is not available when I would like to download the language I speak The issue at the moment is that in profiles there only seems to be ways to ban words like MULTi and FRENCHSPANISHITALIAN but no way to say except if the movie is foreign language Describe the solution youd like I would like an option to ban dubs and prefer the original language this could be done by checking the language on imdbtmdb and then preferring that language when calculating downloads In the case that nothing is found that is when we go and check the system language or the keyword DUBBED andor MULTi For native movies FRENCHSPANISHITALIAN should be banned whilst MULTI and DL are degraded in priority Ideally the tags should be configurable under a language setting Describe alternatives youve considered Any variation on tagging and filtering that could be used for example different profiles selected based on language although this would be more complex to setup and monitor Additional context I hate dubs and unfortunately I have to ban FRENCHSPANISHITALIAN tags along with dubbed Whats happening is Im getting a lot of MULTi and DL and have to strip the audio tracks shaving off gb of wastage The issue is when it comes to old movies and especially horror that might be dubbed originally ie paneuropean production or when MULTiDL is the only option Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe At the moment Radarr works on a hard hit or miss based on quality profiles and tags ie do not get movies with MULTi do get movies with FRENCH however this means that when MULTi is the only options or the movie is French it would not download the only options Instead of working in a direct hit approach it would be good to reduce the score of MULTi and FRENCH releases With custom formats this follows the same approach of direct hits and instead of saying boost this word say DTSHD and handicap this word say FRENCH it is more of a filtering option and will lead with complex overlays of profiles for each keyword instead of a globally applicable boost list that can be applied on top of the p etc profiles Describe the solution youd like I would like the ability to provide a list of words to boost the score of a download option and a list of words to handicap the score of a download option This could be a simple list of words that boost a ranking and one that handicaps that is filtered to the download list to sort it ideally displaying the overall points calculation when doing the search manually example Describe alternatives youve considered A list of preferred words if its easier although a list of handicaps would make this feature bettermore accurate Additional context I am trying to download native original language rips of movies from around the world fed in from multiple lists and I see MULTI language or DL language rips being grabbed over the undubbed versions meaning I have to go in and process the videos The issue is if i ban MULTi or DL in some cases these are the only options Similarly some ripping crews are preferred over others and there isnt an easy global way to apply to all quality profiles I also want to downrank AVC for example but if I get them dont bother downloading another profile see it as cutover Database

problem is Ex Im always frustrated when I cross seed a lot and the problem I run into is I have to rename files to cross seed but I cant do that in radarr so I have sftp into my server find the files then rename them to what I want Then I have to go to radarr and sync with the new file name Describe the solution youd like Id like to be able to rename files to whatever I want manually In the files tab of a movie theres already a setting cog to manually set the quality tags etc Id like an input there to rename the file as well Describe alternatives youve considered theres no alternatives in radarr you can set a way for all movies to be renamed to a preset format but I dont want to break seeding Generating hard links from radarr would be cool too but Id rather have file renaming capability Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here input here to rename a file and auto sync with the new file names
