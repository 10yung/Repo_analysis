At the moment API allows to get user password by username would be great to have something to work nice with autologin features like NSString getLastStoredUsername or even NSString getlastStoredUserNameAndPasswordNSString password Added support for restricting keychain item accessiblitiy see kSecAttrAccessible by adding an additional version of storeUsernameandPassword with an extra argument The old version is supported for full backward compatibility Also some minor formatting changes splitting long method names across multiple lines Also added CocoaPod spec hi i want to copy my iphone files to computer without jailbreaking my iphone i had tried iphonebrowsercode but only able to access few files some file are remaining how can i got access on those remaining filessmsdbcallhistorydb etc I exchanged import UIKitUIKith for import FoundationFoundationh With this little change you can just drop the two files into a OS X project and use them without any changes The line on if error nil status noErr Should be if error nil status noErr Because it is possible for the error to be nil but for the status to return something different In that case eg the item was not found we would want to return NO NSDictionary attributeResult NULL should be NSDictionary attributeResult nil Can someone take a look into adding support for sharing keychain access between apps As I understand it it requires the use of kSecAttrAccessGroup Thanks The biggest advantage I see in keychain use is that entires survive app deletion and reinstall But if all my database data is lost what use does the saved keychain data has I miss some sort of NSDictionary returning with all my entries Dont know if thats possible Keychain access is really bogus to me but maybe you have an idea Keep up your good work Peter
