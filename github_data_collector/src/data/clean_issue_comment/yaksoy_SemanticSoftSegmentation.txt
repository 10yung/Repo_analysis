No function or variable is defined adjacentRegionsGraph I found the image and features used in demom as follows image imreaddociapng features image sizeimage end and It can show the segmentation result but I have a question what is the relation between this project and the sister project the python realization version another question when I input the dimension features the segmentation result is similar with the above so why do you need the sister implementation we can get the soft semantic segmentation result just using this project can we many thanks Hi YAksoy I was unable o produce the same results as given in the paper on any other image and also new to MATLAB I used the SIGGRAPH SSS repo to generate the features that gave me dociamat file I later placed the mat file along with the input PNG in this repo and ran the demom where I read the dociapng file as the input and the results that I got was as follows out Which is fine but was unable to understand how to get the middle section of the PNG that is highlighted as follows op jpg jpgwith text Also I am not sure if the code was even using the dociamat file And it just used the PNG file below docia Could you help me on how to run this to get the input file from the featuresdociamat file as desired Regards Yash Hi yaksoy Thank you for your great paper I have some questions about ways to solve problems more efficiently I think your prototype implementation roughly includes processes excluding a feature extractor and their respective computational costs for a single x image follow calculation of Laplacian matrix L from affinities sec calculation of eigenvectors of L min solving a constrained sparsification problem mins solving a relaxed sparsification problem secs By the way you say in paper The efficiency of our method can be optimized in several ways such as multiscale solvers but an efficient implementation of linear solvers and eigendecomposition lies beyond the scope of our paper There seems to be ways to make the execution time shorter multiscale solver more efficient linear solvers and eigendecomposition Questions However which processes do they correspond to What is multiscale solver Can I make the most heavy process process faster when I running this code there are some errors groupSegments line cc segmentsi features SemanticSoftSegmentation line groupedSegments groupSegmentsinitSoftSegments features demo line sss SemanticSoftSegmentationimage features I dont know what the thing I mistake can you help me to solve this problem thankyou
