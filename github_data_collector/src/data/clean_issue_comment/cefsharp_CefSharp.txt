As always a big thank you to those who have contributed previously and especially those who make recurring contributions through BountySource Salt and GitHub Sponsors Again Im asking for funding to continue my work on maintainingdeveloping CefSharp As some of you may well know Im currently a stay at home dad and spend a fairly large amount of time roughly hrs per week developing and supporting the project Your contributions are the only reason Im allowed to continue working on the project Without continued funding the time I currently spend on the project will have to be put into finding other paid work There are multiple options for contributing at this time Recurring contribution through GitHub Sponsors For a limited time GitHub Sponsors will match any contribution made as detailed in About the GitHub Sponsors Matching Fund Contribute an amount towards the Bounty on this issue Bountysource A one time contribution through Paypal at If youd like to made a donation through Paypal directly or signup to GitHub Sponsors Ill happily reduce the target Release pre When of target reached Update to latest CEF build Update changelog and create release notes Create cefsharp release branch Release pre pacakges to nugetorg Release When of target reached Resolve remaining issues attached to Milestone Update changelog and create release notes Generate new API Doc and upload to Release pacakges to nugetorg If three additional people signup to GitHub Sponsors then Ill look at releasing a new more modern set of Nuget Packages which will better support Net Core x See for proposed package details If theres a particular issue youd like to see resolved and are willing to contribute financial support then Im happy to discuss the feasibility What version of the product are you using current master What architecture x or x both On what operating system Win Are you using WinForms WPF or OffScreen WinForms What steps will reproduce the problem Create a new WinForms project Change the Platform target in the projectsettings to x or x Try to build the project Error output CefSharpCommon contains unmanaged resoures set your project and solution platform to x or x Alternatively for AnyCPU Support see What is the expected output What do you see instead Project should build because i explicitly set the target to x even though the compilerprofile is still named AnyCPU Please provide any additional information below Related to What version of the product are you using I am using the following Setup CefSharpOffScreen CefSharpCommon cefredistx and cefredistx As this is a little bit of a tapping in the dark because of no Error been thrown or any indication that anything isnt working as expected I didnt change anything inside the Code so I think there is a state or a value saved anywhere which is preventing CefSharp or the underlying Chrome from successfully taking a screenshot What architecture x or x x with x as active platform for the whole Project Solution On what operating system Win Are you using WinForms WPF or OffScreen Offscreen What steps will reproduce the problem Please provide detailed information here enough for someone else to reprodce your problem Please no binary zip etc links fork the MinimalExample and push your changes to GitHub Alternatively use a code sharing service list Gist or Pastebin I am using the MinimalExample with no real changes inside the Process of taking the Screenshot What is the expected output What do you see instead Expected Result A TaskBitmap with a Bitmap as Result returned by ScreenshotAsync Actual Result A TaskBitmap with a nullValue as Result returned by ScreenshotAsync Please provide any additional information below A stack trace if available any Exception information No Error thrown Does the cef log provide any relevant information By default there should be a debuglog file in your bin directory INFOCONSOLE The connection used to load resources from used TLS or TLS which are deprecated and will be disabled in the future Once disabled users will be prevented from loading these resources The server should enable TLS or later See for more information source Any other background information thats relevant Are you doing something out of the ordinary rd party controls I am not using any third party control for the browser or screenshot part All other controls are used after the Screenshot is saved Does this problem also occur in the CEF Sample Application from I have opened my Page inside the Sample Application and it did shows up as it should But I cant take a screenshot with the sample application To compare with WPFOffScreen run cefclient multithreadedmessageloop offscreenrenderingenabled enablegpu Same as above To compare with WinForms run cefclient multithreadedmessageloop Same as above Please include the version you tested with eg cefbinary g e a windows clienttarbz Its important to you test with the same version that CefSharp is based on Check the release notes to determine the version or load chromeversion in the browser Used Version cefbinary ge a chromium windows client Fixes issuenumber Fixes Summary Implement PerMonitorV

will be removed More details to follow Related to x Move StreamResponseFilter from the example into the main project Add some additional checking After the best way to handle errors seemed to be using LoadHtmlLoadUrl the problem of this is that it creates an additional history entry that prevents the back button from properly functioning The back button takes you to the same error site that retriggers the error We could work around this by not showing the error the second time but that would still require hitting the back button twice A temporary solution is to inject JS to call the historygo if on an error page but isnt great Per amaitland suggestion created an upstream discussion thread about suggested best practice with some suggested options Is it possible get Process ID of chrome process I ask it cause i need to look ram usage of chrome subprocess and if more than X value i need to unload and reload instance I running many ChromiumWebBrowser than i cant find the right process to unload then reload I use Offscreen version i tried with GetBrowserIdentifier and GetBrowserHostGetWindowHandle but is not their purpose Thanks Example of CharSet at
