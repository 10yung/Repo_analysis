I have configured shuttle with default setting and its not opening new tab or window I have Iterm stable release and shuttle version When I set to inTerminal current it works Not sure what wrong i did comments Valid terminals include Terminalapp or iTerm In the editor value change default to nano vi or another terminal based editor Hosts will also be read from your sshconfig or etcsshconfig file if available For more information on how to configure please see editor default launchatlogin false terminal iTerm iTermversion stable defaulttheme Homebrew openin new showsshconfighosts false sshconfigignorehosts sshconfigignorekeywords hosts cmd date j name Terminal inTerminal tab Spouses Servers cmd echo WARNING Running commands Are you sure yn read sure if sure y then echo running command ps aux grep a pple else echo save to history and show history s ps aux grep a pple osascript e tell application System Events to keystroke p using control down fi inTerminal current name Logs Opens in the current active terminal window Jane s Servers cmd ssh usernameblog examplecom inTerminal tab name SSH blog Opens in Tab of active window theme basic title title of tab cmd ssh usernameshop examplecom inTerminal new name SSH Shop Opens in New Window theme basic title title of new window It seems the About window shows the wrong version Ive just downloaded version but it states the version is img width altScreen Shot at pm src Also was the latest binary really compiled all the way back in If so is there anything that we can do to help you release new binaries Looking at the logs here it seems that a LOT of work has been done since then and a lot of features have already been added but they dont show up in the current binaries eg Issues etc submenus using their name or can add this feature Added spotlight search and preview iTerm v beta just came into the public so I installed that Now Shuffle is not able to open the tab it opens the new window without the session when I try to open a SSH session Maybe you want to run one command in macOS terminal but another command in iTerm Overrides whatever is set in the global settings Is it possible to put the shortcuts in order manually It seems they are always shown in alphabetical order regardless of how they are sorted in the JSON Why not allow users to parse the content of config for shuttle I have in config like servers over the years I use And to migrate them all into shuttle would be amazing
