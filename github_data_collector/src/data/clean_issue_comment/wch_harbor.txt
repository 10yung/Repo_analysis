First of all thank you for your work on this package I am trying to run docker containers that require environmental variables In bash the command would be something like docker run env SOMEVARIABLE somevalue env SOMEVARIABLE somevalue mydockerimage However I am strugling to make this work in harbor Ive tried the versions below to no avail Is this supported Where am I going wrong harbordockerrun image mydockerimage dockeropts c SOMEVARIABLE somevalue SOMEVARIABLE somevalue capturetext TRUE harbordockerrun image mydockerimage dockeropts env SOMEVARIABLE somevalue env SOMEVARIABLE somevalue capturetext TRUE Thanks a lot in advance for your help Moving the discussion started in to here Some examples of using the Unix socket API using curl librarycurl libraryjsonlite libraryopenssl dockerauth functionusernameSysgetenvDOCKERUSERNAME passwordSysgetenvDOCKERPASSWORD emailSysgetenvDOCKEREMAIL serveraddressSysgetenvDOCKERREGISTRY encodeTRUE toJSON list usernameunboxusername passwordunboxpassword emailunboxemail authunbox serveraddressunboxserveraddress authjson if encode authjson opensslbase encodeauthjson authjson dockerhandle functionverboseFALSE h curlnewhandle h curlhandlereseth h curlhandlesetopth UNIXSOCKETPATH varrundockersock h curlhandlesetopth VERBOSE verbose h curlhandlesetheadersh ContentType applicationjson XRegistryAuth dockerauth h Auth check h dockerhandleTRUE handlesetopth copypostfields dockerauthencodeFALSE res curlfetchmemoryurl handle h strfromJSONrawToCharrescontent Docker info h dockerhandle res curlfetchmemoryurl handle h strfromJSONrawToCharrescontent Docker version h dockerhandle res curlfetchmemoryurl handle h strfromJSONrawToCharrescontent Docker ping h dockerhandle res curlfetchmemoryurl handle h catrawToCharrescontent Data usage h dockerhandle res curlfetchmemoryurl handle h strfromJSONrawToCharrescontent List images h dockerhandle res curlfetchmemoryurl handle h strfromJSONrawToCharrescontent Search images h dockerhandle res curlfetchmemoryurl handle h strfromJSONrawToCharrescontent Pull an image h dockerhandleverbose TRUE handlesetopth copypostfields res curlfetchmemoryurl handle h catrawToCharrescontent List running containers h dockerhandle res curlfetchmemoryurl handle h strfromJSONrawToCharrescontent all truefalse limit int size truefalse filters json h dockerhandle res curlfetchmemoryurl handle h strfromJSONrawToCharrescontent Inspect a container size truefalse h dockerhandleverbose TRUE res curlfetchmemoryurl handle h strfromJSONrawToCharrescontent List container processes psargs string h dockerhandleverbose TRUE res curlfetchmemoryurl handle h strfromJSONrawToCharrescontent Get container logs follow truefalse stdout tf stderr rf since int timestamps tf tail string h dockerhandleverbose TRUE res curlfetchmemoryurl handle h catrawToCharrescontent rescontent x Run a container h dockerhandle handlesetopth copypostfields Image alpine Cmd echo hello world res curlfetchmemoryurl httpv containerscreate handle h strfromJSONrawToCharrescontent I was looking at the source code of harbor to figure out why splashr wasnt working and I dont know if its a good idea or not but throwing it out there I was wondering if it would be easier for debug sanity check within functions to use R classes The structure for opening a docker would be something like boat harbornewNameOfTheDocker Other packages lets say harbor having dependency on harbor would also be R class being subclass of the harbor class for example splash R Classsplash inheritance harborharbor public list initialize functionhost harborlocalhost harbordockerrunhost image scrapinghubsplash detach TRUE dockeropts cp p p I forked the repo and will try to get a crack at it tonight but if hrbrmstr think its a bad idea Ill just let it go Cheers Just keeping this here for tracking purposes Update README Remove analogsea as a dependency Go through the various cloud R pkgs and see which ones use an API for container ops and which ones just use ssh The ones that use ssh should prbly just use the new builtin ssh host object Make an example S host class for an API example in Create a small library of useful install run stop functions like splashrs dockerr Tests wch any plans to send this to CRAN I was thinking of getting analogsea to CRAN soon We dont use harbor yet but we could more easily if on CRAN sckott just told me about this package via the thread on Do you think it would make sense to have those four functions mentioned in that thread or ones like them in this package
