 Dusk Version Laravel Version PHP Version Database Driver Version Description After running my browser tests repeatedly the screen size of the running test automatically decreases after any test fails In my screenshot my DuskTestCasephp file is windowsize although my screen size is defined it crushes it and reduces the screen size DuskTestCasephp file Create the RemoteWebDriver instance return RemoteWebDriver protected function driver options new ChromeOptionsaddArguments disablegpu headless windowsize ScreenShot Screenshot from Steps To Reproduce Hi I am using a forward equivalent of the back method on Browser and would like to submit a PR for the feature Please also support firefox driver I have encountered a problem that mouseover does not work In Dusk Ive been trying to test in Vue the presence of a property value for an object thats in an array The problem seems to come up due to Vue Observer returning a multidimensional array for an array of objects which is fair enough but phpunit assertContains appears to only deal with single dimensional arrays I looked into MakesAssertions and was able to get the query selector to flatMap my data but it feels like too much of a hack assertVueContainsstorestatefeedbackflatMapf fmessage Logged In app Any ideas on this Is it possible to get code coverage of frontend JS code from Dusk The other issues Ive seen only discuss coverage of PHP code Im using Vuejs and Nuxtjs if thats relevant The tests folder is PSR compliant Those two folders do not really belong here They would rather be located in storagelogsdusk Moving the folders is currently possible with a custom setUp method in the DuskTestCase class protected function setUp parentsetUp BrowserstoreScreenshotsAt storagepathlogsduskscreenshots BrowserstoreConsoleLogAt storagepathlogsduskconsole However the DuskCommand complains that the folders in testsBrowser do not exist when trying to clean them I think that for the same reasons some foldersfiles were taken out of the app folder from L to L we should keep the tests folder free of nonPSR stuff Does Laravel Dusk produce working code coverage Because although I added logs node to phpunitduskxml file and got logs those logs lack any coverage data even for the controllers being tested Might it be possible to support different selectors than the cssSelector The webdriver also supports xpath selectors It would be great if functions like text will support xpath also Ive played a little bit with the Dusk code and added a parameter to the text function and it seems to be very easy But im not sure if this is the best way Dusk might also detect xpath by itself by search for at the beginning for example What do you think
