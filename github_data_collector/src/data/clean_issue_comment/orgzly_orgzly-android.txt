This fixes The default time for this preference is still oclock like it was before But now a user is able to change this time For example this heading Heading PROPERTIES CustomID test END The link for orgzly would be test But if it is in a differrent buffer it doesnt work For orgmode it should be filefileNameorgtest Heading Is there a way to have links based on CUSTOMID working for both orgzly and orgmode x I have searched for existing issues that may be the same as or related to mine Adding a yesorno question after a cut operation will make Orgzly more safe Thanks X I have searched for existing issues that may be the same as or related to mine after syncing back an imported org file all plain timestamps get deleted I use them on every entry far more often then SCHEDULED yet they are all gone also DEADLINE and SCHEDULED timestamps get indented by blanks after syncing back but thats a minor issue would be nice though when everything stays as it iswas when savingsyncing back other than that its a lovely app and will become my most used on Android if it leaves my timestamps alone specification EDIT you have to hit the save button on any single entry once before syncing back and it only effects plain timestamps being in one line with the DEADLINESCHEDULED timestamps but in all entries which can be annoying all other timestamps not in the same line keep untouched one can live with that just make two lines as a workaround but one has to know nd EDIT Own plain timestamps have to go after PROPERTIES drawer in Emacs so that PROPERTIES get evaluated and nicely listed by the app otherwise they show up as foldable drawer like any other in the content field of the entry Fixes Hello i wanted to add a simple window that shows diff between local notebook and remote one if a merge confict occurs see issue This is an early draft of what could it look like I could find a way to display diff inside a window could somebody help me with this What really grinds my gears with org and orgzly is theres no default liner command to simply list all tags on my note I would like that to be created because I want to put my brain resource on more important things rather than remembering the entire tags x I have searched for existing issues that may be the same as or related to mine I have created an item scheduled for Jan with a yearly recursion say a birthday reminder I didnt act on this item at the scheduled date On Jan I look at the Agenda widget and there it appears as if the item was scheduled for today with no hint that it is actually days late That is a first problem overdue items should probably appear at the top of the list showing them as scheduled for today is showing erroneous info But the worst is that this seems not just to be a problem linked to the representation of search results I realized that the scheduled time of the item was actually silently modified so for upcoming years it is now scheduled on Jan every year Something I only caught because I manually went to check if the year thing had worked correctly else my agenda would have stayed corrupted without me realizing it Most notification sounds are not sufficient to wake someone from sleep Many devices have a stock alarm clock app which might be adequate but having the scheduling abilities of Orgzly would be better It would be great if we could utilize stock alarm tones for certain notes as well as use notification sounds for other notes As far as I can tell there isnt an option to set different notification sounds on a pernote basis so maybe I need to create a separate issue for that x I have searched for existing issues that may be the same as or related to mine X I have searched for existing issues that may be the same as or related to mine First thank you for an extremely useful app I love it Is there any way to sync a single notebook If so I cannot find it If I trigger a sync for example by pulling down when viewing a certain notebook all my notebooks are synced which can take quite a while since I have a large number of notebooks some of which change very often and some very rarely I find it counterintuitive that the pulldown sync trigger syncs not just the current notebook but all of them I wish there was some way to sync a single notebook because that would be so much faster for me in most situations It would be nice to have another kind of home widget available one that shows the contents of a notebook Ideally it would allow foldunfold Maybe clicking on one item could open the app and take you there This widget would be mainly for reading not for editing It would be nice to me and the way I use orgzly
