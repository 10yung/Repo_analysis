Similarly to database docker images that allow providing a master password database name username and password that get initialized on startup it would be nice if the apiaxle entrypoint script supported something similar This would allow for initializing redis with configuration information to allow calls to the apiaxle api with a given api keysecret The resolve option does not seem to have any effect either when using the PHP Client for ApiAxle or when interacting with it via the repl though those may be different issues Demonstration in the repl axle keyrings DEBUG default Calling GET

true in the repl command I saw an interesting bit of output in our CICD environment T Zproxy DEBUG default POST v apitest apikey apisig T Zproxy DEBUG default Backend POST to Looks like the port number is being output as undefined by the proxy Everything seems to work fine but the log output shows undefined as the port in the URL of the request is says it received In this logger call the port is printed out even if its undefined That value gets extracted here and conditionally set here It might be worth either setting that port value to whatever default ends up being used or if thats not worth the extra complexity simply tweaking the log statement to only include the port if one was specified It would be helpful to others if the latest doc generation updates were referenced in documentation either in README or in the docs website see Currently the README has references to Docker That documentation might be more widely referenced in the documentation website maybe in a new section I tried first with npm install apiaxleapi but it failed exactly for the same reason as As I saw the fix on the development branch so I downloaded the source and compiled with make I could compile it without any problems But after that when I try to npm install foldertoapiaxlebase it fails still bash In file included from srclibxmljsh from srclibxmljscc nodemodulesnannanh At global
