Hi Do you have any plans for migration from now deprecated untyped macros I am not still sure if this is going to work but maybe one could provide implicit views from Monad A Functor A to A eg with a compileTimeOnly annotation so that the code typechecks and the macro would just disregard them replacing with maps or binds What do you think Nick
