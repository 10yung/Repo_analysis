How do we download the android fingerprinting application The link to download it doesnt exist Hi I m maybe planning to install this project I would like to know what s the precision range with a good configuration and training with or without app with or without Pi cluster Is it about meters Thank you Im trying to send using curl but it always returns the same error messageCould not bind JSONsuccessfalse syntax curl v H ContentTypeapplicationjson H Accept applicationjson X POST d grouptuxapusernameandrelocationtrackingtime wififingerprint mac aded f b rssi mac eded f b rssi mace b bb rssi POST track HTTP Host ml internalpositioningcom UserAgent curl ContentTypeapplicationjson Accept applicationjson ContentLength HTTP Bad Request AccessControlAllowCredentials true AccessControlAllowHeaders ContentType ContentLength AcceptEncoding XCSRFToken Authorization XMax AccessControlAllowMethods GET AccessControlAllowOrigin AccessControlMaxAge ContentLength ContentType applicationjson Date Wed Feb GMT Server Caddy Thank you The MQTT topic was being published right before grabbing the RF data I moved the code down a bit and added RF to the topic structure Ive never written in go before but my simple testing seems to indicate that this works fine Awesome tool I have multiple APs in the house and it works well to work out where I am Is there a way I can make it predict where I am heading towards Conceptually it would be the one which is increasing in accuracy I downloaded the dockerfile and supervisor conf and built the docker image and Find randomForest doesnt work I believe it is because rfpy has data hardcoded but find gets passed in data data After a lot of swearing and trying things I have finally managed to succesfully install go MQTT and find server on the raspberry pi I can also succesfully send the command to make a group curl X PUT mqttgroupgroupnanne I get the response that the group has been created I get the password for the group and if I try to make the exact same group again it tells me your password exists and it relists the password However I cannot access the group from my phone other raspberry pi with ARM client from my laptop or indeed even login to the group on the browser at The phone gives an error undefined the windows client also spews out errors and my arm client on raspi keeps sending the fingerprint to the mlinternalpositioncom as changing the URL apparently is not possible on ARM Ive been running find for quite a while without issues but recently it has started crashing like this version build devdevde is up and running on DEBUG mqttgo Got valid MQTT request for group stillskink user motox panic page already freed goroutine running panic x f e xc ca usrlibgo srcruntimepanicgo x e githubcomboltdbboltfreelistfree xc a x a b x f e a e sharelibgosrcgithubcomboltdbboltfreelistgo x b githubcomboltdbboltnodespill xc a a x x sharelibgosrcgithubcomboltdbboltnodego x ca githubcomboltdbboltnodespill xc a x x sharelibgosrcgithubcomboltdbboltnodego x c githubcomboltdbboltnodespill xc a e x x sharelibgosrcgithubcomboltdbboltnodego x c githubcomboltdbboltnodespill xc a x x sharelibgosrcgithubcomboltdbboltnodego x c githubcomboltdbboltnodespill xc a x x sharelibgosrcgithubcomboltdbboltnodego x c githubcomboltdbboltBucketspill xc c x x sharelibgosrcgithubcomboltdbboltbucketgo x cf githubcomboltdbboltBucketspill xc x x sharelibgosrcgithubcomboltdbboltbucketgo xbc githubcomboltdbboltTxCommit xc x x sharelibgosrcgithubcomboltdbbolttxgo x d githubcomboltdbboltDBUpdate xc d c xc efc x x sharelibgosrcgithubcomboltdbboltdbgo x d mainputFingerprintIntoDatabase xc xa xc x x x x ed b d xc cc x x sharesrcfindfingerprintgo x b maintrackFingerprint xc xa xc x xc ca a x x xc cc x x sharesrcfindfingerprintgo xbd mainmessageReceived xc f x f e bf a xc c c sharesrcfindmqttgo x d githubcomschollzorg eeclipse epaho emqtt egolangroutermatchAndDispatchfunc xc a xc fd x e xc f sharelibgosrcgithubcomschollzorgeclipsepahomqttgolangroutergo x ac created by githubcomschollzorg eeclipse epaho emqtt egolangroutermatchAndDispatch sharelibgosrcgithubcomschollzorgeclipsepahomqttgolangroutergo x The learnFingerprint method in fingerprintgo file is just adding the fingerprint to database You can find the line here Where is the learning actually happening Also is it online learning Most of the implementations I have seen uses a dataset in which each row contains all the Access Points APs which will be encountered with some standard RSSI value for missing APs How is this repository doing the learning in realtime Hi there a way to implements new machine learning algorithmsbagging knear neighbor adaboost from py file or I need to do it directly in go files
