 Running into an issue when running the lua example where the data is not updating after each battle even though both sides are winning It was a friend of mine that installed this for me using the Wine installation instructions so possibly something was done incorrectly and caused this but I am unsure Running the example on a ubuntu vm Appreciate any help I can get After running into some errors when trying to install Torchcraft I found that there is no support for Windows Now im wondering if there really is no way to install it on Windows My second best option would be to run it on a Virtual Machine with Win but my best option would definetly be to run it on Windows If there is a solution for running on Windows I would really appreciate to hear it When following the TorchCraft installation process is the AIClient part required Or is it a choice between AIModule or AIClient Running into a problem when doing the pip install pybind pip install D AI BWAPI TorchCraftpip install

A friend of mine says that it fails to compile the C code for some reason im unsure why Have some issues when trying to build the BMEnv Solution Get a ton of different errors that I am unsure how to solve I followed the steps for developing the TorchCraft Server although I may have misinterpreted the step Clone TorchCraft into STARCRAFTTorchCraft I simply copied the TorchCraft folder into the Starcraft folder where I have bwapi located Here is a screenshot of the multiple errors that I recieved As pointed out in if you follow the setup instructions in for using BWEnvexe you are instructed to click Start but the indication that everything is working correctly is the game freezing which is surprising Not sure if I followed the instructions incorrectly I did the copy of common prerequisites and followed the AIModule part However when Starcraft launches it freezes as soon as it enters the gamematch I may have done the common prerequisites incorrect since I was unsure about what the last two steps meant For Copy STARCRAFTTorchCraftBWEnvbindll into STARCRAFT I was unable to find any BWEnv map so I just went in to the bin map and copied the dll file into the Starcraft map For Copy STARCRAFTTorchCraftmaps into STARCRAFTMapsBroodWar I copied both the folders inside the maps folder into the MapsBroodWar folder Did I make a mistake somewhere Or is it supposed to freeze when it gets into the game vs To install BWEnv on an instance of StarCraft running on Windows please follow these installation instructions where can i find these installation instructions
