the project would need to be adapted with the self explicit operator when pull down to refresh ODRefreshControl have some bugs let the method beginRefreshing activate the target action the method beginRefreshing can not activate the target action why you implement dealloc like this voiddealloc selfscrollView removeObserverself forKeyPathcontentOffset selfscrollView removeObserverself forKeyPathcontentInset selfscrollView nil voidwillMoveToSuperviewUIView newSuperview super willMoveToSuperviewnewSuperview if newSuperview selfscrollView removeObserverself forKeyPathcontentOffset selfscrollView removeObserverself forKeyPathcontentInset selfscrollView nil why not just removeObserver in voidwillMoveToSuperview like this voidwillMoveToSuperviewUIView newSuperview super willMoveToSuperviewnewSuperview selfscrollView removeObserverself forKeyPathcontentOffset selfscrollView removeObserverself forKeyPathcontentInset selfscrollView nil Another question when the function dealloc will be called Thanks When I use it in a tableview it was coverd by the navigation bar can you tell me how to fix the problem I was a beginner so please give me some advice thanks a lot simulator screen shot is this control available via cocoapods Add finished Label When pulling down a table view to refresh I crash in tableViewcellForRowAtIndexPath when I access my datasource As a workaround I added a try catch block around where I use indexPath row to access my datasource In this specific crash I have sections and datasources The crash happens when indexPath has a section of nd section When inspecting indexPath in the debugger it shows that indexPath row is nil This is when the control is stretched far enough to begin refreshing but crashes before it does
