 reference I have no use for ratings myself and theyre kinda polluting the rather clean TUI in my case can we disableenable tags Also can we have global tags album duration album year yyyy track count etc in the album string from cmus Of course they should be optional too I think this would look great in musikcubes style Preconditions musikcube Windows x x screen resolution Start musikcube Maximize its window Expected result no border is shown Result black border is shown at the bottom part and the right part of the screen Additional info Issue is presented in any version of Musikcube I havent used Musikcube on Windows for like months but I dont remember that Musikcube had such issue in the past So I guess it is not Musikcube issue it could appear somehow recently after some Windows updates or after my changes of settings in my system It would be nice if someone could try to reproduce that issue on his PC Multiple projects have now come up for scrobbling without lastfm such as librefm and listenbrainz Some of these projects even use the same api as audioscrobbler does so implementation simply requires changing the api endpoint It would be great to be able to configure which services to scrobble to including multiple at the same time Hi does musikcube support shuffling by album If not this issue is a feature request The scrobble is sent immediately to lastfm recent tracks after clicking to play a song even if you dont actually listen to it It is not shown that the song is scrobbling on lastfm either It would be great if it show that you are scrobbling now on lastfm while you play some music as it happens while you do it on Spotify for example request command line parameters options request portable save user settings in the same player folder request resume playback on startup request internet radioaudio stream support radiosm u radio playlist support
