Sourced from thors changelog Drop support to Ruby and Deprecate relying on default exitonfailure In preparation to make Thor commands exit when there is a failure we are deprecating defining a command without defining what behavior is expected when there is a failure To fix the deprecation you need to define a class method called exitonfailure returning false if you want the current behavior or true if you want the new behavior Deprecate defining an option with the default value using a different type as defined in the option Allow options to be repeatable See Support old versions of didyoumean Fix didyoumean support Support new versions of ERB Fix checkunknownoptions to not check the content that was not parsed ie after a or after the first unknown with stoponunknownoption Add didyoumean support Add checkdefaulttype to check if the default value of an option matches the defined type It removes the warning on usage and gives the command authors the possibility to check for programming errors Add disablerequiredcheck to disable check for required options in some commands It is a substitute of disableclassoptions that was not working as intended Add injectintomodule release Rename ThorBasethorreservedword to isthorreservedword release Output a warning instead of raising an exception when a default option value doesnt match its specified type release Fix bug with handling of colors passed to ask and methods like yes and no which it underpins Allow numeric arguments to be negative Ensure that default option values are of the specified type eg you cant specify foo as the default for a numeric option but make symbols and strings interchangeable Add ThorShellBasicindent method for intending output Fix removecommand for an inherited command see Allow hash arguments to only have each key provided once see Allow commands to disable class options for instance for help commands see Do not generate a negative option nonofoo for already negative boolean options nofoo Improve compatibility of ThorCoreExtHashWithIndifferentAccess with Ruby standard library Hash Allow specifying a custom binding for template evaluation eg key and fetch Fix support for
