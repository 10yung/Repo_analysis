Someone at Microsoft just thought it was a good idea to translate the English roles in French in the FR version of Sharepoint So you need to modify in AutoSPInstallerModulepsm Line etc Full rights to Contr le total yes with Maybe the same one embedded a special char instead of space twice in the name of the Sharepoint Management Shelllnk namely Microsoft SharePoint spYear Products SharePoint spYear Management Shelllnk And in autoInstallerModulepsm line one more translation Full Access to Term Store Magasin de termes avec acc s total which means nothing in French BTW Additionally Creating site Collection is failing everytime with accessdenied error I have to create it by hand to go on regards Is there a reason to use CU for AppFabric exclusively for SP It works way better performance wise with CU backgroundGC patch Received this error newspwebapplication cannot bind argument be parameter applicationpool because it is null after creating the my sites Digged deeper found out that the variable mysiteAppPool on line is not initialized and is used in some scenario I installed the web sites to non standard ports not sure whether that caused the issue or not Anyway I manually initialized the variable mysiteAppPool to the applicationpool in order for the script to continue Not a show stopper but here is how its behaving and if some one can provide better work around that will be great Script will try to add managed accounts after provisioning CA and before creating any web applications and in case you dont have interactive logon enabled for those accounts it will fail

sysadmin which is impossible for my situation I resolved this problem by running that two commands Line and within elevated Farm account privilege which the AutoSPInstaller had already used this technique during creating User Profile Service application the CreateUpsAsAdmin function Hope that this will be integrated to the master branch In a two node MinRole farm you should be able to select just Application and Search for one server and FrontEnd Distributed cache for the other server However it still complains that is invalid installation scenario on web front end as shown here For several customers on different environments we have the problem that the initial installation of SharePoint does not activate the Search Service Application We install SharePoint with AutoSPInstaller
