Hi i am trying to build the source develob branch mvn clean install DskitpTeststrue But its failing with INFO scalapbmavenplugin compile default obpapi INFO Reading proto files in homexxxOBPAPIobpapisrcmainprotobuf INFO Writing Scala files in homexxxOBPAPIobpapisrcmainscala protocjar protoc version detected platform linuxx linuxamd INFO INFO BUILD FAILURE INFO INFO Total time s INFO Finished at T Z INFO ERROR Failed to execute goal netcattescalapbmavenplugin compile default on project obpapi Error compiling protobuf files Unsupported platform protoc linuxx exe Help ERROR ERROR To see the full stack trace of the errors rerun Maven with the e switch ERROR Rerun Maven using the X switch to enable full debug logging ERROR ERROR For more information about the errors and possible solutions please read the following articles ERROR Help Any hint please Best regards Is it time to use UUID here If there is space in username eg Hongwei Zhang Then we can not get the directLogin token back following error getting while running build completed sucessfully C Program Files Java jdk bin javaexe javaagentD software IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition lib ideartjar D software IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition bin DfileencodingUTF classpath C Users AppData Local Temp classpath jar RunWebApp Error Could not find or load main class RunWebApp Scenario Developer using api submits a post request to obpv banksBANKIDcustomers with an invalid value for kycstatus Expected response When possible the api response must inform the api user which field is invalid Actual response code messageOBP Incorrect json format The Json body should be the PostCustomerJsonV Motivation Developers should be able to troubleshoot api responses themselves provided there is enough error feedback based on the structure of the data they send The actual repose is not helpful Out of possible datapoints for this api call the developer has no clue which properties are invalid Proposed solution use displayinternalerrors or provide api validation only errors When we enable the props setting displayinternalerrorsTrue Then the error message is more useful for example code messageOBP Incorrect json format The Json body should be the PostCustomerJsonV No usable value for kycstatus nDo not know how to convert JStringTRUE into boolean Right away as an API user it is possible to see the error is with the kycstatus property The developer can now easily focus on correcting the data they are sending There is concern hongwei that displayinternalerrors is too broad for this as it may show internal errors which are sensitive Therefore maybe a more granular setting is needed Currently the copyright date is until Proposed solution State the current year in the footer When the database connection fails the user should see an error message Right now the error message does not tell the developer that the database is the problem Proposed solution When the database connection fails Show an error message that the database connection has failed Hi I tried to develop an app in android studio I followed all the instruction on README But this appears instead is this the correct outcome Needs some explanation and guidance here outcome Hello I was trying out your API and Im struggling to understand how bank details are added by a user so that the application has access to the account data of the user I was trying to implement according to the wiki but the page seems to be quite outdated The for me interesting part Banking Details doesnt describe how a user is redirected back to enter his account data after he is logged in by the OpenBankProject site and is redirected to the REDIRECTURL Hopefully someone can help me understand this better Thanks We already provide obpv managementbanksBANKIDcardsCARDID As an API user it would be convenient to be able to also get a card via its card number obpv managementbanksBANKIDcardsCARDNUMBER Proposed solution Add api call to GET card by card number
