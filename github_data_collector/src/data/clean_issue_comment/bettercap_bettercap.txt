 Prerequisites Please before creating this issue make sure that you read the README that you are running the latest stable version and that you already searched other issues to see if your problem or request was already reported PLEASE REMOVE THIS PART AND LEAVE ONLY THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS IN YOUR REPORT Description of the bug or feature request Environment Please provide Bettercap version you are using bettercap version OS version and architecture you are using Go version if building from sources Command line arguments you are using Caplet code you are using or the interactive session commands Full debug output while reproducing the issue bettercap debug Steps to Reproduce Description OS and application Bettercap version OS version and architecture Linux Parrot parrot amd SMP Parrot parrot x GNULinux Go version go Linuxamd Command line Running bettercap bettercap interface eth gateway when i run the application it still run and cant stop automatically so i not use any command line Running bettercap debug to show the command used bettercap debug when i run the command i found and i remember to using it so this is command i used it D LANGen LANGUAGEenENUTF arp a n and i dont now to turn off it its make an automatically scanning until down still running The screenshoot Screenshot at Screenshot at Screenshot at Screenshot at Screenshot at Screenshot at Screenshot at Screenshot at Screenshot at I think I am having a very basic problem which I cannot figure out It seems that there are come special characters at the end of each line which keeps bettercap from recognizing any commands I only type wifirecon bettercap v built for windows amd with go type help for a list of commands syslog war Could not detect gateway wifirecon J K syslog err unknown or invalid syntax wifirecon type help for the help menu Environment Please provide Bettercap version you are using bettercap version v built for windows amd with go OS version and architecture you are using Win bit Intel Command line arguments you are using none Caplet code you are using or the interactive session commands I do not know what that is Steps to Reproduce start bettercap type any command Expected behavior What you expected to happen command recgnized no special characters added to line Actual behavior What actually happened special characters added to line command not recognized This module allows bettercap to interface with gpsd for gps data instead of a gps devices serial port directly This is done to be able to share gps time data from gpsd to ntpd or chrony for devices that dont have a RTC or a network connection This is my first writing anything in go I hope everything is alright Looks like a regression HSTS hijacking works on bettercap v and doesnt work upper Steps arpspoof is

ssl proxy and everything works well both browser accept the certificat of burp suite This is some pics about the problem KALI LINUX Bettercap v Built for linux amd go KALI gitter channel doesnt seem to be alive so Q is it at all possible to run bettercap by a normal userwithout suid Trying so immediately errors dont have permission to capture And bettercap iface none doesnt work too Would be nice to have reaver functionality in bettercap Hello everyone maybe someone has an idea about the problem here I was reading all the forums and docs but I dont really get it Especially as most people remark that it should work out of the box with the default dkms driver I am running Kali rolling release kali amd in VirtualBox r Qt with an Alfa AWUS WiFi adapter the USB host in VirtualBox is set to USB Installing the default driver apt install realtekrtl xxaudkms doesnt make the WiFi adapter work I reverted to the aircrackng driver set Now the adapter works lsusb Bus Device ID bda Realtek
