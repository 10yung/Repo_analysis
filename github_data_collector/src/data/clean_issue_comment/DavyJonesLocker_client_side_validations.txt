 Steps to reproduce This maybe a question more than an issue with CSV but Im trying to make email confirmation sometimes required and sometimes optional depending on the circumstances Note when testing the validation Expected behavior By default CSV should not validate email confirmation because it is conditional If validate true is passed then it should validate Actual behavior Always validates emailconfirmation regardless of what validateemailconfirmation returns Note testing this out serverside validations work as expected System configuration Rails version Ruby version Client Side Validations version clientsidevalidations clientsidevalidationssimpleform Code snippet from your model of the validations validates email presence true confirmation true validates emailconfirmation presence true if validateemailconfirmation The whole form code from your template simpleformfor contactmessage validate true do f finput email finput emailconfirmation The resulting HTML Browsers development console output x I confirm that my browsers development console output does not contain errors Additional JavaScript Libraries If your issue depends on other JavaScript libraries please list them here Eg Bootstrap Modal v jQuery UI Datepicker NA Repository demostrating the issue Debugging CSV issues is a time consuming task If you want to speed up things please provide a link to a repository showing the issue I can provide if required Failure to include this requirement may result in the issue being closed Add a callback when CSV has been initialized to run custom code This will prevent the need of duplicating initialization code and check for turbolinks jquery Ref Todo list in priority order x Remove the strikeuniquenessstrike middleware x Unobtrusive Javascript Idempotent events Run JavaScript tests on CI Promisebased approach x Raise CodeClimate score to Remove jQuery dependency x Use ES instead of coffeescript Whats new Proper SemVer A proper SemVer allows us to break things very badly The first feature which will be removed from CSV will be the middleware The Middleware If you want need the middleware stay on but please note that it will not be supported and bugfixesnew features will not be backported by me If there is someone who wants to maintain the middleware as a separate gem you are the welcome Please note that you may also need to import the middleware from the mongoid plugin When using numericality greaterthan with other model attributes if i remove of the fields it doesnt show any messages anymore but when i try to submit im getting server validation fail I suppose its better to reproduce server side behaviour for that case validates maximumplayers allownil true numericality onlyinteger true lessthanorequalto greaterthanorequalto minimumplayers validates minimumplayers allownil true numericality onlyinteger true greaterthanorequalto lessthanorequalto maximumplayers img width alt d be e e e src At the moment travis is only running ruby related tests rake There is another suite of tests rake testjs which only runs locally I would like to see unit tests run on the cloud Running on travis with phantomjs is ok saucelabs would be way better Anyone can help on this TIA
