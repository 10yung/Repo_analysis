Hi Thanks for your work Im currently working with Carla and I was wondering if the minimum value generated by depth sensor can be modify because it seems to be always equal to is it correct Max value and minimum Thanks Best regards Is it possible in CARLA I only see the option for setting the FOV but not the exact camera matrix itself Or the distortion Thanks for contributing to CARLA If you are

you are reporting an issue please provide the CARLA version number you are using and your PlatformOS Version Platform Linux Probably all platforms but I cannot test There seems to be an issue with the way framerate is set with the configpy script found in the util folder of the PythonAPI Specifically when setting the value to in order to regain the variable framerate of the server an error occurs Traceback most recent call last File utilconfigpy line in module main File utilconfigpy line in main if settingsfixeddeltaseconds TypeError unorderable types NoneType float This same error occurs when trying to use deltaseconds or the default flag d The only way to recover variable framerate seems to be restarting the server It also seems that the benchmark fpsxx flag for CarlaUE sh does not set the framerate for the server Maybe this was removed from previous versions Is there a full changelog for releases to help with determining the breaking changes Lastly this may need to be a separate issue but when setting the framerate for the simulator only certain dynamics seem to change appropriately For example it seems the water ripples spectator camera controls and even vehicle controls are influenced by the framerate However the ephemeris model or sun dynamics is unchanged by the frameratesimulation time Im sure there are other dynamics that may not change appropriately but I havent had a chance to dig any further Description PythonAPI content is now indexed correctly PythonAPI documentation has been updated The following classes have been modified carlaActor carlaActorAttribute

alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend Hi In the current version of Carla the new Traffic Manager is not able to connect to a remote server only to a local server localhost That is because in code a localhost is used for the connection If you change that localhost with the IP where the server is the traffic manager can connect That means that then we need to compile again with make PythonAPI The line to change is I use manualcomtrolpy How do I set the first appearance of a car to any location Help me Hello there simple question Is there any example that I can build on top of to record DLiDAR like data on the simulator Id like to collect a staticscene dataset to work with D Laser scans I tried to look in the documentation but there are no examples and the ones provided in the distribution are too big to just hack and go Ive searched for pointcloudexamplepy but it looks that it has been removed from the latest distributions Thanks a lot carla ver manualcontrolsteeringwheelpy is used I want to increase the number of pygame windows to as I want to actually drive I want to use three monitors to see not only the front but also the left and right Is there a way Help me Hi Im new to carla but trying to build a map that can support a min drive an oval track would work i dont have access to roadrunner i wish i had so easier so i started with town tried to extend the long straight i was doing ok till i tried to use it to see the result event if it wasnt done well it didnt load i saw a video the guy was using a racetrack generator object that was making the process a lot easier i find in the carla doc its missing a lot of step by step and the full process even if that would build a simple track just wish roadrunner wasnt costing that much any help or video or anything to put me on the right track thanks a lot To reproduce in a town with bridges driver under a bridge eg in town we can see that the ceiling below the bridge is marked to class with is a lane marker although the other side is a roadclass we may not prefer to define them as class w Thanks for contributing to CARLA If you are asking a question please make sure your
