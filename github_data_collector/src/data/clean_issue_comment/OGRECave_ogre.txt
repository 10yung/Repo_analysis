 following intuition instead using the reverse order as of now Also drop the setPriority mechanism like is done for UBOs and SSBOs As they are unnamed we can not attach them to an sharedparamater set workaround use SSBOs to efficiently map to constant buffers UBOs similar to GL implement the follwing buffer types UBO Constant Buffer binding to sharedparams missing forums thread SSBO RWStructuredBuffer AtomicCounterBuffer RWStructuredBuffer D D BUFFERUAVFLAGCOUNTER System Information Ogre Version Operating System Platform Ubuntu RenderSystem greyquestion Detailled description Im trying to update the ogre package released for Debian and Ubuntu to the current and to enable some language bindings as well As imgui is not included in the release tarball Im currently disabling it I read about by setting DOGREBUILDCOMPONENTOVERLAYIMGUIBOOLFALSE However it then fails to find the imgui include later on if I enable python bindings generation log Building CXX object ComponentsPythonCMakeFilesOverlaydirOgreOverlayPYTHONwrapcxxo cd homesimonproggnogresalsaogreogreobjx linuxgnuComponentsPython usrbinc DOverlayEXPORTS Iusrincludepython m Ihomesimonproggnogresalsaogreogreobjx linuxgnuinclude IhomesimonproggnogresalsaogreogreOgreMaininclude IhomesimonproggnogresalsaogreogreComponentsOverlayinclude Wall Winitself Wcastqual Wwritestrings Wextra Wundef Wmissingdeclarations Wnounusedparameter Wshadow Wnomissingfieldinitializers Wnolonglong g O fdebugprefixmaphomesimonproggnogresalsaogreogre fstackprotectorstrong Wformat Werrorformatsecurity pipe Wall Wdatetime DFORTIFYSOURCE Wdatetime DFORTIFYSOURCE msse fPIC fvisibilityhidden fvisibilityinlineshidden Wnocastqual Wnoshadow Wnomaybeuninitialized Wnounusedlabel Wnounusedbutsetvariable Wnomissingdeclarations stdc o CMakeFilesOverlaydirOgreOverlayPYTHONwrapcxxo c homesimonproggnogresalsaogreogreobjx linuxgnuComponentsPythonOgreOverlayPYTHONwrapcxx homesimonproggnogresalsaogreogreobjx linuxgnuComponentsPythonOgreOverlayPYTHONwrapcxx fatal error imguih Datei oder Verzeichnis nicht gefunden include imguih compilation terminated fix seems to be a missing conditional in OgreOverlayi if I change lines to ifdef HAVEIMGUI include imguih include OgreImGuiOverlayh endif it compiles successfully System Information Ogre Version master Operating System Platform Windows bit RenderSystem OpenGL Detailled description This issue has existed for a long time at least since but it has started occuring more and more with every major update of Ogre Now with and especially with relatively flat surfaces this occurs quite consistently Only way that Ive found how to detect that this is happening is to compare the terrain root scene node AABB vs the terrain WorldAABB like this cameraisVisibleterraingetRootSceneNodegetWorldAABB cameraisVisibleterraingetWorldAABB If that is true then also the terrain will not be visible Ive still been unable to locate the real reason why those AABBs would be different in that case and what could cause it and derive UnifiedHighLevelGpuProgram and NullProgram from GpuProgramPtr fixes we cannot unify any further as HighLevelProgramManager has its own resource namespace right now merging with low level would cause conflicts in user code The factory classes do not consider syntax which requires special hacks with we can now delegate to lowlevel programs as well We should make this clear in the API Also there is nothing highlevel to the Unified programs typedef HighLevelGpuProgramPtr to GpuProgramPtr
