Would it be possible to implement typed actors I made a small example this ignores the whole mailbox threading etc so it isnt an exact match but is it possible to implement such a thing It would allow for safer code Hi Are you planning to make ActorRef serializable whenif you create networking support This has been one of the most problematic things for us when creating AkkaNET port of Akka to NET Polymorphic serialization is hard and depending on serializer and platform not always possible LocalActorRef DeadLetterActorRef RemoteActorRef RouterActorRef etc etc In my other actor project I ditched the ActorRef concept and used a more Erlang like PID which is a simple value that instead of using polymorphism resolves the underlying actor This way the actor pid can easily be passed across the wire using eg protobuf as the serializer Just wanted to give a heads up on that one Another benefit of the above approach would be the possibility of cross platform Go Rust remoting hint hint If you are still going down the ActorRef route are there some interesting ways that Rust can deal with the above
