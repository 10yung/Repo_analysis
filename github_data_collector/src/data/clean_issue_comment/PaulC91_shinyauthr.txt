Thank you for great package Are there any tricks for using Shinyauth with Flexdashboard instead of pure Shiny andor Shinydashboard I have tried with no success After experimenting with couple different approaches I believe testing shinyauthr functionalities against the Shiny example app in inst would be the most practical way as it allows to test the userfacing interface leaving room to change the underlying logic eg hashing etc Tests have been structured as Login Login form displays properly empty username and password fields with collapsed sidebar If a user logs in successfully userauth is set to TRUE and info gets update with user infos When a user logs in successfully sidebarCollapsed is set to FALSE and logout button displays Logout Logging out successfully sets userauth to FALSE and info to NULL Logging out hides logout button and sets sidebarCollapsed to TRUE Tests run well under a minute secs hence it shouldnt be required to skip tests when submitting Would be really interesting to understand if I overlooked any better approach to do this Help needed Exporting values is needed in order to inspect them during testing This is done by adding a call to exportTestValues in appR r Export reactive values for testing exportTestValues authstatus credentialsuserauth authinfo credentialsinfo userdata userdata this throws an error On the other hand exporting userdata reactive data frame breaks the call trowing the following error even when in testmode Unable to fetch all values from server Is target app running with optionsshinytestmodeTRUE This is blocking me from testing the right data is being show to user respecting their permission level Hence tests have been commented out testshinyauthrR I am probably missing something obvious here but the same call works like a charm on a mock Shiny app Thanks a lot for the package with some basic db logic to storeretrieve user credentials it has become my goto to implement basic auth in Shiny I think unit tests are needed to guard the package from bugs testthat is probably your best goto on this one Is it possible to add the logout button in the User panel of the shinydashboardPlus dashboardUser interface When adding the button as it is the button is not visible Builing an own function without the hide function solves the problem but then the login panel is not showing up after logout Hey First of all Thanks for the great package I found out that you cant log in if the passwort contains the character Dont know if there are other characters which will cause that bug also I didnt find out Minimal example Just run your example app with userbase dataframeuser test password test It will always say Invalid username or password Also if isnt the first character it will cause this bug Im trying to add signup functionality Im using the prescribed code for login verification credentials callModule module shinyauthrlogin id login data userbase usercol user pwdcol passwordhash sodiumhashed TRUE logout reactivelogoutinit In the above code userbase is a global variable I tried to use reactive and eventReactive to replace the data but got the following error Error in UseMethodtblvars no applicable method for tblvars applied to an object of class creactiveExpr reactive Refreshing the page does not help but Im able to login with the previously created user after restarting the application because global variable userbase gets updated But Im unable to login with any user ID thats created in the current session Desired output On click of signup a new row gets added to userbase during the same session Login attempt should be successful with the new user Thank you for your package it saves a lot I want to use userinfopermissions to control the appearance of certain tabPanel in fluidPage It works when first login but after logout the relogin process requires to refresh the webpage other wise the webpage just not render the uiOutput and uiOutput as well as the glue in sidebar Do you have any idea why this happens ui dashboardPageheader dashboardHeader sidebar dashboardSidebar body dashboardBody shinyjsuseShinyjs tagsheadtagsstyletablemargin auto

issue and calligrosss Shiny Cookie Based Authentication Example I simply combined the code and created this PR First off would like to thank you for putting all the work in this package It has made my life simpler However there is always room for improvement and one problem I noticed that I have to relogin in every new window because currently the package doesnt store successful authentication persistently across tabs so want propose a feature Would anyone be up for collaboration to combine cookiejs to save sessionid per user as Cookie with a custom expiry period such that the same user is not required to login again in that time period This blog uses this cookiejs and exemplifies its usage in R
