 Describe the bug Hi Ive noticed that using the completion feature of zshautosuggestions under Cygwin makes the prompt completly unresponsive Im aware of the slowness of cygwins fork and using the history strategy theres a small lag when typing but after adding the completion option the prompt will stop responding to any character typed Only solution Ive found is to close the current shell and open a new one To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior sh zsh df source pathtozshautosuggestionszsh ZSHAUTOSUGGESTSTRATEGYcompletion Expected behavior Typing characterscommands on the prompt should work normally little lag is acceptable Desktop OS distribution Windows Cygwin Tried both bit and bit Zsh version Plugin version Hi Ive tried to define a custom wiget for my zsh Basically its not working autocompletion does not work Config is rather straightforward zsh function autosuggestpartialaccept CURSOR zle N autosuggestpartialaccept bindkey v g autosuggestpartialaccept zsh ZSHAUTOSUGGESTPARTIALACCEPTWIDGETS autosuggestpartialaccept What am I supposed to do in order to get it to work Thanks in advance Its not actually a bug report or a feature request Its more like a requst for the help Describe the bug When installing zshautosuggestions for ohmyzsh on raspberry pi B raspbian jessie it fails to understand the ZSHCUSTOM part in the install script and so fails to correctly install the plugin To Reproduce On raspberry jessie do as follows Install zshautosuggestions plugin for ohmyzsh using command bellow shell git clone ZSHCUSTOMohmyzshcustompluginszshautosuggestions add zshautosuggestions to plugins section in zshrc and do source zshrc restart the terminal and a warning saying ohmyzsh plugin zshautosuggestions not found is displayed check the ohmyzshcustomplugins and ohmyzshplugins directories Expected behavior It should have created zshautosuggestions directory in ohmyzshcustomplugins instead of creatign a wrong directory called ZSHCUSTOM in ohmyzshplugins Screenshots Screenshot Desktop OS distribution Raspbian GNULinux jessie Zsh version Plugin version d c Describe the bug There are conflicted between zshuserszshsyntaxhighlighting and zshuserszshautosuggestions With both plugins activated if one continuously uses ZSHAUTOSUGGESTPARTIALACCEPTWIDGETS the last word of the suggestion will be duplicated To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior sh zsh df source pathtozshautosuggestionszsh source pathtozshsyntaxhighlightingpluginzsh export WORDCHARS cd Test Test Now input cd and continuously use ZSHAUTOSUGGESTPARTIALACCEPTWIDGETS until the end of the line Instead of get the complete Test Test the Test part will be duplicated Expected behavior sh cd Test Test Actual behavior cd Test Test Test Desktop OS distribution macOS Zsh version Plugin version d c f d c d b a a f fd Describe the bug I load this plugin in the background after precmd hook This plugin runs zshautosuggeststart after precmd So first prompt will be without autosuggestions To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior sh TMOUT TRAPALRM source PATHTOPLUGINzshautosuggestionspluginzsh If you are not able to reproduce it by running zsh df and sourcing the plugin manually it means there that the issue is caused by something in your local config files Temporarily comment out or remove sections of your config and restart zsh until you narrow down exactly what is causing the issue Expected behavior A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen After initialization the plugin must run zshautosuggestbindwidgets directly The plugin currently autosuggests on blank lines for every whitespace character It is just a cosmetic thing but I dont like it My zsh currently autoinserts a space after every completion and zshautosuggestions will autosuggest in all of these instances as well But in of these cases I do not want an additional completion and I just want to open the tabcompleted file in vim for instance Maybe this is a little clearer vim file tab autocompletes to vim file txt spaceautosuggestionfile txtautosuggestion Can I disable autosuggestions on whitespace characters and for a single keystroke after all tabcompletions and reenable for all other keypresses or something like that Or maybe you have other suggestions to fix my configuration I tried bindkey autosuggestdisable but it eats up my space Thanks Describe the bug zsh prompt becomes very slow after multiple times of source zshrc I suspect its the widgets of zshautosuggestboundn slowing zsh down because after every time I do source zshrc the number of these widgets increases For example when a new shell starts only widgets of zshautosuggestbound are registered and after a second source zshrc widgets of zshautosuggestbound are added I use ohmyzsh to load this plugin To Reproduce Do this for to times source zshrc Desktop OS distribution debian Zsh version Plugin version f bc I have frequent cases in my workflow where I never use current suggestions when I want to revertcherrypick a commit I usually put the commit hash in my clipboard first then git revert it would make sense to suggest here the hash which is in my clipboard Feel free to close the issue if it is outside of the scope of the plugin as It suggests commands based on history and completions Should run make and check if zshautosuggestionszsh changes Autosuggest suggests me files that dont exist in this directory eg foo vim foofile foo cd bar foobar vim at the point autosuggest is suggesting me foofile even though it doesnt exist in foobar For commands that work on paths I want to only be shown valid paths from the current directory Can I make the suggestions more intelligent to solve this problem
