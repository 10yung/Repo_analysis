Keytap allows recovering audio to text from just the audio recording Allowing importing of recordings made elsewhere would allows recordings made with other equipment phones etc and then use the tool to record the text It would be nice to provide info for building the project in Windows environment I was a bit surprised by the huge amount of interest that this project generated I had no idea if keytap works reliably or not so I am happy to see that people actually like it I am still curious to know how reliable it is For example I havent been able to get any good prediction results when using nonmechanical keyboards Would be interesting to know if this is the case for everyone Feel free to share your experience here
