foo static async foo async a async a a async a b async a b a Im trying to store data associated with an expression Unfortunately Expression doesnt implement Hash which makes it impossible for me to store the data inside a HashMap Would it be possible to derive or implement Hash for Expression so an expression can be used as a HashMap key Fix Module soundness where its possible to get a borrow of body while dropping the arena its allocated on Related to The current AST types uses CopyCell from toolshed which is not really sound Adding to that interior mutability is inherently confusing I propose that we move back to normal heap allocated objects if the performance difference is small otherwise we should consider saving mut in types Also while toolshed requires Copy bound its not always necessary as rustcs DroplessArena shows We could either use a reimplementation of that or simply typedarena Snippet js for x in a b f Span seems to be a quite common thing in parsers and its also very useful when it comes to source map sourcemaps uses line and column instead of byte position Instead of reimplementing these functionality inhouse there seems to be a good crate codespan that is used by the Gluon scripting language Lets integrate it and give them a shout out
