Please upload this library to jcenter or maven If you add item nameandroidwindowTranslucentStatustrueitem to your activity theme the animation does not work Reason is FrameLayoutandroidRidcontent does not get resized in case of such activities img width altScreenshot at PM src Seems like a weird unrelated issue But I see it happening Whenever I pop a fragment I hide the keyboard kotlin fun ViewhideKeyboard handlerremoveCallbacksAndMessagesTOKENKEYBOARD contextgetSystemServiceInputMethodManagerhideSoftInputFromWindowthiswindowToken InputMethodManagerHIDENOTALWAYS If I press the back hardware button the first time closes the keyboard and the second time pops the fragment This is the normal case where everything works Now if I press the close button in the toolbar the two actions are done at the same time It closes the keyboard and pops the fragment This is where I see the problem happening In this case the popped fragment only goes through onPause and onStop onDestroy is never called What happens is that this fragment is removed from the FragmentManager but if I do call fmfindFragmentByTag the fragment is null It doesnt make any sense Now you could be asking How is this related to this lib If I dont use the lib the issue doesnt happen For some reason the animation in the activity messes up the fragment manager Any ideas what it could be Thanks Hi saket First of all thank you for providing me with good information but I have a little problem Its a problem when using FluidKeyboardResize with CoordinatorLayout How do I use FluidKeyboardResize with CoordinatorLayout please help me Let me know if you like this or would prefer something different happy to modify And THANK YOU for the super nice project it was a joy to experiment with It seems that setting the height on the views LayoutParams was what was holding up the TransitionsManager from detecting the original state of the content view but we also dont know the bounds on the first pass adding a postRunnable allows us to get the proper original height right after the first layout pass
