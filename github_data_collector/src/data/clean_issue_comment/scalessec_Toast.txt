ios xcode iphone ps Could not find module ToastSwift for target armv appleios found arm arm appleios overlapping CN ToastView ToastView I display toast with progress indicator to wait for background task But view behind toast is still clickable Is there a way to fix it Hi I use Toast to create a loading view So I pass CGFLOATMAX to duration parameter to ensure toast do not disappear automatically since I would manually hide it But if I hide it before completion block in csshowToastdurationposition called the timer will hold strong reference to view forever Beside my case there is a release latency if we manually hide toast before completion block called Would it better to take a check on finished flag This flag is NO when I manually hide toast Fix makeToastActivity condition called hideAllToasts cannot be hidden This solves issue with title and message alignment The solution it to use the same width for both UILabels This will be the largest value of the expected widths based on the text content The available width for the UILabel was too large the stylehorizontalPadding wasnt respected Here is the before left and after right when using styletitleAlignment NSTextAlignmentCenter originalhorpadding sbs It also solves a problem that the UILabel is not resizing when using horizontalPadding originalhorpadding sbs add style UIActivatyIndicator to makeToastActivity voidmakeToastActivityidposition style CSToastStyle style voidmakeToastActivityidposition styleCSToastStyle style indicatorStyleUIActivityIndicatorViewStyleindicatorStyle and change demo Thank you I wanted to have not only to appear and disappear the toasts with transparency animations My goal was to have the toasts slide from the bottom up and out again Therefore I added optional blocks defining the show and hide animation of the toast Let me know if I need to provide anything else As mention in if the title or message is shorter than the width of the wrapper view it does not appear to be centered Bug fixes that animation is complete when the parent view is released before the start application error occurs Change the trigger of completion animation from NSTimer base timer source base note Great implementation of this Toast but it seems there is a need to a little improvement There seems to be screen transition and a case to application errors when using this Toast you use a UINavigationControl at iOS Where it was examined there is a case that to no parent view before completion animation that uses a NSTimer ToastView has been released it was noticed that you are going to call a method of NSTimer has been released instance So I have changed how to implement the GCDbased timer souce I hope that this implementation is us liked
