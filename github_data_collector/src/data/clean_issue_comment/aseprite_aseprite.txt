 An extra null pointer check is not needed in functions Do I need to check for null before delete p like the following ExtensionDitheringMatrixInfodestroyMatrix ExtensionDitheringMatrixInfodestroyMatrix function Job Destructor for Job For example Layer above of Layer Layer opacity draw filled square with a color with alpha square B Layer opacity draw other filled square with a color with alpha square A Execute Merge Down command Results Wrong result resultant layer with opacity square A its OK but the square B was affected by Layer opacity so the square B has a current opacity of square B looks more transparent after the Merge Down command Expected result resultant layer with opacity and unchanged displayed shapes Aseprite version Right now we have All Layers Current and First Reference Layer as options for the eyedropper However All Layers has the problem of picking mixed colors if there is any opacity and current layer simply picks nothing if you are on the wrong layer Id like a fourth option that simply picks from the first layer from the top that it encounters so you can pick from a transparent layer without getting mixed colors although Id assume youd still have to set it to not pick alpha When I try to make an HSV color in my case the saturation s value keeps reverting from to Im unsure if this is a bug or a feature but its kind of annoying when you want to have nice round numbers This only happens when the S value is Aseprite and System version Aseprite v on Windows Origin of the issue Image processing software can save PNG images files with an embedded Color profile Then when Aseprite opens the PNG if the libpng library throws an error for example PCS illuminant is not D we need to ask to the user how to manage the color profile to saveexport the image correctly Stepped color swatches on SHADING LIGHTNESS SATURATION HUE Related to It can be implemented on a float dialog better option or docked instead the color wheel This is a long standing issue we should watch the ini file for changes and if the file is changed by other instanced reload the preferences from that file or at least asking for the changes in the other instance In some way after closing Aseprite we should be able to merge the preferences of the running instances with existing ini eg recent files Not sure if this can be done with all preferences Anyway I guess that just reloading preferences when the ini file is modified externally should avoid these merge conflict or losing preferences when we overwrite the file When having rightclick set to Pick foreground color you can also pick transparency and draw with that That works fine with the Rectangle tool the Filled rectangle tool and the Ellipse tool but not with the Filled ellipse tool That one only works when drawing with an actual color Aseprite version x System Windows Following LUA script should set first palette color to transparent red alpha but instead color in palette is fully opaque Tested with other colors and indexes and it seems that setColor function ignores alpha component local spr appactiveSprite if not spr then return appalertThere is no active sprite end apptransaction function local palette sprpalettes palettesetColor Colorh s v a end apprefresh Aseprite and System version Aseprite version v x installed from Humble bundle distribution
