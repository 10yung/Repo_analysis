 Proper stewardship requires actually updating the project README when a project has been orphaned Hi All I am new here I have cuda and cuda nn installed with paths setup I cannot run the example files for some reason Am I missing something System is Ubuntu akhileshskakhileshskhome cd rustleaftutorialsleaf akhileshskakhileshskhomerustleaftutorialsleaf cargo run release nodefaultfeatures

focus on new ventures Is this accurate If so should the README mention so Autumn is also still listed on is Autumn still a thing If so will the company continue to use Rust Hi all I try to compile and run leaf example with the following command cargo run release nodefaultfeatures features cuda example benchmarks alexnet but got errors like this In function

panicked at called Resultunwrap on an Err value Error kind Failed description Error while trying to execute capnp compile Failed No such file or directory os error Please verify that version or higher of the capnp executable is installed on your system See srclibcoreresultrs note Run with RUSTBACKTRACE for a backtrace You should mention that you require capnproto to be installed in the system beforehand This is followup to autumnaicollenchyma autumnaicollenchyma What do you think about removing ArcLocks from Leaf codebase There is a lot of readunwrap ArcnewRwLocknew and then let inputslocked Vec inputsitermapb breadunwrapcollect that make code harder to read Users of Leaf also have to wrap inputs in ArcLocks I think when autumnaicollenchyma is implemented there would be less problems with borrowing and ArcLocks can be removed but Im not completely sure yet Or are there plans to introduce multithreading that require all inputsoutputsweights to be wrapped in this way
