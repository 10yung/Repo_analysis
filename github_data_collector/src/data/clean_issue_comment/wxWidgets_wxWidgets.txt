See Fix using wxHDBITMAPONRIGHT Possible fix for Show more columns in widgets sample redesign page Remove the check that the size representation was the same as float and as double which was supposed to catch various edge cases NaNs huge numbers etc but actually caught plenty of perfectly valid font sizes such as that simply lost precision when converting from double to float Just check that the size is positive and less than FLTMAX to avoid using values that really dont make sense as font sizes Also add a unit test checking that using fractional font sizes in description string works as expected Closes This adds an additional wxWebView backend based on the upcoming Microsoft Edge Chromium The underlying WebView SDK is documented here Follow the build instructions in the wxWebView documentation page This is very similar to my previous attempt where I integrated the now legacy Edge which is part of Windows This backend has currently quite a few features missing but might still be a better choice than IE when displaying web content The unsupported features are the following virtual filesystems custom urls Ive tested building with Visual Studio Community using CMake on Windows This is still a work in progress see the list of known todos x Deciding on how to integrate x Document build process x Add to Visual Studio Projects x Check nmake builds x Add RunScript implementation x Figure out string parsing from ExecuteScript Obviously it helps if the users is able to know where their codes went wrong especially when the codes is lengthy I was trying to return a JSONstringifye which provides more information but have difficulty to remove method toJSON from the Error object e If anyone knows how to do it without jQuery please let me know I personally would like the whole contents of e to be returned including both line number and column number Anyway its better than nothing to have the callstack By the way the property stack of e seems nonstandard but it does exist in both IE and WebKitbased browser For example a newline was escaped to be a backslash followed by a newline but it actually shall be a backslash followed by a character n It seemed okay with most of codes until in the case that C style comments ie single line comments in the JavaScript codes If the newline characters are not escaped correctly the JavaScript interpreter will ignore everything that goes after the single line comments because the interpreter obviously cannot find the newline where its supposed to stop treating codes as comments CoreServicesh ultimately includes AssertMacrosh which by default on older SDKs introduces various macros whose names very easily conflict with user code For example if you included wxfswatcherh in your own code and your code happened to contain a symbol called check or verify compilation failed No other wx header has a dependency on CoreServicesh or AssertMacrosh Instead of internal values GdkAtom is now const char pointing to internal strings For generic char always call ginternstring to get the internal pointer from gdk so we can compare pointers instead of doing strcmp See this ticket This PR will take care of the ticket It makes the PR obsolete Both unmodified sample and and the sample modified with the patch attached to the ticket works Please check the ticket review PR and apply Thank you
