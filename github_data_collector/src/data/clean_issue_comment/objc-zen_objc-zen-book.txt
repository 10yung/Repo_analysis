 Indent using spaces Never indent with tabs Be sure to set this preference in Xcode Method braces and other braces ifelseswitchwhile etc always open on the same line as the statement but close on a new line Hey Is it a personal preference Or there is a reason I miss somewhere Thanks fix little question of indent In the section of we should not use static for NotificationName or we can t extern it for other code For example ah extern static NSString const TestConstNotificationName am static NSString const TestConstNotificationName TestConstNotificationName This wont pass compile On other hand a constant will be init in the global memory area So it doesnt need a static key word clang version Apple LLVM version clang Xcode version NSURL url NSString urlString NSString stringWithFormat baseURLString endpoint NSURL URLWithStringurlString compiler error initializing NSURL strong with an expression of incompatible type void The value of the latest statement is not returned if enclosing in round bracket Its poor reading experience on Github If you want I can help Never prefix your private method with a single underscore voidnotifyDelegates The two lines above are just copied here I know this project is about coding convention but you tried to explain block and its usage so I ask In the Block section weak typeofselfweakSelf self strong typeofweakSelfstrongSelf weakSelf Why typeofweakSelf instead of typeofself Arent they the same thing I think part of article should mention NSHashTable as a way to store weak references without creating ZOCWeakObject class
