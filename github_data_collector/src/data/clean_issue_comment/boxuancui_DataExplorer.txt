Hi When you use plotmissing colors associated with good bad OK remove changed regarding the content of the data libraryDataExplorer df dataframex rnorm y rnorm z rnorm a rnorm b rnorm plotmissingdf good in red dfx NA dfz NA plotmissingdf good in red OK in blue dfa NA plotmissingdf good in green bad in red OK in an other blue It would be more understandable to have a fixed color code Thanks Hello First thank you for your awesome product I really appreciate the data exploration tool youve put together Im trying to figure out if certain functionality exists Im running DataExplorer v I have the following dataframe Classes tbldf tbl and dataframe obs of variables group Factor w levels amberblue essscore num rpcsqrpq num rpcsqrpq num rpcsqcognitive num rpcsqsomatic num rpcsqemotional num Id like to produce ess x rpcsq scatterplots scatterplots with the points colored by group Ive tried the following plotscatterplottmp by essscore This works but obviously doesnt color the points The following code however fails to produce the plots plotscatterplottmp by essscore geompointargs listcol group Error in grDevicescol rgbcolour TRUE invalid color name group plotscatterplottmp by essscore geompointargs listcol group Error in docallgeompoint geompointargs object group not found plotscatterplottmp by essscore geompointargs listgroup group col group Error in grDevicescol rgbcolour TRUE invalid color name group Does the functionality Im looking for exist in the current iteration of DataExplorer Thanks for any help you can be Discrete features with category Features with nearzero variance TBD Add this to introduce plotintro or create a new function When data gets too messy JS charts will be easier to view I want to add colors to graphs generated by DataExplorer and Im particularly into the viridis palettes Is there any way for me to add them Thank you For datasets with many features multiple pages are returned When visualizing in presentation format it would be neat to be able to plot page by page to fit the slides Currently one needs to subset the dataframe by hand eg data and data
