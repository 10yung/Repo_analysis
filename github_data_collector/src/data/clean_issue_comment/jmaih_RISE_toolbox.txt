Dear Maih I have learned your RISE for a long time now I am confused with some fundamental issues I searched a lot but still havent solved I want to estimate the correlation between two shocksepsaepsb and I want to set the scale of shocks I wanna know how to define them in the rs file Are the command mestimatem based on Maximum likelihood estimation While command Resultsmhsamplerobjectivelbubmcmcoptionsx SIG depends on Bayesian estimation If I wanna do some further analysis based on Bayesian estimation should I create an new object newm after I get the Results of MCMC sampling and then just run irfsirfnewm histdechistoricaldecompositionnewm But how to create the new object newm I dont know whether these thoughts can be done in RISE Could you help me Thanks in advance Best Kairey Dear Junior When I run the Metropolis hastings algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution I found that stderr of shocks are very large most of them are bigger than The range of prior distribution is I want to know what is the most likely cause Many thanks Best Chen Hello Junior Im running a loop that estimates the same model several times just to check whether my estimation results can be replicated I have found that sometimes the optimizerbeegate reports the following I think this is due to the optimizer having difficulty finding the local maximum I know that the max iteration can be adjusted by the option MaxIter Is there a way to report the number of iterations done by the optimizer during the estimation process and save it in the Matlab workspace Also if the optimizer stops due to the number of iterations reaching some upper bound will RISE report some results based on the incorrect solution from the optimizer Best regards Tony Hi Junior After estimating a DSGE model multiple times I found out that the estimation results can vary significantly after each estimation even though it is always the same model with the same priors I have posted two estimation results below both of which are estimated from the same model Im not exactly certain what I can do to improve the consistency of my estimation Is this a sign of not enough observations in my data Thank you in advance Best Tony Result MODEL ESTIMATION RESULTS distribution initval mode modestd tau BETA kappa GAMMA alpha BETA rss BETA rhoq BETA rhoystar BETA rhoPaistar BETA rhoz BETA

However when I then try to run some IR with myirfsirfmirfregimespecifictrue irfperiods I get the following error message Error using genericirf model cannot be solved Error in genericirf Error in genericirf Error in dsgeirf Error in driverAQnophi line myirfsirfmirfregimespecifictrue irfperiods Where could this be coming from Why can the model be solved but no IRFs can be computed Thanks in advance Best Johanna Dear Maih I am actually I interesting on the representation of a MSDSGE as a VAR In doing so I basically need the A and the B matrix xt Axt B epsilont As you suggested such information can be obtained in the field Tz but it is not a nnr matrix nnumber of variablesr number of regimes but nnkr What about the missing k elements And what about the B matrix Can you give me some more information Thank you in advance Hi Junior Hope everything goes well I am trying to introduce switching volatility into the example in RISEtoolbox examples StochasticReplanning Estimationexamples usmodelsrswitchrs The model was rised without any errors However when running the estimate command I got the following errors Error using regexprep Evaluation of converttheguy
