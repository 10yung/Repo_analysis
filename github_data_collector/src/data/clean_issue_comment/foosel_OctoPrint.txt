 What were you doing Trying to install a plugin from the Plugin Manager in OctoPrint running in Python under Windows Additional discussion on the forum here What did you expect to happen The plugin to install What happened instead An error is reported Could not parse output from pip see pluginpluginmanagerconsolelog for generated output Did the same happen when running OctoPrint in safe mode NA Version of OctoPrint rc Operating System running OctoPrint Windows Running Python Printer model used firmware incl version NA Browser and version of browser operating system running browser Chrome Version Official Build bit Link to octoprintlog octoprint log pluginpluginmanagerconsole log Link to contents of terminal tab or seriallog NA Link to contents of Javascript console in the browser NA Screenshotsvideos showing the problem NA I have read the FAQ Not a huge issue and probably part of the new permissions system but I often find Ive been logged out I checked the Remember me button but its seeming like my sessions only last about a day or so Ive clicked through the options to see if there is an autotimeout configured anywhere and dont see anything like that I have created a second user to test the access permissions dont know if that might trigger an autologout or if maybe the issue is possibly something on my browser Chrome running at latest version on mac If there is some sort of new autologout feature Id suggest having the ability to disable that especially for singleuser setups Im guessing many installs are a simple athome setup like mine and most folks arent going to want to login repeatedly Originally posted by ChrisHeerschap in Lantoit thanks for testing Attachments in emails dont come across in github issues so I cannot see the images but the text says enough I think this is a sideeffect of the granular permission system but lets see what foosel has to say about this when she is back Edit Confirmed with curl ie no API key or other headers specified no clientside cache that RC returns the full settings dict and returns a Forbidden error Originally posted by fieldOfView in What were you doing Deleting gcode file via API Get files in location What did you expect to happen The deleted file should have been disappeared What happened instead The deleted file was still there after deleting some files Deleting got me a status No Content deleting again Not found However it is still there when querying with GET apifiles Did the same happen when running OctoPrint in safe mode Yes Version of OctoPrint Operating System running OctoPrint OctoPi Link to octoprintlog Unfortunately the logs are outdated The last ones are from Update My datetime on the raspberry was configured wrong Here is a link to the log file I have read the FAQ Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Using Octoprint with a mobile browser has the URL bar and such at the top obscuring the view and it is also just another tab But it could be better Describe the solution youd like Adding a Web App Manifest that includes display standalone will allow Android Chrome at least to properly utilize the Add to Homescreen functionality which will create an app shortcut that will then launch Octoprint in a completely UIless browser window mimicking a native app As a bonus it will register itself to the appswitcher too Something like this works link relmanifest href urlforstatic filenamemanifestjson name OctoPrint icons src staticimgappletouchicon x png type imagepng sizes x starturl backgroundcolor display standalone orientation landscape The background colour is nonnegotiable any app that starts with a blinding white splash screen should be destroyed and the devs burned at the stake Additional context Without the manifest just a browser tab ScreenshotChrome With the manifest after using the Add to Homescreen in Chrome ScreenshotChrome The splashscreen ScreenshotChrome Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe OctoPrint introduces granular permissions The PRINT permission logically includes the FILESSELECT permission how else would OctoPrint know what file to print The FILESSELECT permission logically includes the FILESLIST permission how else would the user be able to select an existing file Thus any user who can start a print automatically can also see all gcode files As an application developer using the API key I may want to allow users to start a print they just uploaded through my application but restrict their access to a list of other files already on the OctoPrint instance In other words I want users to be able to PRINT without the FILESLIST permission Describe the solution youd like I think I would like the FILESSELECT permission to not automatically inherit the FILESLIST This might be a little strange from the perspective of the OctoPrint web interface because how do you select a file if you cannot see the available files but from the standpoint of an application that uploads a gcode file it is not necessary to be able to list all files if the application knows what file it just uploaded Describe alternatives youve considered The only alternative I can think of is to life with a PRINT permission that also includes a FILELIST permission making the permission system less granular Additional context Eventually a solution where a user can optionally only list and start pause cancel her own gcode files would be great but that is a bigger change for a future version of OctoPrint Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe OctoPrint introduces granular permissions Given a limited list of permissions available for the user accessing OctoPrint through the API an application may want to disable parts of its UI eg disable the jog controls if the PermissionsCONTROL permission is not granted for the user Currently there is no way for an application to query the user andor permissions that are granted to the user accessing the API It is possible to query this information if the user name is known but if an application is only given an appkey to work with there is no way for the application to know the user name associated with the appkey Describe the solution youd like An API endpoint to list the available permissions eg apiaccesspermissionsavailable This would return either a subset of apiaccesspermissions with all the metadata for each permission or only a list of permission keys An alternative that would have other benefits is some way to find out the username that is associated with the provided key which could then be used with the apiaccessusers username endpoint It could also be an option to allow the API key as an argument in apiaccessusers username or API key Describe alternatives youve considered The current alternative is for the application just to try and respond if a permission denied error is returned by OctoPrint and ask the user for forgiveness Additional context I can do the work adding the API endpoints if we can come up with what would be the most optimal solution Thank you for your interest into contributing to OctoPrint its highly appreciated Please make sure you have read the guidelines for contributing as linked just above this form theres a section on Pull Requests in there as well that contains important information As a summary please make sure you have ticked all points on this checklist x Your changes are not possible to do through a plugin and relevant to a large audience ideally all users of OctoPrint x If your changes are large or otherwise disruptive You have made sure your changes dont interfere with current development by talking it through with the maintainers eg through a Brainstorming ticket x Your PR targets OctoPrints devel branch if its a completely new feature or maintenance if its a bug fix or improvement of existing functionality for the current stable version no PRs against master or anything else please x Your PR was opened from a custom branch on your repository no PRs from your version of master maintenance or devel please eg devmynewfeature or fixmybugfix x Your PR only contains relevant changes no unrelated files no dead code ideally only one commit rebase and squash your PR if necessary x Your changes follow the existing coding style x If your changes include style sheets You have modified the less source files not the css files those are generated with lessc x You have tested your changes please state how ideally you have added unit tests x You have run the existing unit tests against your changes and nothing broke x You have added yourself to the AUTHORSmd file Describe your PR further using the template provided below The more details the better What does this PR do and why is it necessary This PR causes the Backup plugins restore process to preserve the modified times of the restored filesdirectories This is useful as the timestamp is used for things such as sorting file uploads The restore uses Pythons unzipextract which updates the extracted filedirectory modified time As the zip contains the original files metadata it can be read for each entry and then written on the filedirectory after extraction How was it tested How can it be tested by the reviewer The change was tested by restoring a variety of backups and confirming that their access and modified time matched the metadata withing the backup zip Any background context you want to provide What are the relevant tickets if any Screenshots if appropriate Further notes Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I want to backup my octoprint instance via CLI with the packaged backup plugin and a cron script but I cant change the path where the backup is stored This makes further processing difficult and dangerous as I dont want to access the whole octoprint folder from the backup script Describe the solution youd like I would like the plugin to take a path similar to the restore functionality Making this path optional wont introduce breaking changes This would result in octoprint plugins backupbackup OPTIONS PATH Describe alternatives youve considered Add the default path to the FoldersEntry of the web interface This wont help for a fully CLIdriven setup but its the best alternative I can think of Most computer displays nowadays are s vanished Octoprints UI however mostly shows layout The most anoying result of that is that the file upload button and the file selector dialog is out of reach when using the rest of the UI Please use the full available screen realestate for octoprint
