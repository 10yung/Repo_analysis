As we already have a library for the user to generate kotlin data class codes instead of only have to use the IDE plugin Now wed better provide a sample project to show users how to use the library easily Here some required points The sample project should be contained in this project for easy maintains The sample project could write in Kotlin as this library always for Kotlin programmer Add the compile build script into CICDTravis to ensure the Environment of sample project always works fine Demo code at least show the user the basic function of the libraryAll library options are default PR regarding Fix Ive tried using the Library version but i cant get it to properly import or build First I tried importing the distributed jar file that you have in the repository but that does not seem to work for neither intellij nor maven Building the jar myself solved the import problems in intellij However when calling JsonToKotlinBuilder i get the following error javalangNoClassDefFoundError wusealjsontokotlintestTestConfig Im not that familiar with gradle myself but it seems that the library does not include the required packages from the parent project Any hints on how to proceed data classes provides hashCode equals toString componentN and copy All these functions are not necessary to a DTO and thus data modifier must be optional As shown above Optional may need to be removed My dockerconfigjson looks similar to this auths containersexampleio auth ZXhhbXBsZQo HttpHeaders UserAgent DockerClient darwin credsStore desktop but that gives me silly classes within auths like this data class DockerConfig val auths Auths val HttpHeaders HttpHeaders val credsStore String data class Auths val containersexampleio Containersexampleio val HttpsContainersexampleio class Containersexampleio data class HttpsContainersexampleio val auth String data class HttpHeaders val UserAgent String How would you suggest making data classes that properly parses different keys within auths I guess preferrabbly it should be a MapString Auth of some sort The same thing applies to HttpHeaders MapString String I usually use comfasterxmljacksonmodulekotlinjacksonObjectMapper to parse my json files Error JSON json Im outside Im here I cant find your house Im coming Be there soon
