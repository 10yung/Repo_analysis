When attempting to use these were the fixes I made in order to get the app to run on macOS Sierra I didnt test on windows or linux I dont have either machine handy but since Im not changing any functionality Im pretty sure both should still work Also a really neat way to kick off the project node e consolelogrequireelectron Im confused is this an Electron UI for Neovim or a way to integrate Neovim into Atom I mean I know Atom uses Electron but that is not the same thing Would be super nice if you could make command send ctrl key in OS X so its easy to use command key as ctrl key similar to the popular iTerm app for OS X So we can do sh npm install g neovime claim on npmjscom before someone else nvime somefiletoeditjs or similar Is it possible to change the line height Im running on Windows with HEAD of electron and neovime To reproduce Open neovime press CwCs observe that neovime has crashed the error message I get is this ERRORipcchannelwincc pipe error Not very specific sorry I confirmed that the js is sending command keyboard events to neovim but apparently neovim doesnt respond at all to them What is going on inside of neovim Attempting to use cw for window commands closes the Neovime window in Linux similar to web browsers I took a look at uicoffee and it seems like supporting ligatures would be within reach Ligatures are great because modern programming fonts are beginning to include support for awesome symbols for functional languages etc For example see It looks like the canvas drawText API that youre using supports ligatures but it merely requires that you draw the twothree characters in one call to drawText I saw that neovime draws one character at a time however Should there be some intermediate representation that neovime keeps track of instead of just executing raw single character drawput commands Could neovime maintain an up to date representation of the entire screen so that when anything changes something like a mini react can find the characters that are likely dirty and draw only those lines and the entire lines so that ligatures will render correctly Have you noticed this When the popup menu refreshes while typing it flickers subtly
