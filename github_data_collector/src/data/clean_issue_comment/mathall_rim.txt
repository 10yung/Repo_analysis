Any plans on implementing Neovims msgpack interface It would be quite interesting to have plugins that are compatible with both Rim and Neovim If you open a file which your user has read permission but no write permission and then try to save it w rim exists with code and no explanation I think rim should show a message to the user and should not exit when failing to write in file In the case of vim theres a line at the bottom thats reserved for showing warnings and erros as well as the vim prompt I think Id be nice for rim to have this message bar as well What do you think
