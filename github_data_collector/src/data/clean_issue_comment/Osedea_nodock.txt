Some confusing behavior After dockercompose up d command all files and folders became with owner and group nobody How can we run the project with nodemon so we do not have to restart the containers for small changes or fixes in files I want to run the node app with PM Advanced production process manager for Nodejs for production use can we have some optional entry point for this type of situation Or is there any method I can add to use PM It will be better to add phpmyadmin contatiner to this setup When I ran the instruction dockercompose up d mongo node nginx nginx and node are working properly but mongodb container is automatically shutting down I tried disabling the firewall of my digital ocean droplet when I tried to inspect inside rootnodockdatalogsnginxerrorlog all I can see on the error logs is as below error connect failed No route to host while connecting to upstream client my computers ip server request GET HTTP upstream host my digital ocean serversdroplets

configuration of certbot container running with node Thanks a lot As showed we should have clear instructions as to how to add a frontend application inside our NoDock environment This should make it easier to customize nodock without editing the dockercomposeyml file
