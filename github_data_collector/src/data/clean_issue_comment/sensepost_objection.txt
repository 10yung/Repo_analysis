avoid a specific version requirement unless it is absolutely necessary Describe the bug After successfully patching an apk file to include the frida gadget once installed on the device I get an error message through logcat DApkSoSource not allowing consideration of libarm v alibfridagadgetso deferring to libdir I decompiled the patched apk and the frida gadget shared library is in the libs folder under the target architecture so its definitely there I also just copied the so file to all other subfolders just to be sure but I had the same error To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Run

request related to a problem Please describe iOS app can use app groups for sharing data between the main app and extensions like the share extension If an app uses an app group all the data shared via that app group is stored in a separate folder privatevarmobileContainersSharedAppGroupSomeOtherGUIDNotTheAppGuid When I run env for an iOS app it does not list app group directories used by the app Describe the solution youd like The solution would be to detect app group directories and list them when using env Describe alternatives youve considered An alternative is using tools like cda
