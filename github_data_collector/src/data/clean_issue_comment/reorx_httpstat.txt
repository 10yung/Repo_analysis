Add extrasrequire sysplatformwin colorama in setuppy in code add part I am a user of httpstat and I used httpstat as an example to show how to package software as snaps To make a snap for a software package you need to create a snapcraftyaml configuration file Here is the one for httpstat How to create the snap Install snapcraft default in Ubuntu or newer Run snapcraft in the same directory that has the snapcraftyaml from the gist The httpstat amd snap will be produced I wrote an article about all this at I understand that someone would simply need to grab the py file and run it I am posting this issue to inform that I have used httpstat as an example for my tutorial This would be super useful to have for learning more about the certificate a particular site uses It could be an addon option not default which shows issuer information if its valid startexpire and possibly other details Just an idea This PR is aimed at solving any problems that would happen when running httpstat on windows Installed via PIP on two separate computers running Windows with Python and Python and attempted httpstat googlecom in the command line and received failed to create process Navigated directly in the command line to the default Python scripts folder and ran py httpstatscriptpy googlecom and received the following on both machines Traceback most recent call last File httpstatscriptpy line in module loadentrypointhttpstat consolescripts httpstat File c users NAME appdata local programs python python lib sitepackages httpstatpy line in main p subprocessPopencmd stdoutsubprocessPIPE stderrsubprocessPIPE envcmdenv File c users NAME appdata local programs python python lib subprocesspy line in init restoresignals startnewsession File c users NAME appdata local programs python python lib subprocesspy line in executechild startupinfo FileNotFoundError WinError The system cannot find the file specified Ran repair on my Python installation and retried Uninstalled and reinstalled Python using elevated privileges and retried No positive effect An attempt on a third Win computer with both Python and Python installed worked without issue Installed via PIP and httpstat googlecom ran correctly Running the script directly on that machine with either version of Python also works without issue The following changes are done to append the redirect urls stats to the output x Added a new L option analogous to the curl L option to follow redirects and print the stats x Changed the code formatting and created new functions runcommand printstats and runcommandandprintstats x Appended keys httpcode and redirectcurl to the curl format x Added a while loop to print the stats if follow redirects L option is used Sample output HTTP Found CacheControl private ContentType texthtml charsetUTF Location ContentLength Date Mon Oct GMT Body stored in tmptmpWV fJm DNS Lookup TCP Connection Server Processing Content Transfer ms ms ms ms namelookup ms connect ms starttransfer ms total ms HTTP OK Date Mon Oct GMT Expires CacheControl private maxage ContentType texthtml charsetISO P P CPThis is not a P P policy See for more info Server gws XXSSProtection modeblock XFrameOptions SAMEORIGIN SetCookie NID KaRf ZB GmdE rn GjaGNDxO qL KPYZfQbNpgHns wbhBMXw wwioSN tf RdRFEcvFFqZdEsn M IqV Ds fF Z j wgmAy yqRlGwVj ymZPppIGTw Rx expiresTue Apr GMT path domaingooglecoin HttpOnly AcceptRanges none Vary AcceptEncoding XCache MISS from localhost XCacheLookup MISS from localhost Via localhost squid Connection close Body stored in tmptmpWV fJm DNS Lookup TCP Connection Server Processing Content Transfer ms ms ms ms namelookup ms connect ms starttransfer ms total ms Windows bit Python bit C Users xmr Desktopcurl version curl x pcwin libcurl OpenSSL h zlib WinIDN libssh nghttp Protocols dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap ldaps pop pop s rtsp scp sftp smtp smtps telnet tftp Features AsynchDNS IDN IPv Largefile SSPI Kerberos SPNEGO NTLM SSL libz TLSSRP HTTP C Users xmr Desktophttpstat googlecom m m mCould not decode json Expecting property name line column char m curl result m timenamelookup timeconnect timeappconnect timepretransfer timeredirect timestarttransfer timetotal speeddownload speedupload m m m
