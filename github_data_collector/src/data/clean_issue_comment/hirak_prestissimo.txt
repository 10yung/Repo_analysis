Security Alerts page details Is there a possibility to install dependencies parallel from vcs like git I have like dependencies and they are definitely not installed asyncparallel and it is quite slow This may or may not be an actual issue But composer now comes with a nocache global option which I tried to use for installing prestissimo in docker so that I dont have to call composer clearcache afterwards I understand the are different but I thought perhaps prestissimo wont do anything yet when its first installed excuse my lack of understanding of how composer plugins work composer global

Then trying to install any package with the nocache option produces the same error which kind of makes sense as prestissimo relies on a cache directory I guess a more friendly behavior is to fall back to normal composer if cache is disabled But its not a biggie The question is whether the cache directory is a hard requirement for installing prestissimo for the first time Disables the plugin when help is requested via the help command or the help option
