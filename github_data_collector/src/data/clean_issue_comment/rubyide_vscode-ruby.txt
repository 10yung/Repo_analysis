a Security The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

first in red but assumes the second one is part of whatever comes after This doesnt seem like the clearest highlighting Heres an example of how it looks for me Example in VS Code Currently the language server etc whitelists specific environment variables This list does not include environment variables used to override rbenv or asdf For instance the asdf directory for shims can be moved with ASDFDATADIR However since this variable is not inherited from the users shell it wont work correctly Same goes for rbenv with RBENVROOT etc These changes whitelist these variables so no further
