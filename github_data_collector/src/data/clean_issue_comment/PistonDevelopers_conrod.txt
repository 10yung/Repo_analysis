querying the state of redraw count Fixes Adding Rendy as a backend for Conrod It would be useful to allow applications to query if drawifchanged would return Some to allow integration with winits request redraw function For some applications this allows a blocking event loop rather than continuous polling more effectively I just realized that conrod had been moved to conrodcore after spending too much time trying to debug a compatibility issue It would be nice if this could be avoided for future users by updating the crate docs for conrod and perhaps with a compilewarning It is very good for me if conrodglium uses latest glium and winit in my use case This PR updates glium and winit to the latest version Ive updated helloworldrs example only but Ill update other examples if this PR is OK Im trying to learn Conrod and I though I would vist to find some examples When I clicked to top link that said Conrod it gave I am writing a book on Rust Surveying indicates GUI related materials are the most in demand I realize you are doing fantastic work however I would enjoy to be able to show more sleek looking widgets and the like Is it possible to work with you to implement some range of basic widgets and to help pay for the graphic design work to give a modern professional looking set of UI elements to the Rust community even if it is just a collection of buttons text input boxes and the like I may be able to contribute like hours of coding and upon double checking my financial situation but am only going to think more about it if I know that you are likely to incorporate the skins I pay for and to perhaps work with me toward ensuring a basic collection of widgets like check boxes radio boxes and the like Ultimately I would like to work with you to skin all piston widgets with professional UI elements that will be provided with a very friendly license like MIT or something that we agree on with the hope that you will make these the default widget skins moreover I would like to contribute some specific widgets and to request a couple be implemented as well and to sort of collaborate together for a brief period of time perhaps two weeks or so just toward making things a bit sleek and modern looking and adding some additional widget functionality to try to get a baseline collection of standard GUI feature set that looks a little aesthetically pleasing and modern I would want to be able to demonstrate all pertinent code that I write in my commercial book and any related code of yours that I am integrating it into as well as to be able to use the resultant code I write and widgets I write to commercial ends while not restricting the ability of others to do so as well not certain your license regarding the products produced by your toolkit Im trying to set the background of the listselect example to a transparent color On lines I have widgetCanvasnew colorconrodcorecolorTRANSPARENT setidscanvas ui The background remains opaque however What is the correct way for setting the background alpha
