Hi Bhaskar and gang It would be extremely useful to have the SelectAreaFeature plugin working with Leaflet for R I created a Stackoverflow question before I knew leafletextras existed Id be happy to give an even bigger SO bounty if required This feature would be useful for any user looking to select multiple markers or polygons at once by intuitively drawing the region from which youd like to select SelectAreaFeature JS demo here By using the addDrawToolbar in shiny modules on different tabs the following Javascript error comes up in the console TypeError t is undefined leafletjs To trigger the error start the app go to Tab mod and back to mod and click on the map Every interaction with the map will cause another console error details summaryshinyAppsummary libs data libraryshiny librarysf libraryleaflet libraryleafletextras drawtoolbar TRUE sfdata sfstassfbreweries coordscoordinates modules mod ui functionid label value ns NSid tabPanellabel value value leafletOutputnsmap mod server functioninput output session parentsession navid outputmap renderLeaflet reqparentsessioninputnavbarid navid p leaflet addTiles if drawtoolbar p p addDrawToolbarpositiontopright targetGroup Sel p ui ui navbarPageid navbarid title DEMO selected mod uimod mod mod uimod mod server server functioninput output session callModulemod server mod parentsession session navid callModulemod server mod parentsession session navid Run App shinyAppui server details Interestingly the error disappears when the following line in renderLeaflet is removed reqparentsessioninputnavbarid navid Adding the ability to have a layer that gives uses drive times can help with maps where we need to determine the driving time a patient would take to come to various hospital settings There already is a leaflet js library for it would love to include a plotlyjs within a popup Im trying to work with leafletvelocity plugin Does anyone know how to do it or have a working example Hi everyone is it possible to change the displayed text of the tools of the draw tool bar leaflet map in a Shiny application tools I would like to display Finish Delete last point etc in another language ie in french I saw it can be done with LdrawLocal from Leafletdraw see here and here but I dont understand if I can do it in my R code Thanks a lot It would be wonderful if it was easy to replicate the example from gisminister linked below but also specify colors to the piecharts via either a pal function a vector of colors or a dataframe of keyvalue stores Leaflet Pie Chart Markers Example Likewise it would be wonderful to also have bar charts as shown in leafletminicharts Example here Im trying to edit the layer in this map but it keeps crashing my computer when I select it All the other toolbar functionalities seem to work fine Whats happening librarysf libraryleaflet libraryleafletextras librarysp libraryrmapshaper librarydplyr librarytigris libraryrbgm nevada votingdistrictsnevada nevada rmapshapermssimplifynevada leaflet addTiles addPolygonsdata nevada group model addDrawToolbartargetGroup model editOptions editToolbarOptions selectedPathOptions selectedPathOptions addLayersControloverlayGroups cmodel options layersControlOptionscollapsedFALSE addStyleEditor It would be great to be able to change the search marker which is right now a circle marker to say a regular marker or even just a dot If theres a way for me to do this manually please let me know Hi A while ago I created a forked version of Leaflet to include a plugin that I was interested in plugin forked Leaflet I was hoping I could add it to leafletextras or perhaps as a different package The main issue is that as it is right now it modifies de the function addPolyline Id appreciate some pointers on the best way to do this Best Fernando
