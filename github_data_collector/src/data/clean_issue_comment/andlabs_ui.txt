Hi I want to do pagnation for big text so I need to calculate the input text size Thanks Hi I love this project since it provides native UI outlook My question is when I make up a window based on it I could resize it by dragging it edges and then the layout inside the window is shifted which looks ugly How could I prevent this I check the ui and libui header files and repository issues there is no answer Thanks PS Is there any confirmation message box widget which has two buttons YES or NO On Windows if MouseEvent has been called for an Areas AreaHandler for example by clicking on it no more calls to the handlers MouseCrossed function will happen anymore ever This does not happen on Kubuntu where MouseCrossed still gets called when moving the mouse over the area when I insert one line with rownum the table auto insert next line Im pretty sure the underlying code for these dialogs already support this I know GTK supports these options For OpenFile adding file suffixes to filter on would be helpful For SaveFile adding a string that appends a specific suffix to the filename would be helpful andlabsui style F B CFE C D F F like delphi style style When there are enough tabs want to display multiple lines thx In one application we report some sort of progress in the title bar so the user can see progress even when the application is minimized eg My Application or such Obviously one should not needlessly spam the OS with UI updates Still we were dumbfounded to find that Kubuntu could be made to lock up almost entirely by calling SetTitle times per second While all applications are still responsive clicking anywhere on the Desktop is unresponsive Also the taskbar would lock up while trying to render an animation of the tab of the application appearing and take multiple seconds to settle in This happens on Kubuntu We worked around the issue by reducing the update rate to Hz window uiNewWindowtitle true I want to create menu but I dont know how to do it generate runtime error my partial code appmainWindow uiNewWindowgetAppTitle false appmainWindowSetMarginedfalse appmainWindowOnClosingfuncuiWindow bool apphideMainWindow return false grid uiNewGrid gridSetPaddedtrue appmainWindowSetChildgrid appmainWindowSetMarginedtrue tab uiNewTab gridAppendtab true uiAlignFill true uiAlignFill tabAppendStatus appmakeStatusPage tabSetMargined true debug error dlv debug UsersantwalProjectscncrev ld warning object file varfolderst b xtsj q qcnbwcpcxwc gnTgolink o was built for newer OSX version than being linked ld warning object file varfolderst b xtsj q qcnbwcpcxwc gnTgolink o was built for newer OSX version than being linked Type help for list of commands dlv break makeMainWindow Breakpoint set at x cb for mainAppGUImakeMainWindow guigo dlv c errNear line last key parsed Ports strings cannot contain newlines mainAppGUImakeMainWindow guigo hits goroutine total PC x cb func app AppGUI onSystrayExit appCloseMainWindowfalse func app AppGUI makeMainWindow appmainWindow uiNewWindowgetAppTitle false appmainWindowSetMarginedfalse appmainWindowOnClosingfuncuiWindow bool apphideMainWindow return false dlv dlv n mainAppGUImakeMainWindow guigo PC x appmainWindowSetChildgrid appmainWindowSetMarginedtrue tab uiNewTab gridAppendtab true uiAlignFill true uiAlignFill tabAppendStatus appmakeStatusPage tabSetMargined true tabAppendSensors appmakeSensorsPage tabSetMargined true dlv n Stopped at x fffd a no source available Command failed bad access debug detail link here how can resolve thanks Hello Ive been using for a while but moving to this system and its great The one thing Im missing is making a textfield have the blinking cursor with a request focus call I was thinking about using To simulate a mouse click inside the textfield Is this a bad idea
