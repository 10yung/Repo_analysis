unable to execute swig No such file or directory error command swig failed with exit status Ive tried to install and reinstall swig nothing Please help ENV linux mint gcc swig python Remove warning No models better than random using Dummy Score since this error message seems to be very confusing fix Im confused with below outputs where trainin score is around and testing score is around But Dont see or is the showmodels output what is the first value in automlshowmodels out put What is this value it is accuracy of the model SimpleRegressionPipelinecategoricalencodingchoice onehotencoding

targettype regression signed False i want to know whether autosklearn support multilabel task thank you Good evening I have used AutoSklearn for a binary classification of tabular data and got as best validation score When I read cvresults there are numerous pipelines that indeed have given such a score However when I explicitely implement one of them with scikitlearn say passiveaggressive with the same parameters as in CVresults and train it I get only Why Is there something I do no get with those Best validation score and Mean score It is very important There is almost monthes of work at stake Thank you Hi Thanks for developing and helping maintain this package I am developing a text classifier and will like to translate the best ensemble model to sklearn model to allow for further processing such as to run LIME TextExplainer to explore the important feature I am unable to do so with the autosklearn Here is my model load Pkgs import pandas as pd import numpy as np from

False targettype classification signed False Thanks a lot See here Dear all When working with autosklearn I run into the following problem When running autosklearnfit I want to pickleload all models which have automatically been pickled by autosklearn model and use them to predict on a given dataset for this I have an observer who observes the directory into which autosklearn automatically stores pickled models as soon as a new model is pickled it pickleloads this model and runs modelpredictX But this then throws an error see below and crashed if I after I pickleload the model run modelfitXtrain ytrain the error no longer appears this makes me think that for some reason the model is not fitted before being pickled which is actually not the case when reading autosklearn documentation Has anybody encountered this problem yet If so what is the reason and is there a workaround I use autosklearn version and tried it with scikit learn and type of model class

Im working on a project that needs me to pass a mask of label into the scorer For example if y is a vector then I will have a boolean mask with the same size After passing this mask I found that the resampling strategy used holdout set then this mask wont be able to match with the original vector size Im just wondering how can I fix this Also if someone can point out which part of code does the splitting it would be definitely helpful Thanks PR implements data preprocessing of categorical and numerical features as two parallel pipelines each with its own independent hyperparameters Ideally if the dataset is made just of features of the same kind then just the hyperparameters of the corresponding pipeline should be considered for optimization Nevertheless this is not the current behavior At the moment the hyperparameters of both pipelines remain active regardless of the dataset
