See comment Hi Ive just tried running guwho against a test organisation both through and through a test instance I spun up myself on Heroku and both error when trying to audit that organisation URL despite the app being granted the correct permissions whether when using a pregenerated access token or using GitHub login The error page says This exception has been logged with id o gn or similar the ID is different every time Do you have any suggestions for what I might do to resolve this There should be logic that requires the sponsor username to be different than the sponsored username You shouldnt be able to sponsor yourself It seems like they are not validated What happened was the member was flagged as having all issues the member has addressed fa and full name the member was changed to outside collaborator and added to userstxt at the same time after running guwho the issue was not closed The comment was added Removing from organisation These were the outstanding requirements In my case the app always times out with this message on the page Application Error An error occurred in the application and your page could not be served Please try again in a few moments If you are the application owner check your logs for details The logs are ok the actual audit is successful and all the issues are createdupdated The timeout is sec and according to docs it is not configurable The solution is to serve page first and then dynamically serve results Or at least start sending the static page heading and once the results are ready finish sending the page it would increase the timeout by sec I ran this against my organization thinking it would be awesome It was It sent out hundreds of emails to our users sometimes multiple depending upon if they setup bots which means that now everyone is upset at me We should instead have a big shiny warning if the file doesnt exist fail if the person authenticating isnt on that list they should be fail if the list of users in the userstxt doesnt match at least some percentage of users in the org straightupbomb out if an env var doesnt exist to override the above We are planning to use this F and even though weve done some testing in a sandbox organization it would be nice to see what the bot would do against our real org Would be great to have a testnoop option where it for example prints out all of the issues it would file and the users it would kick out without actually doing so Ive never done any Scala but could possibly hack on this a bit if theres interest cc jgrevich Took a bit of digging to find the grace period in the codea few ideas in order of importance Mention the amount of time in the README Make the amount of time configurable Make different grace periods for the different infractions In other words not having FA enabled is a security issue whereas not having a full name isnt a huge deal Totally understand if you want to keep things simple and not do this one Thanks cc jgrevich
