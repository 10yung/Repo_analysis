Hello I shortened the wordlist to k subdomains and run the script again at threads and still minutes and keeps going that means that if i try the main wordlist of k subdomains it would take hours Is there any way to speed up this what about the resolverstxt can i update it somehow what type of resolvers and where should i look for them a well organized and correct documentation helps a lot Traceback most recent call last File subbrutepy line in run killprocpid verifynameserversprocpid AttributeError verifynameservers object has no attribute pid During handling of the above exception another exception occurred Traceback most recent call last File subbrutepy line in module printtargettarget recordtype optionssubs optionsresolv output File subbrutepy line in printtarget for result in runtarget querytype subdomains resolvelist File subbrutepy line in run verifynameserversprocend AttributeError verifynameservers object has no attribute end Im getting this on python while running python subbrutepy t xtxt out on carnegiescienceedu or when it was transitioning to wwwteslacom Script was ran on Win Ultimate SP and it was his st or nd line Is a still supported I have used this to list IPs and domain names p works a bit differently and gives more info but I am wondering whats up with the a option or how to use it properly So how does subbrute work exactly Does it just check every value in the wordlist How does it deal with wildcards I seem to be getting a lot of false positives just picked my own sitethat has only one subdomain and this tool finds subdomains none of them have an IP assigned how did these subdomain exist in the first place or is it a false warning from subbrute Typically the most common way to install Python Packages is through the Python Package Index To make installation easier I would like to see subbrute mirrored on the Python Package Index This would allow easy installation through a single command pip install subbrite When using fierce to enumerate subdomains we are presented with the corresponding IP addresses as the results roll in and at the end the subnets where hostnames were found Like this livegithubcom livegithubcom ns githubcom ns githubcom Subnets found may want to probe here using nmap or unicornscan hostnames found hostnames found This would be extremely useful in subbrute as well Removed extra for in readme
