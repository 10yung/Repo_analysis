 Any fix for this issue I have own implementation for CIE and CIE For samples it take times than CIE in my computer Does CIE is expensive calculation I am not sure that i make correctly or not Plz someone comment this issue Im using your code in my Swift app and it works fine in the simulator but when I try to run it on my Plus device it doesnt compile complaining that value of UIImage has no member dominantColors The weird thing is running your project as a standalone works fine on my device Xcode does see the DominantColor framework when I try to import it using import DominantColor so Im really at a lost Any clues Is there a way to know which pixel or area in the image corresponding to the dominant colors First of all Thank you for your nice work Awesome But in general case library users finally needs only color groups like primary secondary or backgroundoutbound colors Currently the result seems that in each items are pretty similar Also in this example I think first color is not dominant color it may be secondary or background with the last color Currently you did perform it by size like following Sort the clusters by size in descending order so that the most dominant colors come first clusterssortInPlace size size Are you have some plans to improve Or please let me know some hints or important parts of your lib Thanks That will be amazing Kmeans RGB LAB CIE Complete tests with reference images Suggestion kmeans might be better than choosing all of the centroids randomly
