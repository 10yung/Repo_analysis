Valgrind reports that mSql and mpixperdb are used before initialization during Gqrx startup The mSql value is read prior to initialization if Gqrx is started without receiver sqllevel set in defaultconf and the mpixperdb value is read prior to initialization if a sqllevel value is present in defaultconf Ive fixed both errors by setting initial values in the CMeter constructor From time to time I run into a bug where the FFT panadapter does not display This appears to be the same issue described in I also frequently see participants run into this bug during Capture The Flag competitions involving SDR problems So far Ive been working around the bug by deleting configgqrxdefaultconf I dug into this to see what the problem was and found that the issue can be reliably produced by setting the FFT averaging to in configgqrxdefaultconf fft averaging If the value is different from the problem does not occur happens to be the default value of the averaging slider The bug occurs because MainWindowsetIqFftAvg is the only thing that sets dfftAvg And the only thing that calls MainWindowsetIqFftAvg is DockFftonfftAvgSlidervalueChanged So if Gqrx starts up without the value of the slider being changed then dfftAvg is left uninitialized resulting in undefined behaviour Valgrind reports hundreds of thousands of warnings in this case because the following line of code uses the uninitialized dfftAvg To fix the problem Ive set a default value of for dfftAvg which corresponds to the default slider value of which is defined here In addition i set the default value of the slider in dockfftui to match DEFAULTFFTAVG so that the slider is always updated when the config file has a nondefault value Since macOS banned the bit application Gqrx could not work Could you please build the application for macOS using bit A really useful addition to the remote control SetReset waterfall retention time span Export waterfall Reset waterfall For such a feature to be really nice some other waterfallexport fixes would be needed image full quality sec resolution even for multihours export For a Mhz bandwidth k fft that would be GB but its client responsibility to export flush before an OOM more precise X graduations and actually reaching the right border avoid Y time label overlapping on the waterfall Hi Im in the process to debug and develop an application based on gqrx source file as a benchmark using qt development ide Im already success compile all the dependencies required for gqrx Im also successfully compile gqrx application using qt ide without any error But the problem is when I run gqrx in the debug mode the system throw segmentation fault with the message Program received signal SIGSEGV Segmentation fault Below are my GDB traces GNU gdb Ubuntu ubuntu

from github and Im also compile it from source Hello there Ive spent my night trying to configure an rtltcp server on my Raspberry Pi and I heard that GQRX could connect to an rtltcp server just fine and listen to it from there but unfortunately whenever I attempt to start GQRX it refuses unless I have my device connected to it which ultimately defeats the purpose of the rtltcp server Heres the log whenever I try to start GQRX on my PC grosmosdr v gf d git gnuradio builtin source types rtl uhd hackrf bladerf rfspace airspy soapy redpitaya INFO UHD linux GNU C version Boost UHD unknown terminate called after throwing an instance of stdruntimeerror what No supported devices found check the connection andor udev rules Aborted core dumped The AppImage version of Gqrx crashes with This application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin xcb error printed on stdout This was already reported before as but got closed afterwards However the issue is still present By the way Gqrx also needs libnslso that is not bundled in the AppImage It would be great if the Gqrx AppImage had all the needed libraries included so it would work outofbox on most big distributions without the need to install any packages I am using fully updated Fedora Workstation with default set of packages Ok so I m running into an issue trying to get gqrx running properly I asked on the pi forums first but they couldn t find a solution for me so I ll try here next I ll copypaste the description I gave there I ve been running into an error with my new raspberry pi I m trying to use gqrx I installed it via the addremove software option since attempting too directly from the website the old way always gave me far more errors than this one ever since buster released So i get it installed and it seemed like it worked at firstproblem was there was no audio I tried to switch to the analog function since I m trying to run it through a Bluetooth speaker via its auxiliaryheadphone jack problem with that is as soon as i check the analog option it gets stuck at volume and soon as i try to raise the volume it immediately disables the analog AND hdmi options so neither is checked After this I just straight up reinstalled raspbian to see if maybe something some how got corrupted in the installhas happened before and figured no big deal since I didn t have anything else on the pi soon as I did this I d get the pulseaudio error mentioned in the title and gqrx won t start at all I then attempted something I read online about the error about completely uninstalling and reinstalling pulseaudio through terminal and after doing that it went right back to the other issue where the analog and hdmi would get stuck at volume and any attempts at increasing it would disable them When the issue with the volume being stuck on happens gqrx technically runs as in its picking up signals can change frequencies etc and I m sure if i just recorded and saved a session and played it back as a file it d probably work haven t tested this yet of course but when I get the pulseaudio error it just stops the program from even starting I ve already attempted both recommendations from two posters there neither recommendation helped one had me install Pavucontrol but it still wouldn t let me increase the volume on either the mm jack or hdmi disabling them once again as soon as I attempted to increase it The other had me do a fresh install of pulseaudio and then attempt puIseaudio D which didn t do anything also attempted to install gqrx the old way by navigating directly to the website downloading the files going through the readme text and copying udev rules to the gqrx folder etc that brings its own slew of issues however since it was setup for rasbian stretch or older and not buster it just completely terminates itself soon as it s started Also forgive me for the dumb question since I m still new to the pi and linux systems but is there a way to install gqrx without pulseaudio attached to it Since the analoghdmi volume works fine when gqrx and pulseaudio aren t installed Right now rxfftc throws samples as they come into the circular buffer even if no FFT is requested This affects the performance a bit noticeable especially at high sample rates I have modified the code to do the following Dont use a circular buffer and do no work if FFT points are not requested by other threads Skip one memory copy operation by throwing incoming samples directly on the FFT inbuf Calculate power spectrum using Volk optimized routines Shift the FFT points in rxfftc but not on the GR thread This has the effect of lowering the CPU time spent in these calculations highest effect on higher sample rates It requires linking directly agains libvolk but GNU radio already links it Sorry dont have the time to do a pull request but feel free to use the code from here if it suits you Inspired by something devnulling said on twitter a while ago this patch adds an implementation of Turbo An Improved Rainbow Colormap for Visualization turbo
