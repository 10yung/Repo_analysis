I have tried to modify the outputyml file like this download bookpdf PDF bookepub EPUB bookdocx Word booktxt TXT However when I render the gitbook version of the book I end up losing the new entries ie the docx and txt file in the html format It should create a download bookpdf bookepub bookdocx booktxt line in the indexhtml but it becomes download bookpdf bookepub so something appears to be hardcoded here Of course if I manually add the missing elements from the list the gitbook will look as expected but I am curious why this is lost in rendering Hi I love Bookdown and use it for basically all my teaching nowadays One feature that I would love to see but dont know enough about the R codebase to contribute frowning is a feature recently implemented in JupyterBook where you can run individual cells in a rendered HTML book It looks like this from their demo book Screenshot When you click the pencil icon you enter interactivity mode where you can run that particular cell and see the output below It does this by connecting to JupyterHub For a Bookdown implementation I would imagine that this might be achieved perhaps by using the holepunch R package which allows whole projects to be opened in JupyterHub This would be a more microscale so instead of rendering the whole book in JupyterHub I would want to the individual cells within my book to be runnable from the original page usually I build and host my books with GitLab pages but any CI applies By filing an issue to this repo I promise that X I have fully read the issue guide at X I have provided the

x I have learned the Github Markdown syntax and formatted my issue correctly I understand that my issue may be closed if I dont fulfill my promises In my Bookdown project I have both a bookdownpdfbook and a beamerpresentation specificed in the outputyml Why Here is an example and here is the explanation The problem is that pdfbook seems to respect the outputdir specified in bookdownyml but not the beamerpresentation Thus when hitting the Build Book button the presentation wont get into the docs directory itll appear in the base directory Is there any way to make beamerpresentation respect the outputdir specification Also itll mean that something has to be done with the filenames as by default the the names would be the same Posted in Stackoverflow here Please keep the below portion in your

understand that my issue may be closed if I dont fulfill my promises I know they were changed from links which did nothing to nonlinks in but I think that it would make sense for part headings in the navigation bar to link to whatever page is first in the part which they delineate The nonlink behaviour was bugging me in a project I have where a Part had no subdivisions it was a references section so you could not navigate to it directly unless I added a redundant H heading ie PART References References By filing an issue to this repo I promise that x I have fully read the issue guide at x I

have learned the Github Markdown syntax and formatted my issue correctly I understand that my issue may be closed if I dont fulfill my promises Request It would be nice to have an autolinking of functions used as inline and block code similar to what pkgdown does Luckily krlmlr found out that one can simply do r files dirbookdownbook pattern html fullnames TRUE purrrwalkfiles printsystemtimepkgdownautolinkhtmlx to get pkgdownlike autolinking of R code functions This is of course just an example and could be replaced by code with lesszero dependencies Some details to this If there is a pkgdown site available for pkgfun the link will point to the reference page of the pkgdown site Otherwise the link will point to rdocumentationorg Right now we achieve this by running the code above during the CI run However I think it would be nice to have this available as a builtin functionality for the gitbook format Maybe even with a toggable flag somewhere Example Have a look at the first instance of datatable in Others are also autolinked but using a nonconvenient hack from our side Just upgraded to latest bookdown and it feels substantially slower in the final step than the previous verison boyasaanuoThesiszip I am try to use my Universitys LaTeX template with bookdown I followed the discussions on stack overflow to compile my project but I get the error message LaTeX Error Missing begindocument Attached is my project file yihui Xie I filled my issue on stack overflow but the suggestions werent helpful to my issue Would be very much glad if I could be helped

my promises I ran into this issue with cderv over on the Rstudio community site and he suggested that I should open an issue here If you try to use a pandocstyle multiline footnote as shown below it will not be rendered in the HTML version of the book and following footnotes in the same chapter will be misnumbered It will render correctly in the PDF and ePub file though If you add an empty page at the end of your book for citations then the footnote will incorrectly show up there unless there are additional footnotes after it in the same chapter in which case it wont show up anywhere even in the referencescitations page Sample footnote number that will not show up anywhere even if you include a referencescitations section Here is some text with a footnote specified Heres another paragraph with a second footnote This is my multiparagraph footnote first paragraph This is a continuation of the footnote Second footnote text Third footnote Im running the latest code and Ive done my best to provide all the necessary information including reproducible code But I dont know what an xfunsessioninfobookdown is Nor have I tested this on the development version Perhaps cderv can help me out

understand that my issue may be closed if I dont fulfill my promises Could there be an option to keep the buildup files for a bookdownworddocument I noticed that the bookdown used to create files to keep plot files in a files folder pdf for Latex and png for Word I learned from Yihuis response here that the program was designed to do so Im not sure since which version this is no longer the case for the Word output The files fold will be automatically removed after the docx file is built Nevertheless it could be helpful in some cases if these files could be maintained For instance many academic journals at least in my area require separate files of figures for publication I used to send them the files in the files but now I have to manually save the plots from the output file or add saving codes everytime building up a plot in the rmd file Heres an illustrative example rmarkdown title title output bookdownworddocument Can I keep the files r pressure echoFALSE plotpressure Heres
