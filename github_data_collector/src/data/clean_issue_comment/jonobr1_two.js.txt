Hi Im tring to use Twojs in my React project js HTML canvas element canvas idthisIsTWO widththisconfigwidth heightthisconfigheight thistwoCanvas documentgetElementByIdthisIsTWO thistwo new Two type TwoTypeswebgl width thisconfigwidth height thisconfigheight autostart false domElement thistwoCanvas But the canvas size keeps increasing I added some debug print in Twojs update function to check its width and height and I found the renderer keeps calling setSize in twojs update function var width thiswidth var height thisheight var renderer thisrenderer here consolelogwidth height rendererwidth rendererheight Output undefined undefined twomodulejs twomodulejs twomodulejs twomodulejs twomodulejs twomodulejs twomodulejs twomodulejs twomodulejs twomodulejs twomodulejs twomodulejs twomodulejs twomodulejs twomodulejs However if I use TwoappendTo everything works fine Resolves Resolves This is a pretty big oneits definitely a breaking change so maybe hold off on merging until gets a stable release and this can become part of This migrates the entire codebase over to ES modules combined together using Rollup It builds on my work removing Underscore functions from the codebase If you want I can squash all those commits together but Ive kept them apart for ease of reviewing Because the changes involve removing a wrapper function from every file everything has been decreased by one indentation level To make the diff readable youll probably want to disable whitespace in the diff view The biggest change by far is that TwoUtils is gone Every utility function previously present in TwoUtils has been moved to various modules in the srcutils folder Because of this they are no longer publicly accessible which is the largest breaking change The sole exception is TwoUtilsEvents which I have chosen to leave under the TwoUtils namespace to avoid confusion with TwoEvents the list of event types For a future version I think its a good idea to rename TwoEvents to something like TwoEventTypes which is what I named it internally and then change TwoUtilsEvents to be accessible as TwoEvents utilsbuildjs should function exactly the same as before I have changed Closure Compiler out for Terser because its much faster the minified code also seems slightly smaller but this could just be down to bundling differences I have also added a build script to packagejson which calls utilsbuildjs Ive exposed Collection as TwoCollection Im not sure if this is desired Should I keep it in the TwoUtils namespace ZUI is now included as part of the bundle it currently depends on some private utility functions that it needs to pull in The choice is between making ZUI part of the main twojs bundle or packaging it separately and duplicating the dependencies I have not yet updated the JSDoc comments to indicate that the new classes are members of the Twojs namespace Ill eventually address that in an additional commit Currently theres a lot of stuff in TwoUtils that was copied in from Underscore It looks like some work has already been put into reducing the use of Underscore in Twojs but TwoUtils could be further cut down and maybe made private so that it can change to suit Twojs needs without worries of breaking external code which relies on it This would break any Twojs projects currently using public TwoUtils functions so perhaps it would be a good candidate for Based on its become clear to make PRs more structured as to not disrupt the currently in transition development cycle of the project Something like Tweenjs Contributor Guide seems straightforward and simple

awesome And welcome to the Open Collective community Come chat with us in the opensource channel on great place to ask questions and share best practices with other Open Source sustainers Does a way to draw inner border for a shape exists The logic for copying Pathmatrix isnt present in the clone methods for shapes subclassing TwoPath such as TwoCircle For that reason the script from still shows a problem Currently twojs can only create an svg clipPath with a single path as commented here It seems true that we cant add a g as a child of clipPath but it does seem to work just adding multiple paths within the clipPath without grouping Is there any plans to implement rendering a group as a clipPath in the future to support this I forked a codepen to illustrate how this can be done The issue is exemplified here doctype html html head meta charsetutf script srcnodemodulestwojsbuildtwojsscript head body div idtwo script let elem documentgetElementByIdtwo let two new Two width height
