repo from the Security Alerts page details The references to jquery were removed in commit e f a A reference to jquery still remains in apptsx and in requireconfigjs apptsx remains ReactDOMrenderGreetifier props greetinggetRandomGreeting outputget configurejs jquery nodemodulesjquerydistjquery I tried replacing output with documentgetElementByIdoutput but got an error Target container is not a DOM element I dont know where to go from here For new samples please provide a detailed explanation of the intended sample It is very hard to get imports and compiling working seamlessly if you are building an app with targets primarily for the browser but can also be run headless in nodefor testing The combinatorics of number of TSC config options and ways to do importsreferencesrequiresexportsetc is huge How about a somewhat complex sample browser app that can also be run headless for testing purposes list of technologies or tools used It should include core TypeScript file one small file for the browser only and then test script It should have external npm dependency that is used only when run in Node and external browser dependency only used in the browser jquery or something like that It should not use webpack or any other bundler like that Just TSC and an explanation of why existing samples are not sufficient and a new sample is needed See explanation above Typescript v supports now references but not sure how to bootstrap this feature please can you add a simple example with client server shared dirs as explained in blog post Thx very much There is two problems on Safari The layout is broken Its not possible to add new itens to the list Console returns Security Error the operation is not secure In this screenshot it is possible to see the two errors img width altcaptura de tela as src Reading through the docs and googling Ive yet to find a good example of this The main clarification needed is what TSC options to use in the package creation when its not for use by node but using node as the dev platform in a bundlertranspiler like webpack The package should then be usable from TS or javascript do will be JS typingsm not ts files Ideally a UMD version would be included for use from browser global scripts My exact use case is to create a set of TS components released as a npm package that can be used when building a SPA style app using webpack which also use TS In other words need to build and consume a TS module that is published via npm and used in code transpiled to ES to run in a web conext TS babel using webpack Im actually using CycleJS but Id be happy for an extended version of the react example that uses a separately published package for part of its functionality Ive no doubt this is easy to achieve but so far I have failed Even pointer to an example would be useful Thanks The config API has changed in Webpack Hi Microsoft team Ive been trying to setup VsCode for d dev and everything works fine if I just use the repo example from TypeScriptSamples but I need to be able to practice them locally with d So I used curl O and put the file in the folder and replaced with d js But after adding the local reference the charts dont work and it raises the following error in the console Uncaught TypeError Cannot read property day of undefined at datats It might be an error of versioning could you guide me how to make it work locally Thanks This is minor and related to the website assets css fontface fontfamily Glyphicons Halflings src urlfontsglyphiconshalflingsregulareot src
