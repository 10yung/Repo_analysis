ShishKabab Does this kick in if there is a failure of any kind or only if the local app does not work Does this check happen BEFORE it does a calculation on the tobebackedup data Preventing unnecessary computation and early cancellation Work on getting the Sync UI into a releasable state If reporting a bug Can you describe the problem and bug in more detail On some pages hr tags are very small and do not span the width of the element theyre in How can we replicate the issue Visit in Firefox or another browser Notice the solid horizontal line Alternatively heres a hr tag hr Install into Firefox and reload the page The horizontal line is replaced by two tiny horizontal lines with endcaps looks like a rounded rectangle Expected behavior ie solution Memex doesnt alter the CSS of the page its monitoring Other comments This issue still happens with all keyboard shortcuts and ribbon disabled If reporting a bug Can you describe the problem and bug in more detail I visit a file url to a local html file on Chrome version but the extension highlighter sidebar and keyboard shortcut dont work How can we replicate the issue I have enabled Allow access to file URLs on Memex

been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended

in more detail There are two vertical scrollbars There is a horizontal scrollbar that probably isnt needed Screenshot from Chromium on Linux How can we replicate the issue On macos System Preferences General Show scroll bars Always Load Memex Otherwise Load Memex Expected behavior ie solution Only show scrollbars when needed with overflow auto If reporting a bug Can you describe the problem and bug in more detail I use padlocapp with Firefox bit on MacOS F When typing the passphrase typing any key that Memex uses as a keyboard shortcuts results in the sidebar appearing and the input from the keyboard being shunted over to Memex Quite annoying when you are trying to type a passphrase How can we replicate the issue Create a free account in padlockapp and type in their input field like email address or passphrase letters associated to a Memex keyboard shortcut For me its h and c for example Expected behavior ie solution Typing your passphrase undisturbed Memex does not appear unless summoned Error stack from extension crash page This issue does not lead to a crash If reporting a bug Can you describe the problem and bug in more detail Im using Memex as a Firefox web extension However Im not able to see the favicon From the HTML source code it looks like the favicon is not configured yet I normally pin the Memex tab in browser and it would be great if we can display favicon to make the tab more recognizable How can we replicate the issue Please be specific as possible Use dashes or numbers to create a list of steps Ex Going to settings every night at pm when I go to search Open Memex Firefox extention and see there is no favicon Expected behavior ie solution What should have happened I should be able to see the favicon Error stack from extension crash page Did the issue lead you to the crash page NA Other comments I can help with adding the favicon if this change sounds reasonable to you Please provide support to read pages in reader mode akin to firefoxsafari That alongside the excellent organizationannotation features would make it the perfect reading tool Thanks Can you describe the problem and bug in more detail When in the settings I disable the Show tooltip on every page option the extension disables the whole Highlighter functionality therefore it stops showing the highlights I make in a page I am trying to disable the tooltip because I only use the keyboard shortcuts and it is annoyingdistracting How can we replicate the issue Go to settings Disable the Show tooltip on every page option Refresh any page you previously had highlights Highlights gone Expected behavior ie solution The highlights still showing yet the tooltip not displaying when text is selected Error stack from extension crash page NA Other comments I only tried this using Firefox but from my debugging it seems to be an issue with the extension I tried to search for similar open issues but I did not find any
