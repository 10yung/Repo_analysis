I notice that you import mantles header file using import Could you use import to import third library header file Because This can cause many header file reference problem Thanks with a podspecjson if a platform version isn t defined the lowest version available will be used osunfairlocktrylock is only available on iOS macOS tvOS and watchOS or newer see Apple Docs Thanks for wanting to contribute to this project Unfortunately its not really maintained anymore Feel free to use it asis or fork it and modify as much as you want to suit your needs However I cant guarantee that Ill have timeenergy to look at new issues and pull requests Sorry for the trouble Hi there thanks for this fantastic lib its very useful and the code is very impressive I really want to put concrete protocol into my project however I found some performance issuethis lib looks like not maintained but why dont we just discuss this issue here I checked the implementation of the concrete protocol function and I found when loading concrete protocols a lot of time will spent on traversing all Objc classes for making protocol connected target class automatically I have a test in an almost empty project and we will got more than classes in the system foundation it will take very long time to load all the concrete protocols In this simple test I create concrete protocols more than s will spent on loading phase it will be worse when we actually use it in a real project So there is my solution create a concreteprotocol macro to all the specific target classesjust increase a little bit writing complexity for making such a great high performance for example concreteprotocol DemoProtocol AppDelegate Class Class That will drop the traversing code and take less than ms to load all the concrete protocols To support the following form of usage str is a instance of NSString keypathstr lowercaseStringUTF String keypathNSString lowercaseStringUTF String keypathNSStringnew lowercaseStringUTF String The version on is out of date please push the latest version Thanks for wanting to contribute to this project Unfortunately its not really maintained anymore Feel free to use it asis or fork it and modify as much as you want to suit your needs However I cant guarantee that Ill have timeenergy to look at new issues and pull requests Sorry for the trouble Hi I used EXTConcreteProtocol to extend my protocol I met a question when I used it When used liked this import EXTConcreteProtocolh protocol TestProtocol concrete voidchanged end concreteprotocolTestProtocol voidchanged NSLogUpdate end interface TestObjectNSObjectTestProtocol end implementation TestObject end int mainint argc const char argv autoreleasepool TestObject object TestObject new object buzz return it worked well But when I used in a single application like let TestObject confirm TestProtocol and I used it on my viewController then it cannot be complied success Further I let my viewController confirm TestProtocol call function buzz in viewDidLoad it worked I found another git repository called ProtocolKit which call do same work like EXTConcreteProtocol Maybe I have problem in using protocol I create a repository here to describe my question gitgithubcomtangzzzfanTGTestProtocolgit Thanks advanced Fix metamacroargcount macro when VAARGSs count is Thanks for wanting to contribute to this project Unfortunately its not really maintained anymore Feel free to use it asis or fork it and modify as much as you want to suit your needs However I cant guarantee that Ill have timeenergy to look at new issues and pull requests Sorry for the trouble The LLVM not drop warning for this inttest if YES else weakifyself strongifyself NSLogselfclass If I remove weakly and strongly it drop compile error inttest if YES else NSLogselfclass Control reaches end of nonvoid function
