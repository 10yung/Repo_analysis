TinyMCE or tinymcevue Window I am using the imagesuploadhandler and returning the following image path After returning the string if I do a view code in the tinymce editor I see the following string has been set as the src Notice the amp in the second url this is causing it to break when sending this URL through gmail do to the encoding is this a bug or is there an option to change this Thank you I use TinyMCE Vue and build into an app successfully But I cant build into a web component I mean Is it possible to do or I make some mistake I dont realize Thanks Hi I am trying to achieve changing the tinymce configuration passed in on init dynamically at runtime I am not using cloud but have made tinymce globally available by import tinymcetinymce in mainjs etc So far I got this working with In the template the relevant stuff is A a selector dropdown based on vue bootstrap not relevant calling the reInit function B The Vue Tinymce editor bformselect idconfigselector vmodelconfigselectorselected optionsconfigselectoroptions changereInit editor reftinyMceEditor vmodelcontent initthisconfigselectorselected onChangehandlerfunctioneditor and in the data section of the Vue file data return content bcontent hereb configselector selected tinyMceDefaultConfig options value tinyMceDefaultConfig text default value tinyMceMiniConfig text mini tinyMceDefaultConfig height other settings tinyMceMiniConfig height and in the methods section of the Vue file methods reInit function thisrefstinyMceEditoreditorremove thisrefstinyMceEditoreditor new tinymceEditorthisrefstinyMceEditoreditorid thisconfigselectorselected tinymceEditorManager thisrefstinyMceEditoreditorrender Now this approach apparently works BUT the editor is no longer reactive and the vmodel property no longer gets updated The id of the refstinyMceEditoreditor appears to be the same after but having content in the template no longer gets updated Does anyone have any idea how to change the tinymce config properly dynamically using Vue tinymce AND staying reactive keeping the vmodel bound Perhaps this should be a feature request having a thisrefstinyMceEditoreditorsetSettingsnewConfig that would automatically call a refresh on the ui or something if this is not at all possible in todays version tinymcetinymcevue PS I have even tried a dirty hack of having editor instances each wrapped in a conditional div vifcondition with different init configs from start and switching between them by changing condition truefalse but this doesnt either work because of how the toolbar gets rendered it just doesnt work the way you would expect the toolbar gets rendered despite being inside the false condition div What Any help would be greatly appreciated Please let me know if I can assist in any way by providing more info if anything is unclear Hope some tinymce genius out there will be able to assist Best regards H
