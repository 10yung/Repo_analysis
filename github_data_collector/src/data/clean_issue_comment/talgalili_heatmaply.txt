compiler Id like to save an interactive html file of my heatmaply plot remotely saving any html support files on the web In Plotly this is accomplished with an argument to the save file function that is something like remotetrue Does an argument like this exist for heatmaply My goal is to send the html file to others to open on other servers without access to the helper files on my own computer Hi talgalili Is it possible to combine heatmaply with plotly animations Ie could we supply a series of samesize matrices and transition between them using the animation functionality I expect this feature is not yet implemented and Im willing to put in the elbow grease to implement it myself but Id appreciate any comments on how feasible this would be For background I am one of the developers of an R package which implements convex biclustering Convex biclustering is a penalized method so as the penalty parameter is varied a series of increasingly smooth estimated heatmaps are created See slides of While we can compute these solutions relatively quickly our visualizations are a bit more limited We currently have i heatmaply output for a single lambda value and ii a shiny app showing the output of gtoolsheatmap as lambda as varied Im interested in doing something a bit more webnative and combining these two Related In ggplot the alpha values of each cell in a heatmap can be set individually using the aes function Can the same be done in heatmaply Currently data plotted as side colors all share the same color scale This becomes problematic when data on very different scales are plotted sidebyside eg age and gender In this case the contrast between binary or logical variables becomes very poor A couple possible solutions would be to either Allow the user to provide alternative color scales one per variable plotted or Use a separate color scale for binarylogical variables The first approach is the most flexible but would require a little more manual effort on the users end The second one has the potential benefit of improving some plots of this nature automatically but is much less flexible and would not resolve scale issues for numeric variables on different scales Need to ensure that ordering remains consistent using the different plot functions somehow For example TcPla OndGra DolTro OndDex PalRam OndDrop OndMet GraDex PalDex DolDex DolDrop GranDrop S c

bug in plotly Basically retain the data values so that clustering is the same but colour scale can be more compact and thus the heatmap more colorful
