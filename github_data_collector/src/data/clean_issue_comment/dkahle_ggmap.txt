Hi dear developers It may be a very easy question but I couldnt find a perfect answer so far is it possible to get a purely clean google map which has the basic terrain color but no continental or country label on it It seems to not work with google best Cui I am trying to use naver map in the R shiny I have the Key and client ID from the naver cloud interactive map but when I use the getnavermap command from ggmap it throws an error of Error getnavermap is defunct Use Naver is at least temporarily not supported as its API has changed instead See helpDefunct I wd appreciate your help This line is not commented out in the CRAN package version so users get the terrain maptype regardless of what they asked for I couldnt quite figure out how to customize the map extent from a Google map Id like the map extent to just surround the color overlay in the middle in getgooglemaps this is scale and scale is zoomed in too far My code is ggmap map geomsf datanr fillNA colorDarkred cex lty inheritaes F geomtile datapred aes Longitude Latitude fillEstimate colorNA inheritaes F scalefillviridis optionA Thanks Reproducible Example It appears that a hash in the query of ggmapgeocode will prevent returning a result Perhaps queries should be cleaned Below I use the same address but switch the with Suite and it works fine ggmapgeocode Channel St Source Warning Geocoding Channel St failed with error You must use an API key to authenticate each request to Google Maps Platform APIs For additional information please refer to A tibble x lon lat dbl dbl NA NA ggmapgeocode Channel St Suite Source A tibble x lon lat dbl dbl For now a simple gsub appears to be the easiest workaround For example gsub s Suite Channel St Adding functions to get maps from Carto ony getcarto did not add the option to the generic getmaps Before you open your PR y Did you run R CMD CHECK y Did you run roxygen roxygenise Thanks for contributing I can get getmap to return a satellite map when specifying the maps location by a centroid ie location cLongitude Latitude however when I specify the location as a bounding box ie location cleft bottom righttop it returns a terrain image not a satellite In both examples I have specified maptype satellite Is someone able to please shed some light on this issue Reproducible Example The following code uses the OSM source but in the back it still uses Google Maps to generate the bounding box I think it is cleaner to just throw an error that this isnt supported r ggmapgetmaplocation clon lat sourceosm Source Error in apermdefaultmap c invalid first argument must be an array In addition Warning message In getgooglemapcenter location zoom zoom filename filename HTTP Bad Request partialmatch indicates that the geocoder did not return an exact match for the original request though it was able to match part of the requested address You may wish to examine the original request for misspellings andor an incomplete address Partial matches most often occur for street addresses that do not exist within the locality you pass in the request Partial matches may also be returned when a request matches two or more locations in the same locality For example Henr St Bristol UK will return a partial match for both Henry Street and Henrietta Street Note that if a request includes a misspelled address component the geocoding service may suggest an alternative address Suggestions triggered in this way will also be marked as a partial match We should label output with a partialmatch attribute that can be extracted programmatically It shouldnt change existing workflows hence the use of attr instead of something like an additional field in the output cc jdmiller ESRI has a nice and free basemap service a leaflet example is found here Would it be possible to include this as a basemap option in ggmap
