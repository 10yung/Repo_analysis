How do we specify which subnet to use in each region subnet names have been substituted bees up s g bees keyKEY iami aami a zoneapsoutheast aapsoutheast a loginec user subnetsubnet asubnet a groupSGGroupsTagNameInBothRegions I assume this works since it resolves the SG ID The subnet ID subnet asubnet a does not exist Hi I am running the following command bees up s g bees k bees z euwest b i ami b f f And get this error Any help would very much be appreciated command bees attack n c u Read bees from the roster useast d Connecting to the hive Assembling bees Each of bees will fire rounds

to write Wasps with Bazookas if you could not tell by the name The reason I went this direction instead of contributing to this one is due to the bees not being fast enough to get true results For example testing a HelloWorld node server Bees Test bees node servers running on kurbintes EKS rps node servers running on kurbintes EKS rps node servers running on kurbintes EKS rps Bees Test bees node servers running on kurbintes EKS rps node servers running on kurbintes EKS rps node servers running on kurbintes EKS rps Wasps Test Wasp node servers running on kurbintes EKS rps node servers running on kurbintes EKS rps node servers running on kurbintes EKS rps It also seems this project is no longer being worked on If you wanted to update the readme to put a link to Wasps With Bazookas for a replacement I think that would help a lot of people out Wasps With Bazookas Hi I am getting below error when I am trying to pip install beeswithmachinesguns I am unable to figure out this

currently one can only specify the p postfile param using a bare filename no path which must exist in the same directory in which you are running bees due to the scp command which assumes that the destination of the file on the bee file system is postfiles It would be more ergonomic to be able to specify a relative or absolute path to a file and have that file read and sent to the bee swarm I think the line which needs to be changed is the one which tells ab where to find the file Working a way to automate load testing on instances by creating an AMI with the bees installed I created a new user in my AWS account for a bees user to prevent toopermissive access to resources Id rather not use mine I have enabled AmazonEC FullAccess AutoScalingFullAccess and some basic CloudWatch policies but still am receiving a You are not authorized to perform this operation What are the minimal amount of permissions required to start a swarm The nargs option is so my assumption is the argument will
