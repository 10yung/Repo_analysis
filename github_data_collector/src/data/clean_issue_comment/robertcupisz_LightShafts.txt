Hello I am trying to use Light Shafts with WaterPro DayTime unity but when I set the water to reflection mode or refraction mode the rays disappear Why does it happen Hi Do you know any way to be makin the voumetric fog with a cut out shader Since you said it need to write to depth texture and standard cutout doesnt Thanks Baptiste Hi I tried Its working on Unity But didnt work on my mobile So Im curious that is it supposed to work on mobile Thanks in advance Without GVR With GVR Just copied files but got this error No clue why Target standalone x windows dx light shaft errors On PS I have shaders issueI hope its an easy fix Been trying to get the light shafts to work with single pass stereo but unable to do that so far Is it trivial to add support for that When building my project I get the following error Shader error in HiddenCoord wrong operand types no operation exists that takes a lefthand operand of type bool and a right operand of type bool or there is no acceptable conversion at line on gles Hi Im trying to use light shafts with a mesh that is animated via vertex shader and the shafts dont seem to be conforming to the changing mesh Is this expected If so could you offer any pointers as to how I could go about getting this to work Thanks
