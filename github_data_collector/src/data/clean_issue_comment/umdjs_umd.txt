No able to find this file xmsdkjs under Im a bit confused with so many different UMD templates What if I want to build a javascript library which can be used by itself or together with a jQuery adaptor and I also want it to be compatible with AMD and commonJS In that case which of the UMD templates is the appropriate one Provided UMD templates follow assumption that module definedInTemplate is dependent on module b But how should UMDcompliant systems look like when module definedInTemplate is dependent on a FEW modules like a b c Or how to express in UMDcompliant way a case where module definedInTemplate is not dependent on any modules at all Also regarding template for jQuery plugin what if that plugin dependent not only on JQuery but on for example root or other modules Do you provide those in order of factoryjQuery root a b c or as factorya b c root jQuery Would it make sense for umd to support es module exports Though one practical issue is that there is no good es module feature detection as of now to my knowledge The project Braceumd should be listed in the README as it explains how to develop standardized methods using the UMD design in ecma modules
