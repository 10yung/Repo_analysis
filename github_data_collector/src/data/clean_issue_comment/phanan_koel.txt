Describe the bug Hi guys I have full access to a cPanelWHM environment and I was trying to set up a Koel installation on my domain I was able to finish the install successfully but the website simply does not open Im not using php artisan serve because I want to run it directly on the root folder of my domain To reproduce Unfortunately theres nothing to reproduce I just used Git and cloned Koel repository to my publichtml folder Then I shot a composer install blah blah blah everything ran fine The only thing that I was not able to do was to open the website Expected behavior Simply open the Koel GUI when I enter tastreamingml Screenshots There are no screenshots just a error Environment Koel version v OS CENTOS v KVM Browser Firefox Developer PHP v Node v cPanelWHM v Describe the bug When visualizer is enabled changing restarting or simply moving forward or backward in the song results in a significant volume increase which cannot be traced to an actual change in volume anywhere in Koel the volume slider and equalizer doesnt change or the system This only happens when visualizer is enabled and only works once ie the volume doesnt keep increasing To reproduce Start a song Enable visualizer Move forward or backward in the song using Koels progress bar Volume increases noticeably Expected behavior No change in volume Environment Koel version OS Debian Sid Browser Chrome PHP version Node version In a sub directory installation the assetpath ist absolute so the resources cannot be loaded koelassetsbroken After removing the first slash in the webpackconfig of the publicpath and recompilation the assets are loading great now Describe the bug cant stream lossless To reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior have lossless library try to stream anything nothing loads or plays Expected behavior music plays without loading for ridiculous amounts of time Screenshots no Environment recent Additional context i can download the files through the browser and load them into quicktime player before the streaming service does anything if it even does anything so thats pretty poor EDIT it pretty much always hangs indefinitely and nothing ever happens Describe the bug Cannot login without manually setting APPKEY in env file To reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Follow the documentation cd PUBLICWEBDIRECTORYFORKOEL git clone recursesubmodules git checkout v Check out the latest version at composer install php artisan koelinit Populate credentials during the process php artisan serve Expected behavior Able to login using credentials provided during koelinit step Screenshots NA Environment Koel version eg v OS Ubuntu Browser any browser PHP version Node version Additional context na Hi having this sync script with inotify running as systemd

anyone found out some way on how to monitor file changes on network drive The only working way to sync koel at the moment is by triggering cron script to sync the complete file system at interval X

tried clearing cookies and logins to no avail Environment Koel version OS Server Ubuntu Browser Firefox PHP version Node version Additional context Server is mounted on Apache Hi on mobile view the

play all I never use shuffle mode and would love to simply play all songs in my playlist in order When you doubleclick a song in a playlist then use Play next song or Play previous song button it doesnt play the next or previous song in the playlist but rather in the Current queue list This is confusing and kinda defeats the purpose of playlists All of this doesnt apply to Artists or Albums since those have a dedicated play all button that works fine For playlists I have to manually select all songs then add them to the queue Adding a Play all button in playlists would solve all those issues at once Thanks in advance
