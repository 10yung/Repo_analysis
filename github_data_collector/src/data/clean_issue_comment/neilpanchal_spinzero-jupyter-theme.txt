Hi Thanks for the excellent work on this Do you know how to stop the toolbar menu from hiding while scrolling down and if possible how to change the fontsize of the code cell Whenever I include code in a heading cell the size of the code doesnt react to the fact that it is a heading cell getDatapy gives the same output visually as getDatapy
