Ive updated the documentation if necessary Pending Work for Cordova Docs Repo Motivation and Context Use GitHub Actions instead of thirdparty CI services Description Created GitHub Actions Task Move all Travis CI AppVeyor jobs to GitHub Actions Run only one Travis CI job for codecov reports Job Environment Linux Node Codecov has a better UI but requires setting secrets in GH which we do not have the direct ability to set If we want to continue supporting and using Codecov we would need to community with INFRA to set the secret token Testing Checklist x Ive run the tests to see all new and

folder where the cordova app is loaded defaults to www On Android the www is hardcoded in several places Feature Description Describe your feature request in detail Please provide any code examples or screenshots of what this feature would look like Are there any drawbacks Will this break anything for existing users note that on cordovaios its only configurable with code so not meant to be changed from configxml is for when integrating cordova into native projects Alternatives or Workarounds Describe alternatives or workarounds you are currently using Are there ways to do this with existing functionality Hi after installing cordova I have created a new project The contents of the www folder are generated by building an Angular project As a platform I added android with target SDK at and min SDK at after doing the build of the project I open the emulator with SDK launch the command cordova emulate android and on the device the white screen opens instead if using an emulator with SDK the app opens and shows the correct contents of the www folder Anyone know how I can fix it How do I get my cordova app to work on samsung dex Samsung dex only says cant run in Samsung Dex Its designed for phone touch screens Edit I think I found a way to do it by adding this to the configxml file but havent tested yet xml editconfig fileAndroidManifestxml targetmanifestusessdk modemerge
