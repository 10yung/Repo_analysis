 Solution objectivec if self isOverThisVersion self setEdgesForExtendedLayoutUIExtendedEdgeNone Added changes to remove QuartzCore library Added changes for iPad integration Added changes to make the project ARC compatible but without change the API compatibility Allow to build PullToRefresh as iOS Framework We can do all the animation within Core Animation without having to use QuartzCore Makes the installation a bit easier and removes the need for the QuartzCore framework I noticed this wipes out any content insets that existed on the table Could this be modified to preserve them some suggested fixes for use with projects that use ARC in the vein of githubjdgMBProgressHUDgit add defines for STRONG and WEAK so this can be used for both older nonarc and newer arcbased projects add protocol PullToRefreshTableViewDelegate to force the implementor to implement their own refresh also a silence redundant Xcode clang warnings in setupStrings by using the suggested fixes for the strings b also localize the strings so a project can decide to set these values to whatever makes most sense to the project and the most sense for each localization c show how the protocol works in the DemoTableViewControllerm hellowhen i pull the height my app is crash Hello Now the library doesnt support ARC As far as I know there are options to solve this The first is adding fnoobjcarc compiler flag for PullRefreshTableViewControllerm file in build phases tab of target configs as described here The second solution doesnt need any steps for developers I found it in ViewDeck library Here you can find changes Pay attention to the next lines of code objectivec ifndef hasfeature define hasfeaturex endif ifndef hasextension define hasextension hasfeature Compatibility with pre compilers endif if hasfeatureobjcarc clangmajor define IIARCENABLED endif hasfeatureobjcarc and objectivec voiddealloc if IIARCENABLED refreshHeaderView release refreshLabel release refreshArrow release refreshSpinner release textPull release textRelease release textLoading release super dealloc endif So the question is which way is correct And should I pullrequest this changes
