properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the

only create standalone applications with it Something like this example facebookreact issues Thanks for submitting a PR Please read these instructions carefully Explain the motivation for making this change Provide a test plan demonstrating that the code is solid Match the code formatting of the rest of the codebase Motivation required What existing problem does the pull request solve Test Plan required A good test plan has the exact commands you ran and their output provides screenshots or videos if the pull request changes UI or updates the website See What is a Test Plan to learn more If you have added code that should be tested add tests Next Steps Sign the CLA if you havent already Small pull requests are much easier to review and more likely to get merged Make sure the PR does only one thing otherwise please split it Make sure all tests pass on Circle CI PRs that break tests are unlikely to be merged For more info see the Pull Requests section of our Contributing guidelines
