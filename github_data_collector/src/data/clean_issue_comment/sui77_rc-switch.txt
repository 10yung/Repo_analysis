Hello I tested the ReceiveDemo advanced and simple Both staying silent on serial mySwitchavailable never triggers I use theese receivers If i connect a Logic analyzer to the receiver module its bitbanging If i push a button on the remote i try to capture the bitbanging sequences are changing After releasing a button all is for a while Is there a special Setup or receiver i have to use with this library Thanks Stephan Ive worked on receiving this code this off and on over several months but I just keep hitting walls I have a driveway sensor that I can reliably receive consistent data via the rtl app on an sdr I cant seem to do so on my arduino though I get the following pulses And it seems to match up with the fcc filing for the product here on page of It looks like the pulse lengths are purposely different and there are more than states which would explain why I cant get the results I want with rcswitch but the reliability of data via the sdr method says to me it must be binary data and Im ju st missing something Any suggestions In all the examples I find it says mySwitchenableReceive Receiver input on interrupt D But what if I would like to use another pin for the receiver I have a Wemos D mini and I cant use pin How could I set up a different pin Dear Sir I have to say tank you very very much for your lib I have achieve my domobox for most off my outlet your lib associate with websocket its wonderfull of reactivity less than second amaizing from a smartphone however i have problem with one outlet here find inclose with simple scaner its very long can you give me a help thanks a lot Wiring between arduino and receivertransmitter is fine and works with many remotes with different protocols Im struggling with a last one I receive fine Received bit Protocol data bits of pulse train duration proposed protocol true first level down But nothing happens when I transmit RCSwitch mySwitch RCSwitch mySwitchenableTransmit mySwitchsetProtocol mySwitchsetPulseLength mySwitchsetRepeatTransmit delay mySwitchsend delay Any idea I have a Type A DIP switch set of outlets and remote with x buttons In getCodeWordA sGroup and bStatus parameters were handled wrong had to be changed in order to get it work with my set like this char RCSwitchgetCodeWordAconst char sGroup const char sDevice bool bStatus static char sReturn int nReturnPos for int i i i sReturn nReturnPos sGroup i F for int i i i sReturn nReturnPos sDevice i F sReturn nReturnPos bStatus F sReturn nReturnPos bStatus F sReturn nReturnPos SerialprintlnsReturn return sReturn Hi i would like to send longer signal than bit Is it possible with this libraryI ve tested tutorial AddNewRemotePart but i couldnt recognize new protocol Is it possible to send binary longer than bit with arduino I ve received binary code with SDR The library is just super I try to compile the project under STM S F P and get errors Please help to adapt for this controller The controller is very cheap and therefore very suitable for sensors of security systems C Users roman AppData Local Arduino packages sduino tools sdcc build binsdcc sketch SendDemoinocpp preproc ctagstargetforgccminusecpp re c

delay somewhere that throws off the timing of reading the GPS data stream causing the GPS data to generate about a error rate even when no remote buttons are being pressed just idle state Once I remove the enableRecieve statement the code works perfectly and the GPS data stream has zero errors Is there a way to use rcswitch that doesnt introduce a small loop delay and only triggers when the actual interrupt pin is triggered Thanks My setup is as below MXRM V data D Arduino Nano rcswitchenableReceive is set to Thats the interrupt number for D Should it be thats the pin number The remote Im trying to sniff out
