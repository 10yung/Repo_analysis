Hi is it possible to integrate with redux and reduxform as that is how the rest of my site is built and i would require it to work with it Hello As far as i see the payment lib is used only for checking card type This is done with a simple array in this lib What do you think about integrating this inside reactcreditcard This would avoid the cost of QJ and payment Currently those libs are bundled and almost not used tree shaking is impossible with those coffee generated files Cheers Thanks for developing such a great tool Its super useful However there are several other card types that are not fully supported Can you add some more card type or can you make a general card which is used for valid but not yet supported card Visa MasterCard American Express Diners Club Discover JCB UnionPay Maestro The functionality to allow setting of which cards can be used already exists in Paymentjs see this commit Can we please get this exposed Hi First of all really nice component I just npm installed it and the two mentioned css dependency files are not located inside build folder as stated on READMEmd but i could import them anyway because they are located at source folder I guess that is not correct because source folder contain uncompressed files Any API or suggestions for setting the size of the credit card In my case Id like it to be able to shrink to fit inside a certain div I think VISA credit card is of type digit But Amex card has to be digit I would love to setup what placeholder I want to show through component properties Hi there First of all I really like your react component and use it for my projects But I found an issue with it By default the credit card image looks like this Then when I type an existing card eg Visa the image changes to the following Then if I remove credit card number so that it will be come unknown again please note a broken image of the credit card type in the top right corner
