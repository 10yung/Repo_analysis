Environment Swift Xcode Problem I implement the logger using the various levels of severity however all the log statements in the console are still white I have tried changing themes and yet I still cannot have TRACE DEBUG INFO WARNING or ERROR to appear in the console with the proper colors Example Logger Setup MARK Logging private lazy var log Loggerformatter default theme tomorrowNightEighties minLevel trace Example Console Output Screen Shot at PM Hi unfortunately SwiftPM is currently unable to depend on this package due to the naming of the version numbers The previous ones are all prefixed with v v v And then its just Obviously this should be improved in SwiftPM but it would be a quick and easy fix here until that happens Xcode complained about some missing symbols which were resolved by the Foundation imports Besides that it seems to work fine now for use with Xcode s SwiftPM support As you know Apple removed support for XCode plugins in and we need some way to color code the logs So I have added a provision to setup emojis for log levels Please go through the code and let me know what you think I have not updated readme or version number yet Ill update it if this change is merged This is definitely one of the better and more flexible logging frameworks for client side swift Awesome work It would be great however to add an abstraction which will allow you to assign multiple output locations EG Instead of just logging to standard output it would be nice to be able to take the same record and just send it to another logging service via https Happy to open a PR for this when I get the time
