I am able to set some syntax highlighting rules with textEditorSyntaxHighlightingMainRuleSetRulesAdd Unfortunately changes to this list are not applied to the editor on the fly and I havent found any method to trigger a refresh once the editor is loaded I intended to use AvalonEdit to highlight multiple user defined values in log files Is this possible Best regards Carsten There would be no way to use the mono project to compile projects made on Sharpdevelop You could implement the Dot project so that you can generate Android and do the same things that Visual studio does and update that project Hi everyone Im using AvalonEdit since more than years without problems and it work great Im just facing one issue on changing text from background thread using SetOwnerThread method trigger VerifyAccess Exception every time even when called from main thread If I do everything in the main thread it work but this also freeze the UI Its why I want to do it in another thread and show a loading indicator to the user I cant seem to understand what im doing wrong here Any help or idea will be greatly apprecied Thanks in advance Sample code c public async void EditTextSample Thread lUiThread ThreadCurrentThread SelectedTab is the current tab viewed by the user in my application SelectedTabTextEditorDocumentSetOwnerThreadnull await TaskRun Thread lBackgroundThread ThreadCurrentThread SelectedTabTextEditorDocumentSetOwnerThreadlBackgroundThread string lNewText SelectedTabTextEditorDocumentText lNewText SelectedTabTextEditorDocumentSetOwnerThreadlUiThread Some screenshots The URL of my project is Thanks hi Is it possible to use this component in Windows Form too I wanted to use it instead of wpf in winform C Thanks how can i highlight only the keyword in this sample whiletrue i want to highlight all keywords before Hi When using a RectangleSelection using the Alt keyboard and mouse while having collapsed sections causes exception Ive put both exceptions in this issue since they seem to be related First exception is an InvalidOperationException with the message Line was skipped by a VisualLineElementGenerator but it is not collapsed Repro Launch Sample application and have text Welcome to AvalonEdit if if Using the Alt keyboard key select from the first line and column to the last line and after the last bracket selecting only char wide Collapse the first section Press delete Boom Second related exception ArgumentOutOfRangeException with offset Parameter name offset Actual value was Repro Input same text as previous exception Collapse both sections Using the Alt keyboard key select past the first character and take a few on the right And go down all the way Press Delete I havent found any quick fixes or workarounds for this Let me know if you have any clues or any tips to have that fixed Thanks Fran ois Like this This removes the extra selection visible at the start of the next line referenced in issue The existing paint logic is inconsistent with Visual Studio and just about all other editors AFAIK I have been using this code in my fork for over a year and it appears to work fine But note that I havent tried to address corner cases For example if word wrap is turned on and the last character selected is a space and the line breaks on that space the fix wont apply a fairly extreme corner case There may be other corner cases that arent addressed such as an image on the last line etc
