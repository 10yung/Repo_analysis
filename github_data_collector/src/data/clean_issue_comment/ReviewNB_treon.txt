Executing entire notebook is a good CI practice But its not always feasible or required some cells can take hours to run It would be good to offer an ability to only run specific cells or exclude specific cells Which cells to run ignore can be specified with tags This whole partial execution can be wrapped as a new treon cmdline flag eg treon partial Wed still want the standard mode to execute complete notebooks top to bottom When running treon on Windows with multiple threads it sometimes stops running because of issues with the underlying jupyter client To some extent this is an issue with the jupyter client and or nbconvert but treon is triggering the issue by calling nbconvert in multiple threads The error message and discussion of the jupyter client is at this issue For treon a workaround though would be to use multiple processes instead of threads Ipython does not seem to be threadsafe as of now but this is being worked on Combining Jupyter notebooks with test driven development feels great treon is really helpful for CI pipelines Is it possible besides doctest and unittest to also include the pytest framework It seems that pytest does not have a dropin function such as the unittestmain which executes the current module but requires a filename Still this would be a nice addition and removes a lot of boilerplate one needs for the unittest framework
