Ive recently been using cartographer for localization testing and I have seen an issue on multiple maps that I tested When going down a narrow hallway usually not in the first pass through the area everything will look fine until suddenly the whole hallway rotates as seen in the image below compared to the map generated from the mapping operation Screenshot from I have been able to tune the localizer so that the map will eventually fix itself but I am interested in preventing this issue from arising in the first place From what I can tell it seems to be heavily influenced by the motion filter but I have not been able to determine the root cause of the issue Here is a link where you will find the config and bag files that I have been working with I would appreciate any help you can give in figuring out the cause of this issue Hello I am trying to tune three parameters in trajectorybuilder dlua they are TRAJECTORYBUILDER Dceresscanmatchertranslationweight TRAJECTORYBUILDER Dceresscanmatcherrotationweight TRAJECTORYBUILDER Dsubmapsnumrangedata I learned that the size of the submap should be ten to thirty seconds of data The more I trust the odometry data the larger translationweight should be And The more I trust the IMU data the larger rotationweight should be Is it right But I am in trouble How to judge the accuracy of the odometry data and the imu data Is there any parameter from cartographer to help me Thanks for your help Incompatible flag incompatiblenoimplicitfileexport will be enabled by default in a future Bazel release thus breaking Cartographer The flag is documented here Please check the following CI builds for build and test results a href targetblankimg src height Ubuntu OpenJDK a Never heard of incompatible flags before We have documentation that explains everything If you dont want to receive any future issues for Cartographer or if you have any questions please file an issue in Important Please do NOT modify the issue title since that might break our tools The target release hasnt been determined yet Our tool will update the issue title once the flag flip has been scheduled I found that in earlier versions the imu data was processed by kalman filters but now its gone Why Kalman filters work badly Thank you very much I am trying to test cartographerros on my simulation environment Cartographer compiles correctly
