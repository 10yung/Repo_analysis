I am solving a large model The model is solved successfully on Mac up to th order approximation When I try solve the model on Windows or Linux server it solves rd order in seconds the program is killed by the system or by the program at th order after a few seconds of running The cpu utilization is below when killed and memory usage is minimal There is no other error message except killed at the end There is no issue solving a small model up to th on windows or linux I would appreciate any explanations remedies or suggestions Thanks Steady state finding in large economic models is hard Currently the user needs to manually implement a full steady state or reduce the problem and then call a solver See eg I wonder if it would be useful and feasible to introduce something like a steadystaterelationblock that allows specifying analytical steady state relations that Dynare could use in the staticfile to substitute out some variable and thus reduce the size of the problem essentially introducing a modellocal variable for the static model An example would be steadystaterelation u R beta Pi inomRPi IdeltaK end Combined with initval this would make finding a steady state much easier In case of the recordstructure not containing the required fields the output argument of the private function at the bottom of the file are not set crashing Matlab See The file This file replicates the estimation of the cash in advance model termed M in the paper described in Frank Schorfheide Loss functionbased evaluation of DSGE models Journal of Applied Econometrics The data are in file fsdatsimulm and have been artificially generated They are therefore different from the original dataset used by Schorfheide The prior distribution follows the one originally specified in Schorfheides paper except for parameter rho In the paper the elicited beta prior for rho implies an asymptote and corresponding prior mode at It is generally recommended to avoid this extreme type of prior Some optimizers for instance modecompute Mathworks particleswarm algorithm may find a posterior mode with rho equal to zero We lowered the value of the prior standard deviation changing to to remove the asymptote The equations are taken from J Nason and T Cogley Testing the implications of longrun neutrality for monetary business cycle models Journal of Applied Econometrics S S Note that there is an initial minus sign missing in equation A p S This implementation was originally written by Michel Juillard Please note that the following copyright notice only applies to this Dynare implementation of the model Copyright C Dynare Team This file is part of Dynare Dynare is free software you can redistribute it andor modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation either version of the License or at your option any later version Dynare is distributed in the hope that it will be useful but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE See the GNU General Public License for more details You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with Dynare If not see var m P c e W R k d n l gyobs gpobs y dA varexo ea em parameters alp bet gam mst rho psi del alp bet gam mst rho psi del model dA expgamea logm rhologmst rhologm em Pc P mbetP alpexpalpgamloge k alp n alp delexpgamloge c P m W ln psi psicP nln R P alpexpalpgameak alpn alpW cPbetP alpexpalpgameak alpn alpmlc P ck expalpgameak alpn alp delexpgameak Pc m m d l e expea y k alpn alpexpalpgamea gyobs dAyy gpobs PP m dA end shocks var ea stderr var em stderr end steadystatemodel dA expgam gst dA m mst khst gstbet del alpgst alpbet alp xist khstgst alp gst delkhstmst nust psimst alp psibetgst alpkhst alp n xistnustxist P xist nust k khstn l psimstn psi n c mstP d l mst y k alpn alpgst alp R mstbet W ln ist yc q d e gpobs mdA gyobs dA end steady check estimatedparams alp betapdf bet betapdf gam normalpdf mst normalpdf rho betapdf psi betapdf del betapdf stderr ea invgammapdf inf stderr em invgammapdf inf end estimatedparamsinit del stderr ea corr eaem end varobs gpobs gyobs estimationorder datafilefsdatsimul nobs loglinear mhreplic mhnblocks mhjscale crashes with a cryptic message because a correlation is initialized that is not estimated For structural parameters there is no error We should make the behavior informative and consistent See See See It seems there is at least one call to makeex missing What is dynamic used for Look at printing in DynareMain cc Why do we switch on outputmode
