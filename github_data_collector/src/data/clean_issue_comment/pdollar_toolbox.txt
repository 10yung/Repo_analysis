on a bit linux system ubuntu the function mxCreateMatrix fails to generate matrix with the correct dimensions The issue is the use of int vs sizet The function mxSetDimensions takes sizet as its inputs but mxCreateMatrix passes int on my bit system int is bytes whereas sizet is bytes This caused garbage dimensions being assigned to the matrix Hi In acfTrainm the classifier for the previous stage is rewritten by the classifier for the current stage detectorclf adaBoostTrainX X detectoroptspBoost Are there any variables that are updated through the stages Or simply something that Im missing Thanks Hello I want to change the detection threshold of ACF Detector in order to generate object proposals How can I do it Thanks toolboxCompile fails for certain files It cannot successfully compile due to this error Building with Xcode Clang COMPILE FAILURE gradientMexcpp UsersmeLibraryApplication SupportMathWorksMATLAB AddOnsCollectionspdollartoolboxpdollartoolboxe channelsprivategradientMexcpp error no matching function for call to mxSetDimensions mxSetDataMI mxSetDimensionsMdims return M ApplicationsMATLABR aappexternincludematrixh note expanded from macro mxSetDimensions define mxSetDimensions mxSetDimensions ApplicationsMATLABR aappexternincludematrixh note candidate function not viable no known conversion from const int to const mwSize aka const unsigned long for nd argument mxSetDimensionsmxArray pa const mwSize pdims mwSize ndims ApplicationsMATLABR aappexternincludematrixh note expanded from macro mxSetDimensions define mxSetDimensions mxSetDimensions UsersmeLibraryApplication SupportMathWorksMATLAB AddOnsCollectionspdollartoolboxpdollartoolboxe channelsprivategradientMexcpp error assigning to const int from incompatible type const mwSize aka const unsigned long nDims mxGetNumberOfDimensionspr dims mxGetDimensionspr ApplicationsMATLABR aappexternincludematrixh note expanded from macro mxGetDimensions define mxGetDimensions mxGetDimensions Error using forestInds Mismatch between data types Error in adaBoostApplyotftrans line ids forestIndsXmodelthrsimodelfidsimodelchildint I dont know what is happening and how to solve this Do you have any solution Thanks Trying to use this library with this circulant tracker code but anytime I try to run runtracker I get an error that says Undefined function gradientMex for input arguments of type single Can anyone help me Im running MATLABR a on a mac running Sierra Thanks Hi please help me to use acfTest function i didnt find an example to understand how inputs should be i dont know the structure of ground truth directory If using python is there a corresponding version When I perform the test how do I modify the parameters to reach of MR or do I need to modify some parameter training before testing thanks for your work but I am quite confused why your toolbox output just single dettxt as detection result for Caltech dataset and your evaluation code in Code needs much setvtxt to draw ROCs I find such conflict very hard to solve Is there any details I have missed Is there exist specific line of code to be set to solve it
