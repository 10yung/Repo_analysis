Added instructions on how to activate function keys for the Touch Bar Will you update this apps repository with the latest code from flourappnets release I think Fluor works great when running Microsoft Office applications in a Parallels Windows VM its so helpful It doesnt recognize the Windows application when Parallels is switched to coherence mode though it would be nice if it did This might be difficult to do so more of a wish list request than a bug report Theres an issue that reproduces often enough to considerable I think App does react on desktop apps being switched but it happens after some time several seconds This might cause confusion and undesired results Example I have Fn keys set up for my IDE and media buttons for everything else I use some applications then switch to IDE and want to skip song Pressing fn F I am in IDE already and I know that media keys here work with fn key only but system still thinks media keys are in priority so I get F pressed instead In different IDEs this might be set to different actions eg start building project which is something I dont want Can something be done about this Palua did not have this behaviour but it is not available anymore I use latest Fluor build with MacOS I know that there would be a lot of work to allow the functionality for external keyboards and this is why it wasnt done yet but why not to cope it with the script which will change the standard f key functionality in MacOS Preferences Something like the thing done here This could make it work with external keyboards with small effort What do you think about it I could also help with that even though I didnt program with Swift yet I know that for many users it is useful to have an overview on the current state of the app but why not to add the possibility to hide the icon in the menu bar I like to keep it clean without any additional apps like Bartender or alike Then it would be possible to access Fluor again after launching it one more time manually when it is already running I think that should be possible this is how the other apps often handle it for example BetterTouchTool That would be a nice addition to the current very beautiful UI The app crashes on me on Mac OS X El Capitan Nothing useful in the Console Exception Type EXCBREAKPOINT SIGTRAP Exception Codes x x Exception Note EXCCORPSENOTIFY Is this app not supported on This application works great with a keyboard however on my Touch Bar MacBook Pro when I click an application that has the function key override the default Touch Bar appears I want this setting to also toggle the setting under Keyboard Preferences Touch Bar shows F F etc Keys This way I dont have to press the function key so see the function keys hence defeating the purpose of the application When I click off of the application it should switch back to Touch Bar shows App Controls with Control Strip If you could do this Id gladly make a donation to the development team Not much to say here I just recognized that the icons placed in the switch elements are not scaled to fit the parent box See below bildschirmfoto um By the way there is another tiny thing that could be improved The About Fluor window does not have the option to close it so you actually have to quit Fluor and restart it in order to get rid of it bildschirmfoto um Keep up the great work and thanks for Fluor Icons in readme have been broken
