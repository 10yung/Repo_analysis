In the blogpost you ve considered unidirectional data flow UDF architecture in the Clean architecture CA context Thank you for this point I ve a question about A layers and UDF In CA the domain layer is only business logic and business entity the layer doesnt know anything about the presentation layer and the data layer The layer is independent Basically in CA the data layer has the state of the app The presentation layer has state of the screen such as isLoading isLoaded screen is green or screen is red etc But the domain layer doesn t it In the article you ve written that the store is the domain layer It s confused me bit I thought that UDF is more about the presentation layer in CA context For example you can switch MVI one of UDF implementations to MVP MVVM and back Of course you will have some bit change other layers What do you think about put the store to the presentation layer And side effects moved to the domain layer Thank you for the article What is happened if Ill remove syncronized I ve considered two options Method handle will execute on the storeThread or same thread Between lines of the code actionsofferaction and handleactionspoll its possible that will add many items to the queue But Im not seeing problems without syncronized Im feeling that missed important stuff in the sample Can you explain me about synchronized in this case
