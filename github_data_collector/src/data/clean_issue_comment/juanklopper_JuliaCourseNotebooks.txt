Hi Now that Julia v is out as a stable release is it possible to update the notebooks accordingly I have modified some notebooks for week and will continue the same for next weeks and can share them if that helps Thanks In cell the following warning is reported julia Setting up a custom stylesheet in IJulia file openstylecss A css file in the same folder as this notebook file styl readallfile Read the file HTMLstyl Output as HTML WARNING readall is deprecated use readstring instead in depwarnString Symbol at deprecatedjl in readallIOStream VarargIOStreamN at deprecatedjl in

IJuliasrcexecuterequestjl in eventloopZMQSocket at homeballengjuliav IJuliasrceventloopjl in IJulia at taskjl Given some of the information I had no patience for going through the whole traceback by calls related to rbg colors pointed to something related to color I tried changing the value associated to a color gray in the line argument to the values grey black and even getting rid of such portion and the error does not show up anymore in all three cases Dont understand if this is something related to julia jupyter or even emacs The latter seems less viable since the error shows up both in emacs using ein latest version installed from MELPA and firefox Im taking julia programming in coursera so Im very interested in a possible explanation for this behavior Thanks in advance Gustavo
