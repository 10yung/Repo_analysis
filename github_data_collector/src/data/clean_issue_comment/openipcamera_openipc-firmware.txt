I believe it should be possible to port over HomeKit support from Homebridge I am currently looking into it This would allow the camera to work directly without needing a bridge I am opening this issue so I can document any updates about what I find and anyone who has experience can help me Command fails without this Hey got this cam recently flash it according instructions on this repos page for v Model WYZEC etcosrelease ISAVERSION Now wifi is ok I can connect to the cam via http or ssh but No image on main page of webconfig and nonworking controls Whats in logs dmesg tcuchn tcuchn Motor driver busy now CPU RESET ERROR PC A A jzdwc jzdwc cgu clk gate get error jzdwc jzdwc regulator vbus get error tcuchn tcuchn speed set error xbsnddspioctl line SOUDND ERRORioctl command is not supported varlogboalog cat cant open sysclassgpiogpio value No such file or directory sh cant kill pid No such process May request GET sm ae b f b e afc d ee b f e fe f b a f map HTTP systemsdcardwwwsm ae b f b e afc d ee b f e fe f b a f map document open No such file or directory and so on Should I debug it somehow more or post certain logs to go further Not sure if this is the best forum for this but when I go to I receive a cloudfare error Error Ray ID c d b e c e UTC Origin is unreachable The Wyze Cam seems to be US a rebadged Hualai camera Neos Smartcam is a similarly rebadged camera in the UK In order to be able to revert to original firmware could process used to extract the original firmware be documented Those who purchase a different brand configured to connect to a different service etc could contribute original firmwares for recovery use Will the camera still work with the Wyze app alongside RTSP Im looking to use this the get my Wyze Cams running on iSpyrecord to my NAS and on OpenALRPlicense plate rec Is it possible to use this firmware also on Apleye wifi cam Looks like xiaomi copy added new driver sensorjxf ko to systemsdcarddriver modify runsh Load kernel modules insmod drivertxispko ispclk insmod systemsdcarddriversensorjxf ko datainterface pwdngpio resetgpio sensorgpiofunc still no image need help It appears everything was flashed correctly I get the webserver allows my to login but I cant do anything with the camera Any settings I change immediately revert to default and I do not get a feed from the camera it just says Unable to load image Im using a gb SD card formatted to FAT Ive also tried flashing the stock firmware back on but nothing I try works I tried putting the demobin in the root and in Main This camera is effectively bricked if I cant get a feed or change the firmware back to stock Any suggestions My understanding is that the wifi config stays on the sdcard of the camera I know most of the folks here are interested to use this camera as outdoor cheap security camera however this is a serious problem If some one steal the the camera they can easily read the wifi config from the sdcard gain access to your home wifi and play around with your home automation or other devices while staying in the parking lot The SDConfig should be moved to internal flash as soon as the firmware is installed May be something like small jffs partition like original firmware to store and handle modifications in the htpasswd and wifi config
