Hi Just wondering if you have the VAEGAN weights available still and are happy to share them Thanks in any case Arthur I may be mistaken about that but when I ran the code I got an error TypeError No conversion path for dtypeU After googling I added this type conversion and everything worked fine Hya both google drive dataset links doesnt work The database of image should be found in dropbox image but I cant get the file listattrcelebatxt There is a way to have it Greets Hey I have basically implemented a version of your model myself I got it to work on MNIST but I also want to make it work on other datasets My question is how did you find the optimal hyperparameters on the celebA dataset did you do a grid search regards Riaan Hi I found the code cannot produce the results showed in jupyter notebookIs there any chance that you can update the codes Really need some details to make VAEGAN works Hi I download your network and train it but the results are not good My results are so blurry and not humanlike How many epochs are needed to converge I observed that the results collapse after epochs All hyperparameters are same as your version Is there any optimization tip Any advice would be very helpful Thank you Normalizing the dataset to values in range done by this line faces faces doesnt seem to work properly at least not with the visualizations Is it meant to somehow improve the training process Really nice repo but appears prettytensor support is somewhat broken due to fast changing TF api Some issues similar to And the data is a bit harder to locate now due to downed links The attributes labels can be found here at least using explicit conversion to npfloat and inplace scaling saved me GB of RAM
