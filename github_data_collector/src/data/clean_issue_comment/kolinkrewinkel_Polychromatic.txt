It stopped working with Xcode Even with the trick to unsign the binary and update the plugins the extension doesnt work anymore The settings of Polychromatic are showing up inside the settings menu but the code doesnt get highlighted as it should This is most likely due to the fact that Xcode reworked entirely the code editor component It didnt seem that their extension framework was improved in Xcode vs what they announced and showed in Xcode so for now there is no way to get back the functionality in a more official way Possible using fpg MakeXcodeGr Again more info on alcatrazAlcatraz Any chance to fix that Happened on two computers Xcode img width alt src This is my first time try to use the plugin The steps I have proceed download the latest plugin Polychromaticxcpluginzip from release create a new directory close Xcode and reopen it ls Polychromaticxcplugin pwd UsersheefanLibraryApplication SupportDeveloperSharedXcodePlugins I cannot find anything about Polychromatic on my Fonts Color I am using Xcode May I know whats the reason and how to fix Thanks Is this still happening Or even part of the roadmap I remember an older issue open and came back to install again and try but its still poorly behaving not working cb ebad f f e c e fab Id love to know if there are any plans for this Thank you Shai If code is masked with ifdefs all classes in the nonactive parts will be colored See the attached screenshot taken by creating an empty project copying one method and disabling the code block bildschirmfoto UIApplication NSDictionary UIScreen and UIColor are colored I have no idea if it is possible but it would be great if the unused code is greyed out It would be nice if YES and NO could be seen in a RedGreen colour
