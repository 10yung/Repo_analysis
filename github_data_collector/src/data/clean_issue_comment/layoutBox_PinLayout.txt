When I specify as my dependency in a podspec file pod install give me the following error Unable to determine Swift version for the following pods PinLayout does not specify a Swift version and none of the targets XXXExample integrating it have the SWIFTVERSION attribute set Please contact the author or set the SWIFTVERSION attribute in at least one of the targets that integrate this pod Since we just remove version range in last release Can we keep the version setting using something like version range Thanks How can I cover the AutoLayout like below to PinLayout let view UIView let view UIView addSubviewview addSubviewview view centerXAnchorconstraintequalTo view centerYAnchor constant view widthAnchorconstraintequalTo view widthAnchor constant I have a line label that I need to size Id like it to be sized smaller if the text doesnt take up the allowed width so I use sizeToFitwidthFlexible However this will give the label its full size causing it not to truncate Is this the expected behavior I would have expected the label to be sized smaller if possible but still not overflow its allowed size swift let label UILabel labeltext blah blah blah blah labelpintophorizontally sizeToFitwidthFlexible label is sized beyond superviewwidth It looks like in computeSizeToFit the following line swift sizewidth adjustSizeTypeisFlexible sizeThatFitswidth fitWidth could instead be swift sizewidth adjustSizeTypeisFlexible minfitWidth sizeThatFitswidth fitWidth and the same for height Is this the intended behavior Or am I misunderstanding how widthFlexible is meant to be used Let me start by saying that PinLayout is a fantastic framework thanks for working so hard on it Would it be possible to remove the argument names from the relative edge layout functions Currently the English for most of them is incorrect For example leftof and rightof are perfect but the use of of in each function call in the first usage example viewpinafterof view beforeof view belowof view is grammatically incorrect Just a thought for readability Thanks again for the existing work on this library Just came across an unexpected behaviour Lets says i have a view with subviews that i layout side by side if i hide one of the views wrapContent on the parent view does not skip the hidden View so the parent ends up being too wide I was wondering if adding the following at the beginning of the wrapContent method would be desirable let subviews viewsubviewsfilter view Bool in return viewisVisible It requires adding isVisible to the Layoutable protocol which is fairly easy Thanks I have a UIScrollView which contains some subviews Im puzzled when I want to use these views to determine the scrollviews contentSize and frame size For example when subviews width is more than screens width I want to change the scrollViews width to screens width and the contentSizewidth to the subviews total width But now I use below method to achieve this tagScrollViewpinbelowof likeButtonmarginTop leftStatusTableViewCellHorizentalSpacing right heightof tagScrollViewContentView maxWidthConstantsscreenWidth StatusTableViewCellHorizentalSpacing tagScrollViewcontentSize tagScrollViewContentViewsize Hi Can you provide methods chaining in Objective C as it is available in Swift So I have a simple text defined as follows selfdescriptionCustom UILabelthen text descriptionLabeltext textColor white numberOfLines font UIFontname RubikRegular size baselineAdjustment none textAlignment left selfscrollViewaddSubview descriptionCustompinleft widthUIScreenmainboundssizewidth height top And this UILabel text changes dynamically the problem is that the top of the UILabel changes position either higher or lower depending on the height of the text while I want it Pinned no pun intented on the same spot and just to adjust its height vertically Is there a property I should be using or some special syntax Thanks Hi Could not add the possibility of changing views at once for the whole group as Stack View Im tired of trying to sort through all possible combinations of methods in the FlexLayout The task is simple at first glance img width alt src As a result I again returned to a clean PinLayout It would be great to add views to the main view and write the following code swift cardViewaddbigTitle blurView blurViewcontentViewaddprice textView textViewaddtitle subtitle cardpinstackaxis vertical alignment fill distribution equalSpacing bigTitlepininset sizeToFitwidth heightFlexiblemaxHeight blurViewstackaxis horizontal alignment center distribution equalSpacing spacing inset pricepinheight maxWidth sizeToFitwidthFlexiblepriorityhighest textViewpinstackaxis vertical alignment fill distribution fillEqually spacing
