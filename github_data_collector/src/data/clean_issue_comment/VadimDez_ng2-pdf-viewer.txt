mark with an x Regression a behavior that used to work and stopped working in a new release Bug report please search issues before submitting Feature request Documentation issue or request Hi Ive been struggling to find this issue but I could not make a progress so Im posting it here Basically I want to use pdfviewer component embedded in a div I have two divs left and right The left side has pdfviewer component and since its long it uses the windows scrollbar But I dont want to let the right component div to move so I gave a fixed height like vh to ng pdfviewercontainer class It uses the scrollbar in that div instead of window scrollbar and now all the features moving the scrollbar such as scrollToPageView and searching the words in the pdf document is not working Im assuming it manipulates the windows scrollbar not the scrollbar inside ng pdfviewercontainer div When I search a word I want it to scroll to the searched word or when I want to go to the page that Im looking for I want that scrollbar to locate to that page Does anyone know how I can do this with ng pdfviewer Thanks x Regression a behavior that used to work and stopped working in a new release Bug report please search issues before submitting Feature request Documentation issue or request PR introduced a regression in release A PDF file can be rotated when creatededited with a PDF tool Adobe Reader Preview etc The rotation is stored in the PDF file as a property Rotate eg Open a PDF in a text editor to check if it has rotation Note page orientation portrait vs landscape has nothing to do with rotation Before release The scale was computed as follows scale thisgetScalepage as anygetViewport scale width As explained here if the rotation parameter is not defined PDFJS uses the Rotate property defined in the PDF file Since release The scale is computed as follows scale thisgetScale page as anygetViewport scale rotation thisrotation width By default the scale is computed assuming no rotation thisrotation So if the PDF file contains a rotation of etc width and height are inverted and the PDF is displayed in the viewer with a scrollbar on the x axis if width is originally smaller than height This bug cannot be solved by setting the rotation option Solutions One solution hot fix is not to specify rotation in the scale computation if the rotation option has not been specified by the user However the rotation option will still not work for PDFs that already contain a rotation A better solution would be to take into account the Rotate property of the PDF Bugfix Stop multiple emits
