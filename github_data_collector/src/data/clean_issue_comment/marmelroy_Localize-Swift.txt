Security Alerts page details Hello Team I faced a very wiered issue While generating localize string if my string has then it will automatic adding space before the ex CSV file text maxamountThe maximum amount is RpJumlah maksimum nominal adalah Rp Localizable string maxamount The maximum amount is Rp See the space after Rp There is no space in content csv file Thanks Since pluralization use String class function localizedStringWithFormat which Returns a string created by using a given format string as a template into which the remaining argument values are substituted according to the user s default locale so it takes user s default locale For example if you have the device with English but in app choose Russian it will take the plural type for English but plural string for Russian We know that for English used only one and other types For Russian used all one two few many But the app in that case will return only one and other for Russian It goest to a correct stringsdict file but ignores plural categories which are not used in devices current language The problem is because when changing language in app we substitute bundle and then use this bundle to take localized string But in order to use pluralization we need to use only one available function for this localizedStringWithFormat And it uses the device localization It seems that its a bug because StringlocalizedStringWithFormat always use categories for current device language even if UserDefaultsstandard added a recent key for AppleLanguages Workaround Is to use custom implementation of pluralization I have a Swift app which have more than lines of translations from xliff files Every translations is generated through the Storyboard half of it or through NSLocalizedString with comments associated to it Is it possible to make this lib work as the code is at the moment Hey Hate to really be picky but on line of Localiseswift its if let indexOfBase availableLanguagesindexof Base excludeBase true But on master it is if let indexOfBase availableLanguagesfirstIndexof Base excludeBase true index has been depreciated and has been replaced by firstIndex Its not really an issue as such but just wanted to mention just in case if there were any other discrepancies between the versions This library is pretty awesome though and has saved me a massive amount of work getting the Welsh Langauge supported in one of my apps customer requirement Thanks Osian This question has already been asked and but I still could not use this library in ObjectiveC Are there any solutions Hi Roy I got an issue when I call setCurrentLanguage in my current project and a blank project It occurs when I use Fileplist and Localizablestrings under Base localization Ex I use HR for Croatian localization and Base for others When I set current language to EN I think my current language should be EN but It is my default language instead my default language is HR I dont know why my default language is HR because I tried remove my app then reinstall it I only call setCurrentLanguage one time when I press a button Do you have any ideas to resolve this issue Everything still be okay if I use them under specified language Ex EN for English and HR for Croatian Thank u very much Hi i am using this library and i noticed that the system buttons dont get translated to the users preference localization it is using the phones language that the user has in settings This is happening in navigation items back cancel keyboard buttons search Go Social share popup share cancel etc Could something be done for these issues Screen Shot at PM
