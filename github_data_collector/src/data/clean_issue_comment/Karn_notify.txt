Hi are there any plans for supporting setShowBadge channel config Thanks Are there any plans to support setFullScreenIntent I know I can get asBuilder and apply setFullScreenIntent but it is not desirable Thanks I dont like it grey In apps I tend to give notification creation responsibility to injectable interface that has a Real implementation The interface is mocked in my tests I could see this being a very big use case for this library in addition to the already great convenience Since youre using Kotlin this could just be an companion object extension that could be a testImplementation dependency Something like kotlin NotifywithMockcontext show Internally it would use Mockito or some internal class that isnt the real Android framework class Additional Notification Types Note This is an ongoing discussion planned notification types will be documented here STEPPER NOTIFICATION A Stepper notification type introduces the ability to step through a list of views it would be styled similar to the Google Maps navigation notification screenshot
