Runtime version b x VM OpenJDK Bit Server VM by JetBrains sro macOS GC ParNew ConcurrentMarkSweep Memory M Cores Registry NonBundled Plugins comalayouniansiHighlight izhangzhihaorainbowbrackets Ive a few points here that are all related First I would like to be able to configure one series of colours which is used for all bracket types I would like to be able to choose how many different colours are used Other similar extension do this by letting you configure colours and then setting a numerical config value specifiying how many of those colours are used Second I would like to be able to configure it so that the coloured nesting level changes each time any open or close is enountered Currently if I type in the following All the text will be the same colour I would prefer it to be using the rainbow colours so that each level of bracket causes a colour change The PHP template language Twig is not getting its brackets colored correctly Your programming languages Twig Expected Behavior The Twig brackets should either be rainbow or should be the default editor color Current Behavior The Twig brackets at all levels are the first rainbow color Possible Solution Perhaps the twig brackets can be ignored Code snippet for reproduce for bugs Please provide code snippet for reproduce bugs twig if foo for bar in foo bar endfor endif Your Environment Plugin version IDE

to change the brakets color he needs to change it at different places round brackets square brackets and so on Of course it is nice to have the ability to change each kind of bracketscolor individually But they are for sure some people like me who apply the same code to all kind of brackets It would in that case be very helpfull to have some kind of way to apply the colors dirrectly to all kind of braces Maybe with a global brackets line or a button that would fill all lines with the same colors as the currently selected bracket Please support us before creating a feature request

PythonCore comintellijresharperazure Current Behavior IntelliJ currently lacks of some advanced brackets manipulation abilities that i think they might be useful I know this plugin is mainly about colouring but maybe you will find my suggestions fruitful Feature A shortcut to remove current and matching bracket Lack of this one is pretty annoying How should it works You put the caret before a bracket and by pressing the shortcut it will remove the bracket and its matching one shorcut Or when the caret is within some brackets remove the closest ones but this could be kinda dangerous in languages that uses eg for codeblocks so maybe it could be optional setting Feature A shortcut to duplicate current and matching bracket Same as feature but instead of removing it will add brackets shorcut Feature A shortcut to changecycle brackets Similar to feature but instead of removing brackets it will rotate some preselected brackets In options can be a manualy editable textbar that contains eg and inside editor when you press the shortcut it will replace current brackets with following ones Eg a becomes a then a etc Bonus Feature A shortcut to select all content within brackets I know this one can be already achieved by expand selection feature but when you are really deep within nested brackets you have to repeat the action many times
