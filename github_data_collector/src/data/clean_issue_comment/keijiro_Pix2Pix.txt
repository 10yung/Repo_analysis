 pix pix Hi Keijiro first of all thank you for your all your contributions I am using Unity D on Windows and the newest version of Pix Pix does not work anymore The rendering issue is there again What I did so far I updated my Nvidia driver I checked my pict file if is in the StreamingAssets directory I updated my PostProcessing plugin to I checked almost every version I rebooted my PC I tried a completely different PC with same configuration Since I was testing your previous version of the Pix Pix Unity project I checked the older version with Unity D and it works like a charm Sadly the newest version is producing only this picture Hello Keijiro Great implementation and optimization Learning a lot about GPU compute by studying this code I am trying to get this to run on an iPhone X I believe it could just need to limit the kernel usage I might implement this myself and offer a drop down enum setting for mobile and desktop Have you any suggestions where to start in the code Ill then make a pull request so you can see if its worth it Regards
