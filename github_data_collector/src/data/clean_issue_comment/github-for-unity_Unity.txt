issue happens every time with that extension githubunitylog Each time I make a changes save my code within Visual Studio and then change over to Unity Unity hangs periodically the pointer rapidly changes between Windows waiting circle back to the pointer flashing about ever s While im waiting for GitHub for Unity to finish updating the repository changes I cant use Unity at all Usually this takes around s or so to clear and allow me to use Unity I cant justify using Git for Unity if its going to hang for s each time I make a change in VS These updates should happen in the background and not impact using Unity Versions Unity f VS GitHub for Unity Prerequisites Be sure to run with tracing enabled to capture runtime details in the log file githubunitylog Description When trying to push I get the error My previous push last week worked fine with no issues Ive not changed anything Git related between now and then Steps to Reproduce I dont know whats changed on my computer to have made any difference Ive not touched the Git installation Expected behavior No errors when pushing Ive been using Git for Unity for months now but this is the first time Ive had this problem Actual behavior This error above shows up which is not reporting any version Reproduces how often Additional Information I do not have Git LFS set up for this or any other project I have never used it Checking my Git version using Git Bash shows Im on windows but this is checking the version that I already had installed before using Git for Unity Pushing via Bash still works fine its only not working within Unity In Git for Unity under SettingsGit installation the paths lead to versions of Git and Git LFS that are specific to Git for Unity Inside the folders shown there theres a gitlfsjson file that says version inside I dont know how to check the version on the command line for these Hello I apologize for posting two issues in less than a day but something strange just happened to me while retrying to push some contents to my repo After waiting for one hour or more finally I got a popup from unity but it did say nothing just a popup with the title Push see screenshot I have no idea what the error is but I attached an extract from the log and if you ask I can post the full log later Reproduction Followed the guide Created a new private and empty repo Push the initial commit like the guide says Make changes to your project and commit them Press the Push button I think its important to note that the project already existed before installing GithubForUnity Screenshot Extract from the log logtxt Whenever you click the push button for large commits you will able to see a Pushing text at the bottom of the window but it stays for seconds and it vanishes no messages whatsoever Opening the Task Manager I was able to find that the Git procesec are still working uploading the data to the remote server but nothing is shown in Unity My suggestion is to put a info text progress bar or just gray out the buttons while the plugin is pushing the contents to the repo imagen imagen Hello am very happy to find myself here am new to unity can someone please help me out I want to do my final
