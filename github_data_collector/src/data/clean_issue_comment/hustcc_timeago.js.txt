This repo claims there is a cool tiny js library called timeagojs Every link points to this cool github repo Ive downloaded everything Ive found They look perfectly cool but there is no timeagojs anywhere Maybe the timeagojs isnt something we can download its a vision and a dream about the time the future timeagojs is something everyone talks about prepares github pages documentations and readme files but noone knows where is it In domts getDateAttribute fetches the custom datetime attribute javascript export function getDateAttributenode HTMLElement string return nodegetAttributedatetime But AFAIK HTML would prefer the use of data prefixed custom attributes I am in a development environment that returns proxy objects instead of direct DOM references The handler for this proxy is strict and does not pass back any value to the datetime attribute If the target attribute were optionally datadatetime that would work and be more HTML ish Perhaps javascript export function getDateAttributenode HTMLElement string return nodegetAttributedatetime nodedatasetdatetime for backwards compatibility More validation is probably necessary for the above any help to add urdu locale Hi thanks for your work to support Hungarian and let me have a suggestion to the Hungarian translation Past tense versions of the texts are perfect Future tense version are grammatically fine but I would use a different format For example English In minutes Current Hungarian translation percen bel l means for me sometime between now and minutes later Suggested translation perc m lva means exactly minutes later from now I understand that this means nothing for hustcc but I hope that kukac and szilardka accept my suggestion In case of yes I can create a merge request Basically I want to achieve the same thing as Actually the function requested in I am adding a Spanish version of my app and am using this library The issue is that I need to register a language tied to a locale however Id prefer if there was an option to register it for language only For example instead of registering timeagoregisteresES es timeagoregisteresMX es timeagoregisteresAR es Id want to do something like timeagoregisteres es Is that possible The locales is here you can add the miss name Please sort by dictionary Please ensure the accuracy Please keep file size tiny How to Add you locale file into locales dir Add you locale key into file Add testcases into testslang dir Then run npm test if all passed then commit the pr x ar az az x be x bg bs x ca cs cy x da x de dv x el x en x enshort x es et x eu x fa fi x fr x gl x he hr x hu hy id x inBG x inHI x inID is x it x ja jv x ko ky lt lv mk x ml x my x nbNO x nl x nnNO no x pl x ptBR pt x ro rs x ru rw si sk sl sr x sv x ta x th x tr x uk uz x vi x zhCN x zhTW Thanks
