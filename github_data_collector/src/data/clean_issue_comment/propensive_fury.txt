This should test whether the latest version of Bloop works now BSP traces are very useful for debugging but writing them all the time as older versions used to do is an overkill I think a good middle ground would be writing the trace to a userdefined output file when a special flag is present Steps to reproduce Start Fury as a Nailgun daemon Compile furyfrontend Introduce a compilation error in one of the modules on which furyfrontend depends e g furycompile Recompile furyfrontend Observe the incomplete graph and a build diagnostic message or multiple messages Restore the incorrect code to the state exactly as before the error was introduced Recompile furyfrontend Observe the complete graph and zero exit code despite the diagnostic messages Notes The spurious diagnostic messages dont appear if the fixed code has differences e g in variable names from the original code The spurious notification buildpublishDiagnostics which signals compilation errors contains the lines of code as they appeared before the error has been fixed However this is not the same notification that might have been cached anywhere inside Fury it is a new notification sent by the build server which contains outdated information This doesnt prevent the server to compile the corrected code successfully This also happens in the watch mode as automatic recompilation is triggered This issue is one of possibly multiple causes that constitute We dont get dependency suggestions from projects in imported layers any more None We should support configuration of packaging for JAR files which sits on top of the graph of modules
