The module uses an ordered hash RGBColors to store colors namevalue pairs This is properly scriptmodule scoped At times it is useful to access the list of colors from a script in order to populate the color parameters of functions like NewChartLegend eg pull random colors to populate a legend This can be achieved by either adding theRGBColors variable to the ExportModuleMember OR creating a purposeful public function to export the hash The latter has the added advantage of avoiding potential variable collisions How should we proceed Currently ApexCharts are locked to older version but with new Apex polyfills are removed Using it with IE If you need to make it work with IE you need to include these polyfills before including ApexCharts promisepolyfill classlistjs blobjs This needs to be testedincorporated DataTables when Tabs or Collapsed Sections are used require refresh when switching tabs or expanding collapsed section to make sure they are displayed properly Unfortunately my poor JavaScript skills provided a fix in two places to resolve that but the fix is so performanceintensive that its driving me crazy Its because every time section is expanded or tab is switched each and every table in HTML is recalculated when the only subset of tables should be Need to find another way to do it On JS level find out how to do it properly Use PowerShell and put those recalcs in proper places only targetting particular data tables Wait for DataTables to fix it When using the like and contains operators in NewHTMLTableContition and viewing the output in IE the unsupported IE includes JS method breaks DataTables Simple fix below LIne of PSWriteHTMLpsm posh switch ConditionOperator contains if data ConditionHeaderNr includesConditionValue if data ConditionHeaderNr indexOfConditionValue like if data ConditionHeaderNr includesConditionValue if data ConditionHeaderNr indexOfConditionValue default if data ConditionHeaderNr ConditionOperator ConditionValue This could be further simpified by using the Regex parameter for the switch statement posh switch Regex ConditionOperator containslike if data ConditionHeaderNr indexOfConditionValue default if data ConditionHeaderNr ConditionOperator ConditionValue Something that I would like to have ability to create with PSWriteHTML Some possible solutions I would like to have automatic dark mode switch available I would like to have manual switch available This looks easy but theres a lot of things to make sure things run as required TablesDiagramsetc Not easy unless I miss something obvious When creating a dashboard using the AutoRefresh option Internet Explorer always reverts back to the first tab while Chrome will stay on whichever tab youre already looking at This may be a limitation of IE but it would be great if we can get it to match the behavior of Chrome
