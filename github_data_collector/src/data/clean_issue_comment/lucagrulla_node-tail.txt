receive only security updates if desired details Problem I have a file being constantly written to Im using nodetail to watch this file and Im piping the data through a socket to the front end Unfortunately instead of receiving the latest appended information Im receiving everything a very basic example Im not using a socket here just console to log out the results const Tail requirenodetailTail const tail new Tailfile tailonline data consolelogdata Can we have a last position on unwatch from where we can resume if we re watch the file again This feature will help in making the system fault tolerant Please look into this Could you please add an option for tailing the last few lines Perhaps replace fromBeginning with lastLines or something that takes either an int value or true or something which is a special value which means from beginning Hi I have a log file that I want to watch and which triggers rename events every now and then without being actually renamed truncated or deleted If I do a normal tail f logfile I get the updates as expected When using nodetail however the internal fswatch treats some of the updates as rename events rather than change events This might be a platform issue Im using Mac OSX or an issue with the process that creates the logfile I have no idea but when I force nodetail to use fswatchFile the problem goes away Since rename events reset the interal position and have a second reloaddelay Id like there to be a way to ignore these rename events and treat them as normal change events Because change handles logfiles that are suddenly a lot shorter ie when actually renaming a file and replacing it with an empty one perfectly fine I dont see any harm in adding an option that allows the user to override the default behevaiour What do you think I also updated the docs to outline how these options could be used along with the other options that were already there but not yet documented Cheers Steffen I did some improvements and new features on the tail add a abstract SequenceQueue which control the element of queue was produce one by one next will be process only if previous done This also fix a bug of edge case add feature like tail F in linuxunix which can handle relink rotate rename can tail a file which not exists at first reserve file descriptor to avoid reopen file repeatedly unwatch can return the current position its very useful for some case some application want to resume from last position after transient shutdown
