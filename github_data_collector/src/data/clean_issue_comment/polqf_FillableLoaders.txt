 Is there any method or event that notifies me that the loader finished its job I want to show another animations after the loader finished the progress animation When I add this to my project via cocoa pods its missing the function to set the mainBgColor Is there any way to update the version on cocoa pods Great framework its awesome thank you for sharing One improvement I would like to suggest is to either rename rectSize to height or actually make it a CGSize I think making is a CGSize would be more work since it may alter the dimensions but it should be renamed to height since it can be a little misleading Id be happy to make a PR
