Hi Im Emanuele Iannone a master student at University of Salerno Since my bachelors thesis I have been working on a code smell refactoring plugin called aDoctor which is able to identify and fix energyrelated problems in Android apps I launched it on your project finding different instances of code smells I chose one of them and let the plugin automatically fix it In this case I chose Member Ignoring Method that is present when a non static method does not use at all instance variables and other non static methods These kind of smell may have a non trivial impact on energy consumption as shown in this paper Besides this kind of refactoring does not impact on the functionalities of your app so it is totally safe Let me know if you are interested in this refactoring proposal There is new model of Nokia launchedwill oscombb work with it Can someone recommend me please Cause androidapt plugin is incompatible with the Android Gradle plugin Please use annotationProcessor configuration instead Please help me fix it Could you please help me fix it ERROR Could not initialize class iofreefairgradlepluginsandroidAndroidProjectPluginProjectType Hi my question is does this app root access I install it and run a FBTS using openbts and SDR I also implemented some parameters of stingraybut this application doesnt show any warning thanks for your help Is this app still working in I remember I used to have it and would like to install it again Thank you for your feedback Please add below details so that we can help you a bit faster Agreements Please check these boxes to ensure youve actually read and understood these important rules x I have reviewed and accepted the guidelines for contributing to this project x I have searched the open Issues and made sure I am not filing a duplicate x I have read the notes on debugging and will properly maintain this Issue Overview Please add a short and easy to understand description of the Issue youve experienced here X I have reviewed and accepted the guidelines for contributing to this project X I have searched the open Issues and made sure I am not filing a duplicate Fastlane and TripleT are two tools for syncing app store textsgraphicsscreenshotsetc from a git repo to Google Play Both of them are also directly supported by FDroid Weblate just launched a beta feature for directly translating the app store namesummarydescriptionwhatsnew texts As far as I know no other translation platform supports these file formats See this in action for FDroids Android client Follow the beta here comradekingu Sir Please refer following code snippet from Devicejava for MCCMNC parsing code switch phoneId case TelephonyManagerPHONETYPENONE case TelephonyManagerPHONETYPESIP case TelephonyManagerPHONETYPEGSM phoneType GSM mncMcc tmgetNetworkOperator if mncMcc null mncMcclength try if cellgetMobileCountryCode IntegerMAXVALUE cellsetMobileCountryCodeIntegerparseInttmgetNetworkOperatorsubstring if cellgetMobileNetworkCode IntegerMAXVALUE cellsetMobileNetworkCodeIntegerparseInttmgetNetworkOperatorsubstring catch Exception e loginfoMncMcc parse exception e networkName tmgetNetworkOperatorName if cellisValid GsmCellLocation gsmCellLocation GsmCellLocation tmgetCellLocation if gsmCellLocation null cellsetCellIdgsmCellLocationgetCid cellsetLocationAreaCodegsmCellLocationgetLac cellsetPrimaryScramblingCodegsmCellLocationgetPsc break The line cellsetMobileNetworkCodeIntegerparseInttmgetNetworkOperatorsubstring should be cellsetMobileNetworkCodeIntegerparseInttmgetNetworkOperatorsubstring Otherwise digit MNC code will be parsed incorrectly Thanks Thank you for your feedback Please add below details so that we can help you a bit faster Agreements Please check these boxes to ensure youve actually read and understood these important rules x I have reviewed and accepted the guidelines for contributing to this project x I have searched the open Issues and made sure I am not filing a duplicate x I have read the notes on debugging and will properly maintain this Issue Overview Please add a short and easy to understand description of the Issue youve experienced here AIMSICD version see the About screen Phone and ROM running current release Link to logfile without identifyable data Reproduction Please tell us the detailed steps on how to reproduce your Issue here References If your Issue is related to any other existing Issues or pull requests please link them here Screenshots If you experienced visual glitches please add a screenshot without metadata here
