Whether this is entirely related to Catalina or not I cant say Prior to the new macOS I had some scripts for iTunes actuated from the keyboard Moving to Catalina I modified the scripts to work with the new TV application Going to the Scope tab under Trigger I then replaced iTunes in the applications list by TV with Enabled in selected applications but the script wasn t triggered by the shortcut Selecting Enabled in all applications makes the triggers work and bizarrely enough selecting Disabled in selected applications also works Hi I associated a shortcut to trigger the opening of finder CMDE In Mojave this fails to bring focus to that window as you can see in this screen cast Somehow thew open trigger is only able to change the focus of the menubar which is useless and odd I have used this shortcut for years in previous OSX versions and it is only now in Mojave that the problem present itself Describe the bug If I try to copy and paste something in iWork Pages specifically it will instead paste the object I copied previously This doesnt happen with text only sometimes with objects or groups of objects To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Open Pages Make two sets of objects a rectangle some text and an equation Im not sure which of these are actually required but this seems to work Copy the first set and paste somewhere else Copy the second set and press paste When you paste the first set will show up instead of the second Quitting Quicksilver seems to stop this behavior and turning off the Clipboard plugin also seems to help after a restart of Quicksilver Expected behavior When I copy an object it should be available to paste right away What version of macOS What version of Quicksilver This should force some lingering UI things onto the main thread These have been warnings for a while but under Catalina they will crash QS Progress toward Hello I am almost certain I am posting in the wrong place but I am new to this stuff and I cant figure out where else to post it I am sorry to be contributing to any unwanted chaos If someone would like to tell me how I should have known where to put it then next time I will know how to look for the information more effectively In any case please direct this to whoever should be aware of it For questions or tech support please start with the users group If you know the problem is in Quicksilver itself report it here Im not making a google account and this also doesnt sound particularly appropriate for that Describe the bug This is about the page Under the heading Quicksilver all but one of

InnOut mins mostly about dragging and dropping to and from QS links to actually goes to which has nothing about Quicksilver that I can see Arrowing mi links to that page exists however the URL for the

macOS irrelevant What version of Quicksilver irrelevant I was just copying and pasting large Adobe Illustrator files MB into my clipboard for image editing work Quicksilver was storing these files in its clipboard and then subsequently saving them to disk using QSLibrarian saveShelf every time the clipboard changed clipboardChanged notif This was causing QS to hang indefinitely writing a GB file to disk every time I copypaste Solutions that come to mind Have an option to limit the filesize saved to the QS clipboard Dont save the clipboard to disk every time the clipboard changes but either a save it periodically eg every s if anythings changed downside is some things might be lost if QS crashes before saving the latest clipboard b Use some binary file format for saving to disk and only make incremental edits Or maybe just something like SQLite to insert new items at the top of the list and pop old items off the bottom of the list Open for discussion but noting this issue here now For questions or tech support please start with the users group If you know the problem is in Quicksilver itself report it here Describe the bug A clear and concise description of what the bug is To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Go to Click on Scroll down to See error Expected behavior A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen Screenshots If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem What version of macOS What version of Quicksilver Finder has a setting in the Get Info window of a document that can set a document as a Stationery pad basically a template file With this setting every time the document is opened its copied and the copy is opened Quicksilver does not follow this behavior and always opens the template document itself Steps to reproduce the behavior Go to a document in Finder Open Get Info window for the document Make sure the Stationery pad checkbox is checked Open the document from Finder to see expected behavior Open the document using Quicksilver to see erroneous behavior Expected behavior A copy of the document should be created and that is what should be opened Im not sure whether Finder handles this normally or instructs the opening application to make a new copy Screen Shot at PM macOS Quicksilver For questions or tech support please start with the users group If you know the problem is in Quicksilver itself report it here Describe the bug I assigned a trigger to Search Artists for the iTunes plugin but when I press the keys nothing happens Its probably a bit early to report but Im using macOS Catalina Beta Ive added Quicksilver to Accessibility and Input Monitoring in the Security Privacy prefs pane Also when I try going to Run in QS and type in search by I get the attached result Search Contents of null To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Install the iTunes Plugin Assign a trigger to Search Artists eg CmdShiftCtrlA Press trigger keys nothing happens Tried rebooting and relaunching QS no love Expected behavior Quicksilver dialogue opens with Search Artist icon showing Screenshots img width altScreen Shot at AM src What version of macOS Beta A t What version of Quicksilver Describe the bug If the Current Document proxy object is brought up in the first pane when a nondocument based app eg Safari is frontmost four error message notifications are immediately dispatched to the Notification Center This happens even if the Current Document proxy object is only momentarily in the first pane while the user is typing to select something else eg the Current Web Page Safari proxy object To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Open Safari and make it the frontmost application In Quicksilver bring up the Current Document proxy object in the first pane See one notification banner reporting the error pop up Open Notification Center and see that there were actually four identical notifications sent and that macOS merely collapsed them when showing the popup banner Expected behavior Ideally a single notification would be sent only if Current Document was still selected in the first pane when the focus moves from the first pane to the second pane That way if Current Document was in the first pane temporarily while the user was in the process of selecting something else the user will not be bothered by unnecessary error notifications One way this could be achieved would be to queue up the error message notifications in an internal buffer and then use some simple conditional logic to see if the queued notifications should actually be sent at the appropriate time To make it generalized and extensible this queue could keep track of both the notification message properties and the conditions to test with true as the default of course Plus using queue would make it easy to detect and skip any duplicate notifications that might have been generated so that only one copy of each unique notification message is ever sent What version of macOS What version of Quicksilver
