 Quick POC for SPEC Will link this PR to a Ruby ticket once one exists This is a first attempt at adding auto encryption to insertone and find This is a result of me digging around the command pipeline and trying to figure out where best to put the encryption decryption Id love some feedbackguidance Mainly Im wondering is there a more central location where I can get the command for any operation in the correct format Why doesnt insert have a builder like find does Should it None
