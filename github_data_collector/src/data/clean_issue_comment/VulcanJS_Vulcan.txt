Need upsert mutator like this javascript return upsertMutator collection Movies document movie data movieData validate false The query field on a nested schema doesnt seem to get the data from another collection So CollectionUtilsgetCollectionAsOptions does not get the data it needs to have a select within a nested schema Since Meteor uses a really outdated Nodejs version v while the latest LTS version is already on x it is highly likely that the Nodejs version on anyones computer still defaults to x it is better for the npm packages to be installed with the Nodejs installed with Meteorjs Instead of doing a npm install meteor npm install should be used in and If you dont want to expose meteor cli to the user maybe wrap it around a npm script and call it something like installdependencies and ask the user to run the following instead npm run installdependencies npm start Hello I added new views for the MuiRadioGroup to display columns of MuiRadio if the max length of the label is columns of MuiRadio if the max length of the label is columns of MuiRadio if the max length of the label is and made some minors changes to the responsivity of already existing views Also I fixed some margin issue with the label The label had a px margin and the radio none So the label was higher than the radio You can find here screenshot of a SmartForm with radiogroup on different devices Thanks in advance official selectmulti example the special handling of a change is relevant only while native and multiple are selected This needs to be properly tested before getting merged Based on Unit Tests it does not break anyting When building the demo application for the new datatable with loustak we will make sure to try this commit out dation errors Currently Vulcan does not support a required field that is created via onCreate A really common example is dateCreated but in general it should be possible to have fields that are required but generated by the server in onCreate One could argue that passing a dummy value would solve the problem While this might be reasonable for dateCreated it is not a general solution since there may very well be fields whose purposeexistence is completely hidden from the client Bumps handlebars from to details summaryChangelogsummary Sourced from handlebarss changelog v September th Fixes Security Disallow calling helperMissing and blockHelperMissing directly c Disallow calling helperMissing and blockHelperMissing directly c Features Add new runtime option allowCallsToHelperMissing to allow calling blockHelperMissing and helperMissing Breaking changes Compatibility notes Compiler revision increased b This means that template compiled with versions prior to will not work with runtimes The increase was done because the helperMissing and blockHelperMissing are now moved from the helpers to the internal containerhooks object so old templates will not be able to call them anymore We suggest that you always recompile your templates with the latest compiler in your build pipelines Disallow calling helperMissing and blockHelperMissing directly c Calling helperMissing and blockHelperMissing directly from a template like in blockHelperMissing was never intended and was part of the exploits that have been revealed early in see It is also part of a new exploit that is not captured by the earlier fix In order to harden Handlebars against such exploits calling thos helpers is now not possible anymore Overriding those helpers is still possible If you really need this behavior you can set the runtime option allowCallsToHelperMissing to true and the calls will again be possible Both bullet points imly that Handlebars is not percent compatible to despite the minor

Webpack version necessary to build Storybook This needs us to update Webpack to at least This locks us to at most to support dynamic import But maybe the second issue is now solved so we should try a
