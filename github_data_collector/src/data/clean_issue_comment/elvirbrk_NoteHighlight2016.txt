Its been a while since Microsoft allowed people to use the night theme of OneNote As of right now to get the proper color I need to switch back to light mode and then after importing I need to switch back to dark mode Could dark mode compatibility be a future option Is it possible to install NoteHighlight on a windows installation withouth administrator rights Under python when copy to clipboard is selected the number of spaces will double This is a great plugin but is it available for OneNote running on Mac Just to change the packaging should be simple if it does not involve too much code change ts vb I installed latest x package but was unable add addon Is Office Onenote works with this addon Windows x Enterpr Office Professional Plus x OneNote build ClicktoRun Firstly can I just say thanks for creating a great little addon It works perfectly Im also surprised that MS havent already integrated the ability for keep font formatting within OneNote though What I have noticed is that if I place my cursor at the end of the a paragraph and use the insert function the addon defaults the insert to the to the top of the page While this isnt a massive issue as I can just copypaste it would be nice if the addon picked up the cursor location on the insert and placed the text accordingly First off i want to say how usefull this addon is truly something that MS should implement as standard functionality It makes have notes with code so much better Thanks for your work Request It would be handy if we could set the default box color across all languages Currently it does not save box colors not even for one language Is it possible to enable this on office online version of onenote Could you please add powershell markup
