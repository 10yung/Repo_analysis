I installed Flycut on macOS Mojave and clicked on deny for some initial permissions Now I cant use it even after reinstalling another version Please help thanks It would be good from a security standpoint to enable the user to list specific applications from which they do not want Flycut to copy text The most urgent use case is with password apps The one I use OneSafe copies all text to the clipboard as NSStringPboardType which I believe indicates simple standard text For that reason if I include this clipboard type in the Dont copy from password files Pasteboard types it would block all text I would assume OneSafe is not coded correctly to indicate a Password PboardType but there may be other password applications that have the same flaw I would love to move all my passwords to another password app but who has time to mess with that I would love to be able to tell Flycut to ignore all text from OneSafe Thank you FlyCut was working fine on older macOS versions Right now Im not able to paste from the Clip History It was working fine in Catalina Beta versions as well something seems to be broken by Catalina Im using the latest Flycut version keenly awaiting fix for the issue At the moment when I press the hotkeys the bezel appears with one clipboard item in it and it works like a paging system having to press the hotkey again to get the next item Would it be possible to have an option where pressing the hotkey shows a list of all the clipboard items with the most recent highlighted and then continuing to press the hotkey selects the next item I find that when Im doing a lot of copying and pasting being able to see the whole list makes things much quicker Cheers Id like to request to make Clear All confirmation optional and configurable via the control panel am ready to finally upgrade Mac OS to Mojave but am first wanting to know if Flycut is compatible or not ive been using Flycut for years and IMHO its quite simply the best clipboard app id like to not loose it if possible is this still being developedmaintained if not can somebody suggest an alternative that works similarly by having clipboard items viewableuseablepasteable via the menubar thanks Even though I dont have Launch Flycut on login ticked img width altimage src my computer launches FlyCut on login Ive noticed in System Preferences Users Groups that FlyCut is here img width altimage src Any ideas why Would anyone recommend an alternative keyboard hotkey for FlyCut Im just wondering whether this nice utility might be lowering the guards on security and what could be done about it It is common practice to copy and paste passwords Thus having a history of clipboards certainly raises an issue here How secure is the default macOS clipboard Does Flycut use the same mechanism Might add an option to enable Secure Keyboard Input Or add extra functionality for password type clipboards Link to awesome Stack Overflow post on Secure Keyboard Input When typing it would be very convenient to see Flycut in the rightclick list of options with the contentoption list Not sure if Im explaining that well please see the attached mockup example flycut
