Hello Im a student who uses Linux for research Previously I used Ubuntu for my study and I bought MacBook and continue my research at Mac The problem is that its a little different from Ubuntus environment and Its a bit different from the way Ive installed it before I changed the login shell to bash after learning that it is a z shell in Ubuntu not a bash shell used by Ubuntu My main program are opensource research programBERT GMT run on Python and After the anaconda is installed programs cannot respond or operate if there is a problem in the path Anaconda was installed using homebrew and could this be caused by the Python version of an anaconda and the low version of a Pyenv installed using homebrew causing a path conflict I wonder if there are any errors due to installing an anaconda using homebrew installing an earlier version of Pyenv and installing a program using other installation commands such as pip or apt using different commands It seems to be a mess because Ive installed it here and there When a program called GMT was installed it was installed using a package file The problem is that when I run the installation file inside the package file the terminal opens and It want it to work inside However there is no command when the program is operated using the command in the terminal rather than running using the application Is this also caused by incorrect routes or installation It turns out that the reason it doesnt work is a complicated installing programs and Im going to try to install it step by step after resetting the OS I try to install most of the time using homebrew and I try not to use any other command as much as I can if you see any of the above problems how do you want to install the packages I still dont understand how these path problems and environment variables work because I dont have enough systematic study on linux and my English is not enough but please understand Hi I just tried to install maccli and I see it install git by brew I suggest to add a configuration step by asking git path so it will be not installed again In trying to installuse maccli on a brand new install of Mojave I was unable to install glances resolved by installing via brew install glances or successfully run the pip portion of mac update with the command as currently formatted Specifically pip list outdated formatfreeze local grep v e cut d f xargs n pip install U results in a whole long list of Could not install packages due to an EnvironmentError SystemLibraryFrameworksPythonframeworkVersions privatevarfolders Errno Operation not permitted whereas substituting pip install user worked like a charm I know I could try to findmake these changes and submit a PR but Im still not exactly a paragon of confidence in codinggithubetc So Im just letting anyone know who might care joegalloxor mac info swvers ProductName Mac OS X ProductVersion BuildVersion F joegalloxor mac bluetoothenable Bluetooth enabledNC No matching processes were found It says bluetooth is enabled but doesnt seem to actually have any effect Hi I found that after the first successful mac update operation it always fails at sudo gem update system and sudo gem update I found that it could be manually fixed by reinstalling those gems with gem install XXX userinstall and mac update would work for once and the same problem came back Though gem update system always fails I later found out that this is due to that I replaced the systemruby version x with the one I installed with rbenv And it turns out that if rbenv or RVM is used it would broke the ruby installation if sudo is used during upgrades An upgrade to maccli is needed st during the original installation the script should check whether rbenvRVM is used and prompt to ask the user whether to elevate the privilege with sudo command during updates And for existing users there need to be an option in usrlocalbinmac file st they could specify whether sudo is used or not Thanks update should remember your settings it is very annoying to type paths again I run the installer for the first time and it installed composer on my machine which I dont need The command mac hostsedit is part of the commands for Lamp Utilities When I run it it does nothing I looked at the lamp file under the plugins folder and I dont see a command for it Running mac help I get following error usrlocalbinmac binsh M bad interpreter No such file or directory Confirmed with cd usrlocalbinmac MacCLI doesnt create the directory And binsh M looks like an python script error Just installed newest node and npm versions using Homebrew python version Python pip version pip from usrlocallibpython sitepackages python I have latest MacOS Sierra and tried both installation methods FastCLI installation seems to fail since it is not reachable with fast But Glances works
