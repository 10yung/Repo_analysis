am not sure if its a bug or there is no implementation Expected behavior AnimationView is visible Reproduction steps Create new XamarinFormsmacOS app Add AnimationView to your XAML page Configuration Version Platform iphone iOS robot Android checkeredflag WPF earthamericas UWP apple MacOS tv tvOS x monkey XamarinForms Questions and Help Im building a Xamarin Forms app with Xamarin Lottie Im running it on an android device with Android The animation I am using has merge paths and did not run on my device I checked the logs and found the following log LOTTIE Animation contains merge paths Merge paths are only supported on KitKat and must be manually enabled by calling enableMergePathsForKitKatAndAbove I checked a few articles that say it should be enabled in the android side I wasnt able to find this in the current pacakge v How can I enable the same Bug Report i have to rollback to where the AutoPlay works Expected Lottie animation should start automatically I have to go to another page then pop back for the animation to start Version Platform x robot Android x monkey XamarinForms Bug Report When the AnimationView is placed as an element within a CarouselView the AnimationView will stop animating when swiping to the next or previous slide When coming back to the stopped slide the animation does not continue It looks like a freeze of the Animation This is seen only in Android iOS is working just fine Expected behavior Either the same as in iOS where the Animation just finishes or the animation should continue once coming back to the stopped slide First solution preferred Reproduction steps Place a AnimationView within a CarouselView Giving it a longer animation makes it easier to reproduce Once the AnimationView starts animating swipe to the next or previous slide Go back to the slide with the animating view The animation will be frozen Android only Configuration Version Platform iphone iOS X robot Android checkeredflag WPF earthamericas UWP

dont have a reproduction project right now but Im having trouble using Lottie in XamariniOS I added an animation to the BackgroundView of a UICollectionView when the collection is empty eg no result found view When the collection receives items then I pause and dispose the animation remove it from its superview and null out the BackgroundView The problem is scrolling becomes jittery when I scroll up and down This only happens if I have called Play on the animation To me it looks like there is a memory leak somewhere var lotAnimationView LOTAnimationViewAnimationNamedanimation lotAnimationViewLoopAnimation true lotAnimationViewTranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints false uiStackViewAddArrangedSubviewlotAnimationView lotAnimationViewWidthAnchorConstraintEqualTo Active true lotAnimationViewHeightAnchorConstraintEqualTo Active true lotAnimationViewPlay causes jittery scrolling when BackgroundView is disposed Expected behavior LOTAnimationView needs to be disposed properly so that UICollectionView performance is not affected negatively Platform x iphone iOS robot Android checkeredflag WPF earthamericas UWP apple MacOS tv tvOS monkey XamarinForms Feature Requests Hey thanks for this lib Can you please upgrade Lottie Android to Thanks Platforms affected mark all that apply iphone iOS X robot Android checkeredflag WPF earthamericas UWP apple MacOS tv tvOS monkey XamarinForms We have a need to customize some animations in our application for that to work we either need to generate the json dynamically or load it from an external resource Is there any example on how to load the animation from a stream or string Ive only found how to load it from a resource file Feature Requests Summary description of the feature Remove usage of LottieUWP which has issues and use latest Lottie controls from Microsoft MicrosoftToolkitUwpUILottie github repositiory which uses the Composition Layer to render the animation Contextualize the feature Where does it fit in the framework and why its being included there This would affect the UAP renderer Describe the feature Use as much detail as possible here See Summary Platforms affected mark all that apply x monkey XamarinForms x checkeredflag WPF X earthamericas UWP iphone iOS robot Android apple MacOS tv tvOS Questions and Help Added note This is specifically for a Xamarin Forms Application May be I am not looking in the right place but is there an example in Android that will allow this code sample This works in iOS but Android does not find the File I want to be able to dynamically change my LogoView Animation at runtime based on either a download or a request from an Embedded Lottie Resource in my DomainServices Assembly But my goal is not to have the Animation in an Asset in Android Any example would be great Again this code runs fine with iOS as it allows me to specify my path in iOS but in Android it appears to only be looking for Assets c The Returned Path that I am writing to
