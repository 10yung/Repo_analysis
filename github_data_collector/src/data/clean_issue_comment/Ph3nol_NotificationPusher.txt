I find it rather surprising that the facade sends each message to every device instead of treating the input as a list of pairs I suggest that this is explicitly stated in the documentation Or the code could be changed Also the response array is somewhat buggy It only contains the last response for each token Ive got Sly NotificationPusher Exception AdapterException while processing one user notification to my surprise his token was characters length and Pusher check didnt pass it though Ive googled the question and it seems like Apple guides are quite clear about it APNs device tokens are of variable length Do not hardcode their size I guess it should be fixed according to guides I am sure that it worked before but recently I found the following log in laravellog localERROR exception Sly NotificationPusher Exception PushException with message Bad Request invalid message in mnthomeapachevendorslynotificationpushersrcSlyNotificationPusherAdapterGcmphp I tested it by creating a simple program and I confirmed that it works for iOS meaning that the contents of the message would be OK But I faced the same error of in case of Android I found the following source code in the server PHP public function pushPushInterface push client thisgetOpenedClient pushedDevices new DeviceCollection tokens arraychunkpushgetDevicesgetTokens foreach tokens as tokensRange message thisgetServiceMessageFromOrigintokensRange pushgetMessage try thisresponse clientsendmessage catch ServiceRuntimeException e throw new PushExceptionegetMessage if bool thisresponsegetSuccessCount foreach tokensRange as token pushedDevicesaddpushgetDevicesgettoken return pushedDevices The error occurred at thisresponse clientsendmessage When I checked the source code in GitHub and I found that the source code is slightly different Should I update it This is my first time to open an issue in GitHub so I am not sure how I should do Anyway any information is very helpful because I am now in stuck Hey there I plan to develop a new version of NotificationPusher this year including many new features and a Dockerized standalone microservice K s ready Dont worry this current version will continue to exist as a legacy version This lib has been writen in After K stars on Github and M installations it could be great to develop a new opus of it Of course this new version will respect all current PHP standards DDD TDD powered Some questions for you What do you think about it Any ideas or suggestions for this new version I take this message to thank all the contributors THANK YOU you rocks guys Feel free to sponsor this project with clicking the Github Sponsor button If this allows I will push the project further hosted mode SaaS service and more I just found out that notificatinData is required for sending messages through FCM for android Without that param the response shows no errors but messages dont come up in the android app params notificationData title this is my title body this is my notification text message new MessageThis is an example params So I think the documentation here is misleading This code will send same message twice pushManager new PushManagerPushManagerENVIRONMENTDEV push new PushgcmAdapter devices message pushManageraddpush pushManagerpush pushManagerpush Is it expected behavior or bug PushManager cant be reused to send another batch of messages Hello Is there any way I can push MDM message such as mdmPushMagic When is the FCM HTTP v API supported url Example curl X POST H Authorization Bearer ya ElqKBGN RiUzHnSuNreA H ContentType applicationjson d notification title FCM Message body This is a Firebase Cloud Messaging Topic Message topic foobar HTTP Hello when I run the following code I get the following error push new Sly NotificationPusher Model Pushadapter devices message pushManageraddpush pushManagerpush foreachpushgetResponses as token response vardumptoken vardumpresponse Call to undefined method Sly NotificationPusher Model PushgetResponses I found this WARNING Version v would support only php Please update your composer config if needed in the README However I dont see any commits that tagged with x So Im wondering how can I install version x or it just doesnt exist Thanks
