For I would like to propose to make use of Composers cabundle package Integrating this packages could make it a lot easier to support SSLHTTPS Just like tbar and bgaillard in I wasted an hour to figure out why my API call wasnt working and just like them it turned out I hadnt configured curl properly Since I am not the first and probably not the last integrating this package sounds useful to me My understanding is to use the Add Product API first then initiate the Create Member API before joining the shopping cart and then execute the Add Shopping Cart API is this correct It would be nice to have an method like isSubscribed which would have arguments listId and subscriberHash and would return only boolean public function isSubscribedint listId string subscriberHash bool The Batchcheckstatus method might timeout but its arguments list doesnt allow to set the timeout value Id like to add the argument timeout MailChimpTIMEOUT to checkstatus This is a handy optin errorhandler Based on my past MailChimp experiences I found there are many ways a MailChimp request can fail and many try rightfully to handle them over and over again This error handler classifies a couple of failures and should help programmers to simplify their own errorhandling routines Since errorhandlers also implement some logging alongside which can hardly be extracted out of the errorhandling itself some logging capability are provided and try to play nice with user not providing a Psr Log LoggerInterface PR related to errors I need sent in api call multiple emails This example from mailChimp documentation curl request POST url user anystringapikey header contenttype applicationjson data members emailaddress uristmcvankabfreddiesjokescom status subscribed emailaddress uristmcvankab freddiesjokescom status subscribed emailaddress uristmcvankab freddiesjokescom statusifnew subscribed updateexisting true include How can I use that library to pass multiple emails Add function to check if mailchimp api key was set eg php mailChimp new MailChimpgetenvMAILCHIMPAPIKEY if mailChimphasApiKey do nothing when no api key was set return mailChimp most use case if you register MailChimp class in dependency injection container so you avoid to inject also the api key to all services to check if its really needed I am try to get merge fields but I am unable to guess the exact syntax if this i capable of getting mergefields Code is like include MailChimpphp listid POST listid apikey mykey use DrewM MailChimp MailChimp MailChimp new MailChimpapikey response MailChimpgetlistslistidmergefields printrresponse I have also tried response MailChimpgetlistsmergefields listid and response MailChimpgetmergefields listid and a whole bunch of other combinations but everything produces Array type title Resource Not Found status detail Invalid path instance a f f edeaada cf e I am able to get list information so I have the basics working I dont see any mergefields when using response MailChimpgetlists listid which does return the details on any specific list I originally thought that this GET would show the mergefields but they are not included in the array Thanks
