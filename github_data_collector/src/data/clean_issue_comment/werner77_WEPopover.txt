 UITableViewCellContentView translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints unrecognized selector Fix is quite easy various ways to do it but one option is below Change Line in WEPopoverControllerm to if viewautoresizingMask UIViewAutoresizingNone view respondsToSelectorselectortranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints viewtranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints If you set WEPopoverContainerViewPropertiesshadowColor to a solid color it doesnt work as expected This is because the shadowView is empty and thus wont cast any shadow The solution is to manually provide a shadow path You will have to adjust the path or the WEPopoverContainerViewPropertiess background image or margins You can put this line inside WEPopoverContainerView initFrame after the shadowView frame is set bgViewframe bgRect PROVIDED FOR CONTEXT shadowViewframe bgRect PROVIDED FOR CONTEXT set shadow path here when shadowViewframe is set we need it since the shadowView is empty and wont cast any shadow shadowViewlayershadowPath CGPathCreateWithRectshadowViewbounds NULL Hi First thanks a lot for your great work Here is what Im trying to achieve I have a UITableView with custom cells subclassed Cells are composed of some buttons that should present WEPopover on touch The touch action is implemented in the cells subclass I would like to allow Up and Down arrow directions as in the Demo project I succeeded in presenting the popover but arrow directions seemed to be ignored Indeed whatever the space available its always the same direction Here is the code used in cells subclass selflikeCommentPopoverController presentPopoverFromRectselfcommentNumberButtonframe inViewself permittedArrowDirectionsUIPopoverArrowDirectionUp UIPopoverArrowDirectionDown animatedYES I tried to present it from tableView but it doesnt work CGRect rect selfsuperviewsuperview convertRectselfcommentNumberButtonframe fromViewself selflikeCommentPopoverController presentPopoverFromRectrect inViewselfsuperviewsuperview permittedArrowDirectionsUIPopoverArrowDirectionUp UIPopoverArrowDirectionDown animatedYES Have you got an idea to achieve this Thanks a lot Anthonin for example iOS need a rootViewController set to window add other little change Sadly there were still some issues on Popover it cant run as well as iOS and before I just want to be clear the project on Xcode I had to increase the border for the background arrow by one otherwise I had a border of one pixel between the popup body and the pointing triangle be d c makes WEPovoer more similar to the iOS UIPopoverController Add roundxroundy at the end of calculating the origin of arrow to avoid blurring drawing
