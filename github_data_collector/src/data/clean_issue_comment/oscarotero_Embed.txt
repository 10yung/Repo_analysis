I created a folder name it embedcode in that folder I installed the embedembed NixasMacBookPro embedcode Yanick composer require embedembed Using version for embedembed composerjson has been created Loading composer repositories with package information Updating dependencies including requiredev Package operations installs updates removals Installing composercabundle Loading from cache Installing embedembed v Loading from cache Writing lock file Generating autoload files NixasMacBookPro embedcode Yanick I created a file embedcodetestphp and add the code php use Embed Embed Load any url info Embedcreate vardumpinfocode But I get Internal Server Error Failed to load resource the server responded with a status of Internal Server Error Can any one tell me how to install Embed without composer I read this If you cannot or dont want to use composer just include the PSR autoloadphp file in your code but where to include this and do I have to download the files or just use it Hello I love this tool unfortunately its not working for exemple on this web site I read somewhere that The fix is to add the useragent in the request headers Hope it can help Cheers Is there any Embed alternative for node js I think this package really awesome Changed log Fix failed assertions during unit tests work Because of the TLS handshake issue it should have set the current PHP versions during Travis CI build Drop php x version support because the handshake issue cannot be solved And these versions are so old that we should not maintain that Let the package require php version at least and define this setting inside require block in composerjson Got an error with this url but it works with demo Invalid url Status code Hi I love this library However it seems to keep files open after a curl request I cannot seem to find where exactly but it varies between files after a request It looks like it is something in the CURL call Hey first of all fantastic library Im using it to power and its working amazingly well So cheers Sometimes the widthheight and aspect ratio properties are null but the embed code has a defined size For example no dimensional values get extracted from Google Maps links but the resulting embed code includes an iframe with the widthheight set to What do you think about extracting these values from the embed codes as a fallback Using DOMDocument you could parse the HTML query for an iframe and get the widthheight attribute values and style properties incase widthheight are set there Though Im not sure what scope youve set for this library or whether something like this would be reliable Im currently doing the above in my project and would be happy to open a pull request implementing this here When I retrieve soundclouds infos from url getTags always returns the same array string record string sounds string share string sound string audio string tracks string music string soundcloud I notice that the soundcloud adapter is just the Webpage class maybe we could add another adapter and override the getTags method This json from this repo
