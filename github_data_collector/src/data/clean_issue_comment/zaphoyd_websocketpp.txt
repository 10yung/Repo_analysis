Hi what is the blocker in creating a new version that considers the issues with boostasio since version Im aware that the develop branch addressed this issue but the situation is far from being perfect especially if you use librariesrepos that include websocketpp like ie cpprestsdk Attached is a patch for master that works with boost tested under Windows by compiling the cpprestsdk VS and boost VS and bost and I know the patch is far from optimal but it already would help all the cpprestsdk users that cant downgrade to boost Makewebsocketppusablewithboost andhigherzip Hi Ive a use case to send a continuous audio stream to a web server using TLS wss and receive corresponding text in a bidirectional streaming manner I have to repeatedly send audio to the server until no more audio data While the audio is being sent server will start sending responses with partial results after some intervalfrom the time it started receiving audio Im a beginner and could not find any samples or examples to do the above tasks It would be great if I can get some example or pseudo code to do the same Thank you Hello I have some difficulties when I use this lib on windows my boost is what should i do C local boost boost asio impl executorhpp error C const Executor with Executorstdreferencewrapperboostasioioservice thanks very much Fix misplaced quotes this was leading to spurious in compiler cmdline Remove demanding libc clang can link with both libc and libstdc and platforms have their own defaults user can demand non defaults via adding it to cmake flags Hello I have followed the broadcast server example here and it works but when my client connects to the server using socketioclient I get a CORS error server error Handshake ended with HTTP error fail WebSocket Connection ffff v Mozilla Windows NT Win x AppleWebKit KHTML like Gecko Chrome Safari socketioEIO transportpolling tMB tVA websocketpp Upgrade required client using Chrome Access to XMLHttpRequest at from origin has been blocked by CORS policy No AccessControlAllowOrigin header is present on the requested resource How do I enable CORS on the server This is my unsuccessful attempt mserversetvalidatehandler websocketpplibbind websocketvalidate this websocketpplibplaceholders bool websocketvalidatewebsocketppconnectionhdl hdl serverconnectionptr con mservergetconfromhdlhdl conappendheaderAccessControlAllowOrigin return true Validate never gets called This should fix FTBFS against new scons something is amazing happened when I compiled this project successfully step git clone the master branch step mkdir build cd build step cmake the result seems to be ok just like this step make install it seems to to be ok anyway just like this but I can not found the lib as it tell me in the location UsersadminDesktopwebsocketppmasterbuildlib there is no lib folder in the build folder so where is it thanks for your help For some reasons systemthreadrandomunittestframework was seen as a single module because of the quotes Helps install cmakefiles in right libdir Signedoffby Khem Raj rajkhemgmailcom I am writing a gateway listening on multi ports for websocket connections and a timer that must be called every loop I dont want to use multi threads Also I want to have a time manager that is not too precise which make a system call at the begining of every frame The time manager also need to be called in the main loop I just dont know how to listen on multi ports and how to execute my perframe callback Thanks very much
