How do you use a drop down list to select the monthyear for the calendar I followed your technique for using AJAX to change the months but a dropdown list would save a ton of time Best Hi I have a partial view of both the monthcalendar and the weekcalendar I want that div only to be reloaded when I click on the linkto but I am not able the configuration that comes on the page only says how to configure for the general calendar In my visitors views weekcalendarhtmlerb weekcalendar events events do date appointments span classdatestr dateday span appointmentseach do appointment div hour

in the calendar Something like this weekcalendar attribute recurrentdates events posts do date posts postseach do post posthour Where recurrentdates is an array of dates Any ideias Hi Chris Im an active user of simplecalendar and I want to start contributing Itll be a good way for me to get my feet wet in the world of open source development Are there any features that youd like to see added that I can start building Thanks Patrick Can you show week number on the weekly calendar view Like January has w to w Like in this property for rent listing Is it possible to strip the days that are not in this month from the monthcalendar Currently if the st of the month is on Wednesday the Monday and Tuesday before it are listed as the last days of the previous month Could these days that are not really in that month be suppressed Great gem by the way Thanks Allow the use of html in the enlocales file for simplecalendarprevious and simplecalendarnext This allows us to use font awesome tags for the previous and next links Hi When I try to set google calendars startdatetime as the attribute of monthcalendar monthcalendar events eventlistitems attribute startdatetime do date events datestrftimed eventseach do event div eventsummary div end end There is NoMethodError undefined method datetime for startSymbol But when I try to set nonnested ones like updated as the attribute attribute updated It worked well BTW when I render the eventstartdatetime directly in the same page it looks all right I just cant set it as the attribute successfully How could I solve this problem Thank you Gloria I was thinking of improving the calendar It would be good that the the table classes can be overwritten by your own customed classes You have CSS for everything else except table I had to change the ID of Events I want on calendar to be digits So when I try to show the calendar with these events I get is out of range for ActiveModelTypeInteger with limit bytes Is there a way to solve the issue
