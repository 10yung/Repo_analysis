outer println ok outer println try to get first element tref testing The output is try to get first element outer ok I see that println prints out one argument each time without eager evaluation when the evaluation has side effects such as println the output seems broken I would expect this output outer ok try to get first element This is sort of a continuation of but seems to be a distinct issue Im not getting much output here maybe theres a flag I can pass for more verbosity make CMakeFilesaotaudiodspdirbuildmake libsaotcachextmaudiodspso Segmentation fault core dumped make

CMakeFilesMakefile CMakeFilesaotaudiodspdirall Error make Makefile all Error Hi I am getting following error Analogue Synthesizer Reset eval unbound variable R Trace oxygene I do here a swooosh sound initially Hi all I recently upgraded from to HEAD and found that midi notes were being dropped constantly It seems to happen when more than one note is played at a time The notes that go missing appear to be completely random When I play the same sequence of note chords over and over again different notes are missing each time It rarely plays all four notes but it always plays at least one note Most of the time at notes are missing I have used midi monitor to make sure the problem wasnt happening in my midi host Either way the same code in never misses a midi note Not sure how to debug this one Jason Hello I am new to extempore I was checking out the docs and it told me the binary release may be a good option to get me going so I tried that out So I got the from here which was released in April I am running it on macOS Mojave Now I see that I am good to go I went on to the guide to try out instruments on this page However the code below does not work for the makeinstrument macro does not work but if I change it with bindinstrument it works lisp load the instruments file sysload libscoreinstrumentsxtm define a synth using the provided component fmsynth makeinstrument synth fmsynth add the instrument to the DSP output sink closure bindfunc dspDSP lambda in time chan dat synth in time chan dat dspset dsp play a note on our synth playnote now synth random second I checked out the other issues and the code and see that the makeinstrument macro was added in so I guess the documentation is up to date but the recommended installation method is old since the latest release is My suggestion I think most beginners will first try out with the binary example code in the documents but I understand it is probably hard to sync the version of the docs and the codeperhaps write somewhere in the docs that the sample code there works for the newest code and not necessarily for the newest release build Other than that nice project I am learning extempore in the docs A lot of comes out in the chapter of Notelevel music Therefore I think that it would be better to assign to variables Examplelibscorepcivlxtm lisp define pcnaturalnote What do you think A homebuild of the current master branch crashes on define a Hi I actually started out with a PR to the docs but it seems the html is autogenerated and my phrasings arent nativeenglish anyway so Im just going to throw a couple of suggestions at you instead as I go through the docs while learning extempore Im running Extempore using a Macbook running OS X and its builtin soundcard In the examples in add a note about how to stop the infinite sequence of callbacks eg by redefining foo to a noop In first example explain that the naming of the dsp function is arbitrary but probably a convetion I assume Youre talking about a special function dsp but it seems thats not the case Its only about the signature of the function In same example using a bit more precision on Pi eg avoids a periodic click in the output In the second example same page I needed to userandomf and not random a lucky guess on my part Ill add more as I progress on the current master branch compiled from source when I evaluate sysload libsexternalopenglxtm the following error occurs sysload notification base already loaded Lib Load libGL dynamic library loaded from usrlibx linuxgnulibGLso DECL declare void
