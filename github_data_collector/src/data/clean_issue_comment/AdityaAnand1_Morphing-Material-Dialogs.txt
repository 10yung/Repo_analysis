apps buildgradle android dataBinding enabled true dependencies implementation comgithubAdityaAnand MorphingMaterialDialogs implementation comafollestadmaterialdialogscore I noticed that v of Material Dialogs must be used v will not work and throw errors Will you support V sometime Current readme also references v instead of Thanks I managed to rebuild your standalone morphing dialog to my liking however I found out the creator of MaterialDialogs also has a color picker dialog which I would like to use morphingly as well However upon inspection of the code he appears to use a fragment and the standard android Dialog system for this We cannot simply getView and put it inside the morphing activity Any ideas of how to manage to do this Hello I came across your amazing project and i wanted to help contribute to your awesome project I created a logo for you Two design styles based on similar idea concept i focused more on minimal style simplicity and clean You are free to choose any design style you like the most and good enough for your project If you find any of the styles good enough and you like it please do let me know and i will gladly send you all the files you need both the vector files all for free logo designmorphing dialogspresentation logo designmorphing dialogsidea concept logo designmorphing dialogsidea concept Just going to think out loud in here Okay so the material dialogs library offers a great deal of customization Ideally Id like the morphing animation to work well with all of it Duplicating the API is hardly a good solution might work as a quick hack right now but in the long run a better architected solution should obviously be preferred Can we somehow just transmit the MaterialDialog root view from the calling activity into the MorphDialogActivity Well wont that be nice But I think not possible without leaks Ill look into this first But I think my best bet is to somehow save the state of the MaterialDialogBuilder to be reconstructed in the MorphDialogActivity Perhaps by extending and implementing Parcelable Or something like that
