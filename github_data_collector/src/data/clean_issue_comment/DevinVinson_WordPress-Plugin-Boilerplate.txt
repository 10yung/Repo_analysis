Hi my plugin based on WPPB is working but I need to make some updates that require a database migration How can I handle this I can see the version definition in the main php file define XXXXVERSION Once I have updated this to say how can I detect that the plugin is outdated and perform some actions I mean is there already some boilerplate for this Im having huge trouble in getting the boilerplate to share data between classes As an example Im defining a protected property protected pluginurl in includesclasspluginnamephp Its populated when construct runs I can access the property in that class using thispluginurl However I cant get it to work in publicclasspluginnamepublicphp Tried all of the following with no success thispluginurl pluginurl parentpluginurl selfpluginurl Ive noticed that none of the Boilerplate classes extend the core class which means that none of the properties or methods can be easily shared I thought that replacing class PluginNamePublic with class PluginNamePublic extends PluginName would do the trick but no luck Any suggestions I see that overall the Boilerplate works around this by redefining pluginname and version in each class Seems like a massive duplication of data every single time Particularly with a plugin that may end up growing to dozens of extra classesfiles Is there a reason why the boilerplate uses nested classes Could this be why I cant access properties defined in one class in a subclass like PluginNamePublic Please help Thanks Changed Currently plugin version to Current plugin version very minor change Hi in the constructor of WordPressPluginBoilerplatepluginnameincludesclasspluginnamephp we are loading admin hooks in the publicfacing site and public hooks in the adminfacing site thisdefineadminhooks thisdefinepublichooks Maybe something like this could help if isadmin thisdefineadminhooks else thisdefinepublichooks Regards Hello I found an interesting Template Help me figure this out Template author couldnt help me How to display this code on the pages of the site echo scriptalertgetoptionwpttextblockscript How to do it correctly according to the architecture of this plugin I cant understand the structure of the plugin Do I need to create a file for an external template or do I need to create a function in the class Help me please This change allows WPs predefined filtershooks to be added without a component For example addfilter custommenuorder returntrue can be added with thisloaderaddfiltercustommenuorder null returntrue Hello I think this is a nicer solution and more readable for newbies to understand this code functionality Thanks Add a shell script to make all the plugin name substitutions automatically without changing those that should not be changed Tested working on OSX shell
