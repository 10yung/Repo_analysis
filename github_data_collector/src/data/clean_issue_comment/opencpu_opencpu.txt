it is available Reason Im asking I m trying to run openCPU using the openCPUdebian docker image and a Docker in Docker approach Startup works fine but every request fails with status code System failure for aachangeprofile No such file or directory I think this might be related to but Im not able to run the Container in privileged mode in the Docker in Docker use case which unluckily I require for running TestPipelines on GitLab If I understand correctly from the Docu AppArmor should not be used by openCPU on Debian by default I guess since the parent container image is Ubuntu and they share the Linux Kernel it still tries to use AppArmor which then can not mount securityfs PS The openCPU Server Container works fine if I run the container without Docker in Docker on a maschine without AppArmor available Hi if its not already possible to use GitLab webhooks will you include that feature in future versions Although I have a GitHub account I mostly use GitLab now Thank you Irucka I am trying to save plotly as svg locally using the code if requireprocessx installpackagesprocessx p plotlyz volcano addsurface orcap surfaceplotpng This requires the installation of orca I installed it on my Windows and the above code runs fine locally However the orca cannot be detected if I use ocpucall in javascript to the function containing the above script It returns error of The orca commandline utility is required for this functionality Please follow the installation instructions here I am running a webapp with Angular frontend and Nodejs backend I cannot import ocpu object in the opencpujs script like shown in the documentation and appdemo example because the script that makes the ocpu requests is completely separated from the client thus it doesnt have a window object Is there an alternative to ocpucall in Javascript that still allows me to manage opencpu sessions I tried using the request function in Javascript but the sessionid is treated purely as a string when passed as an argument in JSON format I should also mention that I tried adding the sessionid as a parameter directly to the request URL but opencpu doesnt seem to recognize it For example this request URL would give this error localhost ocpulibraryDNFAPIRtestSessioninput argument input is missing with no default In call testSession I just successfully pushed my R Package on the cloud server and got

and Ive been running into some issues I cannot seem to actually run a container without failure crashing The issue is that Im given an error stating that Starting periodic command scheduler cron cron cant open or create varruncrondpid Permission denied fail AH Syntax error on line of etcapache sitesenableddefaultsslconf SSLCertificateKeyFile file etcsslprivatesslcertsnakeoilkey does not exist or is empty Action DFOREGROUND failed The Apache error log may have more information Even with something as simply as just a From OpenCpuBase seems to net this error While this is probably an issue on my end because Im not particularly familiar with OpenShift do you have any suggestions on how to circumvent this problem I am trying to install an R packages pcorr in my opencpu website But it returns an error of unable to install packages The warning message says lib usrlibRlibrary is not writable So I tried to change my lib when using installpackages But none of them works Here are the libs that I tried usrlocallibRsitelibrary usrlocallibopencpusitelibrary usrlibRsitelibrary usrlibRlibrary usrlibopencpulibrary Here is the console Please help Thank you
