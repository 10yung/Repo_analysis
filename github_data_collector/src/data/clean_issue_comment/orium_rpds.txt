 See af a f d d e List Stack Queue Vector HashTrieMap HashTrieSet RedBlackTreeMap RedBlackTreeSet Add info to the READMEmd and maybe to the documentation of the data structures Ref I was experimenting with using a RedBlackTree as a priority queue and ended up with rust let nextwork queuefirst if let Somek nextwork queueremovemutk It would be nice to have a popfirst that removed the first item and returned it in one impl utest bench See Empty data structures should need no heap allocation Vector See HashTrieMap See This is bad because it involves more heap allocations and also more efford when Vecs need to expand To not lose the ability to configure the branching factor this is better done when is ready and stable If we need this before constgenerics stabilize then we can use the smallvec crate some type aliases impl utest bench See
