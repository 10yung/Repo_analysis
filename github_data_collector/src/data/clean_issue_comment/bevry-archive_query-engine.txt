errors now it will output the path that failed to be found as expected v September Report the correct error for missing action requests Ensure docpadplugintester dependency is latest v September Swapped out promptly for inquirer which brings back Node v support regression since v Close issue v September Add logging support to the pluginloader to make debugging plugin resolutions easier Fixed failures of plugin loading and creation not being reported correctly Ensure all dependencies are the latest right now to help fix false negatives in plugin resolution Close thread v September Fixed initialising new projects regression from v docpad init will now prompt for skeletons before v this was done via docpad skeleton which was removed Upgraded remaining dependencies Upgraded promptly dependency from v to v Swapped superagent for nodefetch Close issue v September This release focuses on eliminating the situation where DocPad would initiate with invalid configuration that would then need to be overwritten later this could cause plugins to not load correctly invalid configuration persisting and general instability until the correct configuration was loaded Now the correct configuration is loaded from commencement Due to new dependency requirements the minimum supported Node version is now Node version which drops support for Node versions and Closes issue Fix DocPad not working on windows regression since v Closes issue thread issue issue Progress indicator will now pause once the action has completed and resume on new actions this allows for cleaner shutdowns with no change of ability Graceful shutdown is now offered by the destroyOnExit configuration option which uses processonbeforeExit docpadonBeforeExit to destroy DocPad gracefully This is now possible as we dont have to support Node Before we had to do graceful shutdowns in a more complex and manual manner which resulted in less graceful shutdowns DocPad will now longer output The action completed successfully as unless an error has displayed then evidently everything remains successful Debug log file will now only be removed if it needs to be replaced with another one Fixed nocolor CLI argument and color configuration option not working Closes issue Color now correctly defaults to environment support Also now supports colour and nocolour Removed prompts CLI argument and prompts config option in favour of the progress CLI argument and progress config option as that is all prompts did really The CLI has been rewritten and simplified The commander package has been swapped out for the cac package Closes issue Customisation of the out path via a CLI option now occurs via outPath to remove ambiguity with docpad render out file customisation Introduced verbose and debug CLI options such that one can do silent debug For docpad render there is no longer a delay to check for stdin however if you are using stdin you must now provide the stdin CLI argument stdin reading abilities has been moved into the docpad renderStdin method and render has gained support for it as well as support for writing an output file Global CLI options are now parsed before DocPad is instantiated to ensure configuration is correct from initiation rather than incorrect at instantiation then made correct later This removes built in support for customising this however no one should be customising global CLI options anyway As expected consoleSetup event fires after DocPad is ready and commands can be added to the cac instance in the event options trtable truncated details details
