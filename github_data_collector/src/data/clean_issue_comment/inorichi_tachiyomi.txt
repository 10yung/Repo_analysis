I am reading Manga horizontallylandscape on my phone so that I get the biggest viewing area I then scroll down each page from top to bottom reading all the segments then I switch to the next page When I use a Bluetooth controller or Mouse scrolling doesnt actually scroll the page in Tachiyomi it just go to the next page I tried every kind of button on a keyboard as well and nothing seem to be able to scroll the pagewas trying to find a way to bypass it with keybinds It would help me a lot if the scroll function actually scrolls the page up and down Instead of switching page I can make this kinda work with the Webtoon viewer already but it scrolls in increments and is hard to follow Best regards Device information Tachiyomi extension version Tachiyomi version r Android version Steps to

comandroidinternalosZygoteInitmainZygoteInitjava Story I dont know how many people are like me but I chose to read many manga from Manga Rock As you know Manga Rock has now shut down and I have to migrate a lot of manga to new source The experience has been very time consuming I tried to think up a better way to better migrate manga to new source and Id like to share this and maybe get some feedback WhatRequirements Here are some wireframes I made tachiyomi Its quite similar to whats already happening right now when you try to read theres a toast message saying that the source has shut down please migrate But I thought of adding a Migrate function here This can also be placed permanently on the page not just as toast After you tap on Migrate you have basically have a predetermined search page looking for the same title but with more info title mangaka last chapter last update to make sure that youre choosing the same manga from a new source thats hopefully up to date with chapters as well Confirmation page Also gives option to sync read chapters info default is ON Tapping on Migrate will bookmark same manga from a different source unbookmark manga from old source sync chapter read info I think this simplifies manga migration by quite a lot What do you think Device information Tachiyomi version r r until the latest r Android version I want to say sorry My English is poor and I did try my best to tell what happened At first I was used r but when I tried to update I found it didnt work After tried several times I can install r r but the versions newer than r cant install It always said App Not Installed I really dont know how to fix the problem A support version of SQLite was bundled at some point for KitKat This should no longer be needed Commit WhyUser BenefitUser Problem Well it sucks to be unable to rename the default category WhatRequirements When there are more than one Category the ability to rename the default category should be added WhyUser BenefitUser Problem should be added because if I am watching the chapter and then I want to save it I have to download a chapter that I already saw It is a way to save mobile data by not downloading something twice WhatRequirements I would like you to add an option to save the chapters of the series automatically when they are read Example I opened the first chapter of a series and read it completely Upon reaching the end of the chapter it is saved automatically Only saved when it is read completely If it is not read completely do not save it Device information Tachiyomi version Android version Steps to reproduce Set frequency of automatic backup Wait then check the backup folder Expected behavior There should be a new json file in the backup folder Actual behavior No new file is created Other details Battery optimization is disabled for Tachiyomi Already tried reinstalling A backup was successfully created once but over several days no new backups were created Max backup files is set to I talked to another person in the Tachiyomi Discord server who is having the same problem Me ransan The other person Soundtrack Chaos They said they were using Tachiyomi EH so this bug is something that originated from this repository and got carried over to that fork They also found that for some reason setting the frequency to hours got the automatic backup to work properly I am currently testing this I do not yet have results but I will update this issue as days pass to see if it works They told me and I agree that the fact that they managed to get it to work is nice and the hour interval doesnt have any major effect on usage However it is still unnecessary for the apps to create backups that often so it would be nice if the other backup intervals would get fixed Device information Tachiyomi version Android version Steps to reproduce Find a manga with seasons counting chapters for each season individually Complete a season while having the tracker synced Continue reading till youre on a new season The tracker will now stop tracking Expected behavior This should happen The tracker should still track what chapter youre on despite there being a new season Actual behavior This happened instead The tracker stops when a new season starts Other details Additional details and attachments No additional info needed Please make a fix for this its infuriating having to manually update it after every chapter and keeping track of what chapter youre on App version Android version IssueRequest Manga download getting stuck Steps to reproduce if applicable I thinks it happens when the download gets interrupted Other details
