DistroDE regolith ubuntu basedi i bar is losing some clicks one miss in every or clicks sometimes more and I cant find the reason Tried compiling i blocks from source regolith uses the i xrocks fork which has the same issue but problem remained Ive used this minimum configuration to reproduce click fulltextClick me commandecho date s Got clicked with button BLOCKBUTTON tmplog Thats everything on cfg file Im running it like this from i statuscommand pathtoclonedi blocks c i xrocksconfig vvv tmpi blockserr This is the i blocks version i blocks Vivien Didelot and contributors And this is the i bar version i bar version Axel Wagner and contributors And when I download i blocks from ubuntu repo i blocks Vivien Didelot and contributors I got the clicking right but its not the best solution as Im using the new features from This is the log from clicks the rd and th lost The spaces were added for clarity after each click lineclineparse nameclickbutton modifiers x y relativex relativey width

reproduce this problem With this PR you can make statusbar output looks like eg powerline Example there New field in config fulltextpattern Value of this pattern will be parsed and all values

community edition After a full system update I could only see GPU USE GPU TEMPmy own scripts and the date in my i blocks and none of the rest I think this is because i blocks was not recognizing i blockscontrib anymore I figured out a hacky solution I took the relevant script out of their folders in i blockscontrib and it started working again SCRIPTDIR was correctly set to i blockscontrib location But this did not work when I switched GPU to intel only the GPU blocks still showed up taking space just that they were empty since there was no GPU to detect I guess this should not happen it did not happen before the blocks before that took up that space I decided to start from scratch I purged i blocks from my system I installed i blocks from pacman as linked in the i blocks README According to the instructions on the README I executed git clone configi blocks cd cp configexample config but I am only able to see the date and the time blocks on my i blocks bar The same problem as before Is it possible to pass secret variables via the environment to i blocks scripts This is useful for API keys for example Im sorry if Im just being stupid but i am new to most of this I have tried using multiple different one line commands inside the config file commandcurl commandecho curl i have tried making basic scripts binbash IPwget qO echo n IP all of which work when i run them outside of i blocks and they also work for my mate using them inside i blocks XDGCONFIGDIRS can contain multiple elements separated by colons which should be searched in order Addresses and Currently a line isnt read if any error is reached including EAGAIN which indicates youve reached the end of a file descriptor This commit allows EAGAIN to terminate a line if anything else has been read from that fd If nothing else has been read its either nonexistent or empty which makes sense to error instead About half of my blocks stopped rendering after updating today I looked through i blocks vvv and noticed that only the blocks that were printing were getting log lines from linec lineclineparse block output Looking around there it seems i blocks can only read lines if they end with a newline I added an extra echo to the end of all my missing blocks and they reappeared I think a fix would be to accept the error indicating the end of the file descriptor as a valid endpoint to the line and break I think this would be sufficient c if err if err EAGAIN break return err Im hesitant to submit a PR because Im having problems getting the build to work Edit I got the build working so I submitted a PR which fixed my problem Hi Working on updating i blocks on debianubuntu I encounter an error during make install I think dhautoinstall PREFIXusr LIBEXECDIRusrshare make j install

and try to move the bashcompletionscript that is located in the source tree but it doesnt exist because we just changed directory My volumecpuinternet indicators dissapeared ever since I updated i
