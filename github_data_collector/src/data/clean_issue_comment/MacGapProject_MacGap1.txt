Pleaase Sync Hi Im unable to use the File Upload dialog to select multiple files in MacGap using the following HTML element input typefile multiplemultiple This works fine in my Safari and is supposed to be fully supported since Safari User Agent in my MacGap Mozilla Macintosh Intel Mac OS X AppleWebKit KHTML like Gecko MacGap Please add an API method to determine if the MacGap window is active and visible similar to First of all MacGap is amazing Have to get that out of the way I know that all new development is going into MacGap but I wanted to post here in case anyone else runs into this issue Ive found that on Yosemite macgapwindowisMaximized sometimes returns when the window is maximized and sometimes returns when the window is not maximized I dont know enough about Cocoa to say why this is but am thinking a good workaround at this point is to use javascriptjQuery wo the MacGap commands var myIsMaximized screenheight windowheight screenwidth windowwidth Hello Im using the macgapnoticenotify to trigger notifications but I cant see anywhere where I can add a click listener to do something on my webapp macgapnoticenotify type sheet title header sound false content message Does anybody know how to The API will return BASE string format of Image You can add dataimagepngbase prefix and set to img src attribute it will be shown as html data uri image If you want to mock a html File Object to upload or do some other things There is the code javascript var imgData windowmacgapclipboardpasteImage if imgData return var byteString windowatobimgData var ia new Uint ArraybyteStringlength for var i i byteStringlength i ia i byteStringcharCodeAti var file new Blob ia type imagepng encoding utf I just got bit badly by this one in colindeanirccloudapp Looks like installing the macgap helper gem uses a version of MacGap released two years ago and it doesnt have much of functionality available in MacGap let alone MacGap The instructions to use that gem should probably be removed or marked with a caveat that it uses a considerably older version It would however still be incredibly nice to have that gem available and working correctly Its greatly simplified development of my little app We now have a twitter account so you can keep up to date more easily Just a headsup that MacGap is very nearly in beta and should be considered ready to test Check it out The documentation site at is incomplete at present but is a focus for us at this point MacGap will only see minimal further development from this point on
