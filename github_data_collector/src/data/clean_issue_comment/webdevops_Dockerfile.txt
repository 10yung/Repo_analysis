uid via dockercomposeyml I need that config because i dont want to run everything as root for convenience reasons composer etc No my problem is that i want to configure my logging to use dockerstdout but i get permission errors How can i change the ownershippermissions of proc fd so i am able to log to dockerstdout from phpfpm process You reproduce the problem with shell docker run it user entrypoint binbash webdevopsphpnginxdev echo hello world dockerstdout response will be bash dockerstdout Permission denied Is it possible to add yarn to the image Without the need to do itself Hey there I just spent a few hours trying to increase the clientmaxbodysize but it always stayed at around M I tried to set the variable by mounting a conffile to optdockeretcnginxconfd Using nginx T i created a dump of the generated config There I saw that my file was being loaded but further down the line the file optdockeretcnginxvhostcommond generalconf was loaded and the only content of this file is clientmaxbodysize M This means it is in the current latest version not possible to increase the clientmaxbodysize unless one overwrites the mentioned file generalconf by mounting another one on top I dont think this is intended behaviour because it is not mentioned anywhere in the docs Is there any reason why this file exists or sets a body size thereby overwriting the server wide body size config I only used three relevant environment variables WEBDOCUMENTROOTapppublic PHPPOSTMAXSIZE M PHPUPLOADMAXFILESIZE M But I dont think that any of these settings should create this file The image is the current latest with hash c c c Thanks for an answer and thank you for the great work If you need more information just contact me Hello With dockercompose version and higher is no longer possible to add a healthcheck to a database service and set a conditional dependson See As per we can use a script that waits for the database service to be healthy To avoid creating my own fork of the webdevops image I thought it might be useful to include this script in the mysql and postgresql versions of the image It could be optional to use it so not having it as the default entrypoint or cmd but at least have it inside the image I have a PHP application in AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Docker In my dockerfile i use FROM webdevops phpnginx alpinephp however I need to add the Oracle extension to use ociconnect How can I do this This morning I was tinkering a little and while installing a composer dependency I noticed the dont run composer as root message which led go down the rabbit hole a little bash docker run it rm u webdevopsphpapache whoami root bash docker run it rm u webdevopsphp whoami root bash docker run it rm u webdevopsphpofficial whoami root The expected behaviour here would be whoami application I guess Hello We need to install the ddtrace php extension but we cant manage to do it We are using the nginxphp and image and we are using the following method wget dpkg i datadogphptracer amd deb Which result in phpfpm restarting to a zendmmheap corrupted How to reproduce Use nginxphp image cd opt wget dpkg i datadogphptracer amd deb php i Error Hi we have been using webdevopsliquibase docker image in our project for some time and suddenly we started seeing errors during integration tests where liquibase mysql insertion with date value is failing Sample error message is shown below There is no change in the liquibase source xml files so wondering if there was any recent update in the docker image that is causing issues we always pull latest image Mysql query below is correct except that date value has no quotes around it thats why it is failing However we are not sure what is causing the sudden removal of quotes in the date value Any response is highly appreciated Error message Unexpected error running Liquibase You have an error in your SQL syntax check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right
