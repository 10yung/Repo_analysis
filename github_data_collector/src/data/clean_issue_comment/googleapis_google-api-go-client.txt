Hi Were trying to refresh google sheets in real time and its proving difficult The push notifications of the google drive API are only sent as frequently as every min they are batched after the first update which isnt frequent enough for real time updates Retrieving the modifiedTime for a spreadsheet using the google drive API seems to hit the same data in the background which is only refreshed every min Using the google sheets API is not an option since the modified time information is no longer supported in the latest version v What API are we supposed to use if we want real time update information for spreadsheets Thanks in advance Esther To reproduce golang importing googlegolangorgapirunv runService err runNewServicectx handle err err runServiceProjectsLocationsListprojectsmyprojectidDo fmtPrintlnerr Expected nil Got googleapi got HTTP response code with body DOCTYPE html html langen meta charsetutf meta nameviewport contentinitialscale minimumscale widthdevicewidth titleError Not Found title Hacking around the codebase if I change the URL version from apisservingknativedevv to just v then I get the response correctly The experimental APIs relied upon by this option were deleted in Fixes We are using this library and seeing these errors googlegolangorgapioptionoptiongo undefined grpcRoundRobin googlegolangorgapioptionoptiongo undefined grpcWithBalancer Sounds like gRPC removed these legacy APIs It appears that neither oauth v nor oauth v implement a client for Would it be possible to add this api interface to the appropriate package We have a binary that talks with multiple external services and only communication with some services needs to be proxied Thus we can not specify the proxy as an environment variable as suggested in since that will force all traffic to go through the proxy Im wondering if it is okay to have a WithProxyproxyURL string ClientOption so that we can selectively configure proxies when creating clients for certain services Does this make sense Attempting to set Slides API StartIndex to returns the following error googleapi Error Invalid requests updateTextStyle The textRange startIndex must be specified for range type FIXEDRANGE badRequest This happens while attempting the following which is a port from the Python example here go reqs slidesRequest change word in para Bold to bold UpdateTextStyle slidesUpdateTextStyleRequest ObjectId textboxID Style slidesTextStyle Bold true TextRange slidesRange Type FIXEDRANGE StartIndex int EndIndex int Fields bold The reason this happens is that in the type Range the comment indicates this is required for FIXEDRANGE type but the JSON tag is set to omitempty so that zero values are omitted go Range Specifies a contiguous range of an indexed collection such as characters in text type Range struct EndIndex The optional zerobased index of the end of the collection Required for FIXEDRANGE ranges EndIndex int jsonendIndexomitempty StartIndex The optional zerobased index of the beginning of the collection Required for FIXEDRANGE and FROMSTARTINDEX ranges StartIndex int jsonstartIndexomitempty Another issue is that some range types require these indexes to not be present I was able to remove omitempty in a fork and received the following error googleapi Error Invalid requests createParagraphBullets The textRange startIndex must not be specified for range type ALL badRequest Seems like separate Range structs may be necessary What I did I tried to create a VPC in custom mode with the following piece of code Go func CreateVPCctx contextContext ns computeNetworksService name string computeOperation error net computeNetwork Name name return nsInsertprojectID netContextctxDo What I expected I expected to see a new VPC created with custom mode since the default value of AutoCreateSubnetworks field in computeNetwork is false What I saw instead I saw a new VPC created in legacy mode rather than custom mode How I solved Apparently even if AutoCreateSubnetworks is explicitely set to false it is still omitted from request payload Therefore it seems that GCP backend interprets this request as a legacy VPC creation The only way I found to create a custommode VPC is to enforce the request to contain the AutoCreateSubnetworks field In fact the below code works Go func CreateVPCctx contextContext ns computeNetworksService name string computeOperation error net computeNetwork Name name AutoCreateSubnetworks false make sure AutoCreateSubnetworks field is included in request ForceSendFields stringAutoCreateSubnetworks return nsInsertprojectID netContextctxDo Now is it possible to improve the computeNetwork doc Precisely AutoCreateSubnetworks comment should say that it is omitted by default and a legacy VPC is created instead in that case Also doc should say explicitely that AutoCreateSubnetworks field should be included in payload through ForceSendFields if users want to create a nonlegacy VPC There seems to be a related issue opened year ago Also see I use googleapisgoogleapigoclientsiteverificationv like this auth verifService err googlesiteverificationNewServicectx googleoptionWithCredentialsFilegoogleCloudConfCredentialsJson getToken json for simplier getting token is ok json site identifier testnet type INETDOMAIN verificationMethod DNSTXT insert iRes err verifServiceWebResourceInsertDNSTXT nilDo On insert I get You cannot use the verification method DNSTXT to verify a site of type SITE Also I tried web API from developersgoglecom but I get the same result What do I do wrong Is there other method to verify a domain through a google service We use to connect to our database It internally calls sqladminSslCertsCreateEphemeral to create an ephemeral certificate for the encryption With the same configuration this method is behaving differently between v and v Basically it returns a in the case of v and in v it is running without any errors I did not open an issue in that repo as there were no changes there Could you please look into this
