A switchs case was flagged by a static analyzer we use in our code It mentions that a break statement was not included in case for number method inputDigitWithOptionToRememberPositionrememberPosition around line in class NBAsYouTypeFormatter I think this is intentional so the execution fallsthrough the default case If that is the case I think an explicit comment in case would help specially to those who are not that familiar with the class details Can you please confirm if the missing break is intentional or there could be a bug in the code If intentional an accompanying comment would be appreciated The removed line is not reachable I run the Coverity static analyzer in our code which uses the libPhoneNumber and flagged the line as not reachable I think it is right All paths in the switch statement before this line end up in a return keyword A separate reported issue not covered by this Pull Request Actually there was a second issue reported I think it might be intentional but I did not feel knowledgeable enough to modify the code In the switch case one code path ends up in a return the other path sets selfisExpectingCountryCallingCode to YES but there is not break or comment about why it is not used I think the break was not added so it fallstrough and the code in the default case could be executed Anyways a comment around case on why a break is not used would help other people reading the code Tested on the link for this number series both isValid and isPossible number returns true But the ios library for isValidNumber returns false library version libPhoneNumberiOS I have a correct mobile number The number is But our iOS library returns NBEPhoneNumberTypeUNKNOWN Please help solve the problem as soon as possible Thanks my bro library version libPhoneNumberiOS As the repo doesnt have documentation I had to guess Please let me know if I did this incorrectly cd libPhoneNumberTests metadataGenerator cd libPhoneNumber GeneratePhoneNumberHeadersh For example XXX XXX XXXX will out put error In Cyprus the right country code is but when I try to reach Cyprus country code by using libPhoneNumberiOS library i got Input phoneNumber RegionCode gb NBPhoneNumber nbNumber NBPhoneNumberUtil sharedInstance parsephoneNumber defaultRegioncountryRegionCode errorerror Response Mobile numbers in Indonesia must always be dialled with all digits typically digits including a prefixing the nnn within Indonesia no matter where they are being called from so no hyphens are used above snippet is from wikipedia as it says Number can go up to digits so can you update this library to do so Checking for CN number like isValidNumber returned is false
