Hi thank you for your great work I find that the trained models listed in the README in this page are not found Where can I download the trained models Thanks I have solved it aayushbansal it seems that during segimageprovider you permute dimension of the image here but i dont see the equivalent in seglabelprovider here which i beleive might lead to a missmatch of pixels and their annotation and also resizing with different flagsbilinearantialiasing in segimageprovider and nearest in seglabelprovider doesnt have any effect on training Hello Aayush Could you please share the training code for normals as an example Thanks
