We are working as a team and share our designs via Sketch Cloud with others We are running into the problem that we often have to upload an entirely new version which receives a new generated link in the Sketch Cloud After a little bit of research the problem seems to be that Sketch writes some kind of identifier into the binary sketch file after the upload This is used to identify the prototype on next update It seems this identifier is not included in the JSON files that are committed to the repository and only available in the local sketch file Then each time the local sketch files is regenerated from the exploded JSON files the identifier is lost and the version in the cloud cannot be updated When working as a team this creates a lot of problems New links have to be distributed Losing versions in Sketch Cloud Only one person can update whoever published the last version and still has the same local file Do you think it is possible to include the identifier in the JSON files and correctly include it in the generated sketch file I found this issue raised in the Abstract forum describing the same issue Looks like they have no workaround either One difference is that they also commit the sketch files This creates other problems though with merging etc also causing to lose the identifier Description When I change between branches a lot of times library cant sync with Sketch This provokes that libraries doesnt appears in library panels so you cant use it Version Kactus Operating system Mac OS X Catalina Sketch Steps to Reproduce Change to another branch Go to Sketch Preferences Libraries Sometimes works sometimes doesnt works Actual Behavior Unable to load library appears buglibrarysync Description When I change between branches Kactus generate a commit with a lot of file changes This commit disappears if you let Kactus loading more time but will be fantastic If this commit doesnt appear I understand that this is happening because there is a gap when Github change files between branches and when you are in the new branch you still have files from another branch Version Kactus Operating system Mac OS X Catalina Steps to Reproduce Change to another already created branch Look in commit panel Expected Behavior Change to another branch without seeing this commits Actual Behavior A lot of new commits appears Please describe the problem you think should be solved All the libraries in Kactus have more size than outside of Kactus Probably x more size than a normal sketch file Do you have any potential solutions in mind I solved this copying the sketch files to another path then I open the sketch file and make some change just I put a rectangle and delete it and save the file Then the size of the libraries come back normal Ive usually forgot write commit message in right time It would be nice to show last commit time and write a commit message in Sketch app First and foremost we d like to thank you for taking the time to contribute to our
