has this project been abandoned siege c v contenttype application json POST ids ids is random number what should i do Is PUT supported POST works for me but when I replace POST with PUT while testing my REST API siege does not pass the data to the URL The idea with this change is to realize that POST does not automatically mean we are reading a file for input Instead we check to see if the character following is the start of an XML declaration such as xml Any XML POST inputs will confuse siege Example siege c r g POST xml version encodingUTF foobar This happens because siege will only look at the character and try to process the rest of the line as a filename Issue is in srcurlc parsepostdataURL this char datap The following can help fix the issue by looking for the XML declaration diff git asrcurlc bsrcurlc index b e c asrcurlc bsrcurlc parsepostdataURL this char datap for isspaceunsigned intdatap datap Advance past white space if datap if datap datap datap loadfilethis datap datap urlsetpaththis datap Fixed time listed under Elapsed time to match the sample output Was but sample output was This corresponds to the default set at KRB g O c authc authc In function getmd str authc error storage size of ctx isn t known authc warning implicit declaration of function md initctx authc warning implicit declaration of function md processbytes authc warning implicit declaration of function md finishctx How can I solve this problem When the make command is executed Addresses for siege This does seem to conflict with master which has its own fix but doesnt have the SSLCOMPfreecompressionmethods call I am trying to test an authenticated system simulating multiple users I know I can use the URLs file to add multiple URLs but I would like to send a different set of headers for each URL Would it be possible to make the H header syntax from the command line for a single URL to be supported as a param against each URL in the URLs file So youd have user H Authorization Bearer User H Authorization Bearer User user H Authorization Bearer User H Authorization Bearer User
