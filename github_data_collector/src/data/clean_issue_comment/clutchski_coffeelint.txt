Ive copied and pasted the wrong syntax multiple times throughout years wondering why it doesnt work Nobody should waste time due to a typo Ive been working on an automated lint error fixer Basically it takes the output from Coffeelint and programmatically fixes the errors when possible eg for errors like nounnecessaryfatarrows where the intent is obvious and the fix is simple This change enables the automated fixer which relies on this finegrain error location data I also add expected and actual indentation information which is useful in fixing indentation errors I had to add location manually to each AST rule since the rule itself is responsible for recursing into the AST On the other hand we can inject location data for all token based linters in the lexicallintercoffee file I could create a separate pull request for my fixer script which currently supports fixes for the following error types indentation notrailingwhitespace notrailingsemicolons nounnecessarydoublequotes spaceoperators spacingaftercomma colonassignmentspacing nounnecessaryfatarrows arrowspacing Hello I noticed that the context string printed by the checkstyle reporter might not list a context which can make the error messages look awkward eg error messages like this will be printed Line contains tab indentation context Is there a reason context is always printed there It made me think that the tool was broken at first Assuming that string isn t serving a purpose when it s blank this PR removes it in that case Also can this please be backported to coffeelint and published under branched from the last release Our projects still use CoffeeScript and coffeelint seems to have a rough time with our files because of that so I would need the change deployed on version in order to use it via the usual NPM channel Thanks Jackson example code that hangs the browser tab on coffee test The nothrowingstrings rule does not trigger when using round brackets Consider the following code coffeescript test throw moo Lint fails correct coffeescript test throwmoo Lint passes incorrect coffeescript test throw moo Lint passes incorrect This is strange because the resulting javascript is the same js testfunction throw moo Summary It would be nice if coffeelint will support YAML configuration files coffeelintyaml for example Argumentation I think JSON bad idea Main reason I cant write comments why I use those or other options Another arguments JSON as configuration files please dont See also related issue Thanks Thankyou so much for CoffeeLint I love it Just one small request The following code gives the Fat Arrow warning for doittwice but this is incorrect The function is already bound to the right object In fact the fat arrow cannot be used here at all it will break the code The linter should detect that a function is being assigned to an object attribute and not suggest using the fat arrow doit consolelog doing it mything doitonce doit doittwice doitonce doitonce mythingdoittwice We have a large coffeescript code base and had notabs enabled but hadnt gotten around to enabling notrailingwhitespace I was a bit surprised to learn that there were tabs at the end of lines that coffeelint hadnt caught in the code base I see that the notabs rule is conservative because notrailingwhitespace catches this situation so feel free to reject Thanks for keeping this project going Shuan
