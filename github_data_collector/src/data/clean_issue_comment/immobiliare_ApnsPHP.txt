From samplepushmanyphp lines a comment reads To speed up the sending operations use Zero as parameter but some messages may be lost What is the technical reason for messages getting lost I m looking to speed up the performance of my sending it s too slow for production and after reading a Technical Note from Apple they suggest to avoid checking for an error response every time I write So instead of checking every time I m going to do it at some interval ie sends Knowing this does it make sense to have a write interval in this use case My original thought was the write interval s purpose was to give the fread enough time to capture an error response But that may not be the intention as it could be there to prevent some sort of sending limit via the socket yii base ErrorException calluserfuncarray expects parameter to be a valid callback class ApnsPHPMessage does not have a method sound in domainvendorbryglenyii apnsgcmApnsphp any idea why the above error is throwing Hi Ive changed some PHP keywords to comply with this standard in PSR Its admittedly a small fix but I hope it helps Hello after the translation of website to utf push no longer sent Writes Internal error by written in instead of bytes If I try to send in Latin it sends push i received its pushmessages and writes its an error If I try to send a Cyrillic symbols at UTF then I get an error and the push does not come If in the Pushphp file I change the line nLen strlen aMessage BINARYNOTIFICATION to nLen mbstrlenaMessage BINARYNOTIFICATION latin push in Latin comes successfully and there are no errors Cyrillic does not reach but does not show errors nLen mbstrlen construction aMessage BINARYNOTIFICATION utf Does not help how to be sorry fo my english Fixes as well as an issue I ran into where code was attempting to load PHPUnit classes using the ApnsPHP autoloader I would propose that the classes are structured under a namespace Like Immobiliare ApnsPHP While using userNotificationCenter didReceive to get clicks on a notification I cant seem to get these custom properties anywhere Is this not what these properties are for Im trying to use it so I can direct the user to a specific page of the app based on the set property Any help is greatly appreciated Hi Ive two types of tokens long and short First I got invalid token back and then I upgraded the library and now I get back invalid payload size All Tokens are bit but one is bit Please help me We see some users char length push token in our database So I think we must change this line is it possible to send push with image Using this library As i read it should be possible from ios iOS brings support for rich content in push notifications empowering you to deliver significantly more engaging content directly to your users You ll be able to deliver compelling content that includes images GIFs and videos Could you please leave a couple of words about push with images for the beginner
