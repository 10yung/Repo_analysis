supporting our collective See The error message reported is install unrecognized option gemfiletmpkitchenGemfile Try install help for more information testing This PR shows the current build process is broken See Builds continue to work on all systems except Alpine Test building rust version As per theres a known issue with batscore possibly hanging on subprocesses because of its use of fd We run lots of subprocesses in the tests for gitsecret very few of them what I would consider long running but some that might take a second but I cant seem to consistently avoid hitting this issue when I use cntrlC when using batscore on gitsecret on OSX IE when interrupting make test no matter what I do with fd and trapping SIGINT as suggested in the docs and the batscore issue above When the tests hang on ctrlc they always appear up in ps output similarly to this this examp s R AM bash Usersexampgitsrcgitsecretvendorbatscorelibexecbatscorebatsexectest x Usersexampgitsrcgitsecretteststestrevealbats testrun reveal withpasswordargument and that process appears to be waiting on other subprocesses that have already exited I would love to resolve this issue Ive been hitting it for quite a while It would be useful to have a test to make sure we do the right thing if the user has both an active and a revoked key for the same email address See This would help users to understand how gitsecret internally operates This would also help users and developers debug and fix issues such as expired or revoked keys in their gitsecret keyrings Thanks for

updated to include all but the current release It seems like perhaps the Packages files get generated before the deb packages are created Not sure This issue is a cleanup of see that PR for more details As noted in this could be related to Currently the ghpages branch which is what the site comes from has text and scripts that do not exist in the master branch I suggest we unify the contents of the ghpages branch with the master branch and arrange that the needed contents for the ghpages branch and website are generated on demand
