 Mailing List thread Example page in a wider project you know how to find the Scala code I have a Comet Actor which uses LazyLoadrender programmatically to lazy load part of its display When the lazy loading is complete the rendered NodeSeq contains further Comet Actors These display initially however no further updates occur rerendering of the nested Comet Actors are not passed to the page Workaround Create your own MyLazyLoad Actor and if required programmatically initialise it as so SfindOrCreateCometMyLazyLoad FullHelpersnextFuncName ns SattrsFlattenToMap truemap foundComet foundComet MyLazyLoadInitinitData CometcontainerForCometActorfoundComet Fullns match case FullcometContainer cometContainer case failedResult throw new IllegalArgumentExceptionsfailedResult In case we want to use this instead of removing the minified js files ongojavadriver Fixes The mongojavadriver has deprecated a lot of their classes and are going to remove them in the next release This is long overdue One of the big changes is the use of a codec model for encoding and decoding data tofrom the db into a language type I took advantage of that to change how Records are stored A RecordCodec is now used which means data is put directly into a Record instead of first being put into a DBObject or the newer Document and then converting from there I didnt do any benchmarks but I would think thats a decent performance improvement Im not sure if Im done with this yet but I wanted to get this up I need to set it aside for a couple of weeks while I get back to my job The main thing Im still thinking about doing is replacing the BsonParser with a Codec for JValue I have a lot of it written already but Im not sure its worth the effort to finish it Mailing List thread Below is a bit of code out of LiftActorscala and it looks to me like the proper return type of sendAndGetReply should be Box Any rather than Any Send a message to the Actor and wait for up to timeout milliseconds for the actor to process the message and reply This method is the Java callable version of def sendAndGetReplytimeout Long msg Any Any thistimeout msg Send a message to the Actor and wait for up to timeout milliseconds for the actor to process the message and reply def timeout Long message Any Box Any this message timeout depends on netliftwebliftjson to be available for Scala M Improvement idea based on mailing list discussion about AWS deployment Mailing List It was discovered that when deploying a WAR file to AWS Beanstalk along with H database the application will not function properly The reason is that Beanstalk doesnt allow write access locally but H db configured with local file configuration would require write access In the logs it can be seen that while the DB init will throw an exception it is ignored and the process is continued while part of the boot sequence operations will be left undone for example setting the Classpath for lift snippets This will be shown as template render failures on browser It is however not immediately apparent what is causing these render failures and in some environments like Beanstalk accessing the logs can be difficult Handling the DB init failure should be better and more apparent for the developer At first two different approaches were thought of In case of db init failure quit the whole process or inform about the initialization failure somehow through the browser First option would be easier to implement but poses breaking changes in expected behaviour of Lift Also would be good to investigate if applying the other boot sequence operations despite of DB init failure would be possible Mailing List thread Example project When the underlying session ID change without a clean invalidatecreate cycle for example with the HttpServletRequestchangeSessionId which seems to be the recommanded session fixation prevention method for servlet and so is used in authentication frameword like spring security Lift session are destroyed after the dataliftgc attribute is generated and so lift page javascript at then end of the page fails because of error Mailing List thread Example project When a page is stateless for ex with the Stateless modifier in Menu it still get the following code at its end which force create a session script typetextjavascript srcliftpageF YRAVO jsscript Addresses Added a basic structure A partial first pass Not tested yet Still working on it I had some time and I was sort of waiting for a response on another issue I was working on And since we are looking for a release in less than two weeks I thought I would go ahead create a PR for this without asking about it first If thats inappropriate please decline this right away Otherwise does this look like the right approach here Wanted to ask before I went ahead with changing a whole bunch of files
