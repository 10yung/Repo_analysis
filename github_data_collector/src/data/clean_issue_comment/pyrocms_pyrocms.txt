Pyro Steps to reproduce Change the CP language to anything else than English and visit the rolestable at adminusersroles adminguest and user are gone Same happens when trying to attach roles to a user If the CP ist that to anything else than english you cant attach adminuser or guest role because theyre missing in the dropdown Update Seems like you cant even edit a user anymore because of this problem Saving a usersprofile in the control panel results in a Call to a member function getId on null error Describe the bug run php artisan down messageXXXX No custom information is displayed streamsviewserrorerrortwig message is langerrphp content Describe the bug If you place a date field type within a repeater and set it to be text and not datepicker It only instantiate on the first repeater not the others So its a javascript thing there Then see images on how i set my dates Please let me know if there are other ways to set the timezone than these and ill try But basically if i use the datepicker and have the values set according to the timezone and rules in the images it fails validation img width altScreenshot at src img width altScreenshot at src img width altScreenshot at src Mustnt start with a number Limit length to sane default UI for suggesting shorter names Describe the bug If i remove a block in admin its data is deleted from the blocks table but not from blocks transalations and not from blockextension tables If i remove a block programmatically via blockModeldelete its data is not deleted from blockextension tables Expected behavior In both cases all block data should be deleted from all tables Additional context Over the time much garbage data will bloat the database Describe the bug When searching an exact phrase with double quotes the following error occurs An exception has been thrown during the rendering of a template SQLSTATE Syntax error or access violation You have an error in your SQL syntax check the manual that corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near plato or MATCH searchable AGAINST plato or title LIKE at line SQL select from defaultsearchitems where locale nl and MATCH titledescription AGAINST plato or MATCH searchable AGAINST plato or title LIKE plato or description LIKE plato order by MATCH titledescription AGAINST plato desc MATCH searchable AGAINST plato desc To Reproduce Do a search between double quotes eg plato Expected behavior Searching the exact phrase that is placed between double quotes as described in the docs Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Version history builds up over time lets keep it under control with garbage collection Describe the solution youd like Trim garbage past max age setting on artisan refresh or Schedule Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe When adding routes in a module ex module for another module usersmodule for example when adding a sectionformtable its not possible to add these routes to the service providers routes property This is because AddonProviderregisterRoutes addsoverrides the streamsaddon value to addongetNamespace This would result in empty control panel sections So the routes need to be defined in the map method This way the control panel sections for the usersmodule are shown See screenshots below code examples Describe the solution youd like On AddonProvider Would it be possible to implement something like php ifarrayhasroute streamsaddon arraysetroute streamsaddon addongetNamespace This way in routes you can define streamsaddon yourself like php protected routes adminusersdepartments as examplesmoduleex departmentsindex uses Examples Ex Module Http Controller Admin DepartmentsControllerindex streamsaddon anomalymoduleusers Describe the bug If you change the page type of a page the typeid in pagespages is correctly updated to the new type id but the entrytype and entryid are not updated To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Create a page using the Default page type Create a new page type eg Custom page type Edit page and change the type from Default to Custom In page tree you will see the correct Type referenced but on viewing the page the original content will be shown This is because entrytype is still set to Anomaly Streams Platform Model Pages PagesDefaultPagesEntryModel along with associate entryid Expected behavior After changing the type as well as the typeid being updated entrytype should also be updated to Anomaly Streams Platform Model Pages PagesCustomPagesEntryModel alognm with the entry id in that model Describe the bug A clear and concise description of what the bug is To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Create a foocss file with a media block that starts with an id eg mediaprint foo color red Run yarn run prod In your layout add assetaddbarcss themefoocss assetinlinebarcss parse Load the page See error Unclosed comment This is caused by yarn run prod minifying the CSS The output CSS file looks like mediaprintfoocolorred This contains which is interpreted as a twig comment the at the end would probably break things as well Workaround Compile themes with yarn run dev This might be difficult to fix as it would be difficult to tell minified CSS from a legitimate twig comment if it proves too difficult to fix then improving the error message that tells the developer to run dev instead of prod would help at least
