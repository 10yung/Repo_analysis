Fixes Atm the coding style convention for Mumble appears to be to never explicitly use the this pointer to access membervariables andor functions unless necessary Combined with the fact that we dont have a convention in place that marks the names of these member fields somehow specially eg by prefixing them with m this makes reading the code pretty damn hard sometimes in my opinion at least Consider this code and pretend it is inside a memberfunction if bMyFlag myFunc There is no way to tell whether bMyFlag is a membervariable or just a local variable declared somewhere above or even a global variable that has not been declared in its own namespace Furthermore it is to my knowledge impossible to tell whether myFunc is a member function or a free function This makes it increasingly hard if yoou start looking at a piece of code and want to figure out what is going on You always have to search a bunch of places in which these variablesfunctions might be declared and then you have to doublecheck that this is indeed the correct variablefunction as sometimes admittedly rarely though there are multiple candidates with the same names For this reason Id suggest to switch coding style to always use the this pointer explicitly With that above example could be much clearer if thisbMyFlag thismyFunc Now it is imminent where to look for the declarationdefinition Of course its unfeasable to go through old code and change it everywhere but if we respect that for new code and codechanges then I think the code base will adapt this new style gradually And I dont think it hurts to have the old and the potential new style sidebyside Another alternative would be to mark member variables with a prefix eg m but this cant really be extended to member functions without making their names really ugly so Id prefer the use of this What do you think about this Currently all information about Mumble is on the mumbleinfo website This also includes information relevant for development such as buildinstructions Looking at other OpenSource GitHub projects though I think it is more common to have development related information available directly on GitHub and this is what I assume a lot of people would expect including myself when I first visited this repo Besides I think it makes a lot of sense to have eg the buildinformation right where the code lives so I dont have to search it again when fiddling with the code Thus Id suggest to create a wiki for this project right here on GitHub that is and migrate all that relevant information there Furthermore we could also create a CONTRIBUTEmd file in the root dir that contains instructions on how to contribute to the project What are your thoughts on this New translation updates available from transifex From my point of view there are currently way too many open issues and confusingly many open PRs PullRequests One of the first questions that came to my mind when looking at the PRs was why are there so many open PRs To a new potential contributor this could seem intimidating in the sense that it could be conceived as PRs not getting processed properly which I now know is not the case I think it would have a motivating effect for potential contributors to see only a handful of open PRs in this Repo as this clearly shows that PRs are processed in time symbolizing that they are much appreciated Not dont get me wrong Im not complaining about how PRs are actually handled Im just pointing out how it might appear at first glance Given that the oldest open PR is from I think that a lot of those PRs can be closed as temporarily deaddiscontinued If the author of that PR steps forward again at some point later it would be a piece of cake to reopen it but as long as nobody is working on it I dont see a need for keeping it open There could be a label something like incompletePR assigned to them so that if in the future someone wants to see which PRs where closed because of this reason they can easily find those PRs I also have the feeling that some of these PRs are changes that didnt make it into so they havent been merged yet as the development focused on the release As the release is done now though I think now is a good time to merge these PRs in the master branch Issues I scanned over the issues briefly in the last couple of days and I think that there a few duplicates in there some that are probably no longer relevant and some missing information because the author of the issue never bothered to give the details they have been asked for If the issues are to be used to structure the development of Mumble I think they absolutely have to be reduced and properly categorized With well over open issues I doubt that there is anyone having even a rough overview of what is an open issue already and what is not My proposal for tackling this problem is the following Those issues should be revisited to make sure that only the relevant ones staying open If there is an issue with too few information or if it is unclear whether this still applies ask again for more information and add a special label to them Then a bot like could be used to give the authors of those issues a certain amount of time eg days to respond to the request If there is no response in that time the issue will be automatically closed by this bot Note that the bot will only process issues that have been manually assigned to that specific label Thus it wont accidentally close off important issues After having gone through all issues Id hope there will be less open issues there and the ones remaining will provide the necessary information to be processed And most importantly The remaining issues will be categorized in a more or less uniform way Processed issuepages x x x x x x It would be great if we could assign a global shortcut to adjusting local volumes An idea could be to add data to the already existing Volume Up and Volume Down functions We could then assign a user or maybe multiple users to that shortcut by using a similar window to the one used to set the data for WhisperShout Hello After somedays on my server hosting a mumble server Debian buster there is I think multiple

have never done that with Debian Stretch When I open Mumble select another theme in the settings and let Mumble perform the requested restart it doesnt close properly when closed via UI the xbutton in the topright corner The UI disappears but the console doesnt return indicating that something remains running From my tests this does not correspond to the specific theme that is being switched to or that is being used Instead I suspect that this is a bug in the restartlogic If theres another way to let Mumble restart itself I think we could very that suspicion EDIT Forgot to mention that I am

MumbleProtochannelState msg indicating whether a channel is protected by ACLs denying ENTER privilege and whether the user the message is being sent to has the permissions to enter the channel Implement the backend to process the abovementioned fields Mumble Murmur Added the equivalents of those messagefields as fields in the channel class inside the Mumbleclient UI Show lockicon if channel is accessrestricted locked lock for the case in which the local user cant enter the respective channel and unlocked lock for the case in which the local user has the necessary privileges to enter the channel noetheless UI kinda Changed permission denied message for ENTER or MOVE requests if the channel has accessrestrictions the message now states that a missing passwordaccess token might be the cause for the denial From my point of view the description does not correspond to the implementation here According to the description only the enterprivilege has to be granted The other listed ones may optionally be granted The implementation however seems to enforce these privileges to be granted in any case the only optional one being the Traverse one My question therefore is Did I misunderstand something here and if not Which one is correct Id assume the implementation
