I am storing three values in userStorage convuserstoragecounter convuserstorageremind false convuserstorageshare false The values get stored normally and work on my account and for many other accounts of some of my alpha testers as well Unfortunately for some of my alpha testers even though they are verified users with all related settings like web activity etc enabled nothing is stored in their userstorage I have noticed that this happens for G Suite accounts My own G suite account is facing this issue Is this a bug or is it just that I am not aware of some setting Any help would be appreciated Thank you Or Media responses Handling callback BEFORE playback completion The issue is related to the closed issue The UX scenario I experienced an issue when trying to develop an action on google application using Action SDK to replicate google assistant UX when a user listen a Spotify playlist Specifically I would let the user interrupt the audio streaming asking something about what listening in a specific moment Thats appears not possible so far I would like to play some audio file media response say a MP song long something like three minutes Afterward at the middle of the playing song say at I would let user ask for example Ok Google Whats the name of the song or Ok Google Who play the Rhodes piano The actions would manage a QA with these possible steps PAUSE the playback implicit catch the user intent reply user with the answer RESUME the playback TBD My test result fails When the media response plays the action is able to interrupt the audio and its able manage the question but the playback IS NOT RESUMED Thats weird for my ears Its debatable but I think thats a BUG or at least lets call a Change Request I would let developer the choice to resume or not the underlying streaming after a user interruption BTW The fact interrupted audio streaming is resumed after a user QA is in compliance with what happens on Google AssistantGoogle Home with live streaming or an long running playlist streaming By example if a Google Home user say Ehi Google play BBC Radio blablabla brexit blablabla brexit blablabla brexit interrupting the BBC streaming with a question Ehi Google whats the weather Right now in Genoa its sunny blablabla end the answer RESUME the BBC streaming blablabla brexit blablabla brexit blablabla brexit until the user explicitly ask to close Ehi Google stop So INTO THE THIRD PARTY APPS ACTIONS I would like the same UX for the final user The listener of an audio file songnewsbook whatever would be able to interrupt the audio streaming ask a question and afterward the audio streaming would optionally be RESUMED So my request from the developer perspective is related on that possibility to OPTIN an audio playback resume mode My proposal is to modify behavior of actionsintentMEDIASTATUS to catch the interrupt status lets call it STOPPED allowing to playback an audio file from an offset time to enable resume The event BEFORE playback completion would report the elapsed time from the start time of audio streaming eg or in milliseconds amount to allow developer to understand the exact point of user interrupt Thats important to answer user on the precise context eg in case audio was an audio book or a news etc See the following PSEUDO code javascript MEDIASTATUS intent Track the elapsed time milliseconds until user stop playback appintentactionsintentMEDIASTATUS conv const mediaStatus convargumentsgetMEDIASTATUS CHANGE REQUEST suppose the event STOPPED if mediaStatus mediaStatusstatus STOPPED memorize number of milliseconds playd until the user stop offsetTime mediaStatusstopTime else if mediaStatus mediaStatusstatus FINISHED response Hope you enjoyed the tune ONPLAYBACK QUERIES intent appintentactionsintentTEXT conv reply to query parse the query text and find an answer on a DB etc CHANGE REQUEST resume the playback after the reply resuming playback from the offsetTime suppose having the method resume convresumemediaresponse offsetTime A last note The request for me is crucial to develop a new generation of conversational UX where user can interact with a static content streaming music book news any audio file or streaming interacting and conversating with that content using metadata etcetc Please let me know if there is something obscure in my rant or I missing something about an already possible configuration If you like my request please vote Thanks for your patience giorgio Currently the behavior interfacing with the dialogflow API is if the userStorage does not change actionsongoogle does not send back the storage in the response However the next request no longer contains the userStorage properties I assume something changed with the dialogflow API and this is a side effect It has lead to many actions breaking on my end The intended behavior now seems we need to send the userStorage with every response to persist it to the next request I had
