If DriverInterfacegetValue can return null so does this method This adds travis testing of php and php and fixes the only problem we have detected with php so far Before After For your consideration ciao hackdayparis This allows projects using Mink to create their Named and Partial selectors and then to add additional replacements and selectors to be registered for subsequent use This is particularly useful in projects with a distributed plugin architecture which make use of replacements and selectors without abusing Reflection to do so This is something that we currently do in Moodle for Behat for exactly this reason Our hack with Reflection to access the properties to allow proper translation Registration of plugin replacements and selectors There is some discussions happening on various driver repos about dropping PH support This issue is about discussing a consolidated plan for the whole set of Mink repos to be consistent Arguments to drop support all PHP versions are unmaintained and PHP reaches that point at the end of the year Travis supports only PHP on their xenial infrastructure forcing to use trusty for and and precise for And they announced that the precise infrastructure will be decommissioned in the future forbidding us to run tests on at that point and so to officially support it PHPUnit is dropping support for unmaintained PHP versions regularly which forces us to support a wide range of PHPUnit versions to run our testsuite which becomes more painful over time For now we need these versions for PHP to for PHP for PHP for PHP we are currently not yet compatible with the new PHPUnit but it supports PHP PHPUnit is adding void return type in many places Making our testsuite compatible with PHPUnit will be a pain if we need to keep support for PHP Symfony will add return types on a some interfaces which will force us to do the same in our testsuite implementation for BrowserKitDriver which will require dropping support for PHP x or do crazy stuff to keep implementations One of the methods affecting us will use the object type which requires PHP our new driver based on facebookwebdriver will require at least PHP due to the min requirement of the library and they plan to make it PHP in the next version This is not a strict requirement to match the other parts of Mink it would have this requirement even without this min version bump on Mink but it is nice to take that into account in the thinking As we start dropping support for old versions I suggest dropping more than just to benefit from a cleanup as we dont do it often I suggest to at least drop to which will free us from old Travis infrastructure and from PHPUnit Then multiple suggestions are possible to make it easy to add support for Symfony but this is mostly things happening in the testsuite so we could deal with it otherwise to make it easy to migrate to PHPUnit while keeping support for PHPUnit due to our needs which also aligns with the min requirement of Symfony LTS and with the current maintained PHP versions Another thing to take into account is that Mink is currently used as part of the Drupal ecosystem Here is their support matrix source Drupal has PHP as its min version Drupal supports PHP for existing projects but requires PHP for new projects enforced by their installer Drupal will support only PHP As they are currently pinned on a dev version of Mink due to needing unreleased changes we should avoid dropping support for these versions before the release so that they can at least switch these branches to use our next stable release The fact that Drupal will still support PHP might be an argument to keep support in Mink if they dont want to allow a range constraint allowing to use an uptodate Mink on maintained PHP versions and the older release only on PHP But we are not strongly tied to the Drupal ecosystem so this argument alone is not a full blocker aik what is your mind on the new min version Preliminary Im not sure why but on PHP The vendorbinsimplephpunit script part of is choosing to use PHPUnit version Such decision results in a failure when attempting to download chosen PHPUnit version because on GitHub there is no PHPUnit version but there is PHPUnit version Not sure if this is bug in Simple PHPUnit or out travisyml file Failing build URL Failing build Output PHP Warning fopen failed to open stream HTTP

selectors defined in do a good job of recognising most HTML Eg they will find a checkbox by the associated label for or a link but the alt text of the icon img inside the a However at present they do not find eg input typecheckbox arialabelFrog or using arialabelledbyid on the checkbox rather than forid on the label It would be nice to fix this This is something we would like in the Moodle project
