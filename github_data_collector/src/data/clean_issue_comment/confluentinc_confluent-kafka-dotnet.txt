from kafka topic Right know I cant find any information regardless consume bytes of array multiple messages at once Since consuming each message individually takes a lot of time If such case is impossible whats the best solution would be to consume a lot of data gb each day related to This version just exposes the Consumeint method Unfortunately moving the CancellationToken overload to an extension method does not work as it needs access to cancellationDelayMaxMs which is pulled from config in the Consumer impl So not available to the extension in a nice way I did a search in github for dotnetcancellationdelaymaxms Only a single hit outside ConfluentKafka I havent seen anyone in Corp world use it either ms seems like a reasonable value We could just expose it as a default param on the method And remove the config option leave it up to the dev Also the ConsumeTimeStamp overload is referred to all over the place in xmldoc Mostly codegen so probably not that big of a deal I do like extensions for this kind of thing But not as nice as Id thought in this case Keeping it simple for now I may do another PR with the above changes just to show what it would look like Hi everyone Recently i got some issue when i was facing a disconnection or a coordination load in progress failed No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused Error GroupCoordinator Connect to ipv XXXXXXXXXXX failed No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it after ms in state CONNECT Revoking assignment XXXXXXX Assigned partitions XXXXXX After that messages are not consumed anymore and just my program is waiting Sometimes also Revoking partition Coordinator load in progress Assigning partition Is it a know issue of the version I recently updated from or Did i do something wrong or do i have to do something more Thank you for your kind help ConfluentKafka nuget version Client configuration private ConsumerConfig configKafka new ConsumerConfig

Is this a safe hack mhowlett can you please explain me why this property was not publicly exposed in the library If this version is not safe is there another way to accomplish this Thank you Alex Code

generate the docker image with net core as base image it fails because of ConfluentKafka do not support net core Can someone give me some information if the team is working on this or if there is any
