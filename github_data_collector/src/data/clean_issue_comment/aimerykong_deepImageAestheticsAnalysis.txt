I see that you split the dataset into validation testing and training sets but i just find traing and testing image list in the AADBinfomat sohow can i get the validation sets thank you Hi Thank you for your good share I have a question that how to download the AVA dataset I have checked a lot of information online but there is still no clear way I will be very grateful if you can help me solve this problem Thank you i use the mobilenetv fine tune aadb and get regression six class attritute scores and total scores the result SROCCv SROCCv SROCCv SROCCv SROCCv SROCCv total scores we can see the total scores maybe normal but the attritute scores is bad how can improve the attribute scores maybe the data is not good because the attribute label only i use all the datainclude the scores is can you give me some advise to improve the attribute scores thanks The supplemental material provides additional details about dataset collection and statistics of the resulting data where is the supplemental material i want to read more can you add readme how to use the caffeCustom the env require and step thanks img width alt src in this picture the bandcnet are one of branch fora it is bandc net also input ranks pair of image another question is how the feature fusion and only concated and the attribute net how we get the attribute score from the picture only get attrfeat and last get total scores calcuate the total scores loss aimerykong thanks How to get large AADB dataset datasetImageszip GB Can you give me a link Hi thank you so much for sharing your data and code I wonder how you get the Contfea to ContfeaN Do you pretrain the Contfea layers on categoryspecific subset It will be great if you can help me thank you a lot Hi sir whats the meaning of negative value in imgListtxt such as imgListTrainRegressionColorHarmonytxt farm b cce bjpg Thank you Hi Thank you very much for sharing your code One thing that puzzles me is that the code dose not provide the image list used in mergedNetRankprototxt I wonder how you select pairs of images I also read your paper I noticed that you investigated two strategies for selecting pairs of images used in computing the ranking loss One way is to select pairs of images with a relatively large difference in their average aesthetic scores The other way is sample image pairs that have been scored by the same individual I want to know how this relatively large difference is defined whether there is a need to set a specific threshold for the difference in aesthetic scores and how many pairs of images you used for train I am very looking forward to your help Best wishes Chen Hithank you very much for your code I have learned a lot from it I have a small problem which is not very clear I hope you can take the time to help me out I visualize the trained caffemodel and I found that the numinput of the conv is while the numoutput of cov is What makes it happen It will be great if you can help me thank you
