There is possibility to run Minoca OS on Udoo or more in general on iMX SoCs There are difficulties with the apps swiss sh shntosc file for swissexe The compiler includes the sys typesh file with the tools win MinGW include path so I have to redefine the POINTERADD macro In addition UINTN is not defined The size of a long and a int integer in msvc x is bytes but in gcc x it is bytes Ive been contributing some patches to Sparrowdo One of these changed their bootstrapping script to be POSIX compliant This makes supporting Alpine easier but it has come to my attention that it breaks the script on Minoca It seems that Minoca doesnt come with awk on a default installation As such my request would be to have awk added in order to improve POSIX compliance Hi great work with this new distro works fine But could y add the MQTT broker Mosquitto to the repo I could compile it but there are several dependencies eg needed for libwebsocket and Mosquitto that are not existing in repo Best reagards Nic Any chances to run Minoca on cheapest SBCs Allwinner H H Datasheets SDK Info I can help with debugging and testing have OPi Lite Zero now but cant help much with C still noob in programming Would it be possible to support RISCV in the future GCC has support for RISCV beginning in version RISCV The current GUI debugger seems to be written specifically for Windows OS Is it possible to have a crossplatform WindowsLinuxmacOS GUI debugger pkgminocaosappslibcdynamicgaddrinfc contains if Hints NULL Hintsaiflags AINUMERICSERV return EAISERVICE POSIX says The aiflags field to which the hints parameter points shall be set to zero or be the bitwiseinclusive OR of one or more of the values AIPASSIVE AICANONNAME AINUMERICHOST AINUMERICSERV AIV MAPPED AIALL and AIADDRCONFIG Minoca defines AIADDRCONFIG in appslibcincludenetdbh and should support its use in the hints argument of getaddrinfo I have not looked at whether Minoca supports IP but that is not the issue here Support for AIADDRCONFIG is needed so Minoca can run POSIXcompliant programs that want to adapt to whatever network facilities are available in the current platform Hello It would be nice to add support golang in minoca it even possible a software request gluster mono openzfs
