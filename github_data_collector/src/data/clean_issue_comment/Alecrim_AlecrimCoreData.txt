Hello I am trying to migrate our project from version to and I am encountering some problems Below is current code import AlecrimCoreData import CoreData import CoreLocation open class AbstractCoordinateCD NSManagedObject NSManaged open var latitude CLLocationDegrees NSManaged open var longitude CLLocationDegrees MARK AbstractCoordinateCD query attributes extension AbstractCoordinateCD static let latitude AlecrimCoreDataAttributeCLLocationDegreeslatitude static let longitude AlecrimCoreDataAttributeCLLocationDegreeslongitude MARK AttributeProtocol extensions extension AlecrimCoreDataAttributeProtocol where SelfValueType AbstractCoordinateCD var latitude AlecrimCoreDataAttributeCLLocationDegrees return AlecrimCoreDataAttributeCLLocationDegreeslatitude self var longitude AlecrimCoreDataAttributeCLLocationDegrees return AlecrimCoreDataAttributeCLLocationDegreeslongitude self extension AlecrimCoreDataTableProtocol where SelfElement AbstractCoordinateCD func create coordinate CLLocationCoordinate D SelfElement let retValue create retValuelatitude coordinatelatitude retValuelongitude coordinatelongitude return retValue extension AbstractCoordinateCD var coordinate CLLocationCoordinate D return CLLocationCoordinate Dlatitude latitude longitude longitude In version there is no AlecrimCoreDataAttribute AlecrimCoreDataAttributeProtocol AlecrimCoreDataTableProtocol maybe I am blind but I dont find any alternatives in version Can somebody help me please I am wanting to include this attribute in a FetchRequest so I can construct a FetchRequestController with it but since there is no property for it on FetchRequest nor a constructor that would take an NSFetchRequest to represent the internal state there doesnt seem to be a way to do this using extensions Was thinking something like this syntax would work func includerelationships String FetchRequestEntity And in a Query func includerelationships String QueryEntity Am I missing an avenue to do this external to the framework I am new to Core data Now i am trying to load scheme from local database but it shows me error This is error in Query method screen shot at am This is RecentCalls model is auto generated when we created Entity in our model screen shot at am screen shot at am let persistentContainer PersistentContainer Thread Fatal error try expression unexpectedly raised an error AlecrimCoreDataPersistentContainerErrorinvalidManagedObjectModelURL cap I am migrating from MagicalRecord where I use two persistent stores And though I see the CustomPersistentContainer which apparently I can override I still cannot figure how to add more than one store And the difficult thing here is that one is store is always there but the other store could be added later on not during the initialization Is there way to overrideextend the framework to achieve that Im trying to filter a table like the code below let predicate NSPredicateformat validFrom validUntil signedAt as NSDate signedAt as NSDate result contextcertificatesfilterusing predicate But the XCode show the error Extraneous argument label using in call in the second line Is there a way to use BETWEEN statement with Alecrim
