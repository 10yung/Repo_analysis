Macrocosm contains a lot of great utilities for metaprogramming in Scala as well as great utilities to provide extra guarantees like the regex macro Unfortunately the project seems to be abandoned I would love to expand on Macrocosm and make it available on Maven for Scala and forward but there is no license provided This issue is a request to add a license which allows this project to be expanded on and distributed by others Hi As the title says please show the appropriate library dependency to put in the projects sbt file in the README Cheers Delete duplication
