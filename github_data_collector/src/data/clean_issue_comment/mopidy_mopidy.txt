Hi After letting Mopidy finish a track and going to the next one the track title is not properly updated resulting in the next track having the same title as the previous one This issue slowly seems to grow worse and the entire playlist becomes skewed For the record the audio plays fine the artist is updated fine the track number is updated fine and so is the track length and progress Steps to reproduce Fill the playlist with a few tracks Play one without skipping or seeking as it seems to happen when you let a track play out for a while Let the track finish and watch as the title is not changed when moving to the next track Im running Arch Linux with the following versions of Mopidy and its extensions mopidy mopidylocal mopidympd mopidysoundcloud These are all updated to the latest known version on Arch and the AUR Ive been dealing with this since updating to Mopidy somewhere last year whereas never had this behavior This issue seems similar to however that one talks about Mopidy The tracks shown below are played from mopidylocal In ncmpcpp Incorrect track listing And in polybars MPD extension Polybar MPD This is the actual track listing Correct track listing With a different album I tried to capture the logs with mopidy v during the time it happened Log text DEBUG MainThread mopidyaudioactor Audio event tagschangedtags minimumbitrate bitrate DEBUG MainThread

Pi hats like the Hifiberry Miniamp do not have hardware mixer Thus the buildin software miser has to be used However the physical volume is already very high at mixer setting An configuration option for softwaremixer would help to limit the volume See for the initial discussion Initially reported at by Gadgetoid Inline comments specified with a character work in Mopidy v but not in Mopidy v The ini spec might be hazy but we do try to support this we even have some tests for it For example the following config works fine in Mopidy v x http hostname port a port But in v x mopidy config reports http enabled false Extension disabled due to config errors hostname port Invalid literal for int with base a port and mopidy outputs the warnings WARNING Found http configuration errors The extension has been automatically disabled WARNING httpport invalid literal for int with base a port WARNING Please fix the extension configuration errors or disable the extensions to silence these messages MPD started supporting GroupingTIT tag a while ago upon my request According to id v frames TIT The Content group description frame is used if the sound belongs to a larger category of soundsmusic For example classical music is often sorted in different musical sections eg Piano Concerto Weather Hurricane According to Foobar ID Tag Mapping Hydrogenaudio Knowledgebase TIT corresponds to grouping tag in vorbis comment Id like to use GroupingTIT tag for designating the name of movie or game that a song is made for For example I want to find movie OST songs by the name of the movie I used to use album artist tag for this but grouping tag is more appropriate We have a small set of Core APIs emitting DeprecationWarning in our source code now coreplaybackplays tltrack argument is deprecated

was supposed to be a draft PR I have what appears to be a memory leak on a Mopidy installation on a RasPi booting and running over NFS Initially I thought the problem was that I had no swap set up so I added some but it continues to happen The extremely odd thing about this is that the NFS root image is identical to three other RasPi servers handling sound systems in other rooms of the house but those other three systems have run for weeks without exhibiting any issues The failing unit freezes up nearly once a day The only difference among all four servers is the exact content of the music library but all libraries are pretty smallless than k songs far less in some cases All songs are in MP format in case it makes a difference Heres a screenshot of top that I had left running to see the system state when it freezes Note the insane load and k free swap and the fact that kswapd is pegging the CPU but also that mopidy is the one using all the memory Normally the mopidy process is down around mem usage Im already using a local SQLite db I can run a local scan from the command line with no issues After the above screenshot I powercycled the RasPi and got back into a top session so I could pay more attention to it The MEM value reported has slowly crept upward from about to where it is now I expect it will continue to rise if I do nothing In contrast one of the stable RasPi audio servers has been running for over two weeks solid and playing audio for at least hours without stopping and the mopidy process is at usage It even has a slightly larger library and after a while longer the memory use did indeed continue to creep upwards at when I acted and I ran sudo service mopidy forcereload as a test to see if that would help It didmopidy memory usage dropped down near zero for a moment and then back to the expected No full service restart needed though I assume that also would have done the same The different RasPis involved all report Raspberry Pi Model B Rev from the output of cat sysfirmwaredevicetreebasemodel They are running over NFS mounted root folders that are exact copies of each other except for the hostname The contents of etcmopidymopidyconf are identical The memory usage takes many hours to grow significantly but it will eventually eat up all available RAM and swap space I have confirmed as well that the memory use stops increasing when audio is stopped not sure about paused though The following set of graphs shows RAM and SWAP usage on the problem system over a hour period including two full PLAYSTOP cycles hours long with one final PLAY event at the end to confirm I did another forcereload immediately after this to avoid a complete system freeze and drop RAMswap usage back down to normal levels You can see how the RAM is eaten up first from to during the first cycle then shortly after the second cycle starts it eats the last bit of safe RAM from to and then switches to consuming swap from to until stopped Finally it ticks up again at a consistent rate about minutes before the end of the graph which is where I started playback again Note as far as I can tell pausing playback in the Mopidymoped web interface has the same effect as stopping it in this regard ie it stops eating memory Host platform is Raspbian on a RasPi B v Linux lucasaudio v SMP Thu Aug BST armv l GNULinux It is possible that this issue is related to either most likely or less likely is it possible to change the shuffle function When i select a track for play next the shuffle function doesnt play the track next but a diffrent one i would like to use shuffle select a song for next the songs gets played and shuffle resumes Thank you It will be very useful to have a way to assign a custom image to those personal playlists or artists without image mopidytunein By Location Asia South Korea CBS FM tuneinstations freezes mopidy silently Tue It seems that nonexistent mms URLs from tunein make mopidy freeze for a few minutes There needs to be a way to wait for mms asynchronously
