Applicationrun PR with implementation Github Actions is released in november and now is faster and flexible than travis ci I propose to use Github Actions and Travis CI both and leave only Github Actions in future jenssegers library has pending PRs waiting review one month and more old docs broken ci in travis many issues without answers for community I propose to find new maintainers from community if you dont have enough time to maintance this library Any can fork and improve separately but I think that community can improve this library if maintainers will have enough time for maintance With regards Smolevich Hi there I know this is probably isnt a related question but since we using this package we cant really take advantage of sqlite for testing so my question is that is there any possible way to have or implement an inmemory database testing for mongodb
