I found this out the hard way when I realized my system clock was faster by an hour than the actual time I changed my clock back an hour in timedatecpl and started typing in etherpad later on realized stuff I typed up didnt save when I went back to the etherpad This being cloud etherpad at first I thought there was something wrong with the server but had a suspicion that reverting time was the culprit I created a local instance of etherpad on my own box using vmware workstation etc and lo and behold when I reverted my client clock back an hour and then did some more typing then closed out of browser session rebooted the client not the etherpad server then launched the etherpad in the browser again all work that happened after the clock was reversed back an hour was LOST Is there a way to retrieve or recover this if I have access to the etherpad server itself windows server mysql etc Hello Im trying to embed a betaetherpadorg page onto a personal website While it does load on Chrome it doesnt seem to load open on Safari The following is an error popup on Safari Warning it appears that your browser does not have cookies enabled EtherPad uses cookies to keep track of unique users

feature running a simplified version of backend tests in CI via Docker but in doing so copied modified pasted two files See backendloadSettingsjs containerloadSettingsjs backendspecsapipadjs containerspecsapipadjs This was very useful to get the feature out but now it would be better to unify the spec files A possible idea could be pass some parameters at runtime so that npm test and npm testcontainer end up calling the same script with just different command line parameters Any idea on how to achieve this Admin rights to be allocated to a user to accept reject changes made by collaborators Etherpad should track changes against original document It should not track changes only for the latest version Deletion of content should be marked by strikethrough option Hey folks So I managed to install nodejs v Newer versions not working on shared hosting I managed to install it with changes in settingsjson and start it in my ssh But I cant figure out how to access it Is it because I have a shared IP and its not allowing me to access port on it I am new to coding and basically working this through reading forums Here is the readout from my execution keedapjokeedain publichtmlpadetherpad binrunsh Ensure that all dependencies are up to date If this is the first time you have run Etherpad please be patient wd install

closed Theres the problem because I access the etherpad of someones project from different PCs sometimes at home sometimes at work sometimes when Im visiting friends and every time I have to set my author color again when I want to contribute to that etherpad I know the approximate hue of color that I want but its very hard to get the exact same color again with that color circle thing would it be possible to let me simply enter the RGB value of my desired color so Id be able to get the exact same color again Keep the inexact color circle thing but also have RGB value boxes that allow an exact selection That would be great Introduction I have ephashauth installed The current settingsjsontemplate explicitly states WARNING passwords should not be stored in plaintext in this file If you want to mitigate this please install ephashauth and follow the section secure your installation in READMEmd users admin password can be replaced with hash if you install ephashauth please note that if password is null the user will not be created password changeme isadmin true Setup settingsjson looks like users admin hash etherpadadminpasswordhash isadmin true Log output WARN console Removing user admin because it has no password field WARN console Admin username and password not set in settingsjson To access admin please uncomment and edit users in settingsjson Cannot login with the hashed password Setup settingsjson looks like users admin hash etherpadadminpasswordhash password plaintextpassword isadmin true Log output contains nothing suspect Can login with the hashed password as well as with the plaintext password Setup Workaround settingsjson looks like users admin hash etherpadadminpasswordhash password isadmin true Log output contains nothing suspect Can login with the hashed password but not with a plaintext password Conclusion Password authentication code is buggy The easiest solution would probably be to not remove users from the config if they have an attribute hash However is the behaviour under setup desired
