Hello im having this issue i use prisma alpha and this is the repo ErrorOops an unknown error occured This is on us you did nothing wrong It occured in the return await ctxphotonpostscreate invocation in C Users owner Documents modernapps lightmatter new src types Mutationts consolelogevarepsilon Ylength consolelogmallalength return await ctxphotonpostscreate Reason called Optionunwrap on a None value in src libcore optionrs Please create an issue in the photonjs repo with your schemaprisma and the Photon method you tried to use at PhotonFetcheranonymous C Users owner Documents modernapps lightmatter new nodemodules prisma photon indexjs at Generatorthrow anonymous at rejected C Users owner Documents modernapps lightmatter new nodemodules prisma photon indexjs at processtickCallback internalprocessnexttickjs There a plenty of private fields in the PrismaClient class which are properly hidden when using TypeScript but are visible when a user is working with plain JS I suggest we move all toplevel propertiesfunctions that are not intended for the user to a prefixed wrapper property In the generated Prisma Client we export dmmf in the indexjs file However the PrismaClient constructor then goes ahead and mutates this export establishing circular relations This means that the exported DMMF can no longer be stringified easily Studio needs the DMMF to be stringifyable so it can be transported via HTTP Websockets etc In previous versions of Prisma we could pass this inside a resolver if we had a DateTime type and then use it to query items from database Ill provide an example of what I want to be able to do So suppose we have many different rows inside our table which has a createdAt column There is multiple rows which have the same date of creation but the time is different like so T T and so on If Ill pass Ill get all of those rows which have a as a date Besides that it would be nice to be able to pass an array of dates like so and use it inside in parameter so it would return all of the rows within those days with all possible time values I hope this is a clear explanation Would like to hear some comments on that Hello there Reason called Resultunwrap on an Err value Error kind Closed cause None in srclibcoreresultrs This error occurred when a mutation was running and the app was restarting on Expo It might be the same as if the app was purely killed

optkorihorservernodemodulesprismaphotonindexjs at processTicksAndRejections internalprocesstaskqueuesjs see Internal This is a continuation of the comment left on Ive created a minimal repository with instructions on how to recreate the issue Original comment Given this schema prisma model Person id String id defaultcuid parent Person relationname ParentChildRelation When I create people parent and child js await photonpeoplecreate data id parent await photonpeoplecreate data id child Then update the child to have parent as its parent js await photonpeopleupdate where id child data parent connect id parent This is what I get I would have assumed that the row with the id of child to have parent in its parent column Instead its the other way around Is this supposed to be how this works Thanks
