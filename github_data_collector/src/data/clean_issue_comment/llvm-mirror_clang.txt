Currently setting the option ConstructorInitializerAllOnOneLineOrOnePerLine only breaks after the colon if the constructor initializer does not fit in one line This behaviour even goes against the documentation of the option where nowhere a dependency on line length is mentioned Therefore in my opinion this is a bug With this change ConstructorInitializerAllOnOneLineOrOnePerLine always breaks for BCISAfterColon regardless of line length Disable output in quiet mode and no modified files Quiet mode is very useful for scripting when you want just the diff format output or none if not exist In case of no modified files gitclangformat will output to screen even though the quiet mode enabled This patch changes this behavior so if quiet flag passes in no output will be available even if no modified files exists Previously scanbuildbat relied on the PATH to locate the scanbuild Perl script However this causes trouble when neither are accessible via the PATH Instead I propose that we explicitly pass the scanbuild Perl script found adjacent to scanbuildbat It also seems counterintuitive to me that explicitly invoking pathtoscanbuildbat could instead run a different scanbuild Perl script located via the PATH If you are an accomplished programmer and you have a brain the bazillion lines of notes produced by the compiler are completely unhelpful The notes clutter the output with identically poormisleading information and make it very hard to find the real error This option suppresses those notes It is not enabled by default so clang behaves normally without the switch
