I have a situation using yoyo and repeat in a tween Im using tweenjs to animate the opacity of a circle The idea is to smoothly set opacity to and back to Im using yoyo to for it but It has an unexpected behavior when I use start a second time The first time the tween goes from smoothly to then smoothly back to The second time the tween goes from to abruptly to then smoothly back to The expected behavior is the first time the tween goes from smoothly to then smoothly back to The second time and any other times the tween goes from smoothly to then smoothly back to To make it work I have to set again the to method and tweenvaluesStartopacity valuesStart is not a public property so setting it doesnt seem valid Migration to Typescript maintaining backward compatibility Pass all original tests and examples without change eslint Uses the recommended rules from the typescripteslinteslintplugin typescripteslintrecommended prettiertypescripteslint prettierrecommended Resolved dependency vulnerabilities before npm i audited packages in s found vulnerabilities low moderate high critical now npm i audited packages in s found vulnerabilities We could always use more easing functions An easing function is singlevariable function that maps values in the range to a numeric value Generally we require that f and f but otherwise there are no constraints If you want to help out feel free to submit a PR and dont worry about code style If you need help I can provide a template for your PR Tests arent required for easing functions but if you want to you can add the new easing function to the graphs example I want to have a working build automation server for this project but TravisCI doesnt support that very well I want the server to build every commit that hits master except its own and then push a commit with the contents of the dist directory I dont want to submit a PR for version bumps Ideally the person who approves the PR would be required to choose between major minor and patch and everything would be automatic from there If the CI has something like the semanticrelease plugin that we used to use then that would work too buildkite is a build and CI server with GitHub integration selfexplanatory It isnt written in the docs that start even can get passed a value instead of using delay but it can Whats weird is that when passed a string instead of a number the number is parsed and then multiplied by ten start gives it a second delay while start gives it a second delay If I had to guess what the problem is Id say its probably by thisstartTime time undefined typeof time string TWEENnow parseFloattime time TWEENnow thisstartTime thisdelayTime and when its adding the delayTime its concatenating them ie parseFloat didnt work and thisstartTime is registering as a string Thus it added a to itself and only works as a number later on fix I guess something like thisstartTime parseFloatthisstartTime thisdelayTime but Im not really sure why the issue appears in the first place Hi I have the follwing code for var j j j if i thispositions length i var tween new TWEENTweenthisreelOne position tothispositions i repeatInfinity start i Could advise what is the way to stop it I tried var tween new TWEENTweenthisreelOne position tothispositions i repeatInfinity onUpdatefunctionif i tweenstop start but it doesnt seem to be working Thanks
