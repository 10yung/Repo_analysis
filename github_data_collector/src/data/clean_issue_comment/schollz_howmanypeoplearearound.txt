Since theres a chance a user might use the h flag instead of the help flag this commit will let them use both to view the help menu Hi schollz first things first thanks for making such a cool project I was trying to use this on my mac osx And heres what I did Connected to wifi Ran sh brew install wireshark brew cask install wiresharkchmodbpf sudo SystemLibraryPrivateFrameworksApple frameworkVersionsCurrentResourcesairport z Installed the pip package and ran howmanypeoplearearound I see a very big list of options img width altimage src Im not sure which one is my wifi adapter that supports monitor mode Is there any way to figure that out Also I tried to bruteforce and give it a shot with all the option but everytime the response after scanning is Found no signals are you sure en supports monitor mode Can you please help if Im missing any step This change adds a capture filter so that tshark only captures probe requests ignoring all the other traffic that comes up when a wireless interface is listening in monitor mode It uses the following pcap capture filter type mgt subtype probereq pcapfilter docs By using a pcap filter there is less information in the temporary pcap file to parse Hopefully this slightly optimizes the code PS This is my first pull request I hope it is helpful but my sincerest apologies if this is irrelevant or unhelpful Thanks again for sharing this project and your awesome documentation Related and Would it be possible to add a flag so we do NOT store MAC addresses and only see an aggregate count of devices at a given timestamp The program is great but as it stands can not be used on public networks in Europe over GDPR compliancy Create a docker image with all dependencies installed WiFi signals are also bent in specific ways by physical objects Could we access the antenna directly and use something like OpenCV to count people nearby Is there a way to have the JSON output print names of devices that I manually input into a seperate file For example if I know that my android has a mac address of ADC C E B could I manually configure a file for the script to refer to so that while running it would associate ADC C E B with myandroid and print out the name myandroid for me to quickly recognize rather than the mac address Hi I am running linux and the program called howmanypeoplearearound seems to respond with Traceback most recent call last File usrlocalbinhowmanypeoplearearound line in module loadentrypointhowmanypeoplearearound consolescripts howmanypeoplearearound File usrlocallibpython sitepackagespkgresourcesinitpy line in loadentrypoint return getdistributiondistloadentrypointgroup name File usrlocallibpython sitepackagespkgresourcesinitpy line in loadentrypoint return epload File usrlocallibpython sitepackagespkgresourcesinitpy line in load return selfresolve File usrlocallibpython sitepackagespkgresourcesinitpy line in resolve module importselfmodulename fromlist name level File usrlocallibpython sitepackageshowmanypeoplearearoundmainpy line in module from pick import pick File usrlocallibpython sitepackagespickinitpy line in module import curses File usrlocallibpython cursesinitpy line in module from curses import ModuleNotFoundError No module named curses Can anyone help me with this issue as I have tried to work around it with the response to the older version but that does not work either First you may have no reason to support this environment If not feel free to close and resolve I am testing it because I am curious only Thanks Pete But I did want see the package and was able to run the install in the Spyder IDE using pipmain install howmanypeoplearearound Following was then run and output is not informative import howmanypeoplearearound howmanypeoplearearound Out module howmanypeoplearearound from C Users Peter Anaconda lib sitepackages howmanypeoplearearound initpy So not getting the output I expected per the doc for this module Using wlan adapter and scanning for seconds s left There are about people around Edit I should add The TShark module was not imported This may help explain the results Thanks On which version of Raspbian did you successfully install howmanypeoplearearound On Raspbian Jessie I was unable to get the proper permissions for tshark working AFTER a successful install On Raspbian Stretch I am unable to successfully install with Docker OR pip The Docker command fails with returned a nonzero code The pip command is successful but howmanypeoplearearound is not found by bash when executing ie howmanypeoplearearound command not found
