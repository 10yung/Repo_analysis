 Description of specific issue Our code currently compatible with both python and python series is characterized as straddling We are keen to use Python to its full potential and we currently accept the cost of writing crosscompatible code to allow a smooth transition but we don t intend to maintain this compatibility indefinitely Although the transition has not been as quick as we hoped we do see it taking place with more and more people using teaching and recommending Python The developers of the Python language extended support of Python from to January recognising that many people were still using Python We believe that the extra years is sufficient to transition off of Python and our projects plan to stop supporting Python when upstream support ends in if not before We will then be able to simplify our code and take advantage of the many new features in the current version of the Python language and standard library We have pledged to drop support for Python no later than Please see for details on the transition in the Python ecosystem x Deprecation notice changes will be very gradual x Enhancement topdown refactoring of source code x Support installation by pip eg pip install pre fecon Rebuild Docker container using Miniconda latestLinuxx sh as base Expected behavior The transition should be smooth and we will take the opportunity to refactor and reorganize the code from topdown Users using the Anaconda distribution based on python will have to install a new distribution based on python For the fecon Docker image the transition will be announced and automatically be set up for you Installation by pip We have intentionally avoided the pip because optimal installation of fecon dependencies has been difficult esp for binaries and newbies Unfortunately pip is incapable of true dependency resolution whereas Anaconda conda installs are reliable This may change towards the year where only python is involved and pipenv matures The major annoyances are summarized here and minor details not mentioned are even more tedious fecon version v notebooks will begin import of fecon Python version al least through expect at least thereafter Operating systems Linux Mac Windows Description of specific issue We are expecting major disruption in getting data on equities mutual funds and ETFs via pandasdatareader due its dependency on API of both Yahoo and Google Finance Fail quote retrieval via our module libyistockpy if no fix upstream Enhancement if fecon takes independent action in its yistock module Observed behavior Yahoo employee has confirmed that the free EndOfDay data has been terminated presumably due to acquisition by Verizon Possible workaround ralgotrading on Google JSON termination presumably due to costcutting by new product manager Our yistock module may appear to be working but please tail your dataframe to verify whether quote retrieval goes beyond silent fail to get current stock quotes Alternatives to enhance behavior Switch over to Quandl using our libyiquandlpy module See lists premium databases But for free stock price data Alpha Vantage Requires user to get free API key Python wrapper MIT license tiingo Requires user to get free API key EODhistoricaldata Scrape Google Finance pages currently also works for international stocks which is not a robust solution relative to API code since the page layout is subject to UI changes Why would the improvement be useful to most users Information from the equities markets is vital for financial economics Before releasing our own independent solution we expect to make a pull request to the pandasdatareader repository Please kindly propose alternative solutions below or at and look into pandasdatareader issues Check for revisions upstream It is possible that a solution has been merged into pandasdatareader and all that is necessary is an update of the package see its CHANGELOG and make sure the update is compatible with the latest fecon Note Anaconda distribution uses hyphen not underscore conda update pandasdatareader Additional helpful details for bugs Problem started recently Problem can be reliably reproduced fecon version v pandas version pandasdatareader version Major release v benefits from the python compatibility changes made during v All modules are now operational under both Python and Also code has been rewritten for crossplatform performance Linux Mac and Windows We MOVED the yimodules from nb to a new directory lib Python uses absolute import and our python code now conforms to that practice To update pre notebooks please use import style discussed in docs README The toplevel module fecon py formerly known as nbfeconpy is also explained in that introduction With adoption of python printfunction the python print statement must be rewritten as a function We also highly recommend inclusion of PREAMBLEp which gives versioning requirements for successful notebook replication With those fixes our notebooks should run under both Python kernels in Jupyter without any dependency on Linux
