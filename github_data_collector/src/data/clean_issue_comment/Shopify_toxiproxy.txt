There are binaries for the client and server software on However there are no binaries for the arm platform Would it be possible to add binaries for the arm platform Hi I would like to install toxiproxy in RHEL version and downloaded toxiproxyserverlinuxamd from release Could you please share the installation or execution steps for the same Need one more clarification like go should be installed for this or not Thanks Shyam I am trying to do a simple setup of using toxiproxy for rd party service APIs but running into an issue that I cant seem to resolve I am running toxiproxy inside a container on my local machine and then trying to access the upstream service from the host Here are the simple configurations Run toxiproxy docker run expose dns p p it shopifytoxiproxy Create a simple proxy toxiproxycli create testproxy l u apiboxcom Make sure proxy is created toxiproxycli list Name Listen Upstream Enabled Toxics testproxy apiboxcom enabled None The etchosts file on the host machine contains the following entry apiboxcom Now when I try to access the upstream service from the host the request fails with some SSL initiation error curl s v w Total timetotals n header Host apiboxcom Trying TCPNODELAY set Connected to apiboxcom port ALPN offering h ALPN offering http successfully set certificate verify locations CAfile etcsslcertpem CApath none TLSv OUT TLS handshake Client hello LibreSSL SSLconnect SSLERRORSYSCALL in connection to apiboxcom Closing connection Total s I have already looked at the issue but it seems that those steps are not valid if toxiproxy is running inside a container The issue does not go away even If I take the approach of using a different hostname for the call by doing the following Use test boxcom as the hostname of the upstream service and put it in etchosts of the host machine as test boxcom And then doing a request from the host machine curl s v w Total timetotals n Trying TCPNODELAY set Connected to ttboxcom port ALPN offering h ALPN offering http successfully set certificate verify locations CAfile etcsslcertpem CApath none TLSv OUT TLS handshake Client hello LibreSSL SSLconnect SSLERRORSYSCALL in connection to ttboxcom Closing connection Total s Hi I would like to add metrics to allow RT monitoring to allow automatic manual test on remote servers verify that the traffic is actually passing through toxiproxy verify that they stop see clients connects and disconnects and so on Ive been experimenting with the code and got something working and would like to consult before I create a PR The functionality I added does as follows added a metrics endpoint that returns a map that describes the number of total messages per proxy added a events endpoint that returns a list of messages proxy client upstream event type and timestamp for up to minutes ago A token is returned with each response that can be used in the next request to receive only unseen events The way I did it is by creating a metrics module with a RegisterEvent method In proxygo I report when client connects in linkgo I report that a clients disconnects Things got trickier when trying to report messages I used the fact that noop toxic is always present to report from there The problem is that noop toxic doesnt have any context to its work so I had to add ProxyName and Upstream to NoopProxy and had to pass this information on to and from where it is created namely Link and ToxicStub Does this make sense In addition I wasnt able to tell in NoopProxy which client sent a specific message Any idea how can I do that Thanks I am able to connect my client to the proxy even if the upstream server socket is not accepting connections This means I cannot test all my use cases eg server is absent because the proxy will accept the connection on behalf of the upstream When I go to send data it errors but I would rather the socket is not accepted if upstream is down An alternative would be if the upstream rule is disabled then the proxy does not accept connections for that rule Behaving in this manner would change the code in which the server accepts connections During the acceptance the server would either attempt a connection to upstream and refuse the client if that server could not be established or verify the rules and if enabled was false it would reject the connection Very small change Pulling image by digest instead of tag to have a deterministic and safer build Im using the latest alpine I have kind of a unique situation that can use your help on In my environment we terminate TLS at a LB before it gets routed to my toxiproxy instance Then toxiproxy tries to send to the downstream service over https but I get the Client sent an HTTP request to an HTTPS server error Basic layout Source HTTPS LB TLS Terminated here toxiproxy listening on Downstream HTTPS LB TLS Terminated here downstream listening on I can get past it by not pointing it to the downstream HTTPS LB but I could only hit a single service then and it would need to be reconfigured anytime a new deployment happens Not very user friendly It seems that toxiproxy only send over TCP and doesnt try to do https even if its over port Is there any way I could get around this Any ideas will be helpful I found that the README didnt mention that you have to run toxiproxyserver and was stuck on this for awhile This PR adds that you have to run toxiproxyserver as a step for the Mac OSX installation As most of the other installation sections have you run the service Hi quick question Example create a proxy for an webapp like toxiproxycli create myapp l localhost u localhost toxiproxycli toxic add myapp t bandwidth n speed a rate Now when I run the webapp locally and point my browser at localhost the bandwidth rate it seems to limit only the download speed but not the upload speed Is it possible to limit also the upload speed using toxiproxy What proposal Id like to get support of multiple upstream hosts in single proxy definition of balancing strategy at least roundrobin andor leastmostconnected As of now v there is no way how to specify multiple upstreams for single proxy at least in toxiproxycli and python toxiproxy client Why usecase My usecase uses toxiproxy to test the applications behaviour when introduced a toxics between the application and any of depending applications all in kubernetes The way we introduce toxics wo necessity of the application a change is to run toxiproxy and load all proxies to the dependent applications force the application app under test to route via launched toxiproxy via local linux etchosts resolver Given the strategy it is clear that toxiproxy proxy binds same port as dependent app hasbinds no port translation in place Here comes the trouble there is the application which communicates with HA storage consisting of multiple hosts binding the same port redis sentinel for such case Id like to create toxiproxy proxy with multiple upstreams to block none all upstreams The current workaround I have is to use multiple toxiproxy instances but it comes with additional orchestration cost Any suggestions how to deal with the scenario are welcome
