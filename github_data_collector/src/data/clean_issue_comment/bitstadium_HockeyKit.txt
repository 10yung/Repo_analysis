I see my app in Server hockeykit but requesting it from Android delivers result Apache log has no entry and honestly Ive no idea whats wrong here Any hints for me Thank you we are trying to setup an Appstore in our workspace using hockey kit latest version Following things are done we have setup the wamp server on a windows system and when we try invoking the address ipaddress applicationname public Then we are able to see our listed applications both android and ios and we are also able to download both ipa and apk files from above link Then we checked on an Android phone and there also it seems to work fine but when we are trying to download files from iphone ios it is showing could not connect to any suggestions on what would have went wrong and how to proceed I am unable to get the Install Profile button to actually install the profile I tried to follow instructions for the adding of new apps but it seems Distribute for Enterprise is locked down for only Enterprise Developer Accounts which would not really work for AdHocApp Store Targeted apps I am downloading the Provision Profile direct from our member center from the Apple Developer Account Is there something I am missing here I captured the following from the console profiled Notice Error MC Failed to parse profile data Error NSError Desc Invalid Profile US Desc Invalid Profile Domain MCProfileErrorDomain Code Type MCFatalError Dec iPad profiled Notice Error MC Profile cannot be queued for installation Error NSError Desc Invalid Profile Sugg Invalid Profile US Desc Invalid Profile US Sugg Invalid Profile Domain MCInstallationErrorDomain Code Type MCFatalError Underlying error NSError Desc Invalid Profile US Desc Invalid Profile Domain MCProfileErrorDomain Code Type MCFatalError is there any way to get HockeyKit working with Windows MobilePhone apps Fixed warning The viewDidUnload instance method in UIViewController subclass BWHockeySettingsViewController is missing a super viewDidUnload call I completely set up the server and the application page was shown properly But after I click Install Application on iOS device iPod Gen iOS It shows error pop up saying that Cannot connect to website What I think it might relate is as follows What is the value should I have in plist file Right now I have something like I use https to access the build Any clue or suggestion on this problem New to HockeyKit trying it out as an alternative to Apples overly restrictive changes to TestFlight Got client SDK integrated and server setup I can go to app page on laptop and Download Profile and Download App buttons both work However on my iPhone iOS test device neither work OK I just read that iOS no longer supports manual installationmanagement of profiles but that its handled automatically when installing an app Fine but tapping the Install Application button also does nothing at all If I copy the link and paste it into Safari it asks Open this page in App Store which sounds right but again clicking Open does nothing at all EDIT I figured it out iOS requires both displayimage and fullsizeimage keys to be present in the plist So now it asks me to Install App and I get a greyed out default app icon on the springboard but it doesnt seem to ever get downloaded however the network in use spinner in the status bar remains active Ideas BarButtonItem initWithImage might introduce a new crash in iOS Please confirm Propose UIImage image UIImage imageNamedgearpng imageWithRenderingModeUIImageRenderingModeAlwaysTemplate UIButton button UIButton new button setImageimage forStateUIControlStateNormal button sizeToFit button addTargetself actionselectoropenSettings forControlEventsUIControlEventTouchUpInside selfnavigationItemleftBarButtonItem UIBarButtonItem alloc initWithCustomViewbutton hey guys Im trying to setup HockeyKit for our app In my public directory is following dir structure public comcompanyapp version appipa manifestplist version appipa manifestplist In same way as described here However Im seeing only last version of the app I tried test stuff from but with same result Is this issue or intended behavior that was my initial understanding after reading the wiki page but the more I look into code the less I think this is the case Cheers Jan
