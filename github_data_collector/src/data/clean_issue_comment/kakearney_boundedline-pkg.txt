If the first argument X is of type datetime it breaks because isnan doesnt work on datetime isnat works instead If bounds are defined in such a way that the bounds cross over each other the resulting patch is not rendered correctly This can occur if for example the bounds are applied to the independent rather than the dependent variable in a line plot matlab x y sindx e boundedlinexyeorientationhoriz blcrisscross Issue raised by Chad Greene via email There has been several discussions of handling NaNs on the Matlab toolbox page While there are several options for handling NaNs in all cases eg in x or y or in the patch etc The simplest and most typical case is to handle NaNs in y in the same manner as plot command so that noncontiguous lines are supported Consider this plot x y x rand boundary ones boundedlinex y boundary requires boundedline function to be on path bounded Now when we add a NaN in y this is not supported y NaN boundedlinex y boundary error This is the desired behavior boundednan This is akin to the way the plot command would handle this case plotx y with y NaN plotnan
