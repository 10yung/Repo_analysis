 x This is not a usage question x This is not a security issue x This bug is reproducible with a clean install of authlogic x I am committed to fixing this in a reasonable amount of time and responding promptly to feedback Its ok if the reaction to this issue is this is actually a usage question however in that case I would appreciate some guidance on how to contribute to the repository on how to make it more helpful and clear for others Expected Behavior With ignoreblankpasswordstrue as the good sane default users can happily update their profile etc without too much trouble Before password resets in Authlogic just worked even with ignoreblankpasswordstrue The Authlogic example app and documentation recommended us to follow this pattern in the controller userpassword params user password userpasswordconfirmation params user passwordconfirmation Actual Behavior This behavior began for us with Authlogic which we migrated to using similar validations as to those provided in the readme Using the same code and defaults as before users can now submit blank passwords to the reset form which has the result of logging them in without resetting their passwords Authlogic leaves validations up to the user providing a example set of validations but there seems to be no clear migration path best practice or default for handling password resets The fact that the password logic is heavily managed by ignoreblankpasswords makes it difficult to know off the bat what the best solution is and others might be surprised that password resets wont be possible without changing config Options The default is changed to ignoreblankpasswordsfalse and documentation changed to recommend dont allow empty password fields to submit in your view use a different form for password changing Internal magic happens and we create an exception for ignoreblankpasswords such as when the only fields being submitted are password fields We add a manual onetime flag to User to bypass ignoreblankpasswords ala No app changes but we update the README and UPGRADING to highlight this change in behavior For our app I think we will just set ignoreblankpasswordsfalse as we actually arent sending blank passwords up anymore except on password resets x This is not a usage question x This is not a security issue x I am committed to implementing this feature in a reasonable amount of time and responding promptly to feedback Current Behavior User inexperience developer when submitting bug feature request user is obligated to committed on implementing a the fixes in reasonable amount of time However it is not possible for inexperience developer who found bugs and dont know how to fix it Proposed Behavior Inexperience developer may submit valid usefull for common user and fully described bug feature request information but not obligated to fix it Inexperience developer encouraged to write test to to the bugs feature request but not required Proposed Solution remove I am committed to implementing this feature in a reasonable amount of time and responding promptly to feedback from issue template Because ActionControllerAPI does not include ActionControllerCookies metal and ActionDispatchCookies rack module Therefore our controller can not use the cookies method In this patch AuthlogicSessionBase calls controllercookies only when available This ports the encryptedcookies option from the stable branch Namely in the magic columns there are some counter increments that are done as validations Itd be nice to refactor these to be callbacks instead
