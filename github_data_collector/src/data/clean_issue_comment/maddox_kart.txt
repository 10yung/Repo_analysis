Hi when I run scriptbootstrap after I have cloned kart i got this error in the Terminal Installing modules npm WARN deprecated wrench wrenchjs is deprecated You should check out fsextra for any operations you were using wrench for Thanks for all the usage over the years abbrev nodemodulesgruntdownloadelectronnodemodulesdecompresszipnodemodulesnoptnodemodulesabbrev nodemodulesabbrev cut a part because it was too long and the installation seems to do correctly githubreleases nodemodulesgruntdownloadelectronnodemodulesgithubreleases nodemodulesgithubreleases wrench nodemodulesgruntdownloadelectronnodemoduleswrench nodemoduleswrench npm WARN Kart No repository field npm WARN Kart No license field rm atomshell No such file or directory Warning Task gruntdownloadelectron not found Use force to continue Aborted due to warnings I dont know what to do after and also Im on a mac with everything in the last update Please add a license so that we know that we may actually do something with this smile This lets us see the original coffeescript source files while debugging in the developer tools not just the js generated by the coffeescript source Not sure if this is something you want i just noticed it while messing with some atom language tests and thought it might be a good addition Although since i dont know coffeescript its kinda nice to see the js that gets generated the more im typing the less sure i am about creating this PR construction construction construction construction construction construction construction WIP construction construction construction construction construction construction construction This is early but Im gonna push it up while I work on it This lets you edit the art for a rom right from inside Kart It adds a new button to the game card that prompts a modal giving choices of art I wrote a quick consolegridcom scraper in Ruby and threw it up on Heroku so it had something simple to call out to as an API It works pretty well editart To Do x Add loading UI while the api request is still processing x Add credit to consolegridcom in the modal linking to them x Add form for adding art via a URL x Clean up the modal to just look a little better x Some error handling Fix loader to be adjusted to where the art will appear Make sure the art results content can scroll with an overflow Add loader when updating art via url Figure out why events stop working after the first time the modal is shown One of my frustrations with this app when I first started was that I had games in the right folders but I didnt see any of them show up I added backgrounds to the images folders and then they would show up It was pretty confusing to have roms but not see anything show up A flood of doubts overwhelmed me cry ok ok I exaggerate but I started to question whether I had set something up wrong didnt have libretro working or if kart was just broken I think having a generic image would be helpful if theres no image already Ive been using the geopatterns stuff in other projects of mine because theyre easy and look good I can use those when there isnt an image for a rom already present I dont mind coding up a PR just wanted to get your thoughts What do you think Did you have other ideas for this already Way later down the road it would be nice to allow the user to find a good image for a rom through a Creative Commons search
