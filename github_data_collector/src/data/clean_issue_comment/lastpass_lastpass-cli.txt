Since brew update is run automatically before brew install this part of the README seems unnecessary This behaviour exists since Signedoffby Jim Howell jimbocodergmailcom Hi Im trying to log in using lpass cli with Microsoft authenticator enabled After entering my master password an error in red appears saying Microsoft authenticator authentication required But then it asks me for my master password again so nothing happens Im able to log in through web and browser extension by entering the fa code So it seems there is a problem with the lastpass cli Ive already reported this issue through LogMeIn Support ticket and they confirmed the issue and it seems it requires code change lpass version LastPass CLI v GIT installed via brew macOS Mojave version curl version curl x appledarwin libcurl LibreSSL zlib nghttp Protocols dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ldap ldaps pop pop s rtsp smb smbs smtp smtps telnet tftp Features AsynchDNS IPv Largefile GSSAPI Kerberos SPNEGO NTLM NTLMWB SSL libz HTTP UnixSockets HTTPSproxy Please let me know if you need more details about the issue Thank you Pablo If I create a new site the only password related field is Password I can update this and everything autofill etc works as expected Some of my other entries are older and have both a pwd and Password field If I update the Password field the autofill feature still pulls the value from the pwd field In the vault the Password field is used to populate the Site password input element in the UI but upon clicking the wrench to view all the background fields I see that pwd is the old value It seems that even in the vault updating the Site password doesnt affect the pwd field however if I update the pwd field in the UI it does affect the Password Site password value Furthermore it seems impossible to delete the pwd field Im at an impass do I delete and recreate all of my entries so that none have the pwd field I dont want to add pwd to all entries as then the vaults UI doesnt seem to work properly The documentation says that the lastpasscli rpm should be in EPEL for CentOS or greater However on CentOS it is not available even in EPEL Is the documentation wrong or is the fact the rpm isnt in EPEL a mistake I want to use lastpasscli with my WSL terminal but unfortunately since WSL cant open graphical programs xclip does not work I copy things to my clipboard on WSL using clipexe which functions just the same as using xclip so I assume it wouldnt be out of the realm to implement The output format of lpass ls is incompatible with the input format of lpass show This is pretty frustrating For instance it does not allow me to pipe the output into my own fuzzy finder I would like to do something like lpass ls fzf lpass show pc and let fzf fuzzy find the entry Im interested in Right now ls gives output like categoryname id Is there a flag to make lpass show accept this output as input I want to be able to use a local passcode to access lpass when logged in This is both more secure I do not need to type out my main password when under camera supervision in public places and more ergonomic Ill use an easiertotype passcode than my main password This design pattern is fairly common in apps that contain personal information but need highavailability I like to do sth like lpass show G X byusername someuser and see all accounts with the matched username This is quite useful when you have multiple accounts on a single site
