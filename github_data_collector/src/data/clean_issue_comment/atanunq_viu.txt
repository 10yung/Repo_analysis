Not sure if I am missing something Installed like this cargo install viu then opened an image like this viu Desktoptenorgif The quality is like this Screen Shot at PM While original gif is this tenor with sixel you can get better resolutions of images Currently Im using dcraw and cjpeg commands to decode and convert raw image file then pipe to viu dcraw c w rawimagefile cjpeg viu It works but with a bit patient about s waiting time for displaying a raw iamge It would run faster I believe if viu could support raw images by default like cr sr dng Here is a site containing different raw files for testing Played back with viu Original gif It could be useful to be able to use viu as an image viewer for terminal apps Eg Im trying to get it work with ranger cli file manager only by replacing the img txt with viu But it gives garbled render of the image Can you maybe help with a possible solution to this Here is viu output Here is viu in ranger preview Something below can not build in windows I am trying to reimplement it with crossterm libcioctl libcSIGPIPE libcSIGDFL
