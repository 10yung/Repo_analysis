 This is a great project Thank you for all the work youve put into it Id be interested in contributing a configuration file and some docs for it as an option in or near the Prerequisites section your READMEmd to your project but wanted to run it by you with context before just making a PR At the hack night meetups Ive been going to a lot of the people showing up want to learn Python but dont know where to start or even where to look But this is the perfect place to start and to continue revisiting One thing we consistently run into though is getting up and running in the first place Learning environments are extra tricky to navigate on those nights because during experimentation people have often ended up with different Python and Python package versions installed globally locally with pip with aptget etc I think offering integration with an ActiveState project could be really helpful for people with difficulty getting started and people like me trying to help out on hack nights Heres the documentation addition Im imagining On Linux and have ActiveStates state tool Run state activate from the project directory And heres what the config file looks like as an activestateyaml name learnpython owner shnewto languages name python The general idea is that with an account on you can preconfigure a Python or Perl environment with whatever packages you want and it builds a binary you can install The state tool works as a kind of a meta venv for those preconfigured environments so you dont have to install your projects dependencies system wide Windows and macOS support on the way Heres a link to the learnpython project I created it does require creating an account to view while were in the early stages of building all this up Would be happy to answer any questions or to make a PR if youre open to it PS If youd rather create your own project as and use that instead of the shnewtolearnpython project I put together thatd be great too If you did the configuration file might look something like this name learnpython owner trekhleb languages name python
