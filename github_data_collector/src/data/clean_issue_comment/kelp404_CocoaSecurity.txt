Is it possible to add RSA support When i try to decrypt big filearound mb that time it shows around double sized memory allocation when i profile the application for memory allocation Can you guide me if any way to do stream read data from file and stream output the decrypted data which can be written to file at last I have big size file to decrypt any way for asynchronous decryption It hangs execution un till decryption completed Using system method to base and check OS version As noted in readme In the iOS and Mac OS SDKs Apple introduced new base methods on NSData that make it unnecessary to use a rd party base decoding library Whats more they exposed access to private base methods that are retrospectively available back as far as IOS and Mac OS I wanted to fork and submit a PR But in NSData base encoding there is this NSDataBase EncodingOptions parameter that Im not sure which one I should use So I created this issue instead Currently CS uses malloc to allocate memory This allocation is not zeroed and old data resides there While most operations will succeed and overwrite the data the best practice especially in a security class is to use calloc instead to zero out the allocation before use malloc calloc
