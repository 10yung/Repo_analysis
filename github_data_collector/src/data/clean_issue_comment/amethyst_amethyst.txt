number of occurrences of the following error error E type annotations needed consider giving result a type in this macro invocation Reproduction Steps Create a new empty cargo project add the dependency amethyst version features metal or cargo build What You Expected to Happen All the Amethyst components should compile What Actually Happened metal fails to compile Screenshots and Logs If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem Any relevant logs would be helpful as well Your Environment OS Mac OS Mojave OS version Amethyst versions and cratesio Additional Context The master version of Amethyst is using metal from gfxbackendmetal from rendyutil which compiles Description When trying to build an example there is no OpenGL backend feature I see that there is a gfxbackendgl in gfxrs so I was expecting that Amethyst and Rendy would support it What problem does this solve What need does it fill Add an OpenGL backend so people without Vulkan support can still develop with Amethyst or even ship games using OpenGL as a backend Describe the solution youd like Id like to see an OpenGL backend Im willing to contribute code for this Describe alternatives youve considered Keep using Rust Amethyst and buy another laptop use OpenGL directly switch to JavaScript and use WebGL Description It fixes this issue Additions None Removals None Modifications Makes it so that draggable works with percent based widgets PR Checklist By placing an x in the boxes I certify that I have Updated the content of the book if this PR would make the book outdated Added a

Description When using percent true on my UiTransformData in the UiFormat prefab the widget moves on dragging but it moves incorrectly presumably because the percent true causes some bad scaling behavior Reproduction Steps Edit the ui example to make the Draggable Button have percent true Fix the x y width height to make sure the button is still a reasonable size and position Run the example and try to drag the button What You Expected to Happen The button stays under my cursor while dragging What Actually Happened The button flew off the screen Your Environment Mac OS G rev c f e d a b cad c a a c ace Feature amethystui and the Amethyst Book Change Add a chapter in the Amethyst Book about the UI code Should include things like what are the main components for UI entities how do UiTransforms differ from Transforms how does the Widgets resource work when should I use the UiFinder instead of Widgets and vice versa how do I find my widgets how can I define new Widgets how do I create new widgets dynamically not using a prefab how is the Widget entity hierarchy organized how can I animate UI entities what kind of patterns make UI workflows and management easier Reason The best way to understand the UI code right now is to read it Its a lot of code and it takes significant effort to understand use cases and design decisions It would be better if users could read a chapter that describes the design of the UI code with annotated examples Impact Users would be able to understand the UI code much more quickly and it would probably prevent a lot of questions from making it to the Discord help channel What problem does this solve What need does it fill It would be nice to have a way to render an image generated with a shader as a UI element Describe the solution youd like I believe we could provide another variant for UiImageLoadPrefab or TexturePrefab containing a handle of ImageView Description Change gettingstarted to explain how to setup and decide graphical engine for your newly started project Additionally I think it would also be awesome if amethyst new could detect and set it based on user OS I am not sure how feasible it is Reason As it is neither gettingstarted or amethyst new mention about settings the graphics backend leading to quite a few confusing people arriving on discord unable to start their very first project I think thats a not great welcome experience and should be improved In the end there is only one chance at first impressions Impact I cant see how it will have any but positive impact on new users Description A selected editable text field seems to be affected by clicks outside of its transform and cant be deselected Reproduction Steps cargo run example ui features vulkan Click inside the Editable text transform to select it Click anywhere else on the screen What You Expected to Happen It should be deselected What Actually Happened The cursor moves to the closest glyph at the X position that clicked instead of being deselected This should only happen if the click was inside the bounds of the transform Your Environment Operating System Void Linux Operating System Version latest Version of Amethyst
