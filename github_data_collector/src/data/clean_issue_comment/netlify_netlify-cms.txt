 Why In support of this issue aims to provide an initial task to help stakeholders get acclimated to the project Goal Implement an updated login screen UI based on mockups by AustinCondiff img width altScreen Shot at PM src Details The mockup shows the Git Gateway password login screen that UI comes from the netlifyidentitywidget repo and is nontrivial to customize Recommend considering that part out of scope for this issue Due to the previous point a mockup should be made showing how the other backends which currently consist only of a button instead of a form should appear The current login components use some strange positioning which led to being opened That issue can probably be resolved under this one Tasks Create additional login screen mockup with oauth button in place of form

clear and concise description of what the problem is Ex Im always frustrated when The Netlify CMS UI is difficult to reason about test and change due to lack of documentation Describe the solution youd like A clear and concise description of what you want to happen S t o r y b o o k Describe alternatives youve considered A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered Other solutions like Docz but Storybook is ridiculously stable and much better suited for handling both component documentation and testing Additional context Add any other context or

Please describe A clear and concise description of what the problem is Ex Im always frustrated when String templates in the config such as the slug field accept field names as variables but also some built in values like slug and year docs When field names collide with these built in values you can prefix the variable with field to access the field This is a bit unintuitive Describe the solution youd like A clear and concise description of what you want to happen Add a prefix to all built in variables The default could be underscore Accessing these values would then look like slug slugslug The above example would provide a slug consisting of a field named slug followed by the default slug value The advantage here is that everything always works one way versus having to be aware when your field names collide with a built in value especially as the list of built in values expands Without this change every new built in value addition presents a breaking change since fields with the newly used name may already be in use in a CMS instance Describe alternatives youve considered A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered Leaving it as is Proposed approach For now just make the prefixed variants of built in variables available without any breaking changes Make the prefix configurable in case the underscore collides with a projects naming scheme Deprecate and warn when a built in variable is accessed without the prefix Next major release we remove access to built in variables without the prefix Open after a question on slack about setting the initial collapsed state of the list widget Noticed we have that option but it is not documented We should add it See my comment here Adding my thoughts about the Gatsby plugin for now We need to make sure our Gatsby plugin is aligned with latest Gatsby core changes One way to do it is to have a testing project that automatically updates to the latest Gatsby version and run some tests with the latest version of the plugin The deploy preview link on Netlify CMS opens the home page of the preview and a user has to navigate to the topic they changed Ive read on Netlify CMS docs that you can configure the preview paths to a specific page The instructions assume that you use a slug which uses a field value eg title as the identifier of the collections The way the slug works is by compiling the identifier eg My New Post to mynewpost In Axway open docs though we create specific names to the md files and the names dont match the headingtitle of the pages eg the title of a file called apimgrconceptsmd is API management concepts Therefore I didnt find a way to configure my collections to redirect to an specific topic and I dont even know if this is possible in my case Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Its a bad user experience to send the user to the home page of the docs and make them to navigate to the topic that theyve updated so they can see the preview It can be challenging confusing and frustrating for the user to find the topic Describe the solution youd like Id like to be able to redirect the deploy preview links to the specific topicpage that was changed by a user Describe alternatives youve considered Im looking forward to your help Thanks Andrea The relation widget requires that you define the valueField but you cant access the slug of a collection For instance I have a collection of Pages I created a Relation widget in a list that lets me create a menu of pages but I would need the slug of the page collection item to be outputted so I can create a properly linked list of pages Currently I can only get the title which I need to slugify manually after consuming the JSON data Ideally the slug would come along for the ride automatically Requested solutions automatically output slug value alongside the valueField allow the user to output the valueField as an object that contains value slug Please make sure

instead Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe There are several places in the code that use windowconfirmalert for dialogs one example is when uploading an existing media file I think we should should consider switching to a friendlier UI maybe we can use the existing reduxnotifications package were using for status messages Describe the solution youd like Use a react component for dialogs instead of window dialogs Describe alternatives youve considered We can write our own modals but Im guessing there should be a library for that Additional context Related to this

existing issue instead Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe A clear and concise description of what the problem is Ex Im always frustrated when Its common for collection and entry specific directories to be nested in the mediafolderpublicfolder Once is in place the base mediafolderpublicfolder would have to be manually entered for every collection increasing the likelihood of mistakes and making it difficult to change the base mediafolderpublicfolder Describe the solution youd like A clear and concise description of what you want to happen Allow the global mediafolderpublicfolder to be accessed as string template variables Describe alternatives youve considered A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered JS config makes it trivial to create the variable yourself but we need to stop telling people they have to use JS config to do things Should work in a static config file Please make sure that we do not

feature request related to a problem Please describe A clear and concise description of what the problem is Ex Im always frustrated when An entrys filename sometimes uniquely represents a slugstyle value thats used in other places in the entry Hugos docs have filenames that are also used as the name for the subdirectory that the images go in within the centralized media folder not relative Because the filename isnt derived from a field in the entry frontmatter theres no way to access it for use in other values Once is resolved this will be required for some use cases to work asis Describe the solution youd like A clear and concise description of what you want to happen Provide a filename string template variable for config properties that allow string templating such as path This should then automatically apply to the collection level mediafolderpublicfolder proposed in with string templating proposed in
