Change READMEmd description Does this have an option to detect if one item valid added I am looking for disabling a submit button before an item converted to a tag I am guessing it is called a race condition so the better way is to disable the submit button With onFocus onBlur I can create events to disable the submit button but it can not detect if one valid tag success added then enable the button I have to click outside of the tag input field button disabled isFocus matraisedbutton colorprimarySubmitbutton onInputFocusedevent string thisisFocus true onInputBlurredevent string thisisFocus false Also if with onFocus onAdd it would not work as what I am looking for So it would be great if we have afterAdd option is it possible to set an input mask Not a validation pattern Is there a way to display lesser tags on UI rather than actual inputs with show more option at the end and on user click on button show more all tags are displayed It will be great if this feature is
