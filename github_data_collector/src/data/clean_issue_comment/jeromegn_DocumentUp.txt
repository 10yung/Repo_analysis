wonderful project Thank you I want to use it to create a simple blog whose content is stored in one single markdown file I love this simplicity I have one question Would it be possible to add an option similar to disable issues to disable the Fork me on Github label Thankfully Robert I would like to create a documentation site with multiple markdown pages I have a standard readme file with a dozen or more additional pages for specific purposes How can I add navigation menu links and sections for the child pages Compare with The former has ugly line breaks the latter does not Im guessing this is due to the line breaks in the READMEmd file itself I have made a change to break all lines at chars To automatically recompile my page each time I change my readme I included a Webhook to as mentioned in the documentation which seems to work fine as it always returns response code Unfortunately the page is not recompiled that is the changes I pushed to my readme is not not being reflected in the page The page hosted at documentupcom is also not changed Please do look into this First of all thank you jeromegn for this awesome tool service I think it would make sense for DocumentUp to have an option to generate the docs from another file than READMEmd like DOCSmd as one may want to keep the README file small or to contain other information than the whole docs I imagine something like yml name DocumentUp file DOCSmd Could of course also be filepath or something similar Another question not worth opening a separate issue for is it possible to use documentupjson instead of documentupyml I saw this in Id like to make custom themes for DocumentUp Can we have an option to say pass it via I understand from the docs that the documents are only recompiled when the following url is visited To recompile it automatically you can add a webhook to Github So Ive set the Payload URL to Shouldnt that be It didnt seem to work when I left the content type to applicationjson default but changing it to applicationxwwwformurlencoded seems to help it then received an ok as response Maybe you can add this to your readme I left the event that should trigger the hook to Just the push event which is the default I couldnt find the Postreceive hook
