Insider is the OSS CLI project from the Insider Application Security Security Team for the community This project have a simplified version of the proprietary Static Application Security Testing engine developed internally by us to make source code analysis to find vulnerabilities right in the source code focused on a agile and easy to implement software inside your DevOps pipeline import javautilRandom Would adding IDEs as a separate section be useful For example IDEs like Jetbrains IDEA and Android Studio comes bundled with tools like ideainspector and android lint They also provide a lot of tools functionality for refactoring extracting reordering of methods autoformatting using static analysis Can create a PR for it if you think it is a good idea can be used in Java Kotlin and Android projects and includes all the inspections that are available in the IntelliJ IDE Where is the appropriate section for this tool It is applied to any gradle project so i guess the Multiple languages section would be appropriate I started compiling a list of SAST tools as part of a research assignment only to stumble upon this awesome list I noted that several of the tools I found are not yet listed however I have no idea whether the tools I found are awesome For some of them I could find some objective proof eg the Gartner Magic Quadrant for SAST tools and so I created some PRs already PRs created for AppScan Source HCL WhiteHat Sentinel Source Synopsys Coverity Checkmarx CxSAST Not sure if awesome Appknox Online scanner bugScout multiple languages such as Java PHP NET and classic ASP Code Dx Enterprise Correlation engine bundled with SASTDASTIASTother tools Devknox Android will become open source soon no longer supported officially Jtest Java Ripstech Snappy Tick Sparrow SAST Support over languages including Java JSP CC C Python Swift ASPNET ABAP Object C etc ThunderScan Multilanguage TrueCode Virtual Forge Security Suite SAP VisualCodeGrepper VCG is an automated code security review tool that handles CC Java C VB and PLSQL Xanitizer JavaScala ZeroNorth Any feedback on the above tools is welcome If any of the tools is found to be awesome let me know and I will create PRs oelintadv is a linter for bitbake files accroding to OpenEmbedded style guide Systemdlint is a linter for systemd unit files and overall system setup Pyscent is the only wrapper that detects Pythonspecific code smells and generates an intuitive output report At least warning copyright and so on are not rendered on the website
