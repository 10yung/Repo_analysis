Browser Firefox bit Use baranimate when a previous animate call is still being animated and this error will occur uncaught exception Object Getting error shiftyinterpolate is not a function on the new version Hi Firstly I want to thank you for your library it adds a nice touch to our application As I am a developer its sometime nice when we know how our creation is used so Ive attached a partial screenshot to show to you our use case Secondly I encouters a little issue since Ive upgrade progressbarjs from to In my browser console there is sometime one or multiple uncaught promise errors Uncaught in promise offset Promisethen async animate progressbarjs animate progressbarjs It doesnt seem to affect the UI Unfortunatly I have not been able to find exactly why it occurs By by looking into the diffs from to I have been able to find that the error may be caused since the upgrade of the shifty dependency from the Pull Request commit By adding an empty catch function to R R the promise error is handled and it seem to not affect the UI But Im not sure that it is the right way to fix this problem js catchfunctionstate I hope it helps you thank you very much Screenshot Bumps

repo from the Security Alerts page details As suggested by Kimmo Brunfeldt one of the ProgressBarjs contributor Ill write a post here explaining the issue I have encounter Im actually using the library inside a component I have build for an application Im building for my company The component is written in Typescript JSX As every components we make we need to return them in a software called Storybook for exploring all the components and prevent from any visual regression issues But since the latest update of Storybook I encounter an issue using the animate function this function is basically calling a function called getComputedDashOffset which is in charge to calculate the strokedashoffset of the path receiving the progressValue but this function will now always return causing an infinite loop inside the step Using the set function instead of the animatefix the problem but Im loosing the animation So I would like to get any feedback of you guys if you ever encounter this issue before whatever its from Storybook or somewhere else Ill actually look into it but didnt find any solution yet Ill be great if you guys can help me about it Hello Everything works as far as it should but if the time is set a little longer neither the progressBar nor the percentage display is correct Are there any problems here eg at a duration of Thanks in advance Hey there are couple of the same issues here but no one is really solved Im using semiCircle and I want that the stroke and trail has rounder corners But as you can see in the example the trail has square ending But if check source code the path of trail has strokelinecapround and when you rotate trail path you can see that it has round corner What that means that the trail is bigger length as the viewBox so thats why everything gets cut off even when you have baranimate Number from to the stroke will not have round border anymore If I inline inspect change viewbox from to I can see the round corners for everything So is there any solution for this Thanks Do you think is possible to show a passmark like this score
