Thanks much for sharing this awesome tool I am struggling to get it to display any notifications though This is on gnome so its using notifysend which works fine otherwise I am calling this script at boot to start dude watchdirgit config dudewatchdir if n watchdir then git dude watchdir fi The directory where I am keeping the repos I want monitored is gitwatch which i have defined in the gitconfig As far as I can tell everything seems to start and run fine as you can see in the screenshot of the relevant processes rofi I am pretty much at a loss on what could be preventing the notifications from displaying I am not using gdm or any display manager screensaver Is gitdude supposed to sleep if the screensaver is active and not fetch any info from git if I am understanding correctly If you have any thoughts on what could be going wrong I would love to hear them Assuming an exit code of indicates successthat the screensaver is active the screensaver is running check needs to be reversed If i have a repo with a parenthesis in the name the script breaks when running eval iconpathhomegrokcodesaltstatesiconpng cd dirname git revparse gitdir devnull cd dirname git config dudeignore basename dirname git git config duderemote true git fetch remote grep F sed s git config dudeicon true pwd iconpathhomegrokcodesaltstates copyiconpng homegrokbingitdude eval line syntax error near unexpected token Pull Request added support for OS X Notification Center OS X Mountain Lion and newer using terminalnotifier Unfortunately it also added GitHubspecific support so was not accepted but the OS X Notification Center support would be a nice addition
