In DebugView ProcessPhoenixtriggerRebirth seems to kill the process too fast On my device the SharedPreference wont get set so I cant change the endpoint from the DebugView Its only used in DebugApiModule I got an error when run app It showed could not find symbol symbol variable nullL in u masterappsrcinternalDebugjavacomjakewhartonu uidebugDebugViewjava a c d c a f bf cd a Or maybe as a switch in the debug drawer The debug drawer currently shows the available screen size rather than the full screen size its useful to be able to see both Also show these sizes in dp as well as px as these are the units we work in more often u screenshot Setting endpoint to custom with value that is not parseable eg saffga will make the app crash It will crash on every consequent startup until the app data is cleared The reason is that the user inputed string is saved to ApiEndpoint String preference which is later read by provideHttpUrl method in DebugApiModule The method tries to parse the String into HttpUrl but invalid Strings are parsed to null value When null HttpUrl is provided as a base url when building retrofit instance the app will crash Fix Make sure user provided custom URL is parseable Additional validation is required when custom endpoint is set by the userwithin DebugView check if it is parseable by HttpUrlparse method Ive made pull request for this but I guess Im not allowed to push anything to this repo Aside from the obvious of just writing a test thats meaningful consider demoing Controlling mock mode from the test Robots pattern We need an aftercreation mechanism for the graph
