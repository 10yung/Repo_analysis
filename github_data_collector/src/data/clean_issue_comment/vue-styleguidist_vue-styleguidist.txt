 Consider opening a pull request instead it s a more productive way to discuss new features Description For some basics components I just use emitonClick event from the template A clear and concise description of what the problem is Ex Im always frustrated when Proposal Search for emit inside the template and extract the name of the event emitted A clear and concise description of what you want to happen Add any considered drawbacks Expected result Generates automatically the docs for emit used within templates A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you ve considered Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here remove peer dependency preventing update of webpack Consider opening a pull request instead it s a more productive way to discuss new features The problem Consider the following setup Lib a defines a mixin mx and provides docs via vuestyleguidist Lib b uses mx from lib a Components in lib b can access and include the mixin they receive the desired functionality and work well However in the docs the props and functions from the mixin are not documented despite they where documented in lib a A clear and concise description of what the problem is Ex Im always frustrated when Proposed solution If comments are preserved during bundling default with vuecliservice build target lib they could be extracted from the bundle in order to provide the missing documentation parts In my case webpack preserves the comments and code very well only the export is changing js My mixin description export const myMixin becomes js My mixin description var myMixin concated harmony reexport myMixin webpackrequiredwebpackexports myMixin function return myMixin A clear and concise description of what you want to happen Add any considered drawbacks Alternative solutions Provide the documentation information within the export through a well defined interface This doesnt sound nice at all A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you ve considered Additional context Maybe duplicate of Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here create a docgencli command to create translation files for components create a docgencli command to checkupdate translation files for components when creating files using docgencli if there is translations found and there is a language specified use the files to translate the descriptions closes On my project Im using components that are communicating with a RESTAPI with required authentication When providing examples they will fail due missing authentication of course because no user ever logged in Im planing to provide a roversion of the API with demodata that gets reset every day with hardcoded login for a demo user Since logging in is an async HTTP request I can not simply set up the login in the root example file of styleguidist since the export is synchronous racecondition maybe the login is fast enough maybe setting up the vue instance is faster Question Is there a way to perform async setup tasks before launching the example code Usually i would do this in mainjs js import Vue from vue import client from myapi import App from App let login false clientlogin username testuser password then login true finally new Vue render h hApp mountapp Current behavior Im using vuex and vuexORM in my styleguide I have a parent component that accesses the store internally and passes data to a child component via vmodel This works fine as an example However I want to show an example for the child component as well so Im trying to access the store using a require The code Im using in my markdown file is this const PolicyGroupModel requirestoremodelsPolicyGroupdefault const PolicyGroup PolicyGroupModelquerywithpoliciesorgsfind new Vue data return PolicyGroup template PolicyManagerGroup titlePolicyGroupdisplayName vmodelPolicyGrouppolicies open With js opening the code block This results in the following error However by chance I have discovered that if I include a duplicate require in a separate code block before this code block like this const PolicyGroupModel requirestoremodelsPolicyGroupdefault spanspan const PolicyGroupModel requirestoremodelsPolicyGroupdefault const PolicyGroup PolicyGroupModelquerywithpoliciesorgsfind new Vue data return PolicyGroup template PolicyManagerGroup titlePolicyGroupdisplayName vmodelPolicyGrouppolicies open With js noeditor to hide the block my component renders as expected Im using the latest version for vuestyleguidist Expected behavior I would expect to no have to include a second require in a separate block Consider opening a pull request instead it s a more productive way to discuss new features The problem When building a library for Vue applications it is not possible to document custom directives delivered by the library A clear and concise description of what the problem is Ex Im always frustrated when Proposed solution The Ability to describe behavior what its supposed to do when is which hook triggered and what does it do possible modifiers and their meanings possible arguments and their meanings possibleexpected valuesexpressions Im pretty sure this can be done via custom JSDoc tags js This is my custom directive directive argument Description how arguments are handled modifier foo Description how the modifier is handled modifier bar Description how the modifier is handled modifier baz Description how the modifier is handled export DiMyCustomDirective Optional description what this hook does bind Optional description what this hook does inserted Optional description what this hook does update Optional description what this hook does componentUpdated Optional description what this hook does unbind When using the Vuedirectivefocus syntax a directive comment would not be needed A clear and concise description of what you want to happen Add any considered drawbacks Alternative solutions As workaround the information can be composed manually in a md file which then is included with the styleguideconfigjs sections syntax A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you ve considered Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here If webpackConfig contains data options for pugloaderpugplainloader these get overwritten with filename Thanks for using Vue Styleguidist Before you submit please read the following Search openclosed issues before submitting since someone might have asked the same thing before Read essential documentation Make sure you re using the latest versions of Vue Styleguidist When something isn t working for you include a reproducible demo Fork the example project repository Modify it to reproduce the issue Push to GitHub and paste the link here Most likely you ll find an issue yourself while creating a demo Looks like specifying a theme for the editor doesnt work anymore version of the vuestyleguidist Tried out on the basic example by adding the following to the config editorConfig theme night Resulting config looks like this omitted
