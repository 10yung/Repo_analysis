Hi I am trying to use Chronos which depends on this particular project Can you upload this artifact to Maven Central instead of using a proprietary Maven repo After get rid of Guice DI you replace JacksonMessageBodyProviderby JsonProvider but the mapper of it only register DefaultScalaModule so how to register customized restMapper in RestModuleHttpModule Ideally this would support a standard apache htpasswd style file which would also add the benefit of allowing multiple different userpassword combinations to access the webapp such as marathon Try out the MacWire for wiring Also add some actor and AOP examples The mesosphere marathon package for redhat logs via logger which gets hoovered up into the systemd journal on RHELCentOS or Fedora It would be really nice to instead send this to a specific file in addition to the systemd journal Since marathon uses this library to do logging the issue seems to be here and not in marathon directly Ive added this systemd service as a stopgap so we can use splunk to read marathon logs bash Unit DescriptionHack to log marathon logs to a file Afternetworkonlinetarget Wantsnetworktarget Service ExecStartbinbash c usrbinjournalctl quiet lfu marathon varlogmarathonmarathonlog Restartalways RestartSec Install WantedBymultiusertarget And Ive added Requiresmarathonloggerservice to the marathon systemd unit to start marathonlogger on demand Would it be possible to have chaos and as a nice side effect marathon support something like loglevelinfo logfilevarlogmarathonmarathonlog A simple logrotate config like this could be used so that chaos wouldnt natively need to rotate any logs bash varlogmarathonlog daily compress missingok rotate notifempty copytruncate delaycompress hope to support the oauth please update the new version of readme All Marathon instances currently proxy to the current leader Marathon uses its own proxy implementation with various issues Jetty includes support for proxying Thus it would probably make sense to upgrade to Jetty to benefit from this functionality Since this is functionality which would be useful to frameworks other than Marathon I would include the proxy artifact in Chaos potentially even some utility support to provide proxying to another host dynamically It would be nice if we could document which steps are necessary to publish a new release Eg Bumping up versions in versionsbt Creating tags Testing certain essentials Running a team city task Whatever is necessary
