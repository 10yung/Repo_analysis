This patch makes it possible to resize side panes streams and issues Related to I set up a stream that contains PRs from my team that have not yet been reviewed reviewnone The search query I have works as expected on Github but the stream never removes PRs once they have been reviewed Similar to but in addition to window position and size will also restore maximised window states on Microsoft Windows fullscreen windows on macOS and delegates responsibility for that to the electronwindowstate library If I set the maximum number of records as lower value Jasper will delete exceeding old data If run the VACUUM command it will keep the DB file to small size The default GHE config set PathPrefixapiv However when the http request is processed by pathnormalize it adds an extra at the beginning and result to requestPathgheyourcompanycomapiv user This cause a validation error I can make it working by manually remove the leading from the config screen step But I think this should be fixed at the code level This could be a duplication of exiting issue around GHE but I am not sure so allow me to open a new issue Id like to use Chrome Canary or Vivaldi instead of Safari I wasnt be able to find a solution for this myself BTW The browser painel could be automatically hidden As we are not using it Cheers Similar to issue it would be good if Jasper would update itself when labels change on issues I added a label to an issue that should make it disappear from a stream as the stream has labellabel I just added but even after a while and clicking Load Issues doesnt seem to help nor restarting streams the issue is still not showing the tag I added and remains part of the stream Id like to hide the Issues and PRs that merged or closed on the stream specified with the is open query At present issues and PRs that have been displayed once remain after merging or closing My environment is as below OS MacOS Mojave Jasper Version This used to work it was fixed earlier here but there seems to have been a regression I don t believe I can filter out the activity using the search syntax so it would be great to have a fix for this
