should be able to delete their own shortened links Current Behavior Only the administrator can delete links users can only update them from the web UI but not from the API Possible Solution Implement deletion of links for the owning user through web UI and API Steps to Reproduce for bugs Log in on a nonadmin account create a shortened link try to delete it no delete button only admins can delete links Normal users cant even delete their own links Context Affects me polr is unusable for my project Expected Behavior Im trying to use polr on my own server to create a static URL that points to a dynamic one that changes all the time For that purpose I have a script on the device star serves the dynamic url which uses wget to create an entry in my polr server that has a completely static url by using the customending and ispublictrue My problem is it only works once after that I get custom ending already in use until I manually log in on the dashboard as admin even to delete the entry Current Behavior it is impossible to update an existing url through the API Possible Solution implement a new parameter updatebool or implement a delete action in the API Steps to Reproduce for bugs create an URL via the API create the same url with a different target observe the second attempt to fail Context Basically the way this affects me is polr is useless for my project Your Environment latest release from github running on openSUSE with PHP Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above IMPORTANT Please follow the format displayed in this template or your ticket may be ignored Expected Behavior If youre describing a bug tell us what should happen If youre suggesting a changeimprovement tell us how it should work I cant use this program in the secondary directory Error In addition I found that many resources referenced in the program use absolute directory which leads to resource loading I understand that these errors do not exist when the secondary directory is not used but I need to use the secondary directory But after I fix the problem of resource loading there are still errors on the website Please fix them to be compatible with the secondary directory installation Thank you Current Behavior If describing a bug tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior If suggesting a changeimprovement explain the difference from current behavior Install using secondary directory all pages are Error Possible Solution Not obligatory but suggest a fixreason for the bug or ideas how to implement the addition or change Change absolute directory to relative directory when referencing maybe Steps to Reproduce for bugs Provide a link to a live example or an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce this bug Include code to reproduce if relevant Use the secondary directory installation and youll see that there are errors Context How has this issue affected you What are you trying to accomplish Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world I think this is a serious problem because laravel itself and other laravel projects can be used in the secondary directory but the errors in pollr indicate that there are still problems in this project Your Environment Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in Version or latest commit hash git revparse HEADf d Environment name and version eg Chrome PHP etcApache PHP Instance link optional I added the logic to prevent shortlinks which would conflict with already registered routes or existing directories Plus a test to prove it works Expected Behavior Shortening the URL should just work Current Behavior When trying to shorten the URL eg on the demo page an error message appears Error The link URL format is invalid Context Possibly related issues Some background about in URLs on Stack Overflow Can domain name subdomains have an underscore in it why use instead off in url This PR adds bare bones OAuth support by implementing an OpenID Connect client To authenticate via OpenID navigate to loginopenid This PR also provides an option to always use OpenID overridable by navigating to

displayed in this template or your ticket may be ignored Expected Behavior Angle bracket entered in password should be sent to database as an angle bracket Current Behavior Angle bracket entered in password is sent to database as html escape sequence ampgt Possible Solution Use htmlentitydecode on password and perhaps on other fields before writing them to env or however that translates into the frameworks being used If theres no documentation on how to make this happen warn the user of this issue Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above IMPORTANT Please follow the format displayed in this template or your ticket may be ignored Expected Behavior Installation instructions should be complete and accurate Current Behavior states Copy the envsetup file to env in your websites root directory However states You should copy envsetup to env in the root folder of the project ie not in public Possible Solution Change to read Copy the envsetup file to env in the varwwwpolr directory Its safe to assume this directory name since the previous instructions unambiguously specified this directory name Context I am trying to bring up polr I am still having problems but until I properly understood the above issue I could not get the artisan steps to function Your Environment ubuntu with apt install mysqlserver mysqlclient php phpmysql php mbstring php curl phpxml
