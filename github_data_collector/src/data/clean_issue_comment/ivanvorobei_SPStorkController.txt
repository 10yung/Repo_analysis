Can i hide controller before full presentating press or swipe In my project I have a more complex view controller hierarchy with embedded view controllers containing a table view In order to dismiss when the scroll view of the table view is scrolled to the top and further I use swift func scrollViewDidScroll scrollView UIScrollView SPStorkControllerscrollViewDidScrollscrollView But presentationControllerfor controller UIViewController SPStorkPresentationController will return nil in my case as the modally presented view controller is some levels higher than the view controller containing the scroll view The code looks recursively for the presentationController until it finds it or the parent property of the controller is nil Hi Im integrating the pod in an objectivec project but Im facing several issues I have the following code SPStorkTransitioningDelegate transitionDelegate SPStorkTransitioningDelegate alloc init transitionDelegatestorkDelegate self ERROR transitionDelegateconfirmDelegate dialPad dialPadmodalPresentationStyle UIModalPresentationCustom dialPadtransitioningDelegate transitionDelegate The error is Property storkDelegate not found on object of type SPStorkTransitioningDelegate Any advise There is no option for disabling swipe gesture during runtime For example I have a UITableView with editing mode and reordering cells While moving cell down SPStorkController fires UIPanGestureRecognizer and dismisses the screen Hi Is it possible to disable transform of root view I want to achieve a state that the root controller will not change its size or position including corner radius IMGCAA C DA Hi first of all I have to say that your project is fantastic and works so smoothly This pull request is about to add a new feature and this feature is about to dismiss this view using the pan on UIScrollView I hope it can help others with the same problem Would be nice to make the colors on the close button editable This patch should do the trick modifiedstorksoicanmodifyclosebuttoncolorpatchzip If present controller swift class TextFieldController UIViewController let textField UITextField override func viewDidLoad superviewDidLoad selfviewbackgroundColor white selfviewaddSubviewselftextField override func viewWillAppear animated Bool superviewWillAppearanimated selftextFieldbecomeFirstResponder with SPStorkTransitionDelegate animation for parent controller accelerate If remove swift selftextFieldbecomeFirstResponder all work correctly Is it possible to enable user interaction during transition Is it possible to present UIImagePickerController as SPStorkController When I try to do this it presents in full screen
