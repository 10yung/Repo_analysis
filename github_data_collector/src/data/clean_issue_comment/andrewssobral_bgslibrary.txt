my platform is win use python and bgs bgs compiled with opencv I got error RuntimeError OpenCV C build winpackbuildwin vc opencv modules core src arraycpp error Bad argument Array should be CvMat or IplImage in function cvGetSize in a lot of modelsuch as MultiCue LBMixtureOfGaussians and so on what is my problem Hi there I need some help When I tried to run the demo py it reported an AttributeError module pybgs has no attribute DPAdaptiveMedian then I annotated that line and ran again same error happened but for the following line AttributeError module pybgs has no attribute DPGrimsonGMM demo However if I removed the whole if iscv or iscv section the program could be executed successfully demo demo PC config Windows Anaconda environment Pycharm Visual studio OpenCV I followed the to install the pybgs whereas the installation details were slightly different First I cloned this repository and added OpenCVDIR system path Next cmake BGSPYTHONSUPPORTON failed So I wnet back to Building Python wrapper from scratch then used python setuppy build and python setuppy install as a result I saw the The C compiler Configuring done Generating done Build files have been written to Therefore I utilized VS to build the bgslibrarysln in bgslibrary build tempwinamd Release which generated a file named pybgscp winamd pyd Based on this pyd file I can smoothly run demopy and demo py removed a part but the installation procedure and partial file names were not exactly the same as the tutorial in addition the error AttributeError module pybgs has no attribute DPAdaptiveMedian I hope to know how to fix that Sincerely on of BGSLibrary in user projects usage Install bgslibrary with Cmake Include bgslibrary in your project cmakeminimumrequiredVERSION findpackageBGSLibrary REQUIRED addexecutableBackgroundSubtractionTester maincpp targetlinklibrariesBackgroundSubtractionTester BGSLibraryBGSLibrary Now edited and tested under Ubuntu and Windows I build bgslibrary with no errors but there is no libbgsso or any other related file created during the building Im working on Windows and build it using Anaconda The library is working fine when I run it manually via webcam but not with python Kindly please look into it Capture Thanks for this great work I noticed the current benchmark result is kind of outdated could you please update that to the latest with all available algorithms Hi I compiled the gui version with cmake and cv and it seems to work fine but there are not as many algorithms available as in your documentation Did I installed it wrong or is it because of cv Bildschirmfoto um Can I also drop a small question maybe anyone has some experience here with this kind of images I create each few seconds an image of a brood frame with bees and want to remove the moving bees on it The best approach so far was with AdaptiveBackgroundLearning and around hour in time Images Any other algorithms which should be good for this problem Which gives me a relative good result here the first and last image Thanks Cheers Hanes Hi small update for the wiki because the folder structure changed Section On LinuxMac git clone recursive cd bgslibraryguiqtbuild cmake make cp bgslibrarygui cd bgslibrarygui and if you manually installed QT on mac with brew install qt the folder PREFIX Path is following cmake DCMAKEPREFIXPATHusrlocalCellarqt Cheers Hannes Hi Andrew After I installed the gui I got an error about undefined symbol when trying to run it Any insight what might cause this Thanks you OS Linux PopOS Error msg bgslibrarygui symbol lookup error usrlibx linuxgnulibgio so undefined symbol grefcountinc I have bgscp winamd pyd and libbgslibrarycoredll and Ive added them to environment variables but when i import bgs to my project ImportError DLL load failed Dynamic Link Library DLL initialization routine failed System information Desktop OS win Python version OpenCV version I try to install this lib from am to pm and finally I made it Here is what I got a pybgspyd file it works well with python hope that it may help you pybgstxt Remember to change the file from txt to pyd before you use it
