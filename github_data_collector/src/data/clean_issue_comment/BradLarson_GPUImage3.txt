I call GPUImage method from another classFilterswift with completion handler let toonFilter ToonFilter let filteredImage imagefilterWithOperationtoonFilter completionfilteredImage and I use completion handler to put on imageView but sometimes with some images it crash with this error Failed loading image texture Hi Is there motion detection in this library If it has how can i use it Fragment FunctionzoomBlurFragment argument uniform from buffer with offset and length has space for bytes but argument has a length how can i fix this and Motion blur code commented is it work validateFunctionArguments failed assertion Fragment FunctionvignetteFragment argument uniform from buffer with offset and length has space for bytes but argument has a length Hi I have an iOS project that uses GPUImage to load acv files to manipulate images I was just wondering if it would be possible to implement the Tone Curve feature in GPUImage Thanks I have an application which is displaying video stream in the application AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer is using to display separate video I found AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer is not return for minutes at least when I kill the application after start capturing with following code phoneCamera try CamerasessionPreset vga x phoneCamerarunBenchmark false phoneCamera renderView phoneCamerastartCapture I took the code from the sample code it happens iOS iPhone x only the problem is not happened on iOS x or iOS iPad x Thanks Hi I try to add some noise overlay to an image with the following var picture PictureInputimageUIImagenamedIMG jpg var blendImage PictureInputimageUIImagenamedNoisejpg let opacityFilter OpacityAdjustment let blendFilter OverlayBlend opacityFilteropacity mySlidervalue blendImage opacityFilter blendFilter picture blendFilter renderView blendImageprocessImage When the opacityFilteropacity is then I see the Noisejpg completely expected that I dont see it at all and when opacityFilteropacity is then I see the Noisejpg only slightly as an overlay What is the issue This isnt an issue but more of a question Is there a way to attach the GPUImageFilters to a running AVCaptureSession Can anyone please guide me through implementing GPUImageSkinToneFilter using this GPUImage framework Thanks in advance Seems like there is no implementation for AverageLuminanceExtractor which I was using from GPUImage Im trying to get the overall brightness from the camera Any suggestions Or is this something that might be implemented soon
