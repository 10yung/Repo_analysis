I moved these to the skipped section of examples They seem to have to do with calls of form figNum vcSelectFigureGRAPHWIN Im guessing this once worked but doesnt any more tcodeISETPref was broken because it was trying to use a key font delta I recoded to use font size which allows it to run But I dont see any actual effect of the command When running my image metric calculations I found it helpful to be able to fix the seed on the cone mosaic being generated This way I had the option to compare the same two cone mosaics for both the test and reference image I achieved this by adding an optional patternSeed parameters for the cone mosaic class The alternate way to do this would be to generate a single cone mosaic object and then reuse it for multiple calculations However the way I was looping and traversing through image metric databases made that method difficult which is why I added the option to set the seed Do you guys think this might be a good addition to the class I note in the comments that the cone mosaic is only fixed for a single FOV if you regenerate with a different size the cone mosaic will change even if the seed is fixed This issue covers isettoolscolor

Ive been doing a lot of analyses with SCIELABCIELAB in combination with ISETBio Currently these two metrics are located in the ISETCam repository Unfortunately ISETCam and ISETBio have some conflicts with each other and cant be on the same path To get around that Ive been extracting the metrics from ISETCam and keeping them in a separate folder This occasionally makes it difficult to share my code Ive been considering moving the metrics into ISETBio to make things easier and more consistent However I see two minor downsides of doing this we would have yet another duplicate of a function in ISETBio and ISETCam and these metrics are currently meant to be run on display RGB images so one could argue whether they truly belong in ISETBio Do you guys have any thoughts on this Its not a huge deal to have a separate metrics folder but Im wondering if theres a better way Only real question from the two folder sets tcode tcodeISETPref This script was listed as broken due to a missing script however it appears to execute Is this still broken then or is this an improper execution
