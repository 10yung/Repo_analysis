documentation pages Checklist x My code has been run through clangformat x I have read the contributing document x My code is not on the master branch x The code has been tested x All commit messages are properly formatted and commits squashed where appropriate Description This fixes a crash where the default audio monitoring device would be returned as null This happens when I build OBS in portable mode on Linux where the pulse server for some reason cant be connected to This has only happens to me on Ubuntu Audio monitoring still doesnt work here but at least it doesnt crash anymore Motivation and Context Fix annoying crash How Has This Been Tested Created audio monitoring with default device Types of changes Bug fix nonbreaking change which fixes an issue Checklist x My code has

where appropriate Description Add VIDEOCSSRGB enum value in preparation for sYCC support Cant PR all at once because of the AMF submodule WIP AMF changes WIP sYCC changes Motivation and Context Most video applications handle incorrectly and sYCC correctly We also dont perform color transformation from sRGB to so sRGB is a more accurate TRC to label our videos with See RFC for compatibility matrix How Has This Been Tested OBS compiles and runs without crashing At this point its just an unused enum value Types of changes New feature nonbreaking change which adds functionality Checklist x My code

support issues use the Discord or forums Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above OBS Detects background and system processes Expected Behavior Tell us what should happen It should only show foreground processes Current Behavior Tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior Please include a log file here if possible It shows system background and apps that cannot be open Steps to Reproduce Provide a link to a live example or an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce this bug Include code to reproduce if relevant Pictures and video are encouraged if applicable Make A Game Capture Source Click on the mode dropdown Additional information Not obligatory but provide any additional details or information that you feel might be relevant to the issue Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above OS WIN bit OBS bit Reproduce Rate Gennerally sources updating should be done immediately after selecting windowgamemonitor But currently in OBS it will be delayed for about s s Expected Behavior sources updating should be done immediately after choosing object in combox Current Behavior windowgamemonitor are not be updated immediately Steps to Reproduce Provide a link to a live example or an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce this bug Include code to reproduce if relevant Pictures and video are encouraged if applicable jump to property window of windowgamemonitor switch windowgamemonitor and check preview window preview window is often updated after seconds Additional information Windowgamemonitor are applied new settings in videotick there are variables to make sure the interval time such as struct windowcapturecheckwindowtimer struct duplicatorcaptureresettimeout struct gamecaptureretrytime It will be better to reset these variables with max interval time in obssourceinfoupdate to make sure new settings will be applied as soon as possible Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above OS WIN bit OBS bit Reproduce Rate Maybe video of an invalid window source whose params are empty should not stay on incorrect frame Expected Behavior In that situation source should not be drawn in preview canvas Current Behavior video of source will stay on last frame Steps to Reproduce Provide a link to a live example or an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce this bug Include code to reproduce if relevant Pictures and video are encouraged if applicable click button and menu to add a window source after jumping to property window first window in combox will be selected and it will be captured and displayed on preview window click cancel to jump to main dialog now params title class executable of the created window source have been empty but video still stay on last frame Additional information I find that in wctick of window source when title and class are empty just return function Maybe dccapturefree wccapture should be runned before returning The OBS Studio GitHub issue tracker is ONLY to be used

output in the speakers the default device they are selected as the sound source and everything is fine Now I connect bluetooth headphones windows changes the default device to them and the sound starts to be output in them while the default device is selected in obs but obs loses sound Moreover if you go into the properties of the playback device the default device is selected there and if you just click ok then the sound starts to pick up correctly again Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above Expected Behavior Obs must correctly detect the default device change Tell us what should happen I am on macOS G and OBS Studio bit Airwindows makes free and excellent crossplatform VSTs They have a huge collection especially of audio effects which would be an extremely positive addition to OBS Studio for plenty of users OBS Studio recognizes Airwindows plugins as in they populate in the list but wont load the UI and then crashes for the handful of plugins I tried on my computer I did not have a problem with the free Melda Production VSTs listed on the wiki As Airwindows is also freeware I figured it might be up your alley to investigate if possible Since its not clear where the problem lies I also opened up an issue on Airwaves GitHub Steps to repro Download the full VST collection via the link on the sidebar of Installsimlink the VSTs to LibraryAudioPlugInsVST Create an audio filter add a VST x effect and then select an Airwindows VST for repro lets say Console Channel Select Open Plugin Interface No window opens for me the button just changes to Close Plugin Interface Now change the VST for repro say to Highpass OBS Studio crashes The general pattern here works for me regardless of what plugins I selectthe first wont open the VST UI and then whenever switching to another VST OBS crashes If this becomes resolved or if it generally works on other systems Airwaves products would be a great addition to the wiki for filters Thanks for taking a look When running OBS in studio mode where you have both the program and preview monitor open at the same time locks the frame rate at fps even though I have my settings set to fps Disabling studio mode running just with the program monitor visible unlocks the FPS and allows me to record with fps conforming to the settings I set Expected Behavior I expect OBS to let me record and stream at fps in both studio mode and nonstudio mode Current Behavior OBS caps my frame rate to fps in studio mode logfile here Steps to Reproduce Video open OBS macOS version click studio mode observe FPS in the lower right corner unable to get higher than fps click studio mode again and observe FPS again Additional information Ive verified the lowerrightfpsindicator by making separate videos and they show the same recording in studiomode caps the fps to without studiomode get me a solid fps Im running a Hackintosh as you can see by my logfile using a Blackmagic Intensity Pro HDMI capture card However I believe that this machine being a Hackintosh shouldnt affect this issue The OBS Studio GitHub issue tracker is ONLY to be used for reporting bugs that have replication steps New features should be discussed on our Discord or Ideas page For support issues use the Discord or forums Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above Expected Behavior Sources should not be set to x Current Behavior When playing back a media source if you are editing the size or scale of it when playback ends the size of the source is set to x meaning that it is no longer visible in the preview Steps to Reproduce Provide a link to a live example or an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce this bug Include code to reproduce if relevant Pictures and video are encouraged if applicable Add a media source While the source is playing click and drag the bounding box and hold left mouse Wait for playback to end Bounding box will disappear and source will be set to x Video Additional information Reprod of the time on Windows x OBS v Oddly appears that simply moving a source does not trigger this but changing the size does I have not tested other platforms
