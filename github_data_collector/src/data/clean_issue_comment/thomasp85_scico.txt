I noticed that Fabio Crameri also created three cyclic color palettes that are specifically for depicting circular data If youd like to have these in the scico package this PR adds them brocO corkO and vikO There are several diverging color palettes like broc cork vic etc where the center color value is as meaningful as the extremes However if you use scalescico on a variable thats not symmetrically distributed around zero the colors also wont be centered around zero r librarytidyverse libraryscico fakedata tribble category pctchange A B C D Zero should be the lightest color or the middle of the scico gradient but its not because the range here isnt symmetrical ggplotfakedata aesx category y pctchange fill pctchange geomcol scalefillscicopalette vik thememinimal One workaround is to extract the extreme and center values from the palette with scico and use scalefillgradientn to interpolate colors between low mid and high This unfortunately loses the magical range of colors in the palette that makes scico so great r fakescico scico palette vik ggplotfakedata aesx category y pctchange fill pctchange geomcol scalefillgradient low fakescico mid fakescico high fakescico thememinimal The better solution is to use the limits argument to make the scale be symmetrical but doing so requires additional code and math to work r ggplotfakedata aesx category y pctchange fill pctchange geomcol scalefillscicopalette vik limits c maxabsfakedatapctchange thememinimal Would it be worth it to add an argument like center TRUE or center to scalescico for the diverging palettes or should users handle the centering on their own I havent found any other examples of how this is done in other packages None of the viridis palettes are diverging and the ColorBrewer diverging palettes that are accessible with scalebrewertype div palette PuOr only work with discrete scales which lets ggplot get around this centering issue
