With CVE KB product IDs are different but have the same URL link I think this is an API bug Have you considered helping Details of attached file Some other CVEIDs are similar MicrosoftAPI novxlsx Hello Im working with a project team who is building a securitycompliance app that takes details of applicable KBs for usually Windows Server systems from WSUS andor SCCM and uses that export as input to call Security Update API In general this process works but the team will have a consisten number about updates that are determined to be applicable and these updates are not found when calling the Security Update API Can the forum moderator help us identify why these particular KBs are not being found There is bit in of a pattern as of the missing KBs look to be related to NET Framework updates and there are at least related to servicing stack updates but remainder on surface dont appear to have any specific pattern Compared the missing updates to another post from this forum in and there were no common KBs from the post so curious if someone who directly supports the Security Update API is able to repro independently and then confirm what behavior is expected and whether we have possible fixes or mitigations MissingKBsv xlsx SecurityUpdateGuideSupersedencedocx When I try running this gt it returns error code message OData URI failed validation This was working fine but have noticed this week the failure Swagger and documentation on the API mentioned that OData is supported Hello What is the meaning of or or other values in the Type field of cvrfDocVulnerabilityRemediations Thanks Since there is onemore Product ID with every KB example Microsoft Office Service Pack bit editions My question is how this calculated Is it from the GUID FF CE
