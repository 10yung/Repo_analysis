Hi It appears that this version of Uglify doesnt preserve parentheses around multiplications effectively reordering them This may lead to problems eg turning hugenum hugenum almostzero may change the result of the computation from a finite number to infinity PS I had to modify packagejson and testunitscriptsjs because otherwise I couldnt run the tests got Error No such module evals both in scriptsjs and nodeunit Added in licence to packagejson I add some code to make let performs like var I test it works well when let used Maybe more test should be done Heres an example The origin javascript function testcondition func func arg arg if condition return func arg arg else return func arg arg What I expect is javascript function testabcdereturnabcde But what the tool gives me is tu is uneccessary repeated times javascript function mainnirtureturn niturtu link is d sometimes especially with AngularJS you get errors only in your uglified code that are about functione which is hard to track down when there are functione This option makes each parameter name unique to help you find the area of code where the problem was see for an example Im not suggesting you use it all the time but just to help track down problems if they happen Hopefully you think this is useful Im not sure its the best way to implement it but it worked for me
