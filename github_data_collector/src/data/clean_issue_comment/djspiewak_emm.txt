Unable to compile this scala import emm import emmcompatcats import cats import catsdataReaderT import catsdataReaderT import catsstdoption import catsstdlist type E List Option ReaderT Id String Base val name Optionx nameliftM E When remove ReaderT from stack it compiles How bout it What do you think There is now addCompilerPlugincommilessabin si fixplugin So start deleting implicits Maybe even depend on the compiler plugin by default Its kinda important to be able to lift into stacks which contain effects in the kleisli category This might be an interesting function scala val e Emm Task List Option Base A e flip List Option Emm Task Option List Base A val e Emm Task List String Option Base A e flip List Option Emm Task Option String List Base A Should be implementable for any useful stack since we just need to traverse things to flip around No one knows these things exist Probably because you would literally need to read the implicit resolution chains to learn anything about them It would be useful to have a function on Emm transform which takes a natural transformation F G such that F is in the effect stack and the resulting Emm has an effect stack where F has been replaced with G Right now its somewhat difficult to compose functions which return Emm but with differing but potentially still compatible effect stacks We should have a function which handles this problem For example scala val e Emm Task Base Int val e Emm Option Base String val u u Emmunifye e t u Emm Task Option Base Int t u Emm Task Option Base String
