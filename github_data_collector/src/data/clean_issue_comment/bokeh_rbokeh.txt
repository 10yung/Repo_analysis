Hello Im working on a shiny app that shows a grid of graphs I would like to be able to place the legend outside the graphs either with one legend next to each graph or one legend for the whole grid of graphs since they are using the same colorshape attribute Is this possible maybe with a hack of some kind The issue being that the automatic legend for rbokeh appears on the graph and often blocks data points Thank you If I have already a complex plot in ggplot is it possible to transform it into a rbokeh plot I used for a while plotlyggplotly with a low degree of success I am really a fan of what you did and I would love to use some of its functionalities Thanks a lot in advance Hello I was wondering whether there is something in rbokeh that mimics the span functionality in bokeh I want to create an infinite horizontal line on my rbokeh graph and I have not been able to find any way to do this in rbokeh so far Hi I am using trelliscopejs with rbokeh for the first time and encountered some issues when i tried to create a trellis of around pages with each page containing scatter plots and each scatter plot has around points I have managed to created the webpage but there seems to be some plots that take an indefinite time to load Strangely when I display them one by one they are fine The json file size seems to be quite small as well Does this occurs because I have too much pictures to display Here is a simple example of barplot expressed in Rbokeh libraryrbokeh total yield per variety figure lybarvariety yield data latticebarley hover TRUE themeaxisx majorlabelorientation Result are shown as below enter image description here Question I want to plot bars reordered on xaxis by yield in descending order I know that theres simple way of doing this in ggplot with reorder function but have no idea how to do this in Rbokeh How can I do this Question Running the code above I can see this error message what does this mean and how can I solve this problem Warning messages In structurex class uniquecAsIs oldClassx Calling structureNULL is deprecated as NULL cannot have attributes Consider structurelist instead In structurex class uniquecAsIs oldClassx Calling structureNULL is deprecated as NULL cannot have attributes Consider structurelist instead In structurex class uniquecAsIs oldClassx Calling structureNULL is deprecated as NULL cannot have attributes Consider structurelist instead In structurex class uniquecAsIs oldClassx Calling structureNULL is deprecated as NULL cannot have attributes Consider structurelist instead In structurex class uniquecAsIs oldClassx Calling structureNULL is deprecated as NULL cannot have attributes Consider structurelist instead In structurex class uniquecAsIs oldClassx Calling structureNULL is deprecated as NULL cannot have attributes Consider structurelist instead In structurex class uniquecAsIs oldClassx Calling structureNULL is deprecated as NULL cannot have attributes Consider structurelist instead Hi Thanks for the awesome package The hover doesnt work when I flip the x and y variable For this example the hover works and I can see value showed up variable value color R diamonds ggplot diamonds topnn figure lybarx cut y carat color color data diamonds positiondodge hoverTRUE xaxislabel Cut yaxislabel Carat However when I flipped the x and yaxis the hover doesnt work anymore See example below R diamonds ggplot diamonds topnn figure lybary cut x carat color color data diamonds positiondodge hoverTRUE xaxislabel Carat yaxislabel Cut I tried using the version via devtools and from CRAN Both have same output Thanks I have seen that having legendorientation was planned for release back in but I dont think that it was ever implemented Would that be something to add to the next CRAN release Thanks It would be good to be able to use the bokeh clickpolicy functionality which lets you click on the legend to hide and show classes See In terms of where to put this in the interface if there isnt going to be a distinct legend function then I think the way the API should look is that in the call to figure the user can specify a list of additional options which get converted to json and passed to the bokeh js So to add click policy the call might be figure some stuff optionslistlegendlistclickpolicyhide Hi thanks for rbokeh Ive been looking into it from htmlwidgets it looks great Im trying to figure out how to build a web app without shiny and rbokeh seems very promising However I cant find any information linking rbokeh to the bokeh server Ive also searched rbokeh docs for any mention of server but couldnt find any Is it possible to use the bokeh server to serve rbokeh apps hafen FYI Bokeh has been released Let me know if I can help get an updated RBokeh ready I will not be around most of November but can help beforeafter
