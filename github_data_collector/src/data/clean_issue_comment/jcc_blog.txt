features I was thinking that you might benefit from this feature this I built a way to link together articles into a series Take a look at my site for an example Robotodos You can select series in the navbar to see the available series only one currently and select a series to see the articles for that series in reverse chronological order Also note that when you are viewing an article which is a part of a series there is a next article link in the sidebar to help users progress through the series in the right order On the admin dashboard I added a series tab to the left navigation menu You can view all series available or create a new series Editing a series will allow you to edit the title description add or delete articles to the series and change the order of the articles via draganddrop admindashseries If you think this is a feature you would like to have let me know and I can start working on it for you Generating optimized autoload files Illuminate Foundation
