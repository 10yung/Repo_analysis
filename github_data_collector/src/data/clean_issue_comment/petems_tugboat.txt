We use tugboat on our build server which spins droplet before running our test I started noticing the error Failed to create Droplet found unpermitted parameters backupsenabled during droplet creation I am able to reproduce the issue in my local machine as well after I installed Tugboat and ran tugboat create pearkeswww s gb r nyc i from the terminal Following is the debug info Queueing creation of droplet pearkeswww I T INFO Started POST request to D T DEBUG Request Headers Authorization Bearer TOKEN REDACTED ContentType applicationjson UserAgent Faraday v Request Body id bad request message found unpermitted parameters backupsenabled I T INFO Response from Status Time ms D T DEBUG Response Headers date Fri Aug GMT contenttype applicationjson charsetutf contentlength connection close setcookie cfduidd efc d dd ce f a expiresSat Aug GMT path domaindigitaloceancom HttpOnly cachecontrol nocache ratelimitlimit ratelimitremaining ratelimitreset xcontenttypeoptions nosniff xframeoptions SAMEORIGIN xgateway EdgeGateway xrequestid a a bc deb e ad d d xresponsefrom service xruntime xxssprotection modeblock expectct maxage reporturi server cloudflare cfray e d c YYZ Response Body id bad request message found unpermitted parameters backupsenabled Failed to create Droplet found unpermitted parameters backupsenabled You can disable colour output for Thor with the environmental variables with THORSHELLBasic However this only works for say hello green it won t apply for custom strings with colour constants in them So we add the environmental lookup to our colour code as well Closes Stops bundleaudit from complaining Thor updated for dependancies Right now we havent kept parity with DigitalOceans new API features in the API gem were using Barge See At the time we moved DigitalOcean didnt have a Gem for the API Now there is The API for accessing is almost plus its maintained by DO themselves It would make sense to move over to this so we dont have to implement all the new endpoints in barge If this is already in the works that would be wonderful If someone is already working on this feel free to comment here It would be nice if the ability to list and remove snapshots of a droplet using the tugboat app as the site is workable for me but annoying to work with from an accessibility stand point plus the command line is better for me to see if something broke Thoughts Im new to tugboat and am loving it I wonder though can the block storage thing be supported now that it is out of beta I know that digital oceans api supports that and Ive ben using it However tugboat for me is an easier interface as I can control my droplet on my mac with out using digital oceans less then stellar website for screen readers I should add I used homebrew to install tugboat so hope that helps a bit Im a member of DO teams and I can only see Droplets for one of my teams It would be nice to also support manipulation of domain records matching just the domain name instead of the domain id like the api supports While the colorized output of tugboat droplets is nice when visually inspecting the output it can cause problems when one wants to use the command in scripts either logging information to a file or using it to check the status of a droplet An option to disable color would be helpful as would making tugboat behave more like other software that automatically disables color codes when stdout is not attached to a tty When running tugboat ssh there is no way to tell tugboat output from ssh one
