Im using a wrapper around your library in Typescript export const Tween target duration number properties gsapTweenVars settings gsapTweenVars gsapcoreTween return gsaptotarget vars When I export and generate declaration files for Typescript I get to following error error TS Exported variable Tween has or is using private name gsapcoreTween Is it possible to export a Tween const from the types like you do with TweenMax and TweenLite etc in gsapcoredts Something like export class Tween extends gsapcoreTween Im using gsapto on a custom input text field made in PixiJS and this object has a getter named length public get length number return thisfieldlength Tweening this object results in a warning GSAP target object Object not found Off course I can rename my getter but maybe the detection used is not robust enough Im working on a upgrade to V in a project and somehow I get random errors regarding the handling of promises Im unable to pin why its happening since its happing at multiple tween at random occurrences Maybe you can shed some light on it Thanks On v when adding a paused timeline to another timeline internally having the Timeline a value of ts will make its end to be Infinity Thats because dividing by zero which we all know is something bad Updated typings delayedCall can take params of any type but is currently restricted to strings Changed that so that the parameters are of type any Hello Excellent library thanks for the hard work I know PR exists but I independently noticed the bug and I figured Id offer up a more piecemeal fix for the TimeLineadd declaration if youre interested in it for a smaller patch release Heres an example thats not compiling for me FWIW typescript import gsap from gsap Assuming const t gsaptimeline tadd consolelogHello world Thanks again Linked with Expose namespace GSAPStatic to public API Fix wrong type declaration of method add from class Timeline There is maybe a more Typescript idiomatic way to do but this way expose the entire namespace with a minimum of changes
