Hi all I tried this package to extract text from a simple picture however the results are not as good as expected here is my pic with dpi pathziji r librarytesseract eng tesseracteng results tesseractocrdatapathziji png engine eng results A tibble x word confidence bbox chr dbl chr Hippo pathway DCHS FAT TAOK SAV STK CRB an TEAD Cell proliferation and differentiation Actually it does not recognize every text in this picture A little strange because this pic is not complex at all anyone could give me some suggestions about this Thanks a lot Bests Shisheng r sessionInfo R version

where the following call results in an error message engine tesseractosdeng options listtesseditpagesegmode text ocr engine engine Failed loading language osd Tesseract couldnt load any languages Warning Auto orientation and script detection requested but osd language failed to load As suggested in some related posts I set TESSDATAPREFIX to the tessdata directory This does not seem to resolve the issue even though the traineddata files are located in this directory SyssetenvTESSDATAPREFIXUsersnameLibraryApplication Supporttesseract tessdata Setting the language argument to osd instead of osdeng will actually prevent the error message however the quality of the text recognition will suffer h s or podnr reod ro test the ocr de nd see or s types or rmat Any ideas how to solve this Thank you very much for your help This is related to and or more accurately the underlying ideas within them With the upstream issue that the whitelist and blacklist are not implemented in tesseract discussed in it is difficult to extract allnumeric values More generally I have some text that follows very rigid formatting with columns of person identifiers that are a mix of alphanumeric and dash characters and floating point numbers The person identifiers will be hard to limit the values for but the floating point numbers are easy as they come from the set and Is it possible within the ocrdata function to get a vector of all characters that matched with x confidence and the confidence values of those characters where x is input by the user That way I could manually implement whitelist or blacklist functionality Hi When i loop over my PDFs and use OCRData after a while about hours it produces the following error TIFFReadEncodedStrip Error Read error at scanline got bytes expected OK It is a popup in windows it is NOT an R error After hitting OK it doesnt go away and the same popup occurs Thus it completely stops my script I did see another issue raised from using OCRData about memory leak perhaps this is related Thanks Oneiricer Users installing on Linux machines may see Error opening data file usrsharetesseractocrtessdataengtraineddata Please make sure the TESSDATAPREFIX environment variable is set to the parent directory of your tessdata directory Failed loading language eng Tesseract couldnt load any languages This is easily solved by first installing tesseractocr and related language packs via aptget or whatever Hi all Im working in recognize some pdf image that havent an excellent quality and I want to perform a better OCR using the third dictionary called userwords but I dont know wich is the procedure to do it I search it on the web but didnt find anything could you help me Thank you very much have a nice day Thanks for a great package jeroen I have two suggestions regarding the vignette Vignette access To read the vignette one either has to go read the CRAN version or to install the package Would you be interested in a PR making a pkgdown website for tesseract This way the vignette would be rendered hOCR I looked at the posts on rOpenSci blog via in particular should this mention of hOCR be added to the vignette I see it is already mentioned very briefly in the README Hi I was wondering if anyone can help me figure out how to use the userpatternssuffix option when setting up the engine Id like to parse PDFs for a specific code that has a certain pattern and have been trying to do something like what this guide does What Ive tried I tried setting up a file in my tessdata folder called enguserpatterns that has my patterns one pattern per line I then tried doing tes tesseractoptions listuserpatternssuffix userpatterns but I see no differences in the output I also tried disabling all other dawgs by using listloadsystemdawgFloadfreqdawgFloadpuncdawgFloadnumberdawgFloadunambigdawgFloadbigramdawgFloadfixedlengthdawgsF however again the results are the same Any help much appreciated Nas See
