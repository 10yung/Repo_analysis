The pagination class at Bootstrap adds margin at the top and at the bottom of the element it is on Looking at the current examples they have on their documentation page only one element has this class and it s an inner one not the parent nav While working on one of our projects I noticed that Pagy had way more vertical margins than it should have so I noticed its Bootstrap helper was adding the class twice on two different elements Since I believe the markup it outputs should be as close as possible to Bootstrap s documentation the class added to the nav element feels out of place Since I replaced kaminari for Pagy The server CPU went up from average to O I havent found out exactly why it happens yet but after days of server shut down because of CPU went to the roof I reverted back to Kaminari and the CPU went down to the regular average of My specs Ruby Rails Nginx Passenger Mysql Im gonna try to use Pagy over the weekend on a testing site see if I can find the bug and Ill post it

discuss if my approach is ok and in line with Pagys standards Ill add docs and tests later Here an example of how it looks when put into use
