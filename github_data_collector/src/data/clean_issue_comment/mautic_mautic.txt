activated a cron job MYDIRappconsole mauticemailssend on cPanel What do I need to set additionally since it is not working now The cron job actually runs but the messages are stuck in spool and no sending is done I like to let you know that all the SMTP settings are proper and correct tested and verified this These errors are showing in the email that this cron job sends on my account each time it executes Parse error syntax error unexpected value TVARIABLE in MYDIRvendorawsawssdkphpsrcfunctionsphp on line It is this function Steps I have tried to fix the problem Commented out the contents of this function inside and another error appeared Again commented the problematic rows another error appeared etc never ending So I need to know what I am doing wrong if so And what needs to be set on my cPanel so that this may work properly I HAVE to use the Queue option That is why I use cron jobs Can somebody share is there a bug in the Mautic software in the lines of code I shared on the screenshot upper What can I do to fix this or how can I do a workaround If a bug is the case then where ever I migrate this will be issue again and again But when speaking on the subject actually my first option with which I started was with Send immediately but after sending of the first batch of for instance addresses the Send immediately was stopping so the process HAD to be started all over again to continue which apparently is NOT an option in case of mass email sending Can you share why was this process stopping since I could not find out in the configuration what was causing this

When you reach the point in the installation process the point to select sending email using queue You will get error due to mkdir permission issue The error cause is the parameters saved in the file localphp which is generated during the installation it uses the variable kernelrootdir which should point the root directory of M installation instead it points to app folder Therefore an error is generated because it tries to create a folder called default inside the folder appvarspooldefault but this folder does not exist instead it should be created at varspool A quick solution could be changing the folder location to a fixed path the same problem occur to the folders cache and logs Q A Mautic version alpha PHP version Browser Chrome Steps to reproduce Mentioned in the steps above
