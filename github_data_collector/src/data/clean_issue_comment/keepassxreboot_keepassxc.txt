 Summary Report all passwords that contain the masterpassword or variants of the masterpassword Details Please check in the Health Report if the masterpassword the password to access the KeePassXC database is reused as password for entries in KeePassXC Please also check for variants of the master password like different upcase lowercase added some special characters Example The masterpassword of the KeePassXC database is for example hellopassword If the password of an entry is using the same password then you show a warning that the password of the entry must not be the master password The following passwords are variants of the masterpassword and are reported in the Health Report hellopass hellopass hellopass HelloPassword HelloPassword HelloPassword HelloPassword HelloPassword HelloPassword Here you should show a message that the password of the entry is similar to the masterpassword is a variant of the masterpassword This will help users to increase the security of the KeePassXC masterpassword I import a second kdbx file using keeshare I created a new folder put in a name chose keeshare chose type import chose the path to the kdbx I had to switch to show all files and put in the password It seems to work but some entries are just missing I opened the file as a new database and it works it is the same file that is imported and is opened as new database but some files in the imported folder are just missing I tried to find out what is the difference between the entries that are shown and the missing ones but could not find any yet Operating system Xubuntu Keepassxc Enabled extensions no extensions enabled Expected Behavior I shouldnt see notes in table view Current Behavior I see hidden stuff Steps to Reproduce Setting Security Hide entry notes by

Please remove all lines which dont apply Documentation noncode change Description and Context NOTE Describe your changes in detail why is this change required NOTE Describe the context of your change Explain large code modifications NOTE If it fixes an open issue please add Fixes XXX as necessary Fix lacking commas between short and long option names eg l and lower in the generate options section of CLI man page and fix a typo in groff command Changed command and option names in man page to bold Because its easier to understand than if its not bold Checklist NOTE Please go over all the following points NOTE Again remove any lines which dont apply NOTE Pull Requests that dont fulfill all REQUIRED requisites are likely NOTE to be sent back to you for correction or will be rejected I have read the CONTRIBUTING document REQUIRED I have a DB that takes a rather long time to unlock so while it unlocked I switched to another DB When the first one unlocked it crashed right away I was able to easily reproduce this Expected Behavior Do not crash open the first DB in the background tab Current Behavior Crash Possible Solution Steps to Reproduce Prerequisites have two locked DBs in two tabs open one of them the one to unlock first should take a rather long time to unlock enough time to switch tabs after PW entry Unlock the first DB happens only when unlock is would be successful while it is computing switch to the other tab Crash Context I have Databases at least one of them takes a long time to unlock Debug Info KeePassXC Version Revision cda d Qt Debugging mode is disabled

Summary Add an advanced check for insecure passwords check against a dictionary Desired Behavior We all know that passwords should not contain normal words that can be found in a dictionary because hackers use word lists to attack passwords via brute forcerainbow tables I am not an security expert but you know what I mean Adding numbers or symbols at the beginning or at the end of normal words makes passwords also not safe Also replacing single letters with special characters like replacing an a with an or replacing an i with is not a good idea because hackers know this trick So here are some examples of weak and Insecure passwords Jnury pw rd n b all words from a normal dictionary with or without numbers at the end like vase or vase names with or without numbers at the end like Oliver or Oliver It would be great if KeePassXC warns me if I use such insecure passwords Here I dont mean pwned passwords that can be found in Have I Been Pwned I mean insecure passwords that can be found in dictionaries like described above I dont know id there is a web service that checks the security of passwords like you have Have I Been Pwned for pwned passwords When I search for check password security then I find these websites where users can check their passwords Maybe these links are useful to test this feature test the results of the password strength report When I search for check password security then I find these services I am not a programmer so I dont know if these links are helpful at least I tried I think programming this manually is a lot of work because you would have to convert the password to lower case replace symbols with the corresponding characters like convert an to a remove leading and trailing symbols remove leading and trailing numbers check if the password is in a dictionary multiple languages My intention is to tell users if they are using insecure passwords I know that this is a huge task and much to code but this would increase password

Behavior Should be able to fully view windows associations of an entry without making any changes and not be prompted about unsaved changes when leaving the entry Current Behavior If you view the

Window Associations Click AutoType The first Association will be highlighted in grey Select the second one Press Cancel Context Just normal use Work with a new database with just a single entry Debug Info Version bit on Windows Remarks is quite similar except that the fix for that one obviously did not solve this one For some reason I did not get the bugreporting template when creating this issue I have therefore tried to mimic the template TIP Provide a general summary of your changes in the title above Type of change NOTE Please remove all lines which dont apply New feature nonbreaking change which adds functionality Description and Context NOTE Describe your changes in detail why is this change required NOTE Describe the context of your change Explain large code modifications NOTE If it fixes an open issue please add Fixes XXX as necessary Adds Browser Integration page to Group Edit page This allows to set the following options for all entries in the group and its subgroups Skip AutoSubmit for entries Hide entries from the browser extension Use entries only with HTTP Basic Auth The checkboxes are tristate so if any of the entries has a different setting from others the state is set to QtPartiallyChecked However user can only set two states QtChecked or QtUnchecked Fixes Fixes Screenshots TIP Do not include screenshots of your actual database Screen Shot at Testing strategy NOTE Please describe in detail how you tested your changes TIP We expect new code to be covered by unit tests and documented with doc blocks Manually Checklist NOTE Please go over all the following points NOTE Again remove any lines which dont apply NOTE Pull Requests that dont fulfill all REQUIRED requisites are likely NOTE to be sent back to you for correction or will be rejected I have read the CONTRIBUTING document REQUIRED My code follows the code style of this project REQUIRED All new and existing tests passed REQUIRED I have compiled and verified my code with DWITHASANON REQUIRED TIP Provide a general summary of the feature in the title above TIP DO NOT include screenshots of your actual database Summary NOTE Provide a brief overview of what the new feature is all about Ability to like Firefox customise the toolbar Desired Behavior NOTE Tell us how the new feature should work be specific I would like to be able to Reorder the elements Remove specific elements this would solve for specific users then This would also help with as users could put the Find option first to prevent it overflowing and becoming hidden Possible Solution NOTE Not required but suggest ideas on how to implement the addition or change Context NOTE Why does this feature matter to you What unique circumstances do you have
