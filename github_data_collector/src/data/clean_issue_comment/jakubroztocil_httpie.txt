This seems to be related to and but is not a pure duplicate I would like to be able to create an alias or shell function for accessing a certain rest API requiring authentication I started with function girder https sessiongirdersessionjson girderhostlocallanapiv but my main problem is that I cannot change the HTTP method eg to PUT or PATCH this way I would like to be able to have a different way of specifying the default host so that I do not have to add a commandline parsing around httpie And I do have some hope since httpie already supports a default hostname only that its hardcoded to be localhost I see two potential solutions contains a small change introducing an environment variable for the default host which would solve my issue Another idea I had more in the line of would be to make the default hostname an optional part of the sessions Maybe that could even be made to work with named sessions by looking into a default host directory httpiesessionsdefaultnamejson With both solutions the above shell function could be turned into a simple alias passing the desired session parameter git clone Hello And thanks for the great HTTP client Ive noticed an issue with the latest release CPython the Trove classifiers in setuppy list Python among supported programming languages Furthermore setuppy does not define any pythonrequires that could help Pip choosing the right version However it seems that httpie has already embraced fstrings which are unsupported on File my virtual env libpython sitepackageshttpiecorepy line envlogerrorfRequest timed out parsedargstimeouts FWIW READMErst correctly states that is required But pip cannot parse this info slightlysmilingface I wanted to use with httpie alas http http error InvalidURL Failed to parse Should resolve to name GraphQL query uses helailigithubgraphqlaction First of all let me thankyou for wonderful project It works perfectly on any platform I use Anyway on
