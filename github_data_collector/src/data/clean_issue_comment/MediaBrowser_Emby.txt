Hello I found some problems in your code using the PVSStudio static code analyzer I described the issues in the article Checking Emby with PVSStudio Not all of the analyzers warnings have been considered in it so I suggest that you check the project yourself Perhaps some of the warnings that have not been described in the article will seem more interesting to you than the ones that I found To work with the analyzer you will need a key please use the following one Name Emby Key HGSG K NFGTZGB License Type Team License up to developers License Valid Thru Feb After I started to have both p and K versions of movies I have started to correct the file naming of all movies and moving the same movie into one folder Before it was in separate folders for D p and K This all works great unless there is a multi disc rip in the folder As soon as there is part or any of the other split video naming the multi version display is not working resulting in two movies in the list The multi disc version now only have one file recognized disc and disc is missing If I move the multi disc version to its own folder Movie name year D Emby correctly identifies both discs But of course it still shows as two movies in the list I have tried different naming but no matter what I try the result is two separate movies and the multi disc version missing the second disc I have attached the logs from the server The movie is The Hobbit An unexpected journey Extended version and D emby log hi i have a problem with the lastest versionthe newest server emby for koid and IOS client When I choose the Chinese subtitle it doesnt work any way But it works in PotPlayerx on Windows I find the issue for such ass subtitles is because the format line in Events section Format Name Fontname Fontsize

After update to Format Layer Start End Style Actor MarginL MarginR MarginV Effect Text the subtitle works for all clients Hope this could help you fix the issue Thanks Hi I try to use emby mainly for the existing mycroftskill set it up let it index my collection Strangely there are some artists missing eg Pink Floyd I tried to check this and learned that it had nothing to do with the mycroft call but the artists are not shown in the web interface as well My collection is completely id tagged and even has musicbrainzids as a feature request it might directly lookup the IDs rather than the names but thats another issue see below switched on debug and restarted indexing the following excerpt appears in my log Debug App FolderImageProvider reports change to smbhomenascolMultimediamp

contained queries Info HttpClient GET looks like emby looks up the folder name rather than the album name contained in every mp If this really is whats happening I wonder why other albums are recognized at all My complete collection is stored in artistyearnametype style imo it should look for the musicbrainzid if present but at least the album name stored in id tags and use the folder name only as last resort when no tags are available Any hints on this Can I provide something else Oh I just updated and am running version on a raspberry if that matters which I doubt If not sort by title Cannot show collections in librarys Samsung smart tv when you fast forward the loadingspinning icon does not go away only way to clear it is to fast forward to where you want to be then back out of the movieshow and then resume play According to how an empty value of the LanNetworks is computed source ref below the corresponding help field is partially correct If left blank only the servers subnet is considered to be on the local network Source Basically all wellknown IPv private subnets according to Instead an indication that wellknown subnets are also used should be displayed for example If left blank only the servers subnet and common private IP subnets eg etc are considered to be on the local network Ive just been doing a little testing in preparation for a new home theater setup eventually going to be built around the new Shield using my Pixel XL running Android and the Big Buck Bunny files available here When testing with the D p file Direct mode results in fps playback Transcoding to p mbps results in solid fps playback Whereas in Google Chrome and other Android players like Kodi I am able to achieve a solid fps playback With the D p file things are better but I still see dropped frames in Direct mode Judging from the video timeline indicator it appears I have plenty of frames buffered so I dont think its my network Is anyone else able to replicate my tests Hi there Emby have a recurrent issue with Chromecast Everytime I pause a movie and then click back on play the playback just freeze many seconds later its random but generally less than minutes I have to restart the playback stop and play to continue Server version Arch repo I ran the lighthouse performance best practises and PWA audits The full results are available here Some notable results from the performance audit Text compression should be enabled on the dictionary files Script evaluation takes s on the main page There are requests on the main page Another note not shown in
