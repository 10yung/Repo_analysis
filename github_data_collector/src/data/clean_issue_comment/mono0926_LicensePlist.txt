In iOS the Setting app crashes when navigating back from a license page The generated plist Crash video I am using LicencePlist v As reported in the other issue the Settings app also crashes on iOS and does so immediately after selecting Acknowledgements not after navigating back from a license Remarkably I dont have any issues on iOS also no popping and pushing when selecting a single library After playing around with the plist properties I found out that removing the Title property of the PSGroupSpecifier in the generated plist fixes the crash but produces this behavior Ive seen this behavior within the acknowledgement section of other apps pe Github and Asana My guess is this is caused by iOS but it would be nice to avoid generating the title until Apple releases a fix LicensePlist produces line breaks inside text blocks For example the following text blocks have a n at the end of every line The line breaks between the text blocks are correct Permission is hereby granted free of charge to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files the Software to deal in the Software without restriction including without limitation the rights to use copy modify merge publish distribute sublicense andor sell copies of the Software and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so subject to the following conditions The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software Is it possible to prevent this from happening Because it creates a problem when using this output as input in an HTML page Let say I have a project that uses some open source swift libraries and other imported frameworks are not part of cocoapods and are not part of the Podsfile Is it possible to To add the path of all the swift open source projects to the licenseplist execution command Create a file with all the used non cocoapods open source libraries eg Github code frameworks and their licenses manually and then use the crated file as an additional input source when executing licenseplist so that those licenses also get included in the execution When using this plugin cocoapodspodmerge that groups pods to reduce the number of dynamic frameworks loaded on startup the result in the plist is one new row for each group and their content just say Merged Pods by cocoapodspodmerge plugin and so the reference to the grouped libraries and their licences is lost Now except CocoaPods and Carthage we also have Mint for buildtime libraries just like LicensePlist itself So how about adding support for Mintfile This is a great little tool thanks for the effort I noticed the homebrew installation is via a tap would you consider adding the formula to the main homebrew repository I assume they generally want the formulas added by the maintainer where possible but otherwise I can try and send a PR for that Or have you already considered that and decided its not what you want Change all operations to sync from async and execute those by concurrentPerformiterationsexecute You can opt out it by exclude config
