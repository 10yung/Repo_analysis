When I use MacGap to wrap Google Keep it works beautifully There is unfortunately still one issue The top bar of the website is flashing while I am scrolling Jan This is my complete indexhtml for reproduction but its nothing special it just wraps Google Keep and I am using macOS Catalina btw DOCTYPE html html head titleMacGaptitle style typetextcss mediascreen html body height width background FFF padding margin overflow hidden webkituserselect none h color E E E margin textalign center fontfamily helvetica style head body script typetextjavascript charsetutf MacGapWindowresize windowlocationhref script body html The red areas height is and I set the titlebars height as Now I cant click the input textfield with left mouse button but right mouse button is work Im using the recent actually not so recent HTML Blob API to download a file from a JavaScript client like javascript Save a text as file using HTML a temporary element and Blob var saveAsFile functionfileNamefileContents iftypeofBlobundefined using Blob var textFileAsBlob new Blob fileContents type textplain var downloadLink documentcreateElementa downloadLinkdownload fileName if windowwebkitURL null downloadLinkhref windowwebkitURLcreateObjectURLtextFileAsBlob else downloadLinkhref windowURLcreateObjectURLtextFileAsBlob downloadLinkonclick documentbodyremoveChildeventtarget downloadLinkstyledisplay none documentbodyappendChilddownloadLink downloadLinkclick else var pp documentcreateElementa ppsetAttributehref datatextplaincharsetutf encodeURIComponentfileContents ppsetAttributedownload fileName pponclick documentbodyremoveChildeventtarget ppclick saveAsFile When the Blob is not supported it uses the standard DOM way When I run my application within MacGap running this code called lets say like javascript saveAsFilemyreportjsonjsonString will lead to this error sendMessageWithDictionary Failed to get remote object proxy Error DomainNSCocoaErrorDomain Code connection to service named comapplertcreportingd UserInfoNSDebugDescriptionconnection to service named comapplertcreportingd Im not sure if this is connected to the secure transport due to the NSAppTransportSecurity but in my case Im creating a downloadable content on the fly which url is on localhost I have also tried to intercept the link click through the PolicyDelegate but for some reason I do not get any log here ObjectiveC voidwebViewWebView webView decidePolicyForNewWindowActionNSDictionary actionInformation requestNSURLRequest request newFrameNameNSString frameName decisionListenerid WebPolicyDecisionListener listener if WebNavigationTypeLinkClicked actionInformation objectForKeyWebActionNavigationTypeKey intValue NSLogCLICKED request URL NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace openURL request URL listener ignore why when i use documentlocationit show Hi I know this is probably not a feature rather than a glitch so I think it would be awesome if refreshing the view through the webkit debugger would also reload the static files At the moment if I want to change my javascript files I have to reload the entire app which is a bit more cumbersome Probably a dumb question but does MG provide a way to call js functions from ObjC and call methods from JS to ObjC If not then what is best method to accomplish this It seems very important to be able to stream standard outputinputerror from a task As far as the API I would suggest nodes streamReadable class which seems to be a popular abstraction for this use case Should I just ignore these or are there plans to fix them Image of warning Hi Where can I change the height of the title bar container like this img width altschermafbeelding om src Thanks
