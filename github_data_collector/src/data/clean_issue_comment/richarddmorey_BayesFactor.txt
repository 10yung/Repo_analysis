Something similar to the post hoc tests implemented in JASP for Bayesian ANOVA Based on our Twitter discussion It would be great to be able to estimate contrasts simple effects simple slopes and their credible intervals from the posterior using emmeans instead of doing this manually by summing up the correct combination of parameters This would require is adding and exporting two new functions recoverdataBFBayesFactor and emmbasisBFBayesFactor Some more info can be found here Thanks It seems that you get different Bayes Factor values for ttestBF and generalTestBF when using a data set with an unused factor level whose underlying integer value is in between two of the actual used factor levels I think this discrepancy is ultimately due to the fact that generalTestBF calls lmBF which calls reFactorData on the data set however this does not happen for ttestBF Heres a way to reproduce this r mydata dataframegroup crepa repb repc score rnorm mydata mydata mydatagroup b strmydata

group Against denominator Intercept only Bayes factor type BFlinearModel JZS Basic issue the Bayes Factor seems to depend on the arbitrary labeling of ANOVA factors The attached code creates a data set with two factors It then flips the labeling of the factors so that the first factor is the second factor and the second factor is the first Finally it computes BFs for the original data and the flipped data using the topdown approach The BFs do not tie across the two outputs One potential issue might be how I specify the rscaleEffects because the problem doesnt seem to exist when I use the defaults Perhaps I am missing something but this appears to be a bug BayesFactor Issuetxt Ive recently come across an issue where ttestBF fails if the BayesFactor package is not imported it appears that this issue is resolved in the current version here on github Is there any plan to release an updated version of the package to CRAN in the near future x c mu rscale nsim test

when a tibble is given as input Consider this tibble tibbletribble value group a b a b df And in contrast this dataframe version of the same data df dataframedf To check classdf classdf In checkingR this evaluation is performed line isnumericdf value isnumericdf value leading to a wrong conclusion for df and to a right conclusion for df So thats the problem Seen from a different perspective tibble subsetting does not yield a vector but a tibble which is an unexpected behavior see df value str df value str I suggest replacing the code in checkingR by something like this see line

Hi Richard First of all thank you very much for all the work with BayesFactor Ive just started studing bayes data analysis and have little experience with fitting models to data so my questions below may sound very noob Nevertheless Id be very grateful if you could help me with three questions concerning generalTestBF Ive included some code below to hopefuly help you understanding my questions Can I use it to do a regression with one of the predictors being time ie repeated measures Considering the posterior for the predictor fbtype a median of means that for every feedback received there is a reduction of in performance similarly to a linear regression estimate Is that expected that fbtype and fbtype posteriors have the same values except for the signs Given that my data is closer to nonlinear than linear please see the plot performance X block in the code below is there a way of using a nonlinear model with generalTestBF Thank you very much in advance Best regards Flavio
