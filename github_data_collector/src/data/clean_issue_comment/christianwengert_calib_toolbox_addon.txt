Some params are not defined how should I run the code you said the dots where spaced mm and had a diameter of mmThe main bars are respectively dots largeso if i largen the size of dots to times the dx dy default in the autocalibratem need to be change from to am i rightthank youthe attachment is a calibration pattern made by myself and the dots size is mm function call handeyem line Hcam marker err TSAIleastSquareCalibrationHm w Hcam grid function definition TSAIleastSquareCalibrationm line function Hcam marker err TSAIleastSquareCalibrationHmarker world Hgrid cam Here it is not clear whether Hcam grid is to be used or its inverse Hgrid cam Same is the problem with other function calls for the different algorithms listed Also why the inverse is taken two times here handeyem lines Hgrid camcorrectSets inv Rc Tc Hcam gridcorrectSets invHgrid camcorrectSets The variable activeimages is missing Your FOSSA integration was successful Attached in this PR is a badge and license report to track scan status in your README Below are docs for integrating FOSSA license checks into your CI CircleCI TravisCI Jenkins Other where should I get the calibration pattern to run the autocalibratem Because the pattern should have the black bar to check the axis Or could you please send me the pattern Thank you very much
