String concatFile at TwitchLeecherServicesServicesTwitchServicecDisplayClass StartQueuedDownloadIfExistsb at SystemThreadingTasksTaskExecute i was wondering if any sort of auto capture was in the works so i could have this running on my pc and capture livestreams so i can watch them at my own time instead of live this is a feature request i guess i dont know if im posting this correctly sorry if im not Hi great work wit the app but there is one thing Im missing some kind of default quality setting I download all videos in lower quality so that the video files take up less space on my hard drive but as currently the quality defaults to the highest possible I have to set it manualy every time which is very annoying when downloading multiple videos at once Additionally I sometimes forget to set it so I also have to check the quality in the download manager afterwards Therefore I would like to have a default quality option in settings which would preset the quality for downloads if that quality is available Could look somewhat like this S There are commits Show filename crop time in downloads tab Add new wildcards with hyphen Add special wildcard that will be replaced by some number to avoid overwrite Add new settings option quality by default Will be selected ONLY if this quality exist in other cases you has to select quality manually as now Add autosplit option with special setting in preferences You can download video by part automatically with extra overlap option Work only with conversation This is almost same changes full tested Hi Thanks a lot for your great work I use it a lot while travelling to download league of legend games but it can last hours So i usually make part of each video so if a download failed i dont have to wait hours again to download the entire game I just have to redownload a part of it Another good point is that I can start to watch quickly as soon as the first part is downloaded while the other part are downloaded in background And last usage is that i can delete files as soon as i watch them But actually its a bit annoying to do it manually because i need to watch when does the game start set is as start time set an end time and remember it Then doing the second part beginning at the end of first one and so on So i imagined two easy way to do it either by setting length of part wanted twitchleecherexamplesliptdownload Or setting the number of parts twitchleecherexamplesliptdownloadnbpart And when you click to download it create independents download task in chronological order Im web software developer and i may have some time next weeks if you seems this feature seems great i will try to do a pull request Thanks a lot and do not hesite if you have question This is a fairly simple request It would be great if there could be some kind of indication on the Search or Browse windows that indicated the videos one had previously downloaded successfully It would help when browsing through my freinds collections of dozenshundreds of saved videos when I dont download them in sequence A fairly simple request but a quintessential and extremely helpful feature in any downloading program Thanks Twitch will shut down API V on Until then TL has to switch to the new Helix API Difficulties The new API does not contain any information about the video quality or framerate The quality selection would be gone TL would only be capable of downloading source quality It is how it is unfortunately I got in contact with Twitch here But there is no guarantee this will happen anytime soon Thanks for creating this awesome software I have a suggestion for a feature which I think would be desirable for a lot of users Could there be a setting to switch off the computer after all downloads complete Kind of like uTorrent or FileZilla does So you could leave the queue downloading overnight I am using version and I would love it if I could enter a Twitch collection url example Preach MGS playthrough after which TL would automatically queue and download every video in the collection instead of having to search for a date period during which these highlights were recorded
