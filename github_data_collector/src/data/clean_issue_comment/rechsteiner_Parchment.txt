My application need to show the menu equally by the width if total width is lesser than the total screen width else it should occupy its needed space For Example Scenario Screen Width Total Menu width of items Since it is lesser than screen width so my menu width need to spread equally Scenario Screen Width Total Menu width of items Since it is greater than screen width so each and every menu need to occupy in their own width itself Also my application supports orientation so in single view controller itself there will be possible of having two different sets of menu width I am using PagingViewControllerDelegate widthForPagingItem inorder to assign width for each and every menu but problem with this is PagingSizeCache which fetch the width from delegate for the very first time and cache it Because of this every time it stick to the same width even though inside delegate function i have a logic to change the width based on screen width Is there any work around to solve my problem I am experiencing crash on iOS Please see below attachment for error log img width altScreenshot at Dec src img width altScreenshot at Dec src Here is the way I set up func setUpView

pagingViewControllerdidMovetoParent self Here is how this library is used Paging view is init on viewDidLoad I download array of dates from api After I downloaded assign reusable paging view controller which depending on dates Then reload and select the appropriate controller using paging selectindex index animated true Did I do something wrong The weird thing is its only happening at iOS Not at iOS latest Development Machine Xcode Parchment Version Ill use the cities example on the front page as reference If you enable VoiceOver on your phone you can select one of the cities in the menu by tapping it By flicking left or right you can navigate citybycity in the menu typical UICollectionView behaviour When you have found your city of choice you double tap and that city will get selected in the menu and the page scrolls The problem is that the flicking to go citybycity works maybe for two or three items Then there seems to be some unexpected behaviour from Parchment which makes the VoiceOver not going to next city but instead jump to the next container on the entire page typically the first element on the current page Any help would be much appreciated Please tell me if you need some more details Currently there is no delegate method like canShowPageAtIndex which could prevent from scrolling to a specific page without reloading the whole datasource and removing that page completely In some cases It is useful to be able to get tab selected event even if the same index to currently selected index is selected For example using it to scroll top or refresh data so I would propose this delegate method when page first appears PagingViewController only show the first cell the next cell will appear after swipe first appear Screen Shot at after being swiped Screen Shot at i use Parchment How do i fix it Is there anyway to hide the page menu on the top when theres only one page something like UIPageControl hidesForSinglePage true seems PageView sets height constraint on page menu the CollectionView and i couldnt find a way to override that heightAnchor except subclassing PagingView and override the entire setupConstraints Is it possible to scroll vertically Thanks Hi rechsteiner youve done a great job this is an awesome library Im facing one issue with size of Menu item when orientation changes I have implemented widthForPagingItem for dynamic sizing cell but this method is not getting called when orientation changes and all menu item uses cached sizeI guess I have also tried to invalidate layout of collection view in viewDidLayoutSubviews but it didnt ask me for new size Is it expected behaviour or is it a bug and what if I want to resize items when orientation changes if I call selfpagingViewControllerreloadMenu in viewDidLayoutSubviews it asks for new size but doesnt apply it can you guide me through it Thanks Hi all Ive just released and iPhone app with a Parchment based pagination controller Some users are using the app in iPad in the iPhone compatibility mode and the app starts crashing for them Im not able to reproduce the issue but I know that It only happens in iPad devices running my iOS app in compatibility mode This is the crash trace img width altScreenshot at src img width altScreenshot at src Hope you can help me This bug is annoying me an some of my users
