Instead of running shellcheck against the entire codebase lets just run shellcheck against changed shell scripts in PRs This way we can incrementally improve the quality of our shell scripts and catch problems early on like in and Supersedes Question summary I operate several CloudLinux CentOS servers The problem that I have is that my accounts often hit their memory limits although there s really no true threat to the server memory Almost hundreds of times a day I receive notices from netdata warning about memory limits I was unable to find any other questions from folks having the same type of issue The question I have is if there are any simple methods to disable those memory email warnings for only those within cageFS system I d hate to miss an actual email for a server memory issue The only solution I can think of for now is to disable warning emails OS Environment CloudLinux CentOS Component Name memusage Expected results Warnings at the server level not account level When asking a new question please Verify first that your question wasnt asked before on GitHub HINT Use label question when searching for such issues Briefly explain what is the problem you are having Try to provide as much information about your environment OS distribution running in container etc as possible to allow us reproduce this bug faster Write which component is affected We group our components the same way our code is structured so basically component name dir in top level directory of repository Provide a clear and concise description of what you expected to happen Hi How to change badge font color Question summary OS Environment Component Name Expected results Describe the change in summary section including rationale and degin decisions Include Fixes nnn if you are fixing an existing issue In Component Name section write which component is changed in this PR This will help us review your PR quicker If you have more information you want to add write them in Additional Information section This is usually used to help others understand your motivation behind this change A stepbystep reproduction of the problem is helpful if there is no related issue Summary I am proposing two changes to systemdservice netdataservicein file Instead of using ExecStartPre lines to create directories let systemd do it There is no need of ExecStartPre lines and forking of additional processes unnecessarily Instead of setting global options via command line in ExecStart via W specify them in netdataconf This gives much more flexibility to administrator That way they can set them more easily and at single place instead of putting some options in service file and some in netdataconf Component Name systemd Additional Information Please read summary above

RELEASEp FreeBSD RELEASEp GENERIC amd netdatainstallersh install opt sh Installing but not enabling the netdata updater tool sed I or i may not be used with stdin FAILED Cannot install netdata updater tool Check if we must enabledisable the netdata updater tool You chose NOT to enable autoupdate removing any links to the updater from cron it may have happened if you are reinstalling Otherwise all good Environment GCP instance with Ubuntu Ran the below command to install Netdata bash curl Ss It seemed to install successfully however when I try to remotely access it on another machine using the below URL ip of the machine running netdata It shows below error The site cant be reached ERRCONNECTIONTIMEDOUT I checked firewall and it is disabled sudo ufw status Status inactive I also added the below statement in both web and global sections in etcnetdatanetdataconf followed by service restart bind to sudo systemctl restart netdata What do I need to change in order to access the Netdata web interface remotely I was unable to find this in the documentation after several lookthroughs of it Feature idea summary A custom dashboard html file should have the ability to refresh charts with the same options as the default chart file In our case similar to the settings entries refresh chartsalways and refresh policysequential This is required in order to create a singlepane URL that can live alongside other monitoring tools web java etc that are next to the netdatas base screens Expected behavior A custom chartdash URL should have the same update ability as a default dashboard when no longer in focus Perhaps by an argument in the script clause Summary broke unit tests for the exporting engine We should wrap uvthreadsetnamenp to make the tests work again Component Name exporting engine Feature idea summary Placeholder thiagoftsm please fill out as discussed Expected behavior Deployment of new library via the netdata installer Describe the change in summary section including
