I have followed the thread for this by another user and have found that the options are not working for me as a mac user I have tried leaving all arguments blank in the spaceinitialize command and R crashes and restarts the moment I have hit the enter key on spaceparse Spacyr is recognizing the condo environment but the crash still happens libraryspacyr spacyinitialize Found spacycondaenv spacyr will use this environment successfully initialized spaCy Version language model en python options type condaenv value spacycondaenv txt This is love spaceparsetxt R session aborted R encountered a fatal error The session was terminated I have a suggestion for an enhancement It is becoming very easy to create domain specific models in spaCy with the matcher and Phrasematcher and the Entity Ruler Prodigy is also turning out to be really powerful for improving the out of the box NER matching and for classification in specific domains At present spacyr allows the user to download models from spacy eg the en model Bearing in mind the discussion on full model names would it be possible to add an arg to install a model from a local path I took a look inside the code but as far as I could tell the calls to install are made through commands to the sys My use case on this is that I used spacyr to extract noun phrases containing species names for Antarctic and the Arctic from scientific and patent texts to examine bioinnovation in the polar regions However that approach drops relevant results and so training a large model with an entity ruler etc was necessary It would be good to use that model inside spacyr I also think we might see R users wanting to use other spacy models such as for biomedical text and the spacy universe suggests other models such as for legal text classification blackstone etc So I think adding this arg would open up a lot of flexibility for users Many thanks again for all the work on the package Hi I am trying to use spacyr and I dont have admin privileges to my machine I am running installpackagesspacyr libraryspacyr without any error messages however when I try to run spacyinitialize I get the error Error in pathexpandpath invalid path argument I have tried different options for the arguments of the function with no success Any advice Thanks At the moment spacyinitialize use the default model name en This would become a bit confusing as we are planning to use wordvectors that come with spaCy language models and vectors come only with lg or md Once this is implemented we expect a number of spacyr users will have multiple models from the same language I think we should use a full model name as the default eg the default will be encorewebsm to avoid this confusion Thats also what ines recommends This will be implemented with unless vetoed by kbenoit or someone else Please give us a way to install spacyr via Docker I have tried everything from installing spacy via a continuumiominiconda container to installing conda on an RStudio container and initalizing directly to spacyinstall within my Dockerfile I feel the easiest way would be to simply call RUN R e spacyrspacyinstallpromptFALSE in my Dockerfile and let it install everything from miniconda to the enviroment as I would in RStudio Unfortunately running it like this is noninteractive and consequently doesnt work I was not able to find a why to run the command interactively in my Dockerfile and automatically answer all prompts with Yes Unless you know a way to run something like RUN R it y e PLEASE enable us to run promptFALSE in noninteractive mode I ran out of any other ideas to make spacyr available via Docker The documentation of spacytokenize states that x can be a character object a quanteda corpus or a TIFcompliant corpus dataframe Yet it does not seem to work on a quanteda corpus but only on textscorpus Either the behaviour should change or the documentation should be refined r libraryquanteda Package version Parallel computing of

Fellow Washington Washington Citizens Washington of Washington the Washington Senate Washington and Washington of Washington the Washington House spaCy now has this Maybe we want to make this functionality available in spacyr Any feedbacksuggestions from users are welcome Revise JOSS submission Hello kbenoit and other users of spacyr This is a comprehensive wishlist of spacyr updates inspired by our discussion with honnibal and ines We will implement some of them in future but is there anything you are particularly intereted in Something likely to be implemented Turn off the part of pipes at the time of execution Noun phrases extractions Having a just tokenization option Size of batch in pipe for performance tuning Something nice to have but not sure how many users need it Allowing to add userdefined attributes Functionality to add word embeddings to the model Just a wish consider the use of matcher in spacyr construction of JSON is necessary parsetree navigations maybe a different package
