Hi author how to use this in OC project Thanks Newbie is me haha Issue Work in progress this is just a proof of concept for the idea all tests are passing live reloading works One question before I can move forward Do you want to keep the original type checking method list of restricted classes or we can substitute it with generics TypedTrait is a temporary thing As I understand if I want Font trait to support UITextView I have to modify Font source code add UITextViewself to restrictedTypes array and modify apply method IMO if target type restrictions were expressed via a protocol it would be easier to add new target classes to existing traits Hi For iOS projets its will be great to make your component Carthage compatible Take a look at these articles Ruthlessly Simple Dependency Management with Carthage Carthage Tutorial Getting Started Making Carthagecompatible Frameworks with Swift Swift Cross Platform Framework section Configure targets for Carthage On your READMEmd add Carthage compatible on top and add section for the installation with Carthage
