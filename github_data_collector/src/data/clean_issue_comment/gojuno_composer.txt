Is it possible to add parameters to support running some specified test classes instead of whole test packages A configuration that works on Mac doesnt work on Windows These are the calls were doing On mac java jar composer jar apk appbuildoutputsapkspaindebugappspaindebugapk testapk appbuildoutputsapkandroidTestspaindebugappspaindebugandroidTestapk On windows java jar composer jar apk appbuildoutputsapkspaindebugappspaindebugapk testapk appbuildoutputsapkandroidTestspaindebugappspaindebugandroidTestapk On windows it answers Cannot parse test package from aapt dump badging APK output By the way of course those apks are there ignore I love that I can see full logcat output and find things that happened before my test started or other systems reported However logcat on emulator and devices is super noisy Would you consider to add some options to filter it At least maybe to ignore all logs that are not related to tested app In a Gradle setting it would be great to be able to have exit handled as I may make other tasks dependent on this for example I may want to run testDebugComposer For example I may define groovy projecttasktestDebugCustomIntegrationTest type DefaultTask dependsOn testDebugComposer clearConnectedDevices projecttaskclearConnectedDevices type ClearDevicesTask dependsOn testDebugComposer mustRunAfter testDebugComposer testDebugCustomIntegrationTest is a task Ive created so that developers can simply run gradlew testDebugCustomIntegrationTest and have testDebugComposer run and then clearConnectedDevices Such set ups are helpful for CI so that I can ensure that each run will get a clean emulator having testDebugComposer makes it so that clearConnectedDevices even though I do gradlew testDebugCustomIntegrationTest continue I could get around it other ways but those start to get more difficult to maintain in Gradle Minor bug The return is return mins secs ms If test runs take longer than an hour you only see the mmssSS Fixes Key points Application process crash during test run will now be considered as test failure After a crash test run for the current device shard will complete unless test orchestrator is enabled where crashes are isolated This will then allow to wait until test runs for the other device shards complete and then compile a report at the end Previously app crash would cause the composer test run to crash which would then also skip generating any test result reports This is also the same behaviour as is implemented in the default Gradle instrumentation test tasks connectedAndroidTest Code changes Dropped the requirement to handle unordered output Each device shard does execute tests onebyone in order so why was this requirement implemented in the first place This allowed for simplifying the asTests method significantly and implementing this fix in a clean manner Will now parse and handle INSTRUMENTATIONRESULT log entries key to catching app crash messages Fixed a few test resource txt files as they contained invalid output Hi people Thank you so much for the tool I have a feature request show logcat for the failed tests as well Sometimes it would be handy Right now I see screenshot and stacktrace only Best follow up to obviously this would fail until that is published but figured I would post them round about the same time restating from the commander PR Sorry for the PR bomb just trying to get some tickets going on the composer repo since they are now bubbling up to the gradle plugin repo as development seems to have slowed on commandercomposer this is in support of gojunocomposer gojunocomposer gojunocomposer trevjonezcomposergradleplugin This might be a silly question how exactly should composer be called after starting emulators with swarmer Im finding that composer may fail to install my test APKs because the emulators are not given sufficient time for the package manager to become available adb failed to install pathtotestapk cmd Cant find service package My buildscript simply executes the swarmer and composer commands one after each other Here are the relevant parts from the command outputs Thu Jun Swarmer My job is done here took

Everything works fine if I simply wait to run composer manually Im currently doing something like this as a workaround would rather not do this if its not necessary sh java jar swarmerjar start
