Not obligatory but suggest an idea for implementing addition or change Closed issue may relate Hello I work at Skylight We are launching a program to offer free Skylight accounts to open source apps similar to Github and Travis so I am reaching out to see if this is something you would be interested in If you re not already familiar with Skylight it is a smart profiler for Rails apps Skylight makes it easy to pinpoint performance issues in Rails applications We work on a lot of open source projects ourselves and in our experience it can be pretty hard to get contributors to work on application performance issues Few contributors consider working on performance problems and the ones that might be interested may not even know where to start By making performance information more accessible we hope to inspire potential contributors to tackle slow parts of your app and have a good way to see if their contributions helped For reference this is the Skylight dashboard we set up for The Odin Project It should give you a pretty good idea of how Skylight works Integrating Skylight to a Rails application is very easy All you have to do is add the gem to your Gemfile and set an environment variable with your authentication token we are happy to send a pull request If you re interested in setting this up or if you have any questions you can reach us here or at supportskylightio mailtosupportskylightio Wed also love to feature you on our website as one of the first open source organizations using Skylight We hope you ll join us in helping to make performance an accessible way to contribute to an open source project It is now January nothing is going on for December and I cant see any info about December Ideally the UI shows the previous years statistics
