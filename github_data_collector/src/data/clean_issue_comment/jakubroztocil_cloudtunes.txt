docker image with databases included in it use images cloudtunes Why is it better docker style is to have only one main process per container faster build of cloudtunes image uptodate versions of redis and mongo smaller image size The whole installation worked perfect without any errors but when I want to open in my browser I always get the message ERRCONNECTIONREFUSED and nothing happens Is that a configuration problem of my system OSX Yosemite or is there are problem in my cloudtunes installation I tried it with Chrome Safari Firefox I dont know where to search for a solution because as I said the installation worked fine Sorry for being a githubnewbie this was my first try in working with the terminal since Im using a Mac trying to install cloudtunesserver but pymongo needs to be donwgraded i have on my debian testing machine pythonpymongo installed but exactly is needed so after if execute cloudtunesworker worker loglevelINFO c to start the server there is a log messeage like ImportError Motor requires PyMongo at exactly version You have PyMongo why is exactly this version needed and not also a newer version usable my repo just have this version of pymongo and i dont want to install it manually with a deb package or something can anyone please update the code so that also newer versions can be used full error log marcelLaracloudtunescloudtunesserver Traceback most
