Hi I want to have some additional knowledge about the implementation of the fn flow With the help of the fn flow its easy for me to for example construct a function chain which means that function f will be invoked first and then f will be invoked with f s return value then f So how are the parameters passed between the flow functions In other words how does the return value of f go to f I have tried to let function f return a super large result to f but the communication time the time interval between the return of f and the start of f does not even increase I just want to ask how to explain the phenomena Does f just return a pointer of the returned object to f Will anything like memory copy from f to f occur Thanks If you are reporting a new issue make sure that we do not have

API version minimum version Go version go Git commit d db Built Wed Nov OSArch linuxamd Experimental false Right now the only way to configure TLS certificates is to use WithTLS with a tlsConfig object I am aware removed the ability to setup SSL using env variables in favor of using listeners or modifying fnserver This means that any change made to the SSL configurations will require a recompilation which is impractical to say the least I propose to add at least two basic env variables FNCERTFILE and FNKEYFILE to allow for a more flexible configuration I will be willing to implement it if its accepted As a side note what do you think about creating an endpoint for dynamically modifying configuration variables without needing to restart the nodeserver If you are reporting a new

malformed HTTP response x x x x x x x See fn command help for more information Client version NB the in the URI Thats wrong How do I convince fn invoke and this fails similarly in the UI too to use TLS and URIs Attempting to set a kernel memory limit when running containers on some systems causes a fatal error The error message is kernel memory accounting disabled in this runc build This happens because githubcomopencontainersrunc part of containerdio has been built for some systems like CentOS with the nokmem option So for these systems we need to disable kernel memory limiting
