I want to attach an event listener to the cursor component so as to display the value at a particular point in a different part of the screen I have tried the method here But this doesnt work Any idea In bonusessimpleanimation example there is an error runTiming is not a function I use timing instead of runTiming erros gone but the logo rotate only once How can I make it loop My redash verson is should I fallback to I am curious if such an example is possible Heres the pure d implementation Seems plausible given d force and d hierachy have no DOM dependencies but I am just not quite sure how it would all come together I tried dropping the draggable chrome tabs into my project but found that any rerenders caused the dragging to lock up I determined this by placing a shouldComponentUpdate that always returns false which then allows me to drag the tabs around Any idea what causes this I noticed that sometimes they respring to their starting positions on rerenders so I suspect that maybe something is going wrong with the gestureState Hi First thank you for this great course Im having trouble in animated path in reactnativesvg I just executed this code without expo and its crashed reactnative reactnativeredash reactnativesvg Hey there Been trying to work on a replacement for the Slider example you did on Youtube but without the deprecated Interactable component However my current issue is that i want to update the snappoints when the layout changes however it doesnt seem to be do that I assume withSpring only does one hook typescript import as React from react import Dimensions View StyleSheet SliderProperties from reactnative import PanGestureHandler from reactnativegesturehandler import useLayout from reactnativehooks import withSpring snapPoint clamp panGestureHandler from reactnativeredash import useMemoOne from usememoone import Ani from reactnativereanimated export interface SliderProps steps number size number export function Sliderprops SliderProps const steps size props Uses layout and check the width const onLayout layout useLayout const width layout const offset ReactuseMemo new AniValue steps size Tries to update snappoints when width changes const snapPoints ReactuseMemo let points for let i i steps i pointspushAniadd i width size steps consolelogUpdated snap points return points steps size width const state translationX velocityX gestureHandler panGestureHandler const translateX withSpring state velocity velocityX value translationX offset offset snapPoints config overshootClamping true damping mass restDisplacementThreshold restSpeedThreshold stiffness onSnap value consolelogsnapping value return View onLayoutonLayout style height size borderRadius size backgroundColor F F F AniView style StyleSheetabsoluteFillObject backgroundColor dc borderRadius size height size PanGestureHandler gestureHandler AniView style width size height size transform translateX borderRadius size borderWidth borderColor backgroundColor ffffff shadowOpacity shadowColor FFF shadowRadius shadowOffset width height overflow visible PanGestureHandler View Is there any way to update the snap points somehow Hello wcandillon your Liquid Swipe example is great but on Android I cant drag the arrow there is no interaction at all Ive tried cloning your project and the interaction works but in my project I dont use expo neither typescript I cant interact with the arrowliquid swipe I guess its some incompatibility to the dependencies gesturehandlerreanimated I am using reactnative I am new to react native also apologize about my poor English Hey wcandillon your Accordion looks great If ever you plan to opensource a reanimated alternative to that would be so great I think theres a real need for that I cant stand anymore the nonnative height animation its ok but for DEV on Android its really painfully slow Unfortunately dont have much time to work on this atm If anyone here is willing to implement this Id be happy to be a beta tester Tapping on the TextInput in the Story doesnt do anything It seems like the ScrollView is not propagating touches to the TextInput in the Story component Is there a way to allow the scrollview to allow the TextInput to receive the touch and respond to the scroll Hey thanks for your tutorials on youtube btw I was looking to your flipcard code here any idea why is not working on Android
