Describe the bug Only numbers are shown for the branches I guess they are suppose to represent when the last commit was created Only numbers tells me nothing since it can be weeks seconds or hours To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Install latest version brew install jesseduffieldlazygitlazygit Open up a repo Check the numbers Expected behavior I would very much like to have explanations for what the numbers represent Screenshots Desktop please complete the following information OS macOS Catalina Lazygit Version eg v iTerm Build Additional context Now when Im typing this I have small bell ringing that this issue is known on macOS Also thanks for putting time into this Describe the bug I use hub to checkout PRs for review By issuing hub checkout url it will checkout from a fork without adding the fork as a remote This can be handy when managing local mess when checking contributions from tenshundreds of different contributors lazygit doesnt seem to recognise these branch configuration entries prompting for a remote URL when hitting p to pull It would be great if it could understand they are there To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Use hub to checkout a pull request or alternative manually add a branch configuration to gitconfg for a project branch dropdownkeyboardsupport remote merge refsheadsdropdownkeyboardsupport Checkout branch Try to pull within lazygit See prompt for remote URL even though it should already be known Expected behavior Expect the pull to run without prompting This is also applicable to push operations for what its worth

Desktop please complete the following information OS Alpine Linux Lazygit Version latest Ive used this method for more than a year now to install or update lazygit and the message appeared today Thanks a lot for your awesome work btw This PR as it stands almost does what I want it to The only issue is that the confirmation box receives a view to return the focus to after youve done the thing but in this case the view to return focus to depends on what happens after the action so Ive hit a roadblock Im starting to think I need to do some serious rearchitecting to allow for async actions and more callbacks and stuff This is a very very minor quibble but I keep finding myself stumped when Im staging changes linewise and want to commit intuitively I would just want to press c from the staging view but instead I have to go back to the file menu with Esc and then press c A bit unnecessary in my opinion especially since c is not mapped to anything else in the staging view So if at all possible it would be great to have c do the same thing in the staging view as it does in the file view Not that this will stop me from using lg thanks very much for this Topic Theres a library called lib git that has a library made to integrate with git without having to run command line options in sub shell like I believe yall are currently doing Said project has go bindings as well at git go Your thoughts This is mostly just an FYI this thing exists which might be betteruseful I havent looked into it much but I feel like it might solve some of the issues Ive been dealing with related to interacting with different versions of git which seem to mostly be changing of flag names see already fixed but possibly avoided doing it this way Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Id like to set up lazygit to follow the changes to my terminal theme based on my macs lightdark mode My iterm client is configured to do this Id like to define an environment variable that stores the status of lightdark theme and use that to determine which config to load when opening lazygit Describe the solution youd like The ability to have sections of the config load conditionally based on an environment variable eg have a lighttheme true section with colors and a lighttheme false section with its own colors and only load the applicable config section based on LAZYGITTHEME or something Describe alternatives youve considered When loading lazygit it searches for an environment variable such as LAZYGITSELECTEDCONFIG and will load the config with that name This would also require the ability to saveedit multiple configs until theres either undo functionality in the system or something else Topic The reset selection kbddkbd key on the Unstaged Changes panel Your thoughts This is a very dangerous key Itll delete things without any warning and without anyway of getting the contents back It should either be A removed entirely maybe not the best B be change to modifier kbddkbd C have a dialog alerting the user that they are permanently deleting information Describe the bug Lazy git segfaults on rare occasions panic runtime error invalid memory address or

Version commitdab c build date build sourcedebian version oslinux archamd Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I am trying to change some of default lazygit behavior eg have a oneline graph in commits view I could not find any info about configuring lazygit The only glimpse of this I had was at in the lazygit features youtube video Describe the solution youd like I would expect a section describing all the configyml options in the readme file Describe alternatives youve considered Maybe there could be a defaultconfigyml with all the defaults so we could pick and modify some to include in our actual configyml file Additional context I find it strange that any other issue seems to be related to this documentation so maybe I am missing something If its the case Im sorry
