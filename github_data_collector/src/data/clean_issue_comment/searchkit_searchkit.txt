Closes I noticed with that problem that I cant install this repo for development on Mac OS Catalina due to old nodesass which doesnt support this env Looks like to run it successfully there should be version or newer I use in my project When I started my work on some fixes I noticed that current repo has some trailing whitespaces For example here I just decided to remove unused let result but together with this changed I did changes in trailing spaces Also it has some inconsistencies inside code like different space positions after sign space after here no spaces here You even have tabs inside the codebase We can resolve such kind of problems by adding linter There is one of the ways how to add it to TS project joemcelroy are you interested in adding linter to the project If yes Ill try to prepare PR with it Hello Im using SearchKit on an ES cluster and I have encountered several problems HitsStats Pagination Im having a problem with the SearchBox component The search dont work When I use the SearchBox I get an error Has anyone ever used SearchBox with ES If yes can you give me an example of configuration Here is my SearchBox config SearchBox searchOnChangefalse queryOptionsanalyzerfuzziness queryFields titlefieldrelatedmakename prefixQueryFields titlefieldrelatedmakename Thanks for your help Basic searchkit seems to be a simple keyword search out of the box I like the kibana syntax eg apples AND oranges AND NOT grapes a more complex search capability I tried changing the analyzer but that didnt seem to do much Also tired queryBuilderQueryString and the entire thing became unresponsive Any idea how to duplicate the kibana lucene style syntax with searchkit Here is my searchbox default SearchBox autofocustrue searchOnChangetrue prefixQueryFieldsprefixqueryfelds queryOptionsanalyzerstandard ps I tried the chat from your website and no one ever responds Also searched everything I could find with no luck on getting this to work Appreciate any tips or pointers I cant figure out an easy way to use Material UI I would prefer to create my own view components We could refactor the view internals to use reacthooks That would decouple view logic from render logic The developer could then choose to use create their own view components using whatever library they wish I have a Google Maps object being passed in data from Hits Each time the results are or not found that component is destroyed and once results are found is rerendered using another API key An optional field to pass into hits to tell it to render hits would be great I understand you have HitsSuggestion if Hits is empty but I think my use case happens a lot From docs Range component containing only minmax input fields Requires pressing Go to update the filter Why do all other inputs get searchOnChange Including most Range Components
