committee to review the pull request if your PR is targeting a particular programming language Previously there was a writeOptional method in DefaultCodegen which allowed Codegen instances to immediately write out a supporting file if it did not exist This would allow a codegen implementation to skip userfacing options such as definitions in openapicodegenignore the supportingFiles system property and support for the experimental handlebars templating engine While our implementation only modified the supportingFiles list conditionally it added confusion as it seemed to imply that file writes were somewhat the responsibility of DefaultCodgen its DefaultGenerator which handles file manipulation This commit moves the definition of whether a file supports overwriting existing files into the SupportingFile type itself allowing that functionality to be determined at timeofwrite rather than timeofdefinition This would allow us for example to dump the list of files which would be generated using a dryrun option or similar This will be a breaking change for anyone who has extended DefaultCodegen and called writeOptional The path to migrate is to add the SupportingFile to the supportingFiles list and chain the method call doNotOverwrite on the instance This has the added benefit of clarifying this behavior considering the write behavior wasnt previously optional writes but optionally defining the list of supportingFiles based on the state of the file system Fixes This is both a bug fix due to previous behavior of potentially circumventing user options and a breaking change due to workflow options exposed to users via DefaultCodegen rather than DefaultGenerator cc OpenAPIToolsgeneratorcoreteam PR checklist x Read the contribution guidelines x If contributing

regard required readOnly and writeOnly open api specification report If a readOnly or writeOnly property is included in the required list required affects just the relevant scope responses only or requests only That is readonly required properties apply to responses only and writeonly required properties to requests only so if i declare a field required and readonly means that in the request that field should be empty example with this yam Poll title Poll type object description A poll is an election or a survey of peoples opinions to ask inside the platform properties id type integer format int readOnly true description Unique Identifier of a Poll openapigenerator generate the class with id not null JsonPropertyid private Long id NotNull public Long getId return id public void setIdLong id thisid id What happen if i run my code and i perform a post with an empty id Spring raise bad request but it is not correct For openapi specification readonly required properties apply to responses only and not for the request I think that openapi generator should generate NotNull only for writeOnly property Bug Report Checklist x Have you provided a fullminimal spec to reproduce the

generating foo with bar Description The PHP code generator does not validate the value of the scheme attribute in the security scheme object It assumes that when type is set to http the auth scheme is basic But thats not always the case Other HTTP schemes that are defined in the IANA registry The scheme attribute in the security scheme object is required as specified in OAS The value of the scheme attribute must be the auth scheme from the IANA registry available at as per RFC openapigenerator version master branch January OpenAPI declaration file content or url Consider the following OAS security schemes yaml securitySchemes httpbasictest type http scheme basic httpscram type http scheme SCRAMSHA httpotherscheme type http scheme mysecurityschemevalue The PHP generator properly generates the code for httpbasictest For the other two scheme values httpscram and httpotherscheme the generator still produces code assuming the scheme value is basic I found this issue while working on PR and Command line used for generation binopenapi phppetstoresh Steps to reproduce Edit modulesopenapigeneratorsrctestresources petstorewithfakeendpointsmodelsfortestingyaml and add the following scheme yaml httpsignaturetest type http scheme signature The signature value is NOT HTTP basic This is just an example I think any value would produce the same results Execute binopenapi phppetstoresh Notice the following code is generated in bsamplesopenapi clientpetstorephpOpenAPIClientphplibApiPetApiphp this endpoint requires HTTP basic authentication if emptythisconfiggetUsername emptythisconfiggetPassword headers Authorization Basic base encodethisconfiggetUsername thisconfiggetPassword I would expect that the PHP generator to inspect the value of scheme and skip the http basic code generation Related issuesPRs Similar issue Suggest a fix I think the code generator should validate the value of the scheme attribute If it does not understand the value and cannot generate the code that will be able to implement this value it should skip the security scheme Or alternatively it should fail but I think skipping is better My reasoning for skipping is that if an OAS spec supports multiple schemes at least the PHP generator will be able to generate a subset of the schemes even if it does not support all of them Bug Report Checklist x Have you provided a fullminimal
