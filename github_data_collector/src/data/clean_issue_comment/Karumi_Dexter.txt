 pushpin References Issue Steps to reproduce Launch two activities consecutively with each activity asking for any new permissions in onCreate Bug Callback for second activitys permission request will not be called sometimes Issue After the second activity sets up the DexterInstance with new callback DexterActivity fired from the first activity permission request calls onDestroy and wipes the callback tophat What is the goal Make state clean up synchronous memo How is it being implemented Manually clean up the state by calling onActivityDestroyed when there already is a DexterActivity that is finishing up Then when DexterActivity calls onDestroyed no cleaning is needed robot How can it be tested Since testing this requires mocking activity life cycle events Suggestions are welcome Our Application need to block all the screenshots and Recording of screen comkarumidexterDexterActivity is not having FLAGSECURE for the Screenshot protection Shall we expect change in next version Version of the library I implemented this library to my project and now Im trying to use it in fragment to get camera permission Expected behaviour After confirming I want to start camera fragment withaout application recreation Actual behaviour After confirming I return to last state of application I tried to override the onRequestPermissionsResult method but in this method I receive the GRANTED value ie in any cases independently I click on cancel or ok button in permission dialog Version of the library last version Expected behaviour If any permission has requested on the code but hasnt declared on the manifest We should provide a proper message to declare permission on manifest Actual behaviour Not showing any message to declare in manifest Steps to reproduce Execute the code without declaring camera permission on the manifest kotlin DexterwithActivitycontext withPermissionManifestpermissionCAMERA withListenerobject PermissionListener override fun

to use MediaProjection you need to request for a permission in this way mMediaProjectionManager MediaProjectionManager activitygetSystemServiceContextMEDIAPROJECTIONSERVICE startActivityForResult mMediaProjectionManagercreateScreenCaptureIntent REQUESTMEDIAPROJECTION And then youre going to receive at onActivityResultint requestCode int resultCode Intent data The data you need to start mediaprojection it would be great if this fantastic library add support for this specially while using it from C side where makes the things a lot easier Actual behaviour No way to do this Steps to reproduce No way to do this Version of the library How does Dexter deal with activity recreation By this I mean I ask for permissions permission dialog is shown then I close the app and go to another Android might kill the app after saving its state When going back the whole stack is recreated and dialog should still be shown But I dont see how you would retain the PermissionListener object Background The Dexter is a fragment inside ViewPager inside the main activity Requesting for Locations permissions Scenarios OK On the first time the app is running Location is disabled the dialog is shown up onPermissionsChecked is activate and confirm the dialog does the work OK In the second time opening the app Location is already enabled dialog isnt shown up as it should be and everything is ok The problem While the app is still running and I turn off the Location permission when checking the permissions the onPermissionRationaleShouldBeShown is activate a Why the dialog isnt shown up again b Why it goes to onPermissionRationaleShouldBeShown callback Still relates to the problem In this callback Im opening the permissions screen of my app there Im turn on the Location permission and then press Back until I return to the app when checking the permissions again non of the callbacks is called neither onPermissionsChecked nor onPermissionRationaleShouldBeShown Why OK Only when I clear the data of the app or reinstall it again the dialog is shown as in Version of the library Code private void registerLocationUpdates DexterwithActivitygetActivity

rationale Calling check on nd time does nothing Version of the library Latest Expected behaviour I want to help the user understand why my app needs a permission before showing android permission dialog Im using a helper dialog to explain that I disabled the back press button on the helper dialog so the only way to close the dialog is to press a button on the dialog after user press the close button I consume token with tokencontinuePermissionRequest and android permission dialog is shown and everything should continue to be working fine Actual behaviour when a helper dialog is displayed to user to explain why permission needed and user press on back button then clicks on dialog close button dexter does not work anymore anywhere and show nothing Steps to reproduce after the helper dialog is shown just press back button then continue Override public void onPermissionRationaleShouldBeShownPermissionRequest permission PermissionToken token new AlertDialogBuildercontextsetTitletest
