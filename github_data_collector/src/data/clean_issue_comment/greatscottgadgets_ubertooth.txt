We recently purchased an Ubertooth One from Great Scott Gadgets and have been experimenting with it We are considering designing our own hardware based off the CC as the CC is not recommended for new designs for the past years it seems You answered a question from Hunyue Yau on indicating the CC does not support Mbps symbol rate required for Bluetooth I see from the datasheets for both products that yes the CC max data rate is half of the CC Do you believe we could ever get an Ubertooth like sniffer based off the CC to work Could you please elaborate on the main issue we might run up against concerning the data rate difference Steps to reproduce Capture PCAP packets using ubertoothbtle command analyze PCAP packets through Wireshark Expected behaviour Tell us what you expect should happen Actual behaviour Tell us what happens instead Braodcast packet are shown correclty but when data packet comes i am getting a PPI malformed packet as shown in image Version information Operating system

RetrievedBluetoothMACAddress and show them in Wireshark Actual behaviour Wireshark opens but does nothing It doesnt have any traffic Either doesnt follow the connection or nothing is being transmitted I think the static RetrievedBluetoothMACAddress retrieved from ubertoothscan cannot be used to follow the packets in ubertoothbtle f How can I find the advertising Bluetooth MAC Address of the device Does the RetrievedBluetoothMACAddress of my iPhone change as soon as I start using ubertoothbtle If so how can I find and trackfollow the new iPhone MAC Address Version information Operating system

Source are different Insert any commandline or build output here Steps to reproduce Build the R version for ARM Install the tools an lib Upload the new firmware with the r argument Expected behaviour When the DFU finish the tool will detach from this mode and the dongle will reconnect to the system normally Actual behaviour The command always success to flash and detach but half the time the dongle is in an unknown state and dont reconnect to the system The only way to be able to use it after is to unplug and plug it in This isnt an accepted behaviour when we dont have direct access to the device to be unplugged or power cycled This is the LED state when that happen RSTLED ONgreen USBLED ONred V LED ONgreen TXLED OFF RXLED OFF USRLED OFF Version information Operating system Debian

ubertoothutil command line utility for Ubertooth Zero and Ubertooth One Dear sir Problems Suppose that i have two ubertooth devices The command parameter U shows that we should to set the index of ubertooth device when using ubertoothbtle U command But how do i know the index of the corresponding devices when using the command and how can I use two ubertooth devices to work simultaneously Version information Linux Ubuntu LTS libubertooth R libbtbb R Firmware version R API Many thanks and looking forward to hearing from you Steps to reproduce Run the command ubertoothbtle s aacc Check BLE scanner app for address I use nrf BLE scanner app Expected behaviour Ubertooth should transmit fake advertisement packets with the advertising address aacc that are detected on the app Actual behaviour Dont see any advertisements from that address I see the TXLED is continuously blinking feebly which makes me believe it is hitting the letransmit function in the code But no advertisements are detected in the app Version information Operating system MacOS Ubertooth tools version ubertoothrx V libubertooth R libbtbb R libbtbb version libbtbb R Ubertooth firmware version ubertoothutil v
