 A simple Chinese story for autor What do you say of a man who is loved by all the people of his neighborhood We may not for that accord our approval of him And what do you say of him who is hated by all the people of his neighborhood We may not for that conclude that he is bad It is better than either of these cases that the good in the neighborhood love him and the bad hate him Sorry for my poor English but a Chinese old saying is I really hope the author can think more about himself his wonderful project and the person who support him but not the people who just want to judge others I recently started a project months ago using actixweb to write back end server I port the old javaSpring based to rustactixweb based actixweb is great and I learnt a lot I didnt do any optimization and find out actixweb is very fast and write less It is sad to hear you fed up with the project During the development of my project I think I want to made some improvement of actixweb as return Anyway Thanks You are a great person man I did a pull request and interaction with you was perfect you were very helpful Also this library was way better then anything in rust except maybe compilation times Big guys are mad because you beat them in benchmarks and your unsafe code doesnt cause any relevant bugs They are toxic because you are good man this is actually a compliment to you I understand that it feels bad to get attacked by a bunch of jealous losers But I am sure there are many people understand and support you I saw the blog post from the security guy and It is pathetic you really shouldnt let losers like him effect you Reddit people are just a bunch of circle jerking losers You shouldnt take them seriously Also fk you to all the undefined behavior fetishists and losers who caused this I learned about this story on the forum I don t know all the details so I won t say too much Also I am not a supporter of the Rust language and do not do web development But the fact that because of the pressure of people you felt so bad that you deleted your work sadly Remember that YOU are the developer of your brainchild Remember that YOU decide how YOUR program works and how not to work Remember that there are people who just TROLES and try not to pay attention to them Remember that YOU are a programmer and are not required to obey any fictitious philosophies of the language The language has a tool you use and a point Whoever disagrees is free to fork not philosophize Yes and just humanly hold on to each other Sometimes in life there are moments in which we become weak and any words or events can break us I hope after a while you will come to your senses and continue to do what you love It s not necessary to restore everything You can do it for yourself But remember in addition to even perhaps smart but evil people there are others Unlike those who advised you verbally how to do you did In general I do not know you I did not use your work But it seems to me to be just a kind word to support you Do not worry come to your senses and let everything be fine with you Good luck and good mood of ideas and inspiration Till Ignore the trolls PS Sorry for my English I am from Russia and do not speak English well Hi fafhrd I would love to use your actixweb framework please publish Actixweb is the only one that is production ready framework for me Please publish it I appreciate your work a lot Thanks fafhrd Dont listen to the BS from the supposedly most friendly community ever Rust I review many frameworks and Actix is head and shoulders above anything else Ive seen in the rust community including tide which is being built by supposed community expert numerous contributors and for months its still not ready for production Many people have used Actix in production with spectacular results I wouldnt listen to the comments of several haters If they werent haters they would roll up their sleeves and contribute to making it even better Personally I dont want to see the framework go but do whats best for your own mental state Even if its one person that loves and uses the project youve succeeded Change starts with impacting one life and I believe open source is the same There are several advocates of Actix here and well continue to defend it Dont be disheartened and discouraged you cant save everyone but you can impact influence encourage and support many as youve done Keep going dont look back I guarantee you as I have many will continue to fall in love with Actix your work and effort Thats the reward and not the voice of a bunch of irritable critics that have not and probably cannot do better Second paragraph is identical for me I have heard pretty much everything by now From I am the CTO of this and that and I DEMAND you to fix my shit for free to I am going to stop using your stuff unless this and that to Fuck you you son of a whore for doing this and that which I disagree with Its like people need to shut the fuck up and stop acting like parasites Pretty much of GitHub is just parasite people demanding free consulting free advice free debugging free bug fixing etc And nobody knows how to read not even the README file in front of their faces The mentality of GitHub is I use your stuff therefore I demand you to pitch why I should use it Its basically like people think they make you a favor by using your stuff for free I took a minute shit once and received identical GitHub issue reports that both were in the FAQ they dont even care to spend one second thinking for themselves And people keep reporting issues which are self explanatory in plain text My advice is refuse to take any shit unless you get paid hard golden cash If anyone gives you the slightest shit block them ban them delete their issues and go about your day They are worthless parasites thats exactly what they are Fuck this whole community bullshit and communist freeforallbutnobodypaysyetinfinitefreestuff mentality People of GitHub dont understand how intellectual property laws work some even believe whole heartedly that they own open source projects and that the projects belong to the community Thats mindblowingly ignorant and incredibly worrying I say fuck all parasites and do what makes you happy Show no mercy You do you I do not know the back story here just another aspiring Rustacean from the Python world and minorleague open source maintainer This is the first time I have ever seen this happen and it saddens me all around So I would like to suggest another possibility of governance for this repo used by Debian for many years and recently chosen by the Python community as its postBDFL governance method as well which can take the pressure off of any single maintainer Ranked Choice voting aka the Condorcet method With it decisions can be made in an uncontroversial and graceful manner by N maintainers Its absolutely fair you have my support You are the man who created it and if you so desire you should be the one who kills it for good You dont have to be sorry you dont owe anyone anything especially in the open source community I hope people will start thinking with their heads before writing I know better comments If you think you can do better then hit that fork button and show it Otherwise its nothing more than just showing off I wish you the best Go ahead get the world
