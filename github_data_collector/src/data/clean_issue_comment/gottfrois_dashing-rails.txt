I had some problems with sidekiq needing a newer redis than dashing was using So I updated the gem used and it seems to work The same errors occurred before and after the update so I think it should work fine I tried using it with Rails rc and it didnt work Any chance you guys can update it to use Redis Bundler could not find compatible versions for gem redis In Gemfile redis dashingrails was resolved to which depends on redis Hello I try to run dashingrails on rails ive tried on as well After following all steps I go to localhost dashingdashboards and it loads forever After browser exit or reload I get this error ConnectionPoolPoolShuttingDownError connectionpool libconnectionpooltimedstackrb line ruby timeout optionsfetch timeout timeout deadline ConnectionPoolmonotonictime timeout

required binrails in main Has someone been through this issue I cant manage to make it work even on a brand new rails project Using Rails with dashingrails engine and puma as server the following exception is raised When instances of the dashboard is running in different brownser when one of them is closed it close the global connection and the exception is raised rufusscheduler intercepted an error web job web RufusSchedulerEveryJob s web error web web ConnectionPoolPoolShuttingDownError web ConnectionPoolPoolShuttingDownError With the original dashing it is possible to customise the size layout of the widget grid via the applicationcoffee script that is generated for each dashboard I tried lifting the version out of the dashingrails gem and replicating within my application assets with the new values which worked so long as configassetsdebug true is present within the environment config which obviously means it doesnt work in production In production the updated code is present within applicationjs but does not get executed instead the code from the gem is executed Any suggestions appreciated as Ive reached the limit of my abilities at this point After sometime this error start rising up again and again Following is the trace Im getting Completed Internal Server Error in ms ActiveRecord ms ActionControllerLiveClientDisconnected client disconnected

blank space between widgets If I specify the widgets as follows widget widget widget widget widget widget widget widget widget widget widget widget widget widget It will be automatically convert into this widget widget widget widget widget widget widget widget widget widget widget widget widget widget I mean to say that the widgets will get repositioned and push themselves so that no space is remaining in between I dont want this feature How to remove it Thanks in advance I installed dashingrails as per the instructions But instead of the widget layout application layout is rendering It seems as if connectionpool fails to release redis subscriptions Once Timeout is raised it every subsequent try will result in Timeout as well Steps to reproduce Set redis pool size to something low like to Open a dashboard and spam refresh Refresh and you wont see any widgets populated
