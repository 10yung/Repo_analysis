I followed the tutorial that can be found here to use this lib on my Android app I was able to include the lib successfully but I perceived that the release apk and aab size increased a lot mb Is there any trick to greatly reduce this Thank you I have created a Cordova plugin around the Spectrum library and while it works well for compressing a source file from an iOS device to a nice small jpg I am noticing that each processing of an image ends up leaking a lot of memory and when I profile the leak in Instruments I see that it is from thousands of array mallocs coming from the constructor of Scanlines but I cant really make any more sense of why these are being retained after the compressionencode operation successfully completes Any ideas here I am using objectivec for my plugin to call the Spectrum library img width altScreen Shot at PM src img width altScreen Shot at PM src img width altScreen Shot at PM src In my android app I use sprectrum to do lossless croppingrotation of jpg images I have observed that rotating a jpg image without cropping the file size changes its file size and rotation is done throuh image manipulation I would have expected that only the exiforientation flag is updated If i rotate an image with exiforientation degrees by degrees i expect the same image but with orientation degrees The current code does an imagerotation transformation and result exiforientation is always Although rotating changes imagefile size is it still lossless I am using this code public void cropInputStream inputStream OutputStream outputStream

almost done with an MVP that doesnt include translations and versioning features which means theres feature parity with your websites current usage of Docusaurus Docusaurus brings about many improvements Clientside rendering with prerendering site renders without JavaScript More flexible appearance Customizable layouts CSS modules etc Embeddable interactive React components within markdown via MDX I will be your POC in helping you throughout the migration process Let me know what you think cc yangshun endiliey The following code causes spectrum to crash if the gps timestamp

something that is in the pipeline The idea is to use ExifInterface here How about to update the documentation about the usage of appbundle If I use already distribute my app with appbundle do I need to use ABI split
