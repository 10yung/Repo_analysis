I modified the project a little bit to run examplers with cargo test diff diff git asrcexamplers bsrcexamplers index ff fbbcaaeb asrcexamplers bsrcexamplers stands for an erased unused lambda or let variable a b c inlines all occurrences of a by the closed term b mod term mod net use term pub fn example let example termfromstringb diff git asrcmainrs bsrcmainrs index d a cda asrcmainrs bsrcmainrs use clapArg App mod term mod net mod extra mod example use term use extra fn main ioResult Ok mod tests use superexample test fn testexample example After that I did cargo test and it gives me thread teststestexample has overflowed its stack error test failed to rerun pass bin sic Is examplers a working example Is there an implementation of amb agent for representing nondeterministic computations The readme mentions Ive read the blogpost and the linked paper but were not able to find specifics about this The reason I ask is because Id love to visualize programs in the combinator form to build intuition Can you clarify I think it will grate if there is a list of benchmarks to show the advantage compared to existing languagesplatforms such as SolidityEVM Haskell etc For example some parallel example that cannot be easily implemented in blockchain because it is hard to eliminate nondeterministic behaviour caused by data race The paper is very good but simple examples can be more intuitive and be more convincible Some simple examples will be easier for me to convince my boss If anyone has a suggestion for a better name since Abstract Calculus seems to be impopular please let me know Symmetric Lambda Calculus since it is isomorphic to Symmetric Interaction Combinators may be a good option Thoughts
