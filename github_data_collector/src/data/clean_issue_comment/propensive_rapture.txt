IntelliJ version sbt version Scala version Hi i cloned the project and tried to import the SBT and i got this error not found value java SupportJVMi I also tried to do the sbt publishLocal and this

find the correct way to do it here is a minimalist sample this code worked with rapture my master branch scala Jsonparsestringas Person but fails with rapture branch rapture Error not enough arguments

Jsonparsestringas Person I found the blog post about Raptures i n library and am really interested in trying it out but had a heck of a time trying to find where it is I think if you just pointed out either in the blog post or in the readme which artifacts you need for different rapture libraries it would be a big help Cheers Josh I hit an issue in a production system with this string using the jawn backend scala jsondescription javautilNoSuchElementException Noneget at scalaNonegetOptionscala at scalaNonegetOptionscala elided scala getBytes res Array Byte Array Some further testing was done and this issue was definitely jawn related Looks like it works on Json s and Argonaut but seems to fail for the others Jackson actually gives a useful exception which says that the control character needs to be escaped with a backslash Jackson is right according to RFC this should be escaped Rapture should take a conservative stance on what is allowed inside an interpolated string So making that a compile error would be better Xml module is not able to dispatch a valid Extractor from nested structures when the extraction of some middle elements has been customized The behavior has been observed starting from nested structures greater than three elements See the next code snippet as an example of this issue scala object RaptureXmlOk import rapturexml case class Foobar Bar case class

it doesnt compile When I add the following dependency compropensive rapture M I end up with rapturetest in my compile scope which pulls scalatest into my compile scope I have worked around it by excluding rapturetest explicitely
