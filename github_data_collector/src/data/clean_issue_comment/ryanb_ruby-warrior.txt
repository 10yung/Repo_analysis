For the first case I added an ifcase for whether the player has changed the template code in his profiles playerrb at all before running the game along with seperate functions for compairing the template file with the players file I also thought it to be a good idea to check in on the users input when trying to access or reset a profileor choose a difficulty level so i added a loop on the choose method of the uirb file asking for input again if the numerical input exceeds the number of options Additionally I added a reset function with which the player can reset a profile he wants I also added a r option in the parseoptions method for the user to choose which profile to reset I tried to call warriorbind from a method of a class that I defined but it only worked once When it got to turn two I got an error stating that I can only perform one action per turn eval in bind Only one action can be performed per turn RuntimeError I was playing level in the intermediate tower When I changed it so that it was calling warriorbind directly from playturn it worked The code is attached playerrbtxt Hi I am a university student and I have a project concerning contributing ruby so i am thinking about contributing for ruby warrior since i find it really fun to work on I know there hasnt been any commit for a while now but if anyone could point me to any useful way of contributing that would be great Currently if you win a level with s option you see Staying on current level Try to earn more points next time But points have nothing to do with it Can be confusing I wasnt able to run tests out of the box so I upgraded Rspec and started tracking my Gemfilelock I changed should to expect to quiet deprecation warnings from Rspec At first I did it by hand but then went looking for scripts perl p i e s sshould shouldnot expect to g find spec name rb perl p i e s eq g find spec name rb Please let me know what you would like to see done differently but please try to let me know about as much as you can think of up front or any contribution rules or guidelines you might have as early as possible so I can avoid lots of rounds of revisions Had a bad experience with that recently I didnt initially catch that the mdash was really two regular dasheshyphens If you want Ill format other inline code snippets too test file added to practice pushing to forked directory tigerroarubuntu rubywarrior Welcome to Ruby Warrior varlibgems gemsrubywarrior librubywarriorprofilerb in load incompatible marshal file format cant be read TypeError format version required given from varlibgems gemsrubywarrior librubywarriorprofilerb indecode from varlibgems gemsrubywarrior librubywarriorprofilerb in load from varlibgems gemsrubywarrior librubywarriorgamerb instart from varlibgems gemsrubywarrior librubywarriorrunnerrb in run from varlibgems gemsrubywarrior binrubywarrior intop required from usrlocalbinrubywarrior in load from usrlocalbinrubywarrior inmain Newbie here This is reproducible on a new ubuntu installation env that doesnt have the full ruby package installed yet To fix this do sudo aptget install rubyfull Corrected second level code example so player will attack sludge and them move Currently the code has the play just attack in an infinite loop and not move
