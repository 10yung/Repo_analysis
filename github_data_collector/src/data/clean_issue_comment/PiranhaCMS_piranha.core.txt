 I think it would be nice to tag different issues with version numbers to see if the issue is related to the issues others have Sometimes you can get some knowledge just reading the issues and maybe out of date Im using Piranha as were not dotnet core yet embedded in another application The preview feature in the manager works as expected in the debug environment but when deployed it displays a page at the initial size but wont resize In browser debugging there is an error ReferenceError is not defined in piranhaminjs which seems to suggest a lack of jquery In the debug environment the same page includes the larger piranhadevjs and doesnt give the error This project originally had Piranha but Ive been following a mvcweb example and I think Ive made the necessary changes There was a search in manager in version but not found in v when i tried to add it it not working Hi Amazing work guys lovely Still in the process of figuring out how it works and how may I use it for my own needs st question that popped up is how would I use this to store and retrieve structured data via API endpoints To use it as storage backend for mobile apps or so for instance nd question would be about multitenancy is it supported and how Thanks Lucian I am wanting to be able to retrieve archive posts by using query parameters and not just path parameters For example I would like to be able to query for a list of posts like this postpageyear tagnewtag page rather than having to say postpageyear tagnewtagpage Is this currently possible Hello When adding posts How can I add a dynamic table with data from my database Any idea I can do it in static pages but I dont know how to do in postcshtml Thats my future blog Great job anyway Thanks in advance Rodolfo Duarte how we can pin a post in main page I have created a custom module with a couple of blocks One block contains a SelectFieldT with an enumeration type which is defined in the same module Creating pages with blocks from that module works fine After creating a new version of the module I was unable to edit the pages because the generic type of the SelectField was stored including the assembly version in the database table PiranhaPageRevisions CLRType PiranhaExtendFieldsSelectField MySelectType MyModule Version Cultureneutral PublicKeyTokennull Is it possible to store the generic type of a SelectField without the version or is there a workaround available Since its almost I thought it would be a good time do improve and do some redesign of the project templates Please leave feedback on What you would like to be included in a good template What different types of templates you would like to see
