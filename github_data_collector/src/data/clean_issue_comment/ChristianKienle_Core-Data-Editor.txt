This PR is a first attempt at adding support for UUID attributes issue UUID types show up and are editable in the table view for an entity type UUID types show up and are editable in the managed object view what you see when you click on a toone association for a record selected in the upper table view Note that I bumped the deployment target to macOS since thats when the NSUUID type is first available After running the Editor for a few dozens of seconds even without doing anything in particular two system popups appear indicating that the application wants to have access to the users Contacts then another one appears requesting access to the users Calendar No explanation is given as to why this would be needed and this seems like a clear invasion of privacy Having basic respect for the users privacy instead entail to Not attempt to use users private data contacts calendar until the point they are actually needed Provide a proper written explanation as to why accessing these data is useful to the applications operations Sign the application with GateKeeper so at least if the application is found to be corrupted by the OS it can automatically revoke these authorizations Absent these requirements the application should not attempt to obtain userss data Cheers Laurent Sorting displayed object by column identifier Attributes that are NSUUID type are dropped from display because tableCellViewClassForAttributeTypecde does not handle them Im new to Core Data Editor It seems really helpful However the tutorial link no longer works Any chance to fix that link First off this is a great utility and a lifesaver when trying to debug Core Data issues thank you for making it As has been pointed out in column sorting seems broken in the latest release so I thought Id open a new issue about another problem with it Searching by column doesnt seem to work either it just gives a blank result maybe it isnt looking at the specified column Specifically Im trying to search for a substring in a string column I select the column name using the magnifying glass dropdown and start to type Whatever I type there are no results This worked fine with the version I had before updating to the latest release from the Releases page Now I consistently get no results Thanks again for a great tool looking forward to having this functionality restored soon File NSManagedObjectModelCDEAdditionsm line now it looks like this metadataForPersistentStoreOfTypeNSSQLiteStoreType and it cannot open XML based core data only the NSSQLiteStoreType It was metadataForPersistentStoreOfTypenil before the commit nil causes warning but also due to documentation If this value is nil Core Data determines which store class should be used to get or set the store files metadata by inspecting the file contents Sorting does not work When i change values in my simulator the core data editor doesnt update the tables I keep having to go back to the project browser screen and refresh the tables Is there a way to auto refresh on a change made Hello Probably I am doing something wrong but I cannot save changes to my database Neither edit nor add new objects I dont have any database validations in place I am using a master branch build I managed to open my database and edit entry values I cannot find the option to save the changes After clicking File Refresh state is reverted to the original one Clicking File Save only offers to create a new Core Data editor file Is there any way to save the manually applied changes so that they will be reflected in my simulator app Clicking the settings icon left of csv button raises the error mentioned in Maybe it is some system file access issue I will be grateful for any tips
