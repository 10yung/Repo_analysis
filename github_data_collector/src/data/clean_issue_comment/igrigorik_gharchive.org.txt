header cc igrigorik api documentation but I cant find any StarEvent in the json file Adds DevStats project that uses GH archives as the main data source Hi I have a question Should all commits stored in git repository be present on the GitHub archives I have a local clone of torvaldslinux repository Im counting all distinct commits SHAs git log prettyformatH since until uniq wc l It gives commits for one year period When analyzing all torvaldslinux commits stored in GitHub archives I can only get distinct SHAs Maybe the problem is that Linux GitHub repository is only a mirror and most commits are not stored in GitHub API then Hello Thanks for this awesome project first Ive noticed that some extracted JSON files only have a single line for hour of log Here are the files for for examples This seems like a bug to me Ever thought about adding GitLab support to the project Maybe forking the projectcreating gitlabarchiveorg Good day I have an issue linked to your open data which is available through Google BigQuery Why is there so huge recession of new GitHub new repositories since November of Whats the reason of it I guess its the new methodology of gathering repositories or not support of new appearing repositories There is the query which gathering all repositories by years WITH t AS SELECT reponame FROM bigquerypublicdatagithubreposcommits UNNESTdifference as diff

NOT IN SELECT reponame FROM t Appreciate for your help Hi Can very well be that the event is simply not reported from where gharchive takes the events but I noticed that PullRequestReviewCommentEvents are collected but not PullRequestReviewEvent As a consequence reviews without extra comments are absolutely invisible in the archive and reviews with comments leave only implicit traces because of the logged comment creation Is there a way to improve the situation Since I found another issue regarding fork events duplicates I decided to open this nonspecific issue on Duplicate Events Then we can report any duplicate we face here for the record Hello Im attempting to understand why some issues show up with an open state whereas they are closed on GitHub For example in the image below Like this As far as I understand it seems that when certain issues are closed by a PullRequest merge using the keywords in the body the issue is closed on the GitHub side but no close IssueEvent is created so to GH Archive that issue remains in its open state However there does seem to be a close record for some issues that were closed by a PullRequest as shown below like this so that wouldnt entirely make sense Would you be able to shed any light on this as Im quite confused Thank You
