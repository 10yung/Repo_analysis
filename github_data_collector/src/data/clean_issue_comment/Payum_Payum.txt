 Todo Fix all warnings X Fix Unsilenced deprecation notices Hi This fixes few deprecation notice that make TravisCi fail Meanwhile could you please merge please BR My software used an old homemade Paypal implementation which allowed payments in both Express Checkout mode and with the Website Payment button with IPN I am reimplementing it all from the scratch using Payum because I need to support other X payment gateways but first I need to seamlessly restore Paypal for existing customers and their current configs Express Checkout is not a problem but I did not understand how I can restore what Website Payment Standard did The main problem is that WPS could only use the merchants email address which I already have and not the api keys I would not have to contact dozens of customers and explain how they should recover the api keys from Paypal and save them into my software but Id gladly avoid all this unless absolutely necessary It seems to me that Payum does not support WPS and I will have to write a specific gateway Basically it should just render a form with hidden fields business amount etc and a submit button to paypalcomcgibinwebscr then catch the IPN validate and postback It can be done A bug in CreateChargeActionphp namespace Payum Stripe Action Api Solved by In line replace chargetoAttay by chargetoArray I want to submit my form with caredit card details but when i submit the form it redirect me to another form with credit card fields How can i use my form and paypal to process submited data and redirect me to the doneAction And i have second question I try this from payum documentation that gateway config has fields that i dont know what values to pass These fields are partner and vendor If I should provide more information to reproduce the issue please write me Thank you in advance Regards Ivan Atanasov Gateway config payum gateways paypalprocheckoutcreditcard factory paypalprocheckout username mysandboxaccountbusinessexamplecom password password partner EDIT ME vendor EDIT ME tender C sandbox true My prepare method look like public function prepare request formhandleRequest request if formisSubmitted data formgetData storage thisgetPayumgetStorage PaymentDetailsclass payment storagecreate payment ACCT new SensitiveValue data acct payment CVV new SensitiveValue data cvv payment EXPDATE new SensitiveValue data expdate format my payment AMT numberformat data amt Amount payment CURRENCY data currency storageupdatepayment captureToken thisgetPayumgetTokenFactorycreateCaptureToken paypalprocheckoutcreditcard payment iapaymentpaypaldone return thisredirect captureTokengetTargetUrl I try add to config payum evens extension payumextensioneventdispatcher class Payum Core Bridge Symfony Extension EventDispatcherExtension arguments eventdispatcher public true tags name payumextension all true prepend false get error Argument passed to Payum Core GatewayaddExtension must implement interface Payum Core Extension ExtensionInterface string given called in applicationvendorpayumcorePayumCoreCoreGatewayFactoryphp on line Allows to set PayPal configuration by handling an array to the factory instead of relying on configpath to parse PayPals skdconfigini Also updates composerjson paypal sdk version to match PayPal Rest composer requirements Tests are fine locally although Travis reports them as failing or incomplete
