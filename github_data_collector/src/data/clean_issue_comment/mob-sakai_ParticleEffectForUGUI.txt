 the top picture is editor mode the picture bellow show in running mode unity version f Can you add support GravityModifier Some people have been setting the z scale to in my project for some reason so I found out that makes the particles just completely vanish I would consider this a bug since other UI elements still render when the z scale is Image Text etc Seems like the d rendering should just ignore the z scale As the BakeMesh API changes the mesh of the canvasRenderer the canvas contains the UIParticle component will rebuild every frame My experiment I compare ParticleSystems and UIParticles the FPS are both about But when I create other Texts and Images in the same canvas the ParticleSystems remains FPS the UIParticles decreases to FPS The reason is the canvas will reorder the elements and batch their meshes before rendering It seems if the UI is complicated we need to create specific canvas for the UIParticles component to seperate with other components When I try to play a particle system with trails I get this error It uses a combination of noise and velocity over lifetime to move the particle for which rendering is disabled Only the trials should get rendered Im using a mobile particle material on this element for better performance Im fine with the particle not supporting masking I am editing the particle system inside a prefab Hey first of all this looks really promising so thanks for sharing it This is not an issue iI would like to know if you did any performance test on devices mobile perhaps and see if its to heavy or not Thanks again In gamma spacethere is no issue but when change color space from gamma to Linear The UIParticle become darker than normal same params Created a particle system in my canvas and attached UIParticle to it The particles appear perfectly in scene view but turn completely black in game view Anyone else facing this too Particle not use shape mode is billboard I Rotate the rect to some paticle the render will no work i try this to solve if mParticleSystemparticleCount meshSetVerticessVertices Recalculate the bounds meshRecalculateBounds It is working on editor smoothly but not quite sure how to use it in my builds When I try this on Android it crashed with this error log E Unity NullReferenceException Object reference not set to an instance of an object E Unity at CoffeeUIExtensionsUIParticleUpdateMesh x in E Unity at CoffeeUIExtensionsUIParticleUpdateMeshes x in E Unity at UnityEngineCanvasWillRenderCanvasesInvoke x in E Unity CoffeeUIExtensionsUIParticleUpdateMesh E Unity CoffeeUIExtensionsUIParticleUpdateMeshes E Unity UnityEngineWillRenderCanvasesInvoke E Unity E Unity Filename currently not available on il cpp Line
