 Converts this tree into the string representation Time On Space Olog n override def toString String if isEmpty else left value right hi I learned a lot from your code thanks IN the Tree data structure the toString method is not visual friendly why not just paint a tree use diagram When the pattern is larger than the string the code returns a Ive also fixed which was caused when hss was assigned a negative value matchRabinKarp matchRabinKarp aaaaaa aaaaaa matchRabinKarp beebop beebop until by map n matchRabinKarp cn cn Vector x used a pattern matching structure to verify the elements are not invalid x indented the first function to make the whole thing more readable Checking the isPalindrome The classic algorithms are expressed as an characterbycharacter algorithm and is fine Is oriented to a lowlevel view of algoritms and datastructures Another classic manner to view patternrecognition algoritms in strings is to express it by regular expression isPalindrome by anchored recursive regular expression containsPalindrone by recursive regular expression supposing only letters wR w It is a good view from a first abstraction layer of strings And is also classic The best layer for an algorithm perhaps is where the simplest and faster algorithm is expressed It is also classic In the isPalindrome an intermediary layer of abstraction the ideal to express the same algorithm is by use the stringreverse method to compare strings StringslongestCommonSubstring gives incorrect results if the first string is shorter than the second one because it only scans until the length of the first string object Strings def longestCommonSubstringa String b String String def loopm Map Int Int Int bestIndices List Int i Int j Int String if i alength bsubstringbestIndices mbestIndices bestIndices bestIndices Doesnt work scala val lcs StringslongestCommonSubstringthe price Is right right on lcs String ri Works correctly scala val lcs StringslongestCommonSubstringright on the price is right lcs String right
