It would be really awesome if we could add a feature to log if the computer is locked or not Or we could choose to not logging the windwsapplication while the computer is locked out Hi thanks for the awesome app Just wondering if it is possible for the app to track unused apps as opposed to apps that are being used currently Thanks Im trying to run thyme in Ubuntu terminal thymelinux track o thymeout xdpyinfo failed with error exit status Try running xdpyinfo grep dimensions to diagnose xdpyinfo failed with error exit status Try running xdpyinfo grep dimensions to diagnose xdpyinfo grep dimensions xdpyinfo unable to open display Since there are distributions that dont package wmctrl e g Solus a solution could be to run Thyme within a docker container Ive created a PoC at and if theres interest at all Ill create a proper PR It would be nice to see when the workstation has locked itself instead of the last used app being active It looks like thyme show w stats uses Google Charts to visualize the data If Im not mistaken this means the data is sent to Google right Id rather not have my window titles land there I havent debugged this further but a quick trial run indicates that thyme considers all windows on desktop to be visible The i window manager has a special buffer it calls scratchpad which contains windows which are not on any desktop But wmctrl l reports them as being on desktop so they are always visible As a secondary point when using multiple windows in a tabbed container it seems like arguably only the active one should be considered visible but this seems much harder to implement Hi Ive been trying to install Thyme on Ubuntu but the command go get u githubcomsourcegraphthymecmdthyme doesnt seem to work it doesnt output anything I installed Go version via sudo aptget install golanggo golanggotools and go env output is GOARCHamd GOBIN GOEXE GOHOSTARCHamd GOHOSTOSlinux GOOSlinux GOPATHhomefelipego GORACE GOROOTusrlibgo GOTOOLDIRusrlibgo pkgtoollinuxamd GCCGOgccgo CCgcc GOGCCFLAGSfPIC m pthread fmessagelength fdebugprefixmaptmpgobuild tmpgobuild gnorecordgccswitches CXXg CGOENABLED PKGCONFIGpkgconfig CGOCFLAGSg O CGOCPPFLAGS CGOCXXFLAGSg O CGOFFLAGSg O CGOLDFLAGSg O Any ideas on what might be wrong and how to fix it Many thanks This is likely an iTerm issue and not a Thyme issue but Im putting it here in case other people have the same problem Ive just upgraded iTerm to Build beta and I am getting the you didnt do the thing in thyme dep error Before this upgrade it worked fine and thyme continues to work in Terminal just fine Not sure if theres anything to be done on your folks end but there it is Thanks Is there support for wayland in this
