I find Hpatches datasets alreadybut Brown datasets is hard to findWhere I can download this datasets Thanks Hi your work is great and I was inspired but I have a little problem when I read the paperWhy is gkk the smallest in the third term of the loss functionShouldnt the inner product between the features of the matching block be the largest What is the Browndataset URL Since I have not been in touch with matlab to realize deep learning please tell me the specific operation instruction of this project thanks there are some statements needed to make sure while the weighting and bias are fixed at and respectfully the mean and var in it should be learned in the training process Right the author state in the paper that the bn layer before DIF is not learned Then it is the mean and var are calculated every time for different input I am really interesting in your L NET work and want to reproduce the training process Is the training code available or can I get access to it Thanks a lot Hi yuruntian I read your paper and found it very interseting Im trying to reproduce your results using tensorflow specificallyIm trying to take the model trained on HPatcheswith augmentation and test it on Brown dataset I ported the weights from matconvnet into tensorflowand followed the exact architecture The tensorflow descriptor works quite well for feature matching tasks so Im guessing I plugged in the weights correctly I also followed the Brown evaluation method and report FPN recall in this case however Im getting quite different results FPN recall on libertyvs you reported in the paper So I guess I must be doing something bad in the evaluation code Can you share or point me to the evaluation code you were using Also can you elaborate more on how you measured yourself on brown dataset patch size special tweaks you had to do etc Thanks Guy
