Hey beizhedenglong Thanks for creating such a beautiful charting library Im looking to convert open source libs into SaaS APIs as part of my work with saasifysh and thought roughcharts would be a great fit For example Id like to create an API endpoint to render charts like called with a JSON payload that represents your React usage in a reactfromjson format json data name A value name B value height children type XAxis dataKey name type YAxis type LineSeries dataKey value Wed love to offer a ratelimited API and reserve most of the profits for you As an example weve also worked on converting sindresorhus imagemin and minimaxirs stylecloud to APIs Looking forward to hearing your thoughts Would also be happy to jump on a quick call to discuss Love the project Is there an existing way to make a Area chart such as this one If I have data to plot to a line graph with a narrow range ie temperature data I can not find a way to change the lowest value on the Y Axis from So in my case I end up with a flat line of values at the top of the graph In the source useChartContext code I see references to the props userXScaleuserYScale but it appears to take as the bottom range regardless of what is supplied if userYScale userYScalerange contentHeight If this feature exists it should be documented All of the storybook pages and examples you show in the repo show as the bottom bound of the Y Axis If this feature does not exist please allow a way pass a preferred yAxis start value into the ChartContext With a static set of data the user could trivially determine a suitable bottom value and pass it in Perhaps fitting the animated style of the project a squiggly break could be used to show the graphs distortion from
