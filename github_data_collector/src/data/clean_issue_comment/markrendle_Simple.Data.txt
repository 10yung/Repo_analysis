URL Screenshot img width altimage src Can we take this to mean that the project is no longer being maintained I have an aspnet mvc project which uses different database types depending on which one the user select MSSQL MySQL Oracle The project follows an AdapterRepository pattern for its code You can see the source code here if it helps The problem is in order for me to use both MSSQL and MySQL I have added a reference to both those nugets But now when trying to get data the DatabaseOpenConnection method throws this exception Multiple ADO Providers found specify provider name or remove unwanted assemblies How can I specify a specific ADO Provider at runtime I didnt find any methods or constructors on the Database Object itself The code in question public class MySQLData IDataContext private string connectionString private Database Database public MySQLDatastring connectionString thisconnectionString connectionString thisDatabase DatabaseOpenConnectionconnectionString IMenuRepo IDataContextMenu var menuRepo new MenuRepo return menuRepo Thanks Pete I am unable to use NOLOCK on the table using Simpledata this is required as the table is getting constantly getting insertedupdated or read Any help is appreciated I am using FindAll to select the rows Hello I have just started to use SimpleData but i cant make it works When I do a connection to my db and then var db DatabaseOpenConnection User obj new User var result dbUserInsertobj result is a type of InserAwaitable and not User type Also there is no new row in my DB Did i forget to do something what should i do with this InsertAwaitable When we have database with tables like ProcesAndOperationProcesses dboProcesses and we want take records from ProcesAndOperationProcesses with order by ProcesAndOperationProcessesId desc we will catch error It will be caused by the sql query select ProcesAndOperationProcessesId ProcesAndOperationProcessesComments from ProcesAndOperationProcesses order by dboProcessesId desc Problem is in method GetName it takes only table name Processes without database schema This fix is working for me The code on the repository is labeled on the main branch in the v branch but for the Nuget package We have found a bug that exists on the Nuget package but are unable to track it down in the code because the versions are mismatched Thanks I love Simple Data and I hope it doesnt die I am curious about something I am playing with dynamic objects and not using models If I update a table like this dbMytableUpdateByIdformRow Sometimes there are items in the data object formRow that are missing from the table Only a couple at the most I can remove these like this formRowRemoveKeyName But is there any point SimpleData seems to be able to handle the mismatches Is it good practice to remove them I would assume that I should only ever include cols that are being updated But is it really necessary Needed to be able to change the timeout on SQL Bulk Copies This is a correction to issue Issue Bulk Insert does not respect identity insert option which I generated I am little confused since the Nuget version of this code is and this one is but here it is The best way to explain this is with code The following works I can insert a value into an identity column using var scope new TransactionScopeTransactionScopeOptionRequired TimeSpanFromSeconds foreachvar item in results SimpleDataDatabase OpenConnectiondestionationDBConnectionString WithOptionsnew SimpleDataAdoAdoOptionscommandTimeout identityInsert true thisdestinationTableName Insertitem scopeComplete This does not The table puts in the identity value using var scope new TransactionScopeTransactionScopeOptionRequired TimeSpanFromSeconds SimpleDataDatabase OpenConnectiondestionationDBConnectionString WithOptionsnew SimpleDataAdoAdoOptionscommandTimeout identityInsert true thisdestinationTableName Insertresults scopeComplete I will try and examine the code and see if it can be fixed easily
