Often I get already url encoded urls And If I use them in browser all work as expected But CocoaRestClient encode them again and server did not accept this May be its better to do Double Encoding of Query Parameters or simply add button to allow user to decode url before send Example A UI update to support macOS Mojaves dark mode would be appreciated It would help keep CocoaRestClient uptodate with the Macs evolving look and feel When trying to export response File Export Response the application shows a message Unable to save response The folder doesn t exist However I am trying to save into the Downloads folder which by all means does exist Request password are saved in cleartext in configuration files LibraryApplicationSupportCocoaRestClientCocoaRestClientsavedRequests Please use the keychain instead At least display a warning near the corresponding input field When a space character is used in query parameter value and query is saved and executed later it is sending Actually it is encoding two times first to and then later storing it is and then doing second encoding to When inputting double quotes in the body editor they are formatted to a different double quote character eg display gets formatted to display As a result I find I have to create my body text in VS Code and then paste it into the body section The JSON parser we are using on our backend fails and gives us this error message Unexpected character S code The first time I launched the application and ran a request it somehow picked up a auth credential from my keychain which I found really nifty However it was an old item with the wrong credentials so it was making requests under the wrong user I couldnt find any way to remove this connection so I removed the keychain item it was incorrect anyway after all Now the application neither uses this credential nor is it asking me for a new one It also will not find and use a new item I created manually with the correct user and address Now the only way to authenticate is to use the Auth tab each time manually filling out my credentials Bonus issue when it was using the keychain item for authentication it ignored the manually entered credentials in the Auth tab I would think those credentials should supersede any global credentials it has picked up elsewhere It should be possible to undo deletion of saved requests I just deleted most of my saved requests because the focus was in the wrong place and I hit backspace a couple of times and right now its not possible to get them back Its no big deal but it would be nice if such an action wasnt fatally destructive in that way Common types include applicationxwwwformurlencoded applicationjson applicationxml Same for Accept Can be enhanced to generic headeraware autocomplete but I think Accept and ContentType are the headers that are most often set
