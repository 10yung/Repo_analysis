Steps to reproduce Open desktop Google Chrome wiht dev tools and turn on device format Try to move map Expected Map move by dragging Actual Map dont move by dragging Environment leaflet Bug not reproduced in Also I found reason of this problem pointer event turn off for any browser on webkit line in leafletsrcjs Steps to reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Create a map Add multiple large image overlays as layers In the example I used x MB jpeg Pan and zoom around Expected behavior The map should pan and zoom without lagging without the need to switch layers from the beginning Current behavior The map is lagging and slow This however can be fixed weird enough by switching back and forth once between layers In fact simply turning an overlay layer onoff also seems to be sufficient Environment Leaflet version Browser with version Chrome Official Build bit OSPlatform with version Linux Ubuntu Official Build bit Additional context I made a dirty fix in which I use JQuery to toggle a layer onoff in the beginning and for now this seems to do the trick Minimal example reproducing the issue Edit This doesnt seem to be an issue on Firefox bit on the same OS How to reproduce I create a function to refresh the map each seconds calling my getUnitLayers function setIntervalfunction getUnitLayers function getUnitLayers mapoff mapinvalidateSize ajax type POST contentType applicationjson processData true url rootUrl HomeGetUnitsFeatures cache false success function data if dataerrorMessage if unitLayer featurelist tbodyempty mapremoveLayerunitLayer legendremove unitLayer LgeoJSONdata onEachFeature onEachUnitFeature mapaddLayerunitLayer if laterControl laterControlremove laterControl Lcontrollayers baseGroup LABEL unitLayer addTomap else afterErrorOperationsdataerrorMessage What behaviour Im expecting and which behaviour Im seeing Cattura With Google Chrome and Edge the amount of memory occupied is stable but with Internet Explorer it grows quickly often over GB Expected behavior Why is so much memory allocated with Internet Explorer Environment Leaflet version Im using Browser Chrome Internet Explorer Edge OS Windows Hello Im very beginner in JS and also leaflet library I would like to if something existe to change how the zoom works Is there a class or feature that enable to change the tileSize on zoom Thank you As a result of using importing Marker as ES module and not importing Popup the function closePopup does not exist on the marker object This is a quick fix A better approach would be to make the popup register a move listener on the marker while its open And then close itself when the marker is moved Closes Steps to reproduce import the following packages import map from leafletsrcmap import icon from leafletsrclayermarkerIcon import Marker from leafletsrclayermarkerMarker import tileLayer from leafletsrclayertileTileLayer import leafletsrclayervectorRenderergetRenderer With those imports one can render a marker on the map but not drag it Expected behavior Clicking and dragging a marker works and does not crash Current behavior A crash occurs cause it assumes a certain member function is present MarkerDragjs Uncaught TypeError thismarkerclosePopup is not a function at NewClassonDragStart MarkerDragjs at NewClassfire Eventsjs at NewClassonMove Draggablejs at HTMLDocumenthandler DomEventjs Environment Leaflet version It would be better if the different classes would not depend on each other that much I know it has historical reasons but the whole idea of using ES import is to not import code one does not use The library would benefit from a cleaner separation of concernsdependency injection In that particular case couldnt the popup register a move listener on the marker itself and then close itself when this listener is called Are there any ES enabled specs I could not find any When all the specs are based on windowL then these kind of bug are hard to find Currently long press touch duration firing contextmenu event on touch devices is fixed to second It would be very useful to be able to set the duration of long press touch duration either by some touch interaction option like longTouchDuration or at least by some internal value in tape handler object like longTouchDuration that could be easily changed by LMapTapinclude Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe The Mapbox URL on the Quick Start page needs to be updated The documentation on the Mapbox ids cant be found on the Mapbox website Describe the solution youd like Use the Mapbox Styles instead Hi does not mention setContent as a method of Tooltip and I had to dig in the code to find it Its important as if you want to create a tooltip with options you need to then setContent to set the text
