After several days both containers not running Restarting in original sequence resolving the problem and all working great again three maybe five or more days Command docker container ls a shows Exited xx minutes ago I am a new fish of docker so I dont understand the way mentioned in the doc I deployed the image in the environment of docker in arukaswhich is a docker service provider but I have no right to access the vps host what should I do Thanks Hi I want to use the dockvpn behind a proxy I try to assign to to to But this is not working either I assign port through docker container or I modify the files run and serverconfig How can I do it update latest repo CIDdocker run d privileged p udp p tcp jpetazzoopenvpn docker run t i p volumesfrom CID jpetazzoopenvpn serveconfig Please run the OpenVPN container at least once in normal mode to generate the client configuration file Thank you Hello I just followed your instructions to setup vpn on digital ocean box but I am not able to connect to it I realise this may not be an issue of dockvpn but perheps you know a workaround Thanks anyway Hi there Ive been working on some improvements to dockvpn There is a new master helper script call runDockVPNsh It currently creates a volume only container as suggested in that containes the etcopenvpn configuration files so that they survive between runs In that directory is created an EasyRSA CA from the environment variables that you pass to it edit runDockVPNsh The configuration files are compatible with TunnelBlick NetworkManager Android and iPhone OpenVPN connect and anything else you can imagine Im sure It then starts up on the ports that you request and spits out the directory on the docker server where your config files are stored Those can either be rsyncd with the command in the README or using dockers exporting of volumes Currently broken is the autohosting of the VPN config file because I no longer create the server pem like previously It may need some cleaning up but it works on my amd and armel boxes as long as you are willing to rsync the ovpn config files down This after all is more of a security feature than a bug but it may be harder to get the file on ones phone This is my first fully functioning Docker project so thanks so much for a starting place Randall Mason
