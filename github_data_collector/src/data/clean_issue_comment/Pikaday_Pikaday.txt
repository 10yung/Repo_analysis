This is useful in case users dont want borderradius on their calendars I am using mozilla and ios mobile browser When I clicking it it will disappear I am using the latest version Please help thanks I was trying to use Pikaday without Momentjs as I use datefns generally However as I am using British format DateMonthYear but the parse function seems to be ignored regardless of the methods const startPoint addDaysnew Date STARTPOINT const finishCal new Pikaday field finish format DDMMYYYY parse dateString f consolelogdateString f return parsedateString toString date setFormatdate onSelect date finishvalue setFormatdate const setter setFinishedfinishCal const startCal new Pikaday field start format DDMMYYYY minDate startPoint parsedateString f consolelogparse dateString dateString is the result of toString method const parts dateStringsplit const day parseIntparts const month parseIntparts const year parseIntparts return new Dateyear month day toString date setFormatdate onSelect date startvalue setFormatdate finishdisabled false setterdate Not sure if I missing something fundamental or there is a bug I saw the implementation for events This is really cool only the scss file was not updated to make use of this feature Since I use the scss file to style the datepicker in our project Ive added eventcolor and eventbg as variables I notice there have been a few attempts at implementing a today selector button noe of which have ever been merged into master Is there any plan to introduce this feature I set min date and max date like this format YYYYMMDD defaultDate momentsubtract yearstoDate minDate momentsubtract yearstoDate maxDate momentsubtract yearstoDate firstDay Instead of showing real year range pickaday shows me first year range If I select any value from here it shows next time year range and so on strange incrementing ranges Specifying any year range or not specifying it all all dont matter results will be the same If I set ONLY max date and year range defaultDate momentsubtract yearstoDate yearRange minDate momentsubtract yearstoDate maxDate momentsubtract yearstoDate Then pickaday shows years correctly so this issue can be avoided but the thing stays the same when you only set minDate and maxDate year range breaks Issue when I select a date and then click a Filter LinkButton on postback it changes the date in the textbox to the min date How do I prevent this from happening Issue is it possible to get the date to return int he following format The way it is populating now it same issue with the month Code used below var picker new Pikaday field documentgetElementByIdtxtFilterStartDate firstday minDate new Date numberOfMonths format YYYYMMDD toStringdate format you should do formatting based on the passed format but we will just return YYYYMMDD for simplicity const day dategetDate const month dategetMonth const year dategetFullYear return yearmonthday parsedateString format dateString is the result of toString method const parts dateStringsplit const day parseIntparts const month parseIntparts const year parseIntparts return new Dateyear month day Bumps lodash from to details summaryCommitssummary ddfd b Bump to v
