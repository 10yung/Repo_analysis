Hi We are using FileHelpers to patch a multirecord file reading it processing the changes and writing the changes It works as smooth as possible however due the large amount of records the writing process takes a long time until all records are written and we may use the resulting file Is there anything we can do to expedite the writing process and not wait for until the buffer is completely flush Thanks Hello I would like to propose a new setting for fixedlength fields to control how an overflowing value is managed Basically currently the behavior is to discard characters at the end of the value I added a second option which is to throw an exception when this occurs as a way to ensure users can be warned if data was lost Of course this could be the foundation to other strategies for handling this case Regards FixedLengthRecordFixedModeAllowLessChars public class Customer FieldFixedLength public int CustId FieldFixedLength FieldTrimTrimModeBoth public string Name FieldFixedLength FieldConverterConverterKindDateMultiFormat ddMMyyyy MMyyyy public DateTime AddedDate public Address Adresses FixedLengthRecordFixedModeAllowLessChars public class Address FieldFixedLength public int AddId FieldFixedLength public string City FieldFixedLength public string Street FieldFixedLength public string Number What I should make into Attributes for this part of class array of Address class public Address Adresses Visual Studio Net Core getting the following error when debugging code to parse a csv file with rows Line Column Delimiter found after the last field TaxonomyGroup the file is wrong or you need to add a field to the record class I have checked the file and I dont see anything in column or anywhere else beyond the defined columns for that matter Here is the code Im testing with public static void Mainstring args var engine new FileHelperEngineEntity var result engineReadFileC Users me Desktop pfile csv foreach Entity subject in result ConsoleWriteLineSubject Info ConsoleWriteLinesubjectNPI subjectEntityTypeCode The error is thrown before the foreach loop is entered Ive checked my Entity Class and all columns are present Can someone help me understand whats going on here As I have read here and in the readme Dynamic ClassBuilder and CsvClassBuilder ClassBuilder is difficult to maintain and a rewrite in NET Core Standard as is would require to reference three NuGet packages There must be better ways to write record structures at runtime So I need to downgrade to something below and run full framework to use a dynamic ordering of columns Or is it something that will be brought back any time soon Hi Team Is there any way to write a file using Multi Record Engine I have used it for reading its works fine Similarly I would like to write back MergeTheChunks uses string comparison and not the comparer specified in class constructor That results in file that is not sorted Please note that correct comparison mechanism is used in WritePart I have a log file im reading that has the following format hostname username Jun Get im using space as the separator and treating the date as a string but it falls over as the datetime field has a space in it Any ideas how i can work with this Hello I would like to be able to read a CSV to a DataTable I do not know in advance the count and the name of the columns so I would like to be able to automatically generate a DataTable structure with column names based on file header The content to load is a Stream not a physical file I have tried to figure how to do this with FileHelpers last version with various methods CommonEngineCsvToDataTable CsvEngineCsvToDataTable FileHelperEngineReadStreamAsDT etc but nothing worked because these methods seems to be intended to work from physical files or the structure needs to be known in advance etc Last month I created a StackOverflow question to explain what kind of problems I encountered but I didnt received any answer Could you please help me Usually I use your library to load files to objects as the structure is known in advance and I really like it So if its possible to achieve something like this what I described previously with it Id be glad to use it Thank you very much I have a nullable type of date but I also require to add the date fromat FieldConvertertypeofNullableDateConverter public DateTime ItemNextAvailabilityDate But I also need to mark it with the format as in ddmmyyyy FieldConverterConverterKindDate ddMMMyyyy But still allow it to be nullable
