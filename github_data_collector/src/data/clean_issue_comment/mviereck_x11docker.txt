Hi Ive got a question and am misusing the issues on that hope you dont mind Atm Ive got a docker running a kodi headless for serving as centralized kodi to sync the library and to serve as main instance for yatse on a headless server So far so good What Im trying to achieve now is to have kodi running with suspended head like with xpra from a docker container started on system startup without the need to be logged in So it mainly is like I have it now Right now Im not able to get audio output and configuration of kodi is tricky as there is no UI but only config files and webui So if I would use x docker tested it with xpra I get sound and am able to attach and detach the head from localhost or via ssh That setup was a little unstable and xpra doesnt clean up nicely if quit port already in use I used your xpra via ssh example from the wiki So now my question What would the best way to realize such a setup Guess xpra or nxagent are the way to go or are there otherbetter solutions The server is able to provide gpu acceleration i so it would be nice to render the head in hardware What would a systemd unit would look like As my server has got a monitor now If that kind of setup would work I have the central kodi instance for maintenance starting on system startup just like the headless docker is now but with attacheable UI if I log in on the desktop am able to play audio on the server from a remote app like yatse without the need to be logged in and it would only need a xpra client for to have the UI on every PC via ssh Any tips on a setup like this would be awesome The current master version of x docker adds support for WSL on MS Windows runx has been updated for WSL support too runx ticket Please check out if it works as expected and report any issues here WSL does not run in my Windows VM so I cannot check it out myself Note In WSL x docker defaults to use the native linux docker within WSL If you want to use MobyVM dockerforwindows instead please add option mobyvm In WSL Cygwin and MSYS x docker defaults to MobyVM because native linux docker is not supported there I noticed on that xwayland does not support seamless mode Would it be possible to support this From a high level I notice that my normal wayland login launches Xwayland in a way that X apps have a seamless mode Id really love it if I can get some similar working with x docker Thanks for all your hard work on this project All in the title this repo is amazing and I was wondering if there is similar work done on running GUI applications in Windows containers that can be remoted into through VNC since image windows and up can run GUI apps I have successfully installed jksieznis xpraclient on my android device and I can connect to a x docker session which launches a xterm on my ubuntu server but i cannot access the xterm from the android device It looks like the client resolution is too high I have tried setting resolution using xrandr but it seems to be ignored How to get xterm visible on Android device I would have posed this question to jksiezni but heshe seems to be offline since Coming from I tried the following Allow VcXsrv windows xserver in Private and Public networks Start vcxsrv with xlaunch Multiple windows Display number Start no client Clipboard Disable access control winpty docker run it e DISPLAY alpineterm xterm works Stop vcxsrv Allow VcXsrv in Private networks only Start vxcsrv again with xlaunch winpty docker run it e DISPLAY alpineterm xterm does not work However x docker does not work with any of them Last I disabled the firewall everywhere Domain network Private network and Public network Now x docker works So it is strange that this problem did not happen earlier Although it might sound strange I think that this might have something to do with changing from wireless to ethernet recently I did change nothing more these last days Will have to investige further Coming from Sometimes docker fails to start with an error message that it tries to create a shared folder that already exists on host Error response from daemon error while creating mount source path mkdir hostmntc file exists This is mainly known from Docker on Windows It is a bug of Docker or MS Windows x docker cannot do anything about it Bug reports and workarounds here The most promising workaround seems to go into Docker settings and do Reset credentials under Shared Drives than restart Docker
