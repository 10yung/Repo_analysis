This crash happens irregular with some clients and is not reproducible There is some evidence that it is in connection with update grid after changingupdating the datasource maybe layoutcycle because when its happen the user did changes on the data which is bound to the grid Since this is not reproducible can you imagine of some place in code where the grid is refreshing where we could place a trycatch so that we can at least avoid crashing the app QvxWin Version bit NET Framework EtoWpfPlatform Copyright Thomas Flemming Root folder qvx data D QuoVadis QVXData deviceid cmdmanstatus Tracks

wrong here Thanks JohnB Expected Behavior Working code preview on MainFormetocs and similar files Actual Behavior A list of exceptions about double references is thrown No preview but red screen attached The application buildsruns fine It seems to be somehow related to the previewer Steps to Reproduce the Problem Start EtoForms project with default platforms gtk mac wpf Defaults to net standard Runs fine code preview works for etocs files in split window as expected Change to net standard reason is i wanted to use Serializable attributes Then code view doesnt work anymore with exceptions as in picture Version eto Extension Platforms main app platform independent Operating Systems windows VS eto extension installed I could create an add to this wonderful open source ide Expected Behavior Code builds without issue Actual Behavior Code fails to build with errors MicrosoftNETSdkFrameworkReferenceResolutiontargets NETSDK The FrameworkReference MicrosoftWindowsDesktopAppWindowsForms was not recognized MicrosoftNETSdkFrameworkReferenceResolutiontargets NETSDK The FrameworkReference MicrosoftWindowsDesktopApp was not recognized Steps to Reproduce the Problem This derives from trying to workaround issues and by manually editing the project files Changing the TargetFramework in the two project files one for the library one for the executable to dotnetcoreapp yields a fail to compile with the mentioned errors Changing Project SDK to MicrosoftNETSdkWindowsDesktop makes those errors go away but a new one appears this is building with Rider under Linux Mint with dotnet installed The imported project usrsharedotnetsdk SdksMicrosoftNETSdkWindowsDesktoptargetsMicrosoftWinFXprops was not found Confirm that the path in the Import declaration is correct and that the file exists on disk usrsharedotnetsdk SdksMicrosoftNETSdkWindowsDesktoptargetsMicrosoftNETSdkWindowsDesktopprops Up to now I think Windows doesnt suffer from this problem Supplying code that demonstrates the problem expedites a fix and a response Code that Demonstrates the Problem Ive attached a ZIP file corresponding to step above Please specify the version of Eto and all platforms this can be reproduced in Specifications Version ci Platforms NonWindows Operating Systems NonWindows nc modifiedzip Expected Behavior Project files are set to be NET Core applications Actual Behavior Project files are set to use the NET framework Steps to Reproduce the Problem Confirm the dotnet version installed dotnet version For the version installed do dotnet new i EtoFormsTemplates ci nugetsource dotnet new etoapp sln s m code wf OR dotnet new etoapp sln m code wf Review the resulting project files eg under Desktop for the notseparate case or under the platform

ci Platforms All Operating Systems All Example ZIP attached for the result of the dotnet commands under Linux for both the allinone and separate project creation nc linuxzip Not a functional issue so ignoring the template The Exceed Extended WPF Toolkit recently made a license change that appears to make it incompatible with commercial applications without a license fee being paid I wondered whether this might be an issue for Etobased applications where Eto licensing doesnt require a license to be paid for commercial usage Ticket is There is a fork at that might be a suitable replacement if an alternative is needed You have excellent set of layouts but I think your DynamicPanel is overengineered thing and looks more clumsy than useful I frequently use DockPanel and it could be also useful addition to your set Thanks for taking the time to report an issue Some things to consider Please be detailed and ensure there isnt already an open issue for your bugrequest If you can please try to reproduce the problem using the develop branch first as your issue may already be fixed If you have an enhancement request you can remove the sections that dont apply Expected Behavior EtoGtk should run with gtk on Mac with the default font Actual Behavior Loading the default font throws an ArgumentOutOfRangeException following the logic in this comment which states it only works in Gtk on Mac Can this be fixed for EtoGtkgtk on Mac too Steps to Reproduce the Problem brew install gtk Create a new netcoreapp Add EtoForms and EtoGtk via nuget Load the default font sample code below Supplying code that demonstrates the problem expedites a fix and a response Code that Demonstrates the Problem csharp var label new Label var controlFamily labelFontControlObjectFamily returns AppleSystemUIFont var family labelFontFamily throws Please specify the version of Eto and all platforms this can be reproduced in Specifications Version Platforms Gtk Operating Systems macOS I have a TestView defined via XAML This view has a Binding to Image xaml xml version encodingUTF Panel xmlns xmlnsx Padding Scrollable ImageView ImageBinding Image Scrollable Panel I create an instance of this view at runtime like this it is added to a DocumentControl csharp new TestView DataContext new TestViewModel When the Image of the TestViewModel changes the view does not update A bit of debugging showed that the PropertyChanged event of the view model is null which looks suspicious to me When the DataContext is passed in the ctor and set before the call to XamlReaderLoadthis everything works as expected OnDataContextChanged is always called as expected Is this a bug or am I missing something Version rc Platforms Gtk Operating Systems Ubuntu
