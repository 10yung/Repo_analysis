It would be nice to have access to the original value inside the callback function to apply further customizations like adding the full untruncated text as title attribute or even as styled HTML tooltip using libraries for this like Popperjs Im not quite sure how to extend the callback signature Here are three variants which all have their pros and cons which should be discussed here before implementing it Simply add a second parameter fullText which doesnt contain HTML but the thiscontainerinnerText value Add the DotDotDot instance as second parameter which might be too much and could cause loops Add the originalStyle and originalContent properties of the DotDotDot instance as second and third parameter ProblemMotivation I want to truncate text inside a div element which is responsive using Bootstrap which means it neither has a fixed height nor fixed width and has a calculated maxheight applied via a CSS class The actual value of the maxheight depends on the current active breakpoint md lg As it didnt work as expected I looked into the source code of DotDotDot and found that it handles maxheight calculation for boxsizing values borderbox and paddingbox which actually is not a valid value according to w schoolscom but not its default value contentbox only the content height without paddings and borders Proposed solution Remove the paddingbox switch from the height calculation as this is not a defined value by the CSS specification Add a switch contentbox which is the default value of boxsizing DOCTYPE html html langen head meta charsetUTF meta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth initialscale meta httpequivXUACompatible contentieedge titleDocumenttitle style dotdotdot width px height px margin px auto p textalign justify style head body div classdotdotdot p The dotdotdot javascript plugin targets modern browsers that support ES meaning Internet Explorer and earlier are not supported For Internet Explorer youll need some polyfills If you need support for Internet Explorer or use the legacy jQuery version version p div div classdotdotdot p p div body script src script srcdistdotdotdotjsscript script documentreadyfunction dotdotdotdotdotdot script html Truncate the whole text when I set not maxheight css property but just height then text block comes empty without text Has anyone got this trouble and how to fix Hello licensed owner here in v there are these lines var c documentcreateComment ereplaceWith c elmspush this comspush c These lines for some reason conflict with Foundation s tooltip regardless of initialization order If the lines above are removed everything seems to work I wanted to confirm the reason for the code above its implications on functionality andor if it is required for functionality or if its just a comment generatorplaceholder Uncaught TypeError agetAttribute is not a function at Functionbattr VM jqueryjs at Arrayanonymous VM jqueryjs at VM jqueryjs at g VM jqueryjs at bselect VM jqueryjs at Functionb as find VM jqueryjs at HTMLDocumenthandlers VM jqueryjs at HTMLDocumentdispatch VM jqueryjs at HTMLDocumentqhandle VM jqueryjs at Commentanonymous VM jqueryjs Oddly it does not happen when the css is unapplied Thank you Hello Ive create a test vuejs component with basic example from dotdotdot site Im trying to make it work in ie with babelpolyfill can anyone help Vue warn Error in mounted hook TypeError Object doesnt support property or method append
