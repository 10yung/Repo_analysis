Hi I need help to deserialize the ClientToGC GC message since I am using Steamkit server side Regards steamClientDebugNetworkListener new NetHookNetworkListener logs the following for me in debuglog Created nethook directory C Users xPaw nuget packages steamkit lib netstandard nethook It should be taking the executing assembly and making the folder there shouldnt it Updated MsgInfot struct members swapped position Updated signature for MessageList strings are stored in HEAP therefore removed the steamclientdll range check Hello Guys My bot can t join my csgo lobby With best regards JoinLobby static void JoinLobby var joinRequest new ClientMsgProtobufCMsgClientMMSJoinLobbyEMsgClientMMSJoinLobby joinRequestProtoHeaderroutingappid joinRequestHeaderProtoroutingappid joinRequestBodyappid joinRequestBodysteamidlobby joinRequestBodypersonaname blabla steamClientSendjoinRequest The method GetMessageList is not being hooked with the new versions of the Steam Client If I got this right all these enums are automatically extracted from steams client to this intermediate language called steamd I am currently porting the codebase to rust and now I am at the step to write a parser to generate the msgs and enums so I am wondering what rule should I follow remove the second repetition or if it shouldnt be there in the first place I checked that the C file has both but the rust compiler doesnt accept that so there has to be a rule Take for example the enum EWorkshopFileType it has the same discriminant for both First and Community Also there are some discriminants with commentaries such as removed and obselete If the discriminant was renamed why not erase the whole line and put it on a changelog instead It adds some unnecessary rules that make the parsing with a lot of edge cases Thanks Hi there I have a very strange behaviour I work with SteamKit and with Dota Task programmatically create a lobby and invite friends How I do it in the game I create a x lobby with first account join this lobby from the second account exit the lobby in the first account and do not join back or join no difference I launch the lobby from the second account the game starts everything is fine How I do it with SteamKit I create a lobby using CMsgPracticeLobbyCreate with the same settings as when I do it right in the game Now there are two options that both do not work I join from the second account to the created lobby then using CMsgPracticeLobbyLeave I exit the lobby in the first account at this moment the lobby rights goes to the second account I try to start the lobby from the second account and I get an endless loading FINDING SERVER I send a request to CMsgPracticeLobbyLaunch looks like lobby trying to launch but nothing happens When I open the dota I see the same thing as in point FINDING SERVER Update This is not related to the region What is the problem Why performing the same actions using SteamKit as in the game I can t start the lobby I tried different lobby creation ways but all to no avail Thanks Screen CreateLeaveLaunch lobby code private void CreateLobby var createLobby new ClientGCMsgProtobufCMsgPracticeLobbyCreateuint

verification code once My Code Ive double checked my code and i think this callback method should be called but doesnt Many thanks for help Bye Remoz Implements generating auth token which can be used by games to authenticate user Would welcome feedback as Im not sure about some stuff I couldnt figure out what was happening last time this happened because it silently logs the exception into the debug log with no stacktrace and just disconnects This time I had debug log enabled and got this DEBUG FreeLicense Received free license OK apps packages STEAMKIT SteamClient Unhandled ArgumentException exception from SteamApps handler An item with the same key has already been added Key After that SK started to constantly keep disconnecting with the same message but without freelicense grant this time Which eventually got me rate limited by the CM
