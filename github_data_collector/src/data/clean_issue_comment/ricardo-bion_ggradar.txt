Apologies if I missed the function but I was wondering if it would be possible to plot error bars with ggradar either using a tibble with the grouping factor and the variables as columns and one row per observation in each group or using a tibble with the grouping factor the variables means and the error standard deviations as columns and a single row per group The first way seems more straightforward with maybe an argument in ggradar to state what kind of error to calculate using a fun but the second way seems closer to the current way ggradar works one row per group Closes I have a data that looks like this with rows ldkttsssss ss ss if I do following datafilterkt renamegroup mutateatvarsgroupscalesrescale I get an error Error expecting a one sided formula a function or a function name If I dont do scalesrescale I get an error saying Error in checkdotcolsvars cols object rescale not found Ive tried datafilterkt renamegroup mutateeachfunsrescalegroup and I get Error in ischaracterx object group not found can you help Hi ricardobion I have a problem with rescaling can you help me Im not so good in R so maybe theres something Im missing genus readdelimperradarcharttxt genusradar genus mutateeachfunsrescale Group select ggradar What I get is a fancy radar plot with only values or not even a middle one while my data file is Group Bacteroides Faecalibacterium Unclassified Ruminococcaceae Ruminococcus Escherichia Unclassified Clostridiales Akkermansia Unclassified Lachnospiraceae Roseburia Dialister Coprococcus Oscillospira Unclassified Rikenellaceae Veillonella Clostridium Streptococcus Ruminococcus Blautia SMB Parabacteroides Phascolarctobacterium Megamonas Citrobacter Lachnospiraceae other HC GSD Can you help me Thanks in advance Hi I am running the example code but got the error Error in FUNX i object valuesradar not found How can I resolve this Thanks Using the latest version from github the plot appears to work fine but none of the labels show up font family not found in Windows font database fantastic work Helps me a lot for my projects However is there a way to export in PDF Any attempt leads to export in PDF leads to a white blank sheet Sorry Im new here Is there any way to use different scales on axes Something similar to this question Is a fill function incorporated into your package I am trying to fill the polygon with a color and transparency value and have not been able to find the syntax Thank you Thanks for this package I noticed when updating the Readme that when using all default arguments the legend text size is now extremely small by default compared to the rest of the text Looks like this is because base text size is while default legend text size is Of course users can update the legend text size but might be good to have better matching defaults Example and result below librarytibble mtcars rownamestocolumn var group mutateatvarsgroupfunsrescale tail select mtcarsradar g ggradarmtcarsradar unnamedchunk
