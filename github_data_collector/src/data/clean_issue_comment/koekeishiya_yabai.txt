 yabaiborders Is there a setting that controls this Id like the border to remain the thickness it original was This happens since verison of Alacritty rearranging takes like seconds after closing window recording Hi the space option in the yabai config file seems to ignore spaces on a second monitor and mess with space numbers With the following configuration the padding is applied to the screen named Desktop in mission control I tried to change the value after the space option but the screens on the external monitor seems to be out of reach yabai m config layout bsp yabai m config toppadding yabai m config bottompadding yabai m config leftpadding yabai m config rightpadding yabai m config windowgap yabai m config space toppadding yabai m config space bottompadding yabai m config space leftpadding yabai m config space rightpadding yabai m config space windowgap External Monitor Fullscreen App Fullscreen App Desktop Macbook screen Fullscreen App Desktop Desktop OS Catalina The System Integrity Protection is not disabled on my computer I have the following setting in my yabairc yabai m rule add appGoogle Chrome titleMetaMask Notification manageoff However these windows with that title still get tiled My appspecific rules work fine however like this one yabai m rule add appSystem Preferences manageoff Hey first off I want to thank you for all your work on this Now that I have to use a Mac your project has enabled me to at least come a bit closer to my Linux i setup One thing Im stuck on is I want to have spaces spread evenly among displays For example if use spacedisplay to show expected setup display displays displays I tried the following in my yabairc numdisplaysyabai m query displays jq length for i in do echo Moving space i to display numdisplays i numdisplays yabai m space i display numdisplays i numdisplays done The echos seem to suggest it did the right thing yabai Moving space to display acting space is already located on the given display Moving space to display Moving space to display acting space is already located on the given display Moving space to display Moving space to display Moving space to display acting space is already located on the given display Moving space to display Moving space to display acting space is already located on the given display Moving space to display Moving space to display acting space is already located on the given display yabai configuration loaded but the spaces dont seem to be correctly organized yabai m query spaces jq index display index display index display index display index display index display index display index display index display index display index display Minor bug really If i create new windows manually by using Command N it would be tiled immediately However when i drag a tab to another monitor there is a delay of seconds for the new windows to get tiled OS catalina yabai head at this commit its not a very good first user experience i think we should provide a better default config or maybe comment out the conflicted ones example cmd shift for screenshot option shift left right for selecting text As per title if you have a fullscreen video window in Safari and switch mission control on and off when back to the window a border is drawn Steps Open a YouTube video in safari and make it fullscreen Activate mission control Deactivate mission control Border is drawn on fullscreen window When creating a new space there is a noticeable delay of up to around seconds before the space appears in the yabai status bar The actual delay is quite variable This issue can be seen by just typing the command yabai m space create Issue video If I use the example skhd config and focus the window as well this issue does not persist
