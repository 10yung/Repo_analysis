Is any plan to fix this Ive been trying to get Google voice recognition to work offline properly After hours of trial and error Ive come to the conclusion that it only works if I leave at least one of these permissions ondemand ViewgetUserAgentString ViewsetUserAgentString ViewinitUserAgentString It doesnt matter if I allow or deny these permissions in the prompt But when I deny or allow them permanently the Google app will crash the next time I give it a voice command I find that behavior very odd and cant really explain it Any ideas what could be causing this and how I could work around

message Missing System WebView on android lollipop your device must have the Android System WebView app installed in order to use this app I have others webview apps which works great i checked my restrictions in xprivacy looks good for me dont understand why it doesnt find webview And why is the message speaking of lollipop Im on marshmallow Any Idea I have an other application that refuse to install on my phone Im sure it is compatible with my android version is there a way Xprivacy provide the android version and if its not correctly filled it results in this sort of issues Can it be microG fault too Requiring users to wait through the submission process is not only annoying for one user while waiting it discourages submission generally This is detrimental to the crowdsourced database in many ways that the developer understands better than I Please consider this issue as not just a request for convenience but as one that would benefit all premium users and the quality of the database Thank you After installing Xprivacy the device was not be able to switch on WLAN that means WLAN is permanently off and tries to enable leads into an endless loop This is happen before doing any Xprivacy configuration already The occurrence is reproduceable and can be removed by uninstall Xprivacy and doing a dalvic cache wipe Xprivacy Version Android OS CyanoGen Version NIGHTLYjactivelte Xposed Version sdk v Device Samsung Galaxy S active Android Xposed Ver alpha XPrivacy Ver When I unblockwhitelist contacts for WhatsApp the contacts are accessible for WhatsApp for a moment sec Then the ticks on the checkboxes for that contacs in XPrivacy are removed by itself You can watch that behavior here YouTube At the moment one of contacts stays checked in XPrivacy firstname AA familyname Contact I created that contact for test purposes I don t know why this contact stays checked especially because an other similar test contact firstname AB familyname Contact also is unchecked automatically All contacts are stored in my google account I used the same way to unblock contacts for WhatsApp on my Android phone my wifes phone and also on an other of my phones with Android but with MiUi and modified Xposed version On all this phones it worked just fine oO Edit Just added some comments to the video When I open the app it shows the internal check error The log shows below XPrivacy Android SDK Brand OnePlus Manufacturer OnePlus Model ONEPLUS A Product OnePlus Device OnePlus T Host ubuntu Display ONEPLUS A Id MXB T Method not found

support for different address books even from different sources which would be a good point to group contacts together which should be whitelisted Ie you could have some whatsapp addressbook which may be read by whatsapp while all other address books are disallowed Then you can add new whatsappcontacts to this addressbook and keep ie contacts for your email app in another address book
