The fix for is a step in the right direction I suppose but it still misses one case If I do myprojectreStart everything is fine because it will split on and get reStart However if I do project myproject reStart it doesnt do the right thing because it returns reStart which doesnt match With sbt I was running a Play project using the task server run The executedCommandKey task will stop parsing the task when it encounters whitespace and so in this case executedCommandKey is server and not run The consequence is that isDevMode will be false instead of true Quoting from jroper from Ive just had a look at sbtwebscalajs and I see what the underlying problem is here Its looking at what command has been run on the CLI to establish whether to run the fast or full JS command Doing this is really working against the tool sbt tasks should be idempotent invoke it once invoke it times doesnt matter the context it should always return the same result if the files its processing havent changed This is a fundamental assumption of sbt and when you break that assumption such as the way sbtwebscalajs does then things start to break in ways that are really difficult to fix Fixing this would probably be quite involved Im not that experienced with scalajs to know exactly how it works but what youd probably need to do is have it configured to run the fast process initially as a source generator then produce a directory that all assets are copied to correctly prefixed that can be added to your development classpath this is something that sbtweb could provide but I dont think it currently does provide however Play framework provides exactly this in its development mode and that directory is isolated and not included in the final production artifact Then youd add a pipeline stage that does the full build possibly dropping the dev compiled assets from the pipeline if they are no longer applicable This would be the idiomatic sbt way of doing things that would work well with other tooling Currently IntelliJ supports debugging of Scalajs project which emits source map files with absolute path Because sbtwebscalajs ignores relativeSourceMaps setting projects based on the plugin cannot be debugged using IntelliJs Scala plugin Hi I think it is currently not possible to use sbtwebscalajs with singleproject build What I mean is to have scalajs sources in our sbtweb project Currently we need to have at least two projects sbtweb one and scalajs one If Im wrong or there is a good reason for such behaviour please tell me Thanks
