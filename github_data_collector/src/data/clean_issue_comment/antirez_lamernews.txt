Downvoting is expensive and the community is the bestcheapest spam filter so why dont we reward users that downvote spam entries Or at least give the karma spent on the downvote back I think this is not that hard to accomplish tech wise I use lamernews internally at my company so I needed it to be linked with the LDAP company accounts Hop e is useful to others too By configuring in appconfigrb how to connect with an ldap server usernamepassword are checked against that directory Registration and the forget password link are blocked and hided from the UI Users are still stored the same way and are created the first time a user logged succesfull through ldap When submitting a news story that has UTF encoded characters in its title the submission completes successfully but the resulting redirect produces the following error ArgumentError at invalid byte sequence in USASCII For some reason it is falsely assumed that strings returned by Redis are ASCII strings I have fixed this problem in production by adding the following line to configru Encodingdefaultexternal EncodingUTF yajlruby x faster than JSONgenerate x faster than JSONparse Everytime I log into lamernews I get bit by the create account checkbox being selected by default Please think about changing the default setting so that it is unchecked This would help out people that use automated password managers such as lastpass A fulltext search feature would be very helpful and increase the usability of the site Right now the search is to click through the more links RSS Feed channel description and comment links are pointing to Example item titleEmbrace Copyingtitle guid link description CDATA a href description comments item I suppose it would be nice to have a latest coments section something similar to I believe it could help to motivate people to participate in discussions by making it easier to check whats being discussed
