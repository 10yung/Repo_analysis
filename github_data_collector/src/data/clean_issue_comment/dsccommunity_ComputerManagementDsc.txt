Since being migrated to the DSC Community this module must be updated to use the new CI process and repository structure I have a job as following but it reports the state as incorrect because of the credential It appears I am setting it as username but then the scheduled task is taking that and just setting it as DOMAIN username leading to a mismatch I think I can probably hack it to work somehow but ideally the scheduledtask resource should probably evaluate DOMAIN username the same as username ScheduledTask DRBackup TaskName DRBackup TaskPath Jobs ActionExecutable C windows system
