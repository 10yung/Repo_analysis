Summary Run yarn on the current master will produce an untracked file websitestaticcssDraftcss Its a remainder from the migration to Docusaurus and should be deleted This will fix Test Plan I ran cd website yarn yarn start and the doc website works fine locally Do you want to request a feature or report a bug Feature Request What is the current behavior I dont know if its possible to render docx files somehow in draftjs What is the expected behavior Is there any way so that I can use docx files for rendering Or anything that can be used to convert the docx files to draftjs state which can then be used for rendering Summary introduced a change that locked immutablejs to Reading the PR you can see that this change was supposed to be a bandaid PR while was getting merged see The PR eventually got merged and included on the latest immutablejs release but the problem is that when installing the latest release of immutablejs there are still multiple type errors across the codebase and most importantly it seems like updating the immutablejs version on Facebook itself is hard to accomplish so this update is being avoided as much as possible There has been a lot of discussion about this update Locking immutablejs to that version is an issue if your project uses draftjs and immutablejs x or if you depend on another package that depends on x In this case youll end up bundling both versions of immutablejs on your application which is not ideal Note that the problems that introduces are only related to Flow types and not actual issues and there are no breaking changes GoDaddy has been using draftjs in production for more than a year now without issues related to the version difference Other ppl are confirming this as well This PR tries to achieve a middle ground where immutablejs stays at x while opening the semver range to allow draftjs to be used with other versions bigger than x and smaller than Test Plan Running yarn on with this change applied
