 Problems with makeFirefoxProfile On AWS EC linux With selenium from docker seleniumstandalonefirefox And geckodriver geckodriverv linux targz I am unable to use makeFirefoxProfile on this machine Error messages sh command not found Error in filetmpfile rb cannot open the connection Calls makeFirefoxProfile file In addition Warning message In filetmpfile rb cannot open file tmpRtmpUDdMKwfile de e zip No such file or directory Execution halted Tests performed to isolate the problem On this same linux machine I can successfully operate a remote firefox webdriver without using makeFirefoxProfile On macOS I can successfully use makeFirefoxProfile There is something about the combination of the AWS linux machine and that makeFirefoxProfile function that fails netstatfreeport is a simple helper that provides an available TCP port from an IANA unassigned range With netstatfreeport we can avoid having to manually specify TCP ports during calls to rsDriver Example This R rD rsDriverbrowsercchrome verbose TRUE chromever port L could be replaced with R rD rsDriverbrowsercchrome verbose TRUE chromever portfreeport This is helpful when managing multiple concurrent sessions and very helpful when running multiple different jobs on the same machine for example multiple scheduled tasks all of which may work independently but fail when run concurrently due to port collisions Modifying rsDriver to default to freeport when port unspecified rsDriver could be modified to default to port freeport whenever a port value is not specified Hence R rD rsDriverbrowsercchrome verbose TRUE chromever port L would reduce to R rD rsDriverbrowsercchrome verbose TRUE chromever which simplifies the function call but also offers improved robustness when running concurrent jobs netstat is not yet on CRAN as it is closed over the break but it will submited Jan in case its of use Keen for your thoughts This is a suggestion to autodetect the proper ChromeDriver version because it happens regularly that the default setting chromever latest selects a ChromeDriver version thats ahead of the current stable Chrome browser version Id suggest something like the following to select the latest ChromeDriver version matching the majorminorpatch version number of the systems stable Google Chrome browser r Get installed stable Google Chrome version if xfunisunix chromedriverversion system
