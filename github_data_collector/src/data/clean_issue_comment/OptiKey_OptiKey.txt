 How OptiKey was being used Modify Communicate tables get new obz file and import into Optikey trough menu What the user expected to happen Kommunicate tables has to appear as designed ppt main page Optikey on one of PC Kommunicate What the user actually experienced no images on the buttons and instead of translated Yes to it still showing Yes This same behaviour with all translated button where is English images are in the place ootikey Version Operating system and version Windows OptiKey version v Steps to reproduce the issue Takes this ppt file TestingRu pptx Uploade it to Download obz file Export into Optikey open Kommunicate keyboard Any other information that helps to describe andor reproduce the problem Very strange is i have three pcs my dev pc and other two is used by my disabled child home PC and MS Surface PRO for school So on my dev PC Kommunicate tables are showing images but the button Yes still untranslated but on child PCs no images for translated buttons and Yes is untranslated Potential keyboard layout examples Bulgarian keyboard layout Phonetic keyboard layout Other Online keyboards Transifex Breakdown of potentially required characters Shift up Shift down Marks combining Breve Punctuation Symbols Infrequents We need to discuss the above to decide on the required set there isnt space for everything and some of the above may be out of populate use Overview doc Branch Pending Submitted via email by AdamRoden Define SharedStyleGroups for keys in the XML heading section with the override values Ive added at the key level and then each key can use the default style from settings a SharedStyleGroup or the individual overrides available today Define SharedTimeGroups in the XML to enable overriding the default settings This would be useful for the DynamicKeys It would useful to have lock on time activation time and min time before key can be reactivated A way to cancel a mouse action How OptiKey was being used Optikey was set up with EyeX left mouse click for trigger EyeX was not connected so I went to manual mode to demo Optikey to someone What the user expected to happen Mouse position used as input while in manual mode and left click trigger should work What the user actually experienced I keep getting the error Uhoh I cannot detect where you are directing your attention and clicking on buttons doesnt work Version Windows Optikey Steps to reproduce the issue Set up with eyetracker mouse trigger Turn on manual mode A new key to translate and replace the scratchpad text Hi Im a dental school student Im wondering about whether this software can be used for dental purposeAs I know the dental procedure can sometimes be timeconsuming and tedious since the patients have to lie on the chair and cannot move for a long time which can last for hours sometimes By using this software patients can use their eyes to control the panel which is above their heads of the dental chair so they can play games or select videos they want to watch during the whole procedure without the help from their dentists I hope my issue can help you find more potential applications of this software Is there any limitation that prevent OptiKey from operating on the Secured Desktop screen For example if the user runs an application as administrator can OptiKey operate on the permission screen I have my keyboard running at a pretty fast rate Key fixation to lock on is ms and time to complete is ms With these settings I can get a nice typing rhythm One thing that I have been getting frustrated by is the behavior of the Ctrl Alt and Shift keys I do like them to activate at the same speed as all my other keys but it is sometimes challenging to get them into the state I want without accidentally double activating I have a couple ideas to improve usability Timing It would be nice if the initial time to activate was the same as text keys but the time to switch on keylock was longer Alternatively add a setting so the key has an individual cool down period before it can be activated again Deactivation It would be nice if the keys could be configured to remain in key down state if a physical key home end arrows etc is pressed and only automatically return to key up state after pressing a text key letter or number Background color It would be nice if the key background color would change when they are on because just changing the font color isnt always enough When locked a bigger bolder lock icon or additional background color might also help This enhancement is to add two new features The ability to retrieve a value such as the Adjust by pixel amount and display it in a keys label The ability to submit a change to a system setting such as the Adjust by pixel amount
