one likely wants to reverse engineer all that js But its worth letting people know that twitter dev site requires running a nonfree program not a nice thing to do Anyone having authentication problems can now easily fix it by doing this Without even trying to go through the usual authentication method Simple create a trc file in your home folder nano trc The format of the file is as follows profiles myusername fakeFAKEfakeFAKEfakeFAKE username myusername consumerkey fakeFAKEfakeFAKEfakeFAKE consumersecret fakeFAKEfakeFAKEfakeFAKEfakeFAKEfakeFAKE token fakeFakefakeFAKEfake secret fakeFAKEfakeFAKEfakeFAKEfakeFAKEfakeFAKEfakeFAKEfakeFAKE configuration defaultprofile myusername fakeFAKEfakeFAKEfakeFAKE The Twitter Developer API allows you to create the tokens without going through the usual process involving the pin Simply replace the contents of your trc file with the appropriate keys and secrets and your twitter username Im trying to search for some pretty specific things t stream search KillthePresident OR wiretransfer OR MilitaryIntelligence OR CIA OR Cheney OR Honduras OR Ortega OR GOP OR OR counterintelligence OR Chemical OR Ali OR OR HERF OR pipebomb OR cryptographic OR LegionofDoom OR PatriotAct OR conspiracy OR ASPIC I notice when I replace spaces with the script prints a few tweets but then it bails usrlib rubygems gemst bint erraticlinux e b not sure why yet but if I use normal spaces the results dont seem too relevant if I get rid of the keywords with spaces it seems to be kind of hit or miss t stream search CIA OR Cheney OR Honduras OR Ortega OR GOP OR OR counterintelligence OR Chemical OR Ali OR OR HERF OR pipebomb OR cryptographic OR conspiracy OR ASPIC if I get rid of dashes it doesnt seem to be any better or worse theres still some results that seem irrelevant t stream search CIA OR Cheney OR Honduras OR Ortega OR GOP OR OR Chemical OR Ali OR HERF OR cryptographic OR conspiracy OR ASPIC Any idea whats going on Pinned the twitter dependency to v x links to ruby downloads and RubyInstaller werent displaying correctly so I fixed it real quick EDIT apparently someone else has already made a PR for this but its still open
