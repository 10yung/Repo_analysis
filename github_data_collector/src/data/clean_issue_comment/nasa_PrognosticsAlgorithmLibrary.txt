This modifies the method initialize so that the initial states are sampled from a Gaussian distribution whose variance vector x Variance is a new property of PF Unlike the property InitGain this allows defining the initial variance of the initial states or initial parameter independently which might be useful when the uncertainty is higher only in some of the initial states or parameters
