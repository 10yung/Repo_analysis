I have to draw day week month and year graph in segmented view and when I try to change the segment tab just need to reset the graph lines and redraw graph but when I call selfgraph reset in viewwillappear and call selfgraph draw its crashing the app in removeTitleLabels method voidremoveTitleLabels if selftitleLabelscount selftitleLabels mkeach id item item removeFromSuperview selftitleLabels nil UILabelLayer convertPointfromLayer message sent to deallocated instance Please help Im using for plot graph for today week month and year when switch between the tabs I call draw method everytime but it still crash at some points Possible to make the edges point to point smooth so it flows like a nice curve In the positionYForLineValue method the denominator self maxValue self minValue may have value In this case exception arise for NaN The fix should be int diff self maxValue self minValue CGFloat scale if diff scale value self minValue diff else scale Hi Am trying to draw a multiline graph what i have noticed is if the data set have same number if values then only line will be drawn complete i have attached a sample project tap on line graph and see the blue line if the data is this line is perfect selfdata if the data has been changed to this selfdata line doesnt reach till the end lets assume i have number which is for year and number is for but i dont have any data for between and but i want by line to reach to reach till the end i have attached a sample project please check line graph GraphKitmaster zip Hi I have a chart with a single line I set startFromZero as true I set data values to you then get Terminating app due to uncaught exception CALayerInvalidGeometry reason CALayer position contains NaN nan Caused by CGFloatpositionYForLineValueCGFloatvalue CGFloat scale value self minValue self maxValue self minValue because self maxValue self minValue I can try and add a possible pull request when I get chance Thanks Now performs check for the dataSource to respond to the selector before actually creatingpositioning the labels Should fix WARNING I havent tested the fix locally so you will want to test before pulling it in Hey I needed to write a GKStackedBarGraph class based on the regular GKBarGraph class and figured it may be of general interest Its basically the same as the bar chart except each bar consists of several segments stacks of colour I added an example so that you can take a look The protocol looks like so objc NSIntegernumberOfBars NSIntegernumberOfStacks NSNumber valueForBarAtIndexNSIntegerindex stackNSIntegerstack optional UIColor colorForBarAtIndexNSIntegerindex stackNSIntegerstack UIColor colorForBarBackgroundAtIndexNSIntegerindex CFTimeIntervalanimationDurationForBarAtIndexNSIntegerindex NSString titleForBarAtIndexNSIntegerindex Note Its not very well tested Also its draw animation is not as pretty as it could be E G Implemented logic to be able to change the font colour font size or font name on either the Bar Graph or Line Graph Adjusting the height of a bar with cashapelayers by covering up what was there not everything was covered leaving behind artifacts This is due to the rendering of uneven float numbers I changed it so only full and half pixels are used the datasource delegate specifies optional UIColor colorForBarAtIndexNSIntegerindex UIColor colorForBarBackgroundAtIndexNSIntegerindex CFTimeIntervalanimationDurationForBarAtIndexNSIntegerindex NSString titleForBarAtIndexNSIntegerindex however in it is being treated as required in the code
