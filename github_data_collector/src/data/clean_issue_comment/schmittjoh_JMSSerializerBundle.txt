Hi guys Im trying to add some excluding groups and i cant make work this configuration Im using symfony and this is my config yaml configpackagesjmsserializeryaml jmsserializer visitors xmlserialization formatoutput kerneldebug jsondeserialization options JSONHEXAMP JSONHEXAPOS JSONHEXQUOT JSONHEXTAG metadata autodetection false directories InnovatikLabs namespaceprefix InnovatikLabs Shared Domain Model path kernelprojectdirsrcSharedInfrastructureSerializer yaml srcSharedInfrastructureSerializerAddressyml InnovatikLabs Shared Domain Model Address exclusionpolicy ALL properties id expose true groups detail street expose true groups detail postalCode expose true groups detail phone expose true groups detail My Model is in InnovatikLabs Shared Domain Model Address and the mapping is made using xml When i execute a doctrine find in my controller i get an Address object and when i return a JsonResponse like this php em thisgetDoctrinegetManager address emgetRepositoryAddressclassfind a ab f d fe acf b return JsonResponsecreate serializerserializeaddress json SerializationContextcreatesetGroups detail The response is empty I think im missing something or i guess the bundle is no reading my config in order to get the excluding groups from the yamls Note If i use the method addMetadataDir like this php serializer SerializerBuildercreate addMetadataDirvarwwwhtmlsrcSharedInfrastructureSerializer build And renaming the yml containing the serialization groups in order to include all the namespace like InnovatikLabsSharedDomainModelAddressyml it works but i need an automated way to declare all my config and serialization groups and only stay focus in serializa and deserialize objects Can anybody help me please xD PHP is out via Hello We are stuck actually to use JMS Serializer because we have metadatas yml files for same namespace placed in several directories Exemple MyNameSpaceEntityA is in srcMyBundle ResourcesconfigserializerMyNameSpaceEntityAyml MyNameSpaceEntityB is in srcMyBundle ResourcesconfigserializerMyNameSpaceEntityByml Actually with prefix path see method addMetadataDirs for a given namespace we can only have one directory for one namespace As we cannot change namespaces for those classes and only the class name differs we are blocked to load metadatas from different directories It would be nace to be able to set directly the class file for instance as a workround Or a way to redefine location strategy Thanks Hello any help plz i need to deserialize entity by id ManyToone Invalid data integer expected any idea Our system Symfony We are getting a fatal error if we use the serializer but the route ends in authentication Fatal Error Unknown Annotation group if the requests hits a controller everything works fine Is there any possibility to load the annotations in any context I had to troubleshoot weird behavior where different environments with identically configured timezone yielded different results when deserializing dates Explicitly setting defaulttimezone in the bundle configuration fixed the issue According to the documentation this value is supposed to default to PHPs timezone defaulttimezone UTC defaults to whatever timezone set in phpini or via datedefaulttimezoneset It turns out that the configuration class calls datedefaulttimezoneget to get a default value which is then injected into the DateHandler meaning that the timezone defaults to the timezone of the environment where the container was built in my case one of the build servers had a different timezone rather than the actual runtime environment This behavior should either be documented much more clearly or if possible from a backwards compatibility standpoint changed so that datedefaulttimezoneget is called at runtime Hi I havent seen any annotation that does what I describe below unless I missed it Is there a solution to it or should this be a feature request Thanks Payload json id properties name version v value John Model php class Payload Serializer Typestring public id Serializer Typepropertiesnamevaluestring Something like this public name Im using the JMSSerializerBundle and have a problem I register my serialization config as YAML with the following config yaml jmsserializer metadata autodetection false directories DomainEntity namespaceprefix path MyBundleResourcesconfigserializer As you can see I have autodetection false and leave the namespaceprefix empty because I want to register multiple namespaces that dont share a common prefix This works great But now I installed a rdparty bundle that does this It also registers multiple namespaces The problem is that the Serialization configuration from the jmsmessengeradapter gets overwritten by my declaration because we both use an empty prefix The prefix is then transformed to an empty string key When I look at the internals I see that the directories array is generated and then passed to the FileLocator An easy fix could be to make the thisdirs array multi dimensional If a duplicate or empty prefix is registered it will be appended to the array goetas Before I make a PR I would like to know if you have objections against this and if its the way to go Hello I get below error when i am using jmssymfonybundle The directory

please help me in solving this I saw a similar issue resolved here with the code now throws an error for me improve naming strategy handing by wrapping always custom naming strategies with the custom serialized name strategy
