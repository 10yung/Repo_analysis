Hi Im looking for a way to add greekspecial characters in the axis Im using the option setnames and characters like mu doesnt interpret to greek letters on the figure any ideas img width altMATLAB src thanks I ran into an error when plotting a boxplot with multiple conditions to plot Error using plot Vectors must be the same length Error in grammstatboxplotmyboxplot line objresultsstatboxplotobjresultind outliershandleplotboxmidoutliersxoutliersyoMarkerEdgeColornoneMarkerFaceColordrawdatacolor Error in grammstatboxplotdobjddmyboxplotdobjddpResults line objgeomvertcatobjgeomdobjddmyboxplotdobjddpResults Error in grammdraw line objgeomgeomindobjdrawdata Error in CLOCDAgrammplotting line gdraw The error arises because the outliersx and outliersy are not defined properly namely outliersy becomes a matrix instead of a vector when there are outliers in multiple conditions This is easily solved by changing statboxplotm like to outliersy outliersy yselseloutlier Hope thats helpful Hi Pierre I wonder if its possible to change to color of a line plotted with geomline independently of the color map used from a plotted densitity heat map For example my dummy code looks like this ggrammxxyy gstatbin dgeomimage annotx annoty annotcatcolumn gupdatexannotxyannotycolorannotcatcolumn ggeomline gsetcoloroptionschroma lightness gdraw At the moment it does not change the color of the line to black as I thought it would using the setcoloroptions I can only change the line to a color of the heatmap by changing annotcatcolumn to having different values cheers Nigel Hi Id like to brush and link data points between different plots However if I use for example gplotgeompoint Im not able to brush data as the data points dont change their color I very much hope this is the last time I bother you on here Pierre If I may just a couple more questions I have several data points at each of several quantised levels and Id like to plot these as a dot plot before adding other layers on top The MatlabExchange script I was using previously Univarscatter was plotting points situated at the same level equidistantly about a central x value regardless of the jitter width Since Ive now migrated all my plotting to gramm I was hoping to obtain more or less the same with geomjitter but I get randomly nonequidistant points Reducing the width doesnt help Is there a way to make the jitter more systematicsymmetrical On this scatter plot Id like to highlight certain data points by making the marker larger or of a different shape as in the UnivarScatter plot above Can this be done either with gramm or in parallel to it Similarly Id like to highlight the median on my violin plots Adding statboxplot would be overkill Id like to just add a horizontal line again as in the plot above Using Matlab commands line prior to gdraw seems to make a mess Thank you so much Ive been having a few problems setting the alpha parameter in geompoint When I run this code the points in the resulting figure become transparent for less than a second but quickly reverts to opaque as the figure is created load exampledata figure ggrammxcarsHorsepowerycarsMPGsubsetcarsCylinders carsCylinders ggeompointalpha gdraw I did manage to find a solution but Im not sure why it works and theres probably a much better way to implement it If I add pause to line in drawm where the subplot is created the code runs perfectly and the points remain transparent Id guess that creating the axis or making an axes current takes some time and doesnt block the code but I dont know the specifics it Im perfectly willing to wait half a second per axis but I thought you should know about this if you didnt Thanks Russell Hi Pierre I was wondering whether you foresee any method which would make me able to automatically group observations into individuals in order to have correct errorbars when plotting for eg SEMs Imagine that I have repeated observation per individual per condition The default input method of gramm doesnt allow me to automatically average these repeated observations does it Cheers Romain I almost feel embarrassed to add such a tiny change I simply added an if statement checking for log scales as lines do not display properly if any values plotted are negative This fixes this such that any negative values become I know this doesnt really follow your guidelines but its really a minor minor QoL fix Two parameters were added to setpointoptions borderwidth and bordercolor These options allow addition of a border to be drawn around each point An example of a plot drawn with and without point borders is shown below The default is no border If borderwidth is set to a value greater than a black border is drawn around each point If bordercolor is set but borderwidth is not then no border will be drawn Acceptable values for bordercolor are an x RGB matrix or the Matlab color shorthand such as g or green figure anoborder With borders figure a Hello This is my first issue here so sorry if I am messing things up or saying something that is not accurate I really like a function called chartCorrelation it is available in a package called PerformanceAnalytics It would be great to have something similar on Matlab however the native function plotmatrix is far less efficient Would this be something interesting to include in gramm I thought about developing it myself but never managed to do so The function mentioned is available on the link
