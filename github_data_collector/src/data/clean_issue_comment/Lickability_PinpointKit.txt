 Feature Proposal In iOS our default log collecting became impossible In iOS it s possible once again to read logs using oslog Determine how we can make use of oslog to collect logs like we do on iOS Feature Proposal In Xcode we can now use Swift Package Manager for dependencies Perform the necessary work for others to integrate PinpointKit as a Swift Package Expected Behavior Send may be greyed out but users will have no clue as to how to proceed adding an alert to say Mail app not found please install from appstore or something will help Actual Behavior Steps to Reproduce the Problem delete Mail app from device run pinpointkit UI click send from screenshot email composer has send button greyed out Specifications Version Platform Feature Proposal Consider moving FeedbackConfigurationBody to be nested under Feedback instead Release the latest master for Swift Xcode users We have run into an issue with setting tintcolor of all annotationviews when using swift UIViewappearancetintColor someColor Granted this is not best practice at all but I think the issue could be circumvented by setting tintColor on every subview when its added to the AnnotationsView Right now this is only done whenever the tintColor changes When building a project that uses PinpointKit via CocoaPods that has a deployment target of the following warning appears due to the use of GLKView within BlurAnnotationView GLKView is deprecated first deprecated in iOS OpenGLES API deprecated Define GLESSILENCEDEPRECATION to silence these warnings Migrate off from GLKit for iOS See for history Now that we ve reached we ll want a better strategy for releasing updates as changes come in Assigning to myself and Twigz to work on the following together Automate as much of the release process as we reasonably can Document the steps for creating a new release Determine release schedule or more likely what will warrant an update See this comment wherein I describe how one could provide a custom LogCollector implementation Consider whether we should have more detailed instructions like this or examples for how one could customize PinpointKit Our current README has a Customization section but it s possible that more detailed information could help users get started
