while running configure in git bash an error appeared like this configure error is required configlog When at the end of each download session axel frequently connects to and disconnects from the server This has problems It actually make the speed lower due to the time used connecting Some servers will ban you if you frequently connects and disconnects to them So if a connection is finished you should not make any new connections This implementation parses the HOMEnetrc or a file specified by the user through the netrc file or R file options It uses a simple FSM in order to parse the file and find the credentials corresponding to the FTP host or uses the default entry otherwise if any according to the specification found on Tokens not applicable to axel usage were not considered Closes Signedoffby David Polverari davidpolverarigmailcom Initially this was going to be a typo fix but as I read more I noticed several miswordings which may be confusing to nonnative English speakers so I have changed them Im using Axel on OSX and having trouble resuming an incomplete download Resuming an interrupted download appears to work until the progress reaches and at that point things seem to just hang for some unknown reason Axel isnt able to finalise things The way I have been experiencing this is when the cable to the external HDD where I have been downloading to is accidentally knocked off Axel appears to be able to pick up from where the download got interrupted but for whatever reason it cant finish the task in the end at which point I have to manually kill Axel Here is an example output axel a Initializing download File size bytes Opening output file mp Starting download Write error Downloaded Gigabytes in minutes KBs axel a Initializing download File size bytes Opening output file mp State file found bytes downloaded to go Starting download Connection finished Connection finished Connection unexpectedly closed Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished Connection finished MBs C Downloaded Megabytes in minutes KBs C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C C x Alpine Linux ALT Linux x Arch Linux x Buildroot CentOS x Debian Fedora FreeBSD Gentoo OpenWRT LEDE no package Mageia OpenMandriva OpenBSD OpenEmbedded no package openSUSE OpenWRT PCLinuxOS pkgsrc NetBSD and others x Slackware x Source Mage x Termux Ubuntu x Void Linux x MSYS The code should try to read as much as possible so an abstraction is required to use the already read part that is not headers before continuing reading from the socket Basic Metalink support should not be difficult If possible avoid XML parsing
