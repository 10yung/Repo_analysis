sparkbenchlaunch RELEASE Details of your cluster setup Spark version StandaloneYarnLocalEtc Spark Scala version on your cluster Scala version Spark Cluster Spark Standalone master and slaves Description of your problem and any other relevant info I am working on analyzing Spark performance using as many workloads that I can use Till this moment I am able to use the KMeans data generation and workload I want to use the Logistic Regression workload but I could not because there is No data generation for Logistic Regression I hav tried to run the legacy version of spark bench but i got some issues because my SPark version is IS there any way to get or generate the input data to the Logistic Regression workload Many thanks in advance for your help In kmeans document the same workload is listed twice Now remove the duplicated one Signedoffby Haojian Zhuang haojianzhuanglinaroorg This workload will output to tmpkmeansdatacsv In LinearRegressionDataGenscala case class LinearRegressionDataGen checks whether the output file is csv file or not If its csv file stop running the workload immediately So this workload is impossible to run just remove it from document Signedoffby Haojian Zhuang haojianzhuanglinaroorg commit a f e fea a bfe d ed aa e d Author Emily Curtin emilyframebitorg Date Fri Feb Addressing code review comments Moves format check to front This commit add verifyFormatOrThrowoutputDir fileFormat in verifyOutput It causes graph data generator workload failure since the workload only generate output with txt file format But sparkbench only supports csv parquet etc The confliction of file format causes the workload failure Now remove the verifyFormatOrThrow instead Signedoffby Haojian Zhuang haojianzhuanglinaroorg
