Add support for JupyterHub with local spawner in the venv and PAM authentication I see youve made some changes in the dev branch These files follow the conventions from the master branch but should be easily convertible This has not been thoroughly tested Let me know if youre interested to merge then I can test and add the changes as in the dev branch Thanks for this project its really usefull One suggestion I have though is to write the instjnssh file such that it has arguments to block some parts from installing or the other way around
