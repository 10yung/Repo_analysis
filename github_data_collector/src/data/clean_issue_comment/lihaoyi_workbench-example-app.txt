 Ive updated all the dependencies to todays versions and ran fastOptJS and fullOptJS to ensure the project compiles Ive added idea to gitignore as I imagine many people use IntelliJs Scala plugin Im getting error when trying to compile akkahttp demo workbenchexampleappexamplejvmsrcmainscalaexampleServerscala type mismatch error found akkahttpscaladslserverDirective String error which expands to akkahttpscaladslserverDirective String error required akkahttpscaladslserverRequestContext error extractentityas String e error error one error found Some years after the last commit in the repository it seems that the required rbt version is nowhere to be found To oldest sbt version known to is while the latest in the x series is Setting the latter as the required sbt version inside projectbuildproperties fixes projects startup SBT versions from x seem not to work I guess this change would need to be merged in the other branches too Hi demo site seems to be down Ive tried the autowireakkahttp branch and it didnt compile anymore This pull request fixes the akkahttp Server compilation error fixes a warning in the js module concerning the usage of scalajsconcurrentJSExecutionContextImplicitsrunNow updates the akka dependencies hey lihaoyi First of all thanks for educating to many of us I am working through example for server and client and in I found scripttypetextjavascript srcclientfastoptjs This is fine for development but when using sbtnativepackager this will break because the file name renames to clientoptjs universalpackageBin info Packaging UsersHaritHimanshuIdeaProjectsq todoMvcakkahttpscalajsservertargetscala server SNAPSHOTsourcesjar info Done packaging info Updating fileUsersHaritHimanshuIdeaProjectsq todoMvcakkahttpscalajsserver info Resolving jlinejline info Done updating info Main Scala API documentation to UsersHaritHimanshuIdeaProjectsq todoMvcakkahttpscalajsservertargetscala api info Wrote UsersHaritHimanshuIdeaProjectsq todoMvcakkahttpscalajsservertargetscala server SNAPSHOTpom info Packaging UsersHaritHimanshuIdeaProjectsq todoMvcakkahttpscalajsservertargetscala server SNAPSHOTwebassetsjar info Compiling Scala sources to UsersHaritHimanshuIdeaProjectsq todoMvcakkahttpscalajsservertargetscala classes info Done packaging model contains documentable templates info Packaging UsersHaritHimanshuIdeaProjectsq todoMvcakkahttpscalajsservertargetscala server SNAPSHOTjar info Done packaging info Main Scala API documentation successful info Packaging UsersHaritHimanshuIdeaProjectsq todoMvcakkahttpscalajsservertargetscala server SNAPSHOTjavadocjar info Done packaging info Wrote UsersHaritHimanshuIdeaProjectsq todoMvcakkahttpscalajssharedjvmtargetscala shared SNAPSHOTpom success Total time s completed Jan PM and scala gitmaster ls api server SNAPSHOTsourcesjar server SNAPSHOTpom classes server SNAPSHOTwebassetsjar server SNAPSHOTjavadocjar server SNAPSHOTjar scala gitmaster jar tvf server SNAPSHOTwebassetsjar Tue Jan PST METAINFMANIFESTMF Tue Jan PST public Tue Jan PST publicclientoptjs Tue Jan PST publicclientlauncherjs How can we fix this Thanks a lot again The refreshBrowsers feature does not work in the jvmjsshared branch example When sbt is run using restart the expected behavior is that the browser reloads after a change to the JSfile However a manual refresh is needed I assume this is because refreshBrowsers is by default triggered after fastOptJS but this is too early and we would need a trigger after the server restarted However what surprises me that if I make another the change the refresh does not pick up the first change updated akkahttpexperimental to akkahttp remove idea files from the project
