Given a word get its root For example the root of is Given a grammatically false statement output the corrected one PS I dont even know if it was done in other languages The idea here is to use a machine learning model to automatically add punctuation marks to Arabic text Those marks are as follows I do not have a dataset for this However I think Tashkela dataset will be a good fit since it contains a large body of Arabic text that is mostly punctuated Any thoughts Given a paragraph classify it into sport politics etc Given an email classify it into spam or not spam Check this on Recognition of Historical Arabic Scientific Manuscripts There is some discussion on fastai Given an audio source convert it to a written text Given an image convert it to text Given a statement in Arabic predict the next word This issue is opened for newcomers If any one wants two work on this let us know This is a new Feature I worked on an LSTM model for POStagger you can read about it Here Im willing to enhance the model with pretrained word vec then add it here Ill open a PR as soon as I start
