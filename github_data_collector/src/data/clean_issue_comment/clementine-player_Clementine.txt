is found If I am looking for a substring that occurs at the beginning of a word say K Then it is found It will pick up K K However if I am looking something that ends in because for example I cannot

from the clementine sidebar of the online tab adds k mp streams Expected No need for outdated mp format somafm streams with worse quality when AAC is available Steps to reproduce the problem only for bugs Add a somafm stream from the online tab Click on stream details on any somafm stream shows somafmsomafmcomdeepspaceonepls This seems to refer to the default k mp streams like But soma also has k AAC steams and obviously there is better quality transported over AAC with the same bitrate they call the playlists like And BTW the playlists over multiple servers In this case there are actually four servers in the playlist I am not sure what the somafm is doing in clementine so I am curious if someone can tell me it would be much appreciated I think opening up soma streams in clementine should actually be like opening up a the xxx pls files from them directly They also offer k and k AAC streams but I personally see no need for them I think I read once that k AAC is basically the same quality as k mp But there could be a choice for them also See somafmcomdeepspaceone Before posting Please follow the steps below and check the boxes with x once you did the step x I checked the issue

and the version of Clementine used Operating System Windows Professional version Build Clementine version Expected behaviour actual behaviour I have a playlist set up When set to random shuffle and repeat entire playlist Sometimes a song will be cut off between and seconds before the end of the file even if silence is not being truncated Additionally this appears to happen only to some songs Additionally every time this strange behavior occurs The playlist is unable to play the previous songs via the previous track button This secondary issue is not present when tracks are able to complete normally Steps to reproduce the problem only for bugs Ive not been able to consistently replicate this bug At best when I notice it happens to a track Ill replay the song and let the last seconds play out in an attempt to get it to skip again Ive been using for over a year none of the settings have changed in the menus This is unexplained especially because this issue seems to remain
