schema to oops this will validate successfully is there a way to accomplish this that Im missing Its an obvious problem but for some reason this isnt in the manual How to validate something is a string with all its subtle needs but has a maximum length Seems a really basic one But I cant see any example how it would work I cant do a string valuelength cause that wouldnt work So how to do a validation which takes a primary type and adds optional extras to it
