just like the Vue and React tools do When component contains window then state doesnt showwe have message No state to show I think it is connection with this bugs I have solution my changes in augurysrcutilsserializets import parse stringify from jsan The intent of serialize is to create a function that is itself able to reconstruct param object into an exact clone that includes circular references and objects that are not normally serializable by something like link JSONstringify It returns a string containing the code for the reconstructor function That value can be passed to a Function constructor which will parse it into a function that can then be invoked to recreate the original object In this way we are able to serialize an object for transmission across thread boundaries even if it is very complex and contains unserializable constructs like circular references This is used in our message passing operations to reliably send complex objects function
