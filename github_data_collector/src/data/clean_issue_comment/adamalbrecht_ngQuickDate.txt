resetting calendar view on click in order to cater for any changes within the disabled date ranges replacing ngfocus with ngclick to fix bug with showhide when clicking on the directive Note This is a recreate of as that fork has been deleted Also worth noting that ngQuickDate seems to be failing tests but thats already the case on master not due to these changes Adding readonly option readonlytrue This makes the directive not trigger the popup preventing the user from selecting a date See bottom form data updates according to the model using watch but user cannot manually edit End Date ngQuickDate does not work on mobile devices with the current version of Angular x The reason is that Angular does not emit an ngmousedown when the user taps on a calendar entry Two new options have been added both default to false to prevent breaking changes on legacy installations isTouchDevice Allows ngQuickDate to be manually configured to use ngclick instead of ngmousedown detectTouchDevices Detects if touch is available and uses ngclick or ngmousedown as appropriate Updated version number to Related to this very simple fix updates the calendar available dates when the date picker opens Resolves I added a binding to watch ngDisabled When disabled is true the button is grayedout the cursor changes to notallowed and the date picker does not open It also does not open if the user sets focus by tabbing to the button I also updated demohtml to demonstrate the disabled functionality Also added a couple of tests I need an option to hide weekends This approach adds an additional CSS class to the main calendar table and the stylesheet simply hides the applicable cells As title Adds ok button and deletes instantaneously disappearing option after user picks Date so the user can pick also Time fix Sometimes I need to deal with UTC dates so I updated a little bit Add timezone configuration Accepted values null or UTC Add timezone parameter for angular date filter to show date in UTC timezone Change date format to ISO format so that date string will be parsed as UTC timezone only when the timezone configuration is set to UTC
