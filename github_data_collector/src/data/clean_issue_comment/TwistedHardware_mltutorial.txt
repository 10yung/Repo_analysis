I found your IPython tutorials very helpful but I had to convert them to IPython format to get the notebooks to work Here is the guide for converting to IPython style widgets For the most part it makes the code look better css properties are now direct attributes and button styles can be set with buttonstyle attribute etc Just thought Id report the suggestion at the very least There arent enough good tutorials like this for the IPython widget system
