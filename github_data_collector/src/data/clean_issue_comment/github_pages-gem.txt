Release Diff Before submitting an issue please be sure to x Read the contributing instructions x Update to the latest Gem version run bundle update githubpages This issue affects The site generated by GitHub Pages x Building sites locally The GitHub Pages Gem is intended to help users replicate the GitHub Pages build environment locally If your issue affects both the hosted version and the version previewed locally you may be better suited reporting seeking support in other forums What did you do eg steps to reproduce Create a new repo locally create a Gemfile with gem githubpages group jekyllplugins run bundle install and finally run bundle exec Jekyll serve What did you expect to happen The site to be built and served on localhost What happened instead A build error was shown jekyll Error uninitialized constant FaradayErrorClientError Did you mean FaradayClientError Additional information As far as I was able to narrow the issue down it has something to do with faraday being installed by the above listed steps After manually lowering the version to the last release before in Gemfilelock and rerunning bundle install everything worked fine Hello benbalter and parkr I was wondering if this projectGitHub would whitelist a simple text plugin that added anchor tags to headings to allow for linking Right now there are only the following options Use Kramdown which supports this natively Con GitHub uses Commonmark so there may be some rendering differences Incorporate Con Liquid rendering can be a slow process and for a site with many pages this adds overhead Con you must copypaste a file into your site preventing the ability for easy updates Use a JavaScript solution like anchorjs Con adds unnecessary clientside dependencies I dont think the plugin I am proposing exists yet so Id be happy to write one if itd be considered for inclusion Thanks Summary When githubpages is listed under the group jekyllplugins in the Gemfile then on regeneration a site has its assetscssstylecss overridden by one bundled with one of the themes in the gem This issue came to my notice while investigating jekylljekyll This issue affects The site generated by GitHub Pages maybe maybe not x Building sites locally Steps to reproduce Set up a Jekyll site with at least the following Gemfile ruby source gem githubpages group jekyllplugins assetscssstylecss with the following css h color red An indexhtml that uses the above stylesheet either via a layout or directly html DOCTYPE html html head meta charsetUTF titleTest Sitetitle link relstylesheet hrefassetscssstylecss head body h Hello Worldh body html Serve the site locally and preview at bundle exec jekyll serve Trigger a regeneration by just adding content to the landing page diff h Hello Worldh pLorem ipsum dolor sit ametp What did you expect to happen Expected the landing page to be rendered with the new content What happened instead The following would illustrate better Before regeneration beforeregen After regeneration afterregen Jekyll is out and brings lots of nice improvements It would be really nice if githubpages gem would add support for Jekyll Hello Can someone help me I am using Affilated themes While testing the theme the archive function works fine on localhost but not in Github host It says file not found Release Diff Until today I have been using any of the many githubpages images out there Today however I encountered a bug in the latest versions and I was trying to find where it came from The bug is still there something with an else not being recognised and already reported but while looking I also stumbled on this pagesgem repository and saw the Dockerfile in there This means there is an official docker image I can use But it seems this repository is not yet linked to a dockerhub organisation Would it be possible to link a dockerhub github organisation to this repository so we could always have an uptodate docker image on dockerhub Right now I have forked this repository to try and see if it was possible to use the repository as is in dockerhub And yes it takes only a few minutes to set up but once its there its free needs no maintenance and will automatically build a new image based on the latest tag starting with the next tag youll add to this repository The setup I use Source repository phpqapagesgem Build rule Source type tag Source v Docker Tag Dockerfile location Dockerfile Build Context only available on edit Autobuild true Build caching true Build rule Source type tag Source v Docker Tag alpine Dockerfile location Dockerfilealpine Build Context only available on edit Autobuild true Build caching true This will build a docker image every time a new tag is added to the github repository You can see the example at based on I use it with the following dockercomposeyml file that will serve your site with a dockercompose up d to on a Mac as there is a PWD in there version volumes website driver local driveropts o bind type none device PWD services jekyll image phpqagithubpagesgemv command jekyll serve H P watch forcepolling verbose ports target published protocol tcp mode host volumes type volume source website target srcsite volume nocopy true You could also add some build hooks to also add a latest tag but that would only be an improvement This allows users to explicitly turn off math engine and syntax highlighter of kramdown following I also applied the changes requested by parkr to prevent nonnil values I would like to request adding for support jekyllfurigana as a whitelisted plugin This plugin supports displaying Japanese with furigana like NHK easy news
