problem to do this My R Ver and Rstudio Ver is Regards downloadfile does not work with HTTP Changed interactive into iterative and What are the false negative rates for padjust What are the false negative rates for padjust What are the false negative rates for qvalues What are the false negative rates for qvalues I see several issues in this section The section in the printed book p states Assuming most genes are differentially expressed across individuals then if the Poisson model is appropriate there should be a linear relationship in this plot It is not explained why this should be so Is it referring to the mean and standard deviation in the Poisson distribution both being lambda But that wasnt covered in the course The plot which is then generated in thunk varvsmean displays variance against means I think this should be standard deviation Indeed plotting sd against means shows a pretty linear picture with the diagonal cutting through the middle In the paragraph following the figure it is unclear what the this refers to The reason for this is that the variability plotted here includes biological variability Does the this refer to linearity or the absence of linearity That paragraph introduces the concepts of biological variability and sampling variability as if they had been discussed previously I dont think they are defined at any earlier point in the book Also given the seemingly quite linear relation does this point still hold water PS thanks for the great course and the book
