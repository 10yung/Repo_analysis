I realised that using the continuous vision request creates a leak when the arviewcontroller is dismissed it stays in the heap Is it possible to get depth z position of the detected object without user tap Hi how could I get the percentage of confidence or accuracy of the prediction Thanks I cleaned up the code a bit Large method in ViewControllerswift has been split into few smaller ones I also replaced flatMap method call with compactMap according to Swift changes Prior to this commit the debug text field was partially obscured by the rounded corner and notch of the iPhone X This commit constraints the text field with the safe area instead of the whole view to make it clearly visible on all devices Hi hanleyweng Im doing a same thing as your project and Im dealing with a big performance problem when running with a bigger coreml model mb Whenever the coreml perform its request the arkit camera previewer get a flick It seems like the coreml performing is blocked the rendering for a few milliseconds I tried to run the bigger model on your project as well and there wasthe same issues do you have any idea
