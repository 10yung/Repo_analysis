I am confused with the viriable responseup in dispinxcrop dispinarea floattotstride responseupin additionwhat is the reason for calculating the distance like thisCan you explain it The tracking results give four values while the groundtruth is eight How to judge whether the result is good or bad Hi Luca Thanks for your work I would like to fine tune your pretrained Imagenet weights using my smallish video data Approximately how many videos and frame pairs would I need to get good results Also is there any reason why you did not use negative pairs in your training Undefined function or variable vlimreadjpeg Error in vidimagestats line imgs vlimreadjpegfiles numThreads There seems to be no such a function vlimreadjpeg defined neither in matlab nor in source code How do you fix it Hi Thank you for your contribution When I trained the network I have a problem that Error using vlnnbnorm operator operator Error in dagnnBatchNormbackward line vlnnbnorminputs params params derOutputs Error in dagnnLayerbackwardAdvanced line derInputs derParams objbackward Error in dagnnDagNNeval line objlayerslblockbackwardAdvancedobjlayersl Error in cnntraindagprocessEpoch line netevalinputs paramsderOutputs holdOn s paramsnumSubBatches Error in cnntraindag line net state processEpochnet state params train Error in experiment line net stats cnntraindagnet imdb batchfn optstrain Error in runexperiment line experimentimdbvideo opts How to solve it Thank you very much Hi Thanks for providing this helpful codebase I am trying to use imagenet video dataset also and I might have to implement a python version since I use python in my project I do not understand the details of this codebase Will the code generate image chips with the objects in their centers and will the generated chips be fixed in their sizes bertinetto zhangliliang With the siamesefc v code the file named archdot is missing Where could I download it Thanks I use matconvert beta and matlab acudn When i run runexperimentimdbvideothe error message that appears is as follows Hi In your tracking code a parameter called wInfluence is set to I know it aims at control the influence of consine window I want to know why the numeric is Is it a hyperparameter need to adjust by experiments Thanks Hi I start training the siamesefc but I have some questions about the training process I want to know the differents between eltwiselabel and label Another question is that how long do you train the model on one Titan X The last question in your paper you say each epoch is consist of sampled pairs but in your code each epoch contain train data and val data The sum of and is not equal to I guess maybe you have some change on your code after the paper or what Thank you very much
