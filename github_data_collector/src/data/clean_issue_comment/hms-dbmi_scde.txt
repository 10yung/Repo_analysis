In short Id like to do something like pagodashowpathwayscGO varinfo goenv cellclustering hc margins c showcelldendrogram TRUE showRowLabels TRUE showPC TRUE but for clusters shown in the pagodaviewaspects plot such as genecluster Thanks JP Hi I want to cite the package SCDE in my paper But I do not know how to discribe the rationale of this packages Most importantly it is difficlult for me to understand the parameters including lb mle ub ce Z and cZ I have attempted to search the relevant information in your paper publised on journalNature MethodBayesian approach to singlecell differential expression analysis But my effort ended in failure Could you explain the meaning behind these parameters or provide me some learning materials to read Thank you Hi I mentioned in that after several attempts i still have the flexmix problems which remains unaddressed up to this day I noticed that you have made some updates on biodonductor page I happened to have a new PC with me in completely new and clean environment Win I installed R and then run your installation scripts if requireNamespaceBiocManager quietly TRUE installpackagesBiocManager BiocManagerinstallscde version For older versions of R please refer to the appropriate Bioco The installation run smoothly and after that I was able to load scde Below are the sessionInfo R version Platform x w mingw x bit Running

done for the denovo identified pathways The gene sets Im working with were generated based on genegene correlations so I want to be careful and not estimate the statistical significance of their overdispersion Thanks Livnat Error in checkSlotAssignmentobject name value assignment of an object of class expression is not valid for slot defineComponent in an object of class FLXMRglmC isvalue

it ended up being successful finally other than that i also downgrade the flexmix package to version However our server Linux based recently went through some upgrade and they are now providing R and R instead of the old that i worked on I have successfully installed scde package on our servers new R under my own folder nonadmin and i am still struggling to install scde for its new R on our server as of now Unfortunately even for the R that has now a scde installed as i reran my old codes of PAGODA it reported a lot of errors adjusting library size based on entries cell calculating cellcell similarities done fitting cell models cell IS Error in newFLXMRglmCf FLXMRglmC family family mu mu could not find function new cell IS Error in newFLXMRglmCf FLXMRglmC family family mu mu could not

wondering if you have a way to import x data cheers I couldnt install it in Windows but I tried Bioconductor and it works Kindly add how to install it using bioconductor in your wiki page Hi Ive tried regressing out continuous confounders eg cell cycle so that the differential expression results wont be effected by them but it doesnt work I get the same results I tried using pagodasubtractaspect but then when I run scdeexpressiondifference it makes no difference Would be great if there is a way to make it work Thanks a lot Livnat
