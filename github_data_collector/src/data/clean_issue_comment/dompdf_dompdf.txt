When the PDFLib backend is in use and an element on the page is styled with a border radius the clipping path is rendered incorrectly This is because the method used to define the clipping path clippingroundrectangle just calls the clippingrectangle method As a result the path drawn by the nonrounded method does not overlap the path of the container element in a way that results in appropriate clipping Example HTML div stylewidth px height px border px solid black borderradius px backgroundcolor orangediv Output clipping While in the process of upgrading a product to PHP we ran into an issue where AdapterPDFLibsetlinestyle performs a count on dash In some cases dash is null instead of an empty array It appears that this method was called with null because the calling methods have style defaulted to null in the parameter lists I can see two possible solutions to this Update AdapterPDFLibsetlinestyle to cast dash to array Sets the line style param float width param cap param string join param array dash return void protected function setlinestylewidth cap join dash dash arraydash if countdash dash dash Update the default parameters that cause the null to be empty array Four methods in Canvas line rectangle polygon circle Ex function rectanglex y w h color width style null function rectanglex y w h color width style Four methods in AdpaterPDFLIb corresponding to the Canvas methods Ex param float x param float y param float w param float h param array color param float width param null style param array style public function rectanglex y w h color width style null public function rectanglex y w h color width style Both of these above solutions appear to resolve the issue and I can create a PR with a solution let me know which is preferred and if you would like me to create the PR Is it possible to preset a pdf document to use duplex both sides of a sheet of paper printing when creating a PDF with dompdf Ive seen that in Word docs this presetting parameter is possible but not sure if it is possible with pdfs Tried to ask via stackoverflow but the question was closed as not being a software question pdf print duplex landscape output not returning always return portrait output only Problem It failed to load custom font from external Solution Add write permission to vendordompdfdompdflibfonts directory Hope this help Im concerned about updates here hindering my ability to upgrade to PHP quickly The past releases for this package were almost a year apart Currently the milestone for contains more open issues Theres a few issues here related to PHP compatibility that releasing sooner rather than later would add a decent amount of value to the community allowing folks to proceed with upgrading to PHP who dont need to take advantage of the other bug fixes Is the team open to shipping a smaller release containing smaller improvementsfixes Warning continue targeting switch is equivalent to break Did you mean to use continue in
