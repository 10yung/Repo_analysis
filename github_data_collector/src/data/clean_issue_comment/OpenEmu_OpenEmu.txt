When I play any N game and save state for the second time OpenEmu freezes I have to force quit and reopen the app I tested this with multiple games and it freezes with all of them Tried Super Nintendo no freezing Works fine I was on so I installed by just dragging into applications folder then telling the system to replace the file Tried everything again and it still freezes Running macOSX It freezes with or without my PS controller plugged in Also this didnt happen before I updated to today So maybe I need to do a more thorough down grade than just dragging the app into the applications folder Any ideas Howdy Thanks for adding GameCube support to OpenEmu its been a blast so far I know its been in the pipeline for a while so congrats and well done Im wondering if we can expect support for other graphics backends for the Dolphin core like Vulkan Im not sure which API that OpenEmu is using I would assume OpenGL however as it runs similarly to Dolphin when Im using OpenGL ie some significant buffering and lag in heavy sequences like Metroid Primes opening cutscene Vulkan however runs that cutscene much smoother when I use the Dolphin emulator outside of OpenEmu I think support for Vulkan makes sense as Apple deprecated OpenGL and will probably remove support any day now Vulkan uses the Metal API through a translation layer Im no expert though and I could be completely wrong about all of this My specs OpenEmu v macOS v GHz Quad Core Intel Core i NVIDIA GeForce GTX M Gamepad input glitches everywhere with v Reverted back to and everything works fine The gamepad Im using is a RetroLink USB N Controller Steps to reproduce Select gamepad as input in the controller menu Assign buttons Sometimes will not allow you to assign buttons sometimes will Select a game and open it Expected Behavior Game should function normally buttons on gamepad should correspond with actions in game when pressed Observed Behavior Some buttons do not function in some games there is a hard drift to the left with analog stick or several directions of analog stick not registering at all When assigning gamepad buttons sometimes OpenEmu will allow buttons to be assigned sometimes not Quitting and restarting OpenEmu may allow you to assign buttons but the issues with buttons and analog play as stated above still exist Examples In Mario Kart the analog stick does not register left or right In Tony Hawks Pro Skater there is a hard drift to the left Debugging Information OpenEmu Version No issues in previous builds with this gamepad and OS macOS Version Mojave Summary of issue Xbox One controller bluetooth model S is no longer working correctly Analog sticks no longer mapped by the emulator Steps to reproduce Update OpenEmu to Connect Xbox One S Pad by Bluetooth using macOS Catalina official controller drivers Pad with batteries fully recharged When trying to map the Xbox One controller the analog L and R is no longer working properly OpenEmu cannot map the analog sticks anymore or is mapping them in wrong places eg when trying to map Y axis for UP the emulator automatically sets Y for LEFT not allowing for manual correction Reverting OpenEmu to solves the problem when the Pad is fully working Observed Behavior Controller doesnt work via Bluetooth or wired Pad is brand new used without problems in previous builds of OpenEmu The problem still continues even using thirdparty drivers unofficial FranticRains Controller The problem still continues in previous macOS release Mojave Neither updating or doing a clean OpenEmu installation seems to solve the problem Only reverting to the previous version Debugging Information OpenEmu Version Hardware Mac mini Late with macOS Catalina OpenEmu Version Thank you for adding new system support OpenEmu is now becoming the most definitive reason to stay on Mac I have a question that some GC games need multiple discs for example Baten Kaitos since the core is different from Mednafen the m u method seemed not applicable Is there any method to support multiple discs GC games I moved my game library to an external hard drive using the change dialogue in library settings I then later moved it back to the original location using the reset dialogue in library settings Everything moved over but on clicking any game to run it an exclamation point appears and it says a rom file couldnt be found I can locate the files theyre all in the right place but what has happened How can I relink everything properly and automatically so I dont have to locate the file each time Thankyou for any assistance
