What is the use case for multiple hosts I cannot seem to find any information on when you should use multiple hosts Is it for an Enterprise Cluster or a HA deployment If it is for a HA then how do you specify the relay server for writes The commit breaks the clients that passed the port inside host An example js host somehost This ends up being because host is actually treated as hostname without port under the hood Naming issue In fact the host object from thisgetHost was always broken even prior to that commit Host backoff ExponentialBackoff options initial max random counter options url Url protocol http slashes true auth null host somehost port hostname somehost hash null search null query null pathname path href Now that it is relying on hosturlpathname boom My suggestion rename host to hostname or remove the port option and let users concatenate both together into host Deprecate x and release x
