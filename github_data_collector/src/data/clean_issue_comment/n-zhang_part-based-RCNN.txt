Hi All In this code is it compulsory requires a bounding boxes information for test data or not please any one help me on this doubt Thanking in advance Hi All runm file gives Subscripted assignment dimension mismatch to runm file gives Subscripted assignment dimension mismatch error Hi Ning Looks like there is one function missing for the scalefeature Could you provide the file to reproduce the result Thanks How can I reproduce the results for the case when the bounding box is given Currently it seems that the code only calculates it for the case where bounding box is unknown So I found a slight mismatch between the results reported in the paper and the results I obtained running your code didnt change anything If I run the code I get run Accuracy Accuracy of using oracle part boxes is Accuracy Accuracy of box is Accuracy Accuracy of prior is Accuracy Accuracy of neighbor is I assume that these results except the oracle one are for the case of Bounding Box Unknown These results match the ones reported in the paper except for the neighbor case The accuracy of neighbor is in the paper while is reported by the code Can you clarify what caused the mismatch Thanks in advance In the readme it says Change rcnn path in initm But in initm file there is no where to set it
