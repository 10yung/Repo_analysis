Would be nice if the API doc had some examples of returned data Ideally in both XML and JSON This can probably be done by anyone as long as long as they have permission to edit the documentation Hi lachlan when using the current develop version I experienced an empty album list on the artist page In the debug log the following error occurs xyz dbaclass Errorquery SQL SELECT MAXalbumid AS id albumreleasetype albummbid FROM album LEFT JOIN song ON songalbumalbumid LEFT JOIN catalog ON catalogid songcatalog WHERE songartist OR albumalbumartist GROUP BY albumprefix albumname albumalbumartist albumreleasetype albummbid albumyear ORDER BY albumname albumdisk albumyear xyz dbaclass Errorquery MSG Expression of ORDER BY clause is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column ampachealbumdisk which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause this is incompatible with sqlmodeonlyfullgroupby This error is independent of the used MySQL version x or and depends on the used sqlmodeonlyfullgroupby Please validate the provided fix and merge if it is ok for you Br Hello I have problems with the dropbox catalog I always get the message ERROR No media updated do you respect the patterns What can you do I have done the same thing with freshly installed servers Id like to make several suggestions that should increase the appearance of professionalism and hopefully improve the teams skills as developers Make use of the Ampache developer team space Ask Afterster to give you maintainer status and then induct the current active developers into the team Use the discussion feature to explore any anticipated modifications If the change is not a bug fix why wasnt the change you want to make already implemented Because they didnt think of it is not the answer Will the change remove an implied feature How will the change affect existing clients Dont be afraid to delegate Create a subteam of one or more to review every PR Its always good to have a different viewpoint Create a subteam for every major milestone Remove patch releases mostly for appearances and with the release of they are unecessary Too many patch releases in such a short time can hurt the Ampache image Change to prerelease for awhile for the same reason This will tend to limit a buggy release to the diehard Ampache patriots All future releases should at first be prereleases for this reason Make more use of the project space It is public and can be used to inform the public of timelines goals and mileposts Including timelines for retiring versions IMHO I think that having a companion client would do much to improve Ampaches popularity I think most of the popular multimedia platforms provide their own client Yes an increasing number of clients exist for Ampache but provide only a limited number of features A companion client should exemplify the full power of the Ampache server The above is my attempt to inject the appearance of professionalism into an open source unfunded project And hopefully attract the interest of additional contributors Also if the team members have the discipline to follow through with the above suggestions Im sure they will discover that their skills as a developer will significantly improve Description Describe the bug No artwork is displayed in the webpage To reproduce Open MusicAlbums Even if I click on the cog for an album artwork to editfind art and select an image when I go back to the album page it is still not shown Expected behavior See some artwork in webpage Note that with my other client DSub artwork is shown Environment Ampache version Web server version Apache v ubuntu debsuryorg PHP v ubuntu debsuryorg Server operating system Ubuntu Client operating system Ubuntu Firefox Client type Web Settings Vanilla Log Gather Art log ampache log Before submitting a feature request make sure to search to see if its already been suggested Please be as descriptive as you can be about your feature No request is too big or too small and if it make sense there is a good chance it will be approved and make it into Ampache However there is no guarantee on the timeframe The quickest way for a feature to make it into Ampache is for you to submit a pull request yourself Describe what you dont like about Ampache or what it is missing I wonder if it is not possible to write the play counter into the id tag of the file Describe how you would like the feature to work After playing the song the playcount will be increased and written into the id tag Delete any section that is not relevant in this template Before posting an issue please try to reproduce with the latest develop branch There is a good chance a fix is already pending for the next version No issue will be considered before confirmation on the develop branch Any text between and will be removed automatically Description Describe the bug Explain in detail what is happening I cannot edit a smart playlist or search songs Search albums artists and playlists are not affected Not sure if it is my configuration or a general error Tried with Firefox Chrome and Edge To reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Go to Smart Playlists Click on any existing smart playlist Scroll down to rules No existing rules are show and add rule button doesnt do anything Expected behavior What you believe should have happened Should see existing rules and have the ability to delete and add more Screenshots If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem Environment Ampache version aec ceb e d aed b d c Web server version Apache Server

Web Firefox Chrome or Edge Ampache Settings Either put a description of your settings or paste the contents of confampachecfgphp after removing sensitive information server host database connection etc If posting full config file make sure to put triple backticks at the top and bottom to make it into a code block It may also make sense to post PHP settings depending on the situation Logs To enable logging visit Please post relevant Ampache logs and web server accesserror logs making sure to surround in triple backticks to make into a code block If you have large logs it may make sense to
