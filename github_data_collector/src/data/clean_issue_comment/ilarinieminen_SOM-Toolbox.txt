This fork lets the standard irisdata example run under Octave Hi I start woking with SOM in order to know what the toolbox is capable to do Im running the demo scrpits using Matlab R a When I was running the second demo the program stops in the fourth step and show the message actually Im not very good using Matlab but so I thought I can deal with the error changing some variables names but didnt work I appreciate if someone can help me with this Hi When I use somstats to get statistics across clusters it returns NaN for some clusters although there are hits in those clusters and would be good to have numbers for them Attached is an example with Iris data capture capture I tried to correct somstats by changing row into if nargin isemptybins sumisnanbins but it does not help would appreciate your help with that Hey Im despratly needing help with one issue But Im currently using this Toolbox for my masterthesis The task of my masterthesis is to compare different accurate CO sensors for the ocean Therefor I should creat a neural network and should find out which one is providing more accurate results The idea is that one sensor is less expensiv but has an accurancy of atm and the other one is more expensiv and works with an accurancy of atm I should now determine if the neural network provids better results when I train it with the double the amount of unaccurate data My biggest problem is that I dont know where I can tell the neural network the accurancy of the data that it use to be trained Maybe someone here knows a function which I need to use to tell MatLab about the accurancy of the Training data If you know something to help me I would be very very glad I hope you understand my problem and can help me Recently I want to construct a som model using somtoolbox in matlab I have SST sea surface temperature images Each image is pixels by pixels And each SST image was transformed into a single row vector by concatenating image rows So that the input matrix consisted of rows image and columns pixels But when I run the following codesome errors occured Could you please tell me how to solve this problem Thanks for your consideration clcclear prepare

everyone There is a way to parallelize the sommake or sombatchtrain functions I want to speed up this functions but I dont have the Parallel Computing Toolbox I am trying to get a selection of hits from som map for this object I use somselect function However I cant get GUI i get the next answer I am trying to get a selection of hits from SOM map for this object I use somselect function However I cant get GUI I get the next answer somselect Error using getfield at Not enough input arguments Error in somselectdrawcolorselection at for i getfieldsizerepy repxi repxi i end Error in somselect at drawcolorselectioncnamesccolors I have used SOM struct initial dataset size of SOM struct size of initial datasets but these aren t successful input arguments Somebody know other way to select hits of my SOM an example o turorial to practice thanks I was wondering how to deal with binary coded input data when other distance measurement metrics than Euclidean are necessary Are there any functions supporting eg Hamming or Jaccard distance metrics or Where can I specify those I look forward to receiving any response to decide if I should further use it for my project Thanks for your support i am a SOM newbieforgive me Noticed the following in somsomshowm matlab Set text property interp to none in title texts sethlabelinterpreternone Would be nice if could switch between standard text interpretation and LaTeX interpretation for component subplot titles Made a start on this here willfurnassSOMToolboxtreetextitleinterpreting but having problems with keyword argument parsing any pointers gratefully received Hi How do I deal with NaNs in the data Thanks
