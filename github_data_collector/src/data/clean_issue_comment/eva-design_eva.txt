Perhaps it makes sense to introduce arrays in token values for cases like borderWidth margin etc This can help us to more deeply customize some components to mimic other design systems add tsnode script that generates control parameter type definitions Fixes js mapping generation scripts Fixes mapping customization scripts We are a Windows shop here NET C Angular Providing the design system only for Sketch prevents our company from using your Nebular product Our designers cannot use any of your design assets Any plans to make this work for the Adobe suite We can add an Icon to an Input component but there is no design system predefined rules on feedback icon press feedback Related issue I am not sure if this is the right place for this or if this is something you would even consider to be as within the scope of the project but I wanted to propose that while we have an Angular implementation of the components that it might also be beneficial to develop a native Web Components implementation that was framework agnostic The main benefits as I see it would be Native Web Components would allow each component to be integrated with any of the main front end frameworks not just Angular thus improving the potential reach and impact of the project It also allows the use of the components without any kind of framework and could just be used with nothing more than native browser APIs All the obvious future proofing of the project that would come as a result of points and above I was reviewing the code of the design system and I realized that is a good idea create a tool for generate themes and new mappings automatically It could be created a tool that receive a JSON in a specific format and generate a new evadesign theme and then upload this new theme and mapping to a centralized repository right Im very exited with the UI library for React Native and I wolud like to help to grow this project D So tell me if this approach exist in the roadmap of this project or if is possible help with a PR Report Reason Multiple Users requests Mapping Changes No Design OK Mobile OK Web OK Report Checkbox inputs etc disabled colors are too light Simply saying it makes it very hard to see the elements Reason Multiple Users requests Mapping Changes TBD changes in themes and in the mappings Design OK Mobile OK Web OK
