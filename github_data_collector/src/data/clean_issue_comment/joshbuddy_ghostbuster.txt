When trying to get request a url I get this weird message The request for timed out Although for the site is online at that exact port on the exact page Any Suggestions EDIT This is my code phantomtestroot phantomtestaddMyTest function thisget function thissucceed Im imagining writing something like this to test user to user interactions via websockets coffeescript phantomtestadd Pinging via push session get user bodyclick pingUser session get user bodyassertFirst newPings ping pinginnerHTML user wait succeed Is something like it in the works Or would it necessitate a complete overhaul Thanks When attempting to run tests Im consistently having them time out Even after a long startwait say two minutes it still times out During that two minute window I can access the app server via my browser so it is definitely running If I do the same above but dont attempt to connect via the browser ie just let ghostbuster do its thing no requests are logged I watch a tail of the log and ghostbuster doesnt actually hit the application Im currently running this against a Rails application with the Thin web server There should be a helper for dumping the page contents to a file and this should be automatically done when a test fails I tried to use consolelogpagecontent after clicking a link The last screenshot showed a new page but the logging showed html from the previous page Wait is a hack that slows things down and can give incorrect results I think it would be easy enough to follow links by using onLoadStarted and onLoadFinished However onLoadFinished does not get triggered for me Any ideas
