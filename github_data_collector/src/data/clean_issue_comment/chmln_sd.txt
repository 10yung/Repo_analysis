It would be nice to able to do a search and replace on an entire tree of files Using fd also find with exec should provide more easy and comfortable ways ref When trying some search replace where I wanted to match something only if the line was starting with it I wanted to use the usual to flag the beginning of the line The result was a fail of the match wail getting rid of it resulted in fine matching I tried to escaping it guessing that as is used for variables it probably needs some escaping to flag the end of a line the same way but this didnt work as well I guess that and should somehow be usable to flag beginning and end of the line replacementstxt txt value replacement test TEST sh sd replacements replacementstxt filetxt I am trying to use sd to remove some values from a NULseparated file but it does nothing to the file zsh zsh sd flags m stringmode i attic cat v attic this is this is this is hi blue boy cat v i this is this is this is Issue In benchmark Ive noticed that you werent using p option for sd to print everything to stdout Nevertheless sedcommands print everything to stdout Also once sd w dumpjson devnull is performed every word in file is deleted This happens because is replaced by shell with empty string and sd performs inplace or inline replacement Experiment Here is my run for a simple thing tmp echo hello world testtxt tmp cat testtxt hello world tmp hyperfine sd w testtxt Benchmark sd w testtxt Time mean ms ms User ms System ms Range min max ms ms runs tmp cat testtxt Please pay attention to the second cat output This is the reason why almost every run of sd is so fast except the first one it doesnt do anything but just reading the file The following command should be used to compete with sed hyperfine sd p w testtxt devnull Please note the escaped groups and the preview option p Experiment Results Here are my results for a MB file tmp l dumpjson rwrr M sergey Aug dumpjson tmp hyperfine sed E s w g dumpjson devnull sed s w g dumpjson devnull sd p w dumpjson devnull Benchmark sed E s w g dumpjson devnull Time mean s s User s System s Range min max s s runs Benchmark sed s w g dumpjson devnull Time mean s s User s System s Range min max s s runs Benchmark sd p w dumpjson devnull Time mean s s User s System s Range min max s s runs Summary sed s w g dumpjson devnull ran times faster than sed E s w g dumpjson devnull times faster than sd p w dumpjson devnull tmp l dumpjson rwrr M sergey Aug dumpjson Thoughts Even if we fixed the benchmark I do think that we are capped with pipe throughput UPD Ok apparently pipe is not a problem Platform MBP GHz Intel Core i apt install sd doesnt work I have found that cargo is need before install sd Do you have a plan publish sd to ubuntu apt I assume the majority of users who come across sd are likely also using other popular Rustbased CLI tools like fd and rg sharkdpfdapprsL L BurntSushiripgrepapprsL L For consistency with the above it would be neat if sds options were consistent with these to make context switching a bit easier Ref While I use sd daytoday for common replacement tasks I find myself falling back to ruplacer whenever I need its subvert functionality It would be amazing if sd supported this via a new option or flag so I could fully switch to sd for all my replacement needs Im using the Windows version and this is the command Its working with many other tools but not with sd set patternCall ListText dKeyDownUp vbKeyReturn set replace Call GetFM ReturnKey sdexe pattern replace Testtxt Testtxt contains this Text text Call Text KeyDownIndex vbKeyReturn Call Text KeyDownIndex vbKeyReturn Call Text KeyDownIndex vbKeyReturn Call Text KeyDownIndex vbKeyReturn It gets replaced with text Text KeyDownIndex GetFM ReturnKey vbKeyReturn Text KeyDownIndex GetFM ReturnKey vbKeyReturn Text KeyDownIndex GetFM ReturnKey vbKeyReturn Text KeyDownIndex GetFM ReturnKey vbKeyReturn Im Missing the first capture group and the Call word Can you tell me if Im doing something wrong or if its a bug As other tools are working with the same pattern and replace strings I think its a bug in sd
