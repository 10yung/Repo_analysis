Sorry to be this much annoying I need help please I have a list of genes that have been previously reported in the COSMIC database about ESCA I also have my own maf object for my tumours in ESCA How can I show the status of COSMIC genes in oncoplot of my maf object please Something like this nihms f For example showing in my oncoplot if a gee has been previously reported in COSMIC or any information like if this is a false positive belong to big gene families like TTN etc Thank you for any help Hi Thanks for this software Can we show alongside the plots come from GISTIC visualization Something like this nihms f Thank you in advance for any help for getting this Can I easily extract which mutations are within each of the clusters in each of the genes For example if the oncodrive results say there are mutations in clusters and there are clusters can extract each cluster and its contents Thanks I am using the options sortByAnnotation TRUE groupAnnotationBySize FALSE and annotationOrder c NA and the samples in the heatmap are plotted in a desirable order However the clinical legend is in an unappealing seemingly random order Hi For each patient I have been given vcf for snp and indel separately So I annotated those separately by annovar I am not sure how I could deal with these in maftools Should I combine vcf for snp and indels before annotation by annovar or maftools can find the matched snp and indel files for each patient Thank you for any help Hi dear authour When I use oncodrive function of maftools there is the following error message My sript is lamlsig oncodrivemaf laml minMut pvalMethod zscore The message Estimating background scores from synonymous variants Assuming protein change information are stored under column HGVSpShort Use argument

is discontinued is this gonna be updated to use with their new foncotator Hi Resently I used extractSignatures to get signaturesbut it alway reported bug as below So how could I can deal with this bug

tumour suppressor genes and downloads a database from TSGene r tumourSuppressors readdelimHumanTSGstxt GeneSymbol lengthtumourSuppressors There are genes The user wants to see the top mutated tumour suppressor genes top but maftools creates an unreadable plot containing all of the genes A second problem is that it doesnt seem possible to only plot copy number variants even if providing a dummy

plenty of high frequency copy number variants which could be in place of the fake gene rare SNP I have to set top to see the top copy number genes as shown below
