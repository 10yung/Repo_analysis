 how can you add sound to the tiles when they move Thanks img To reproduce this bug just swipe really fast on the device Im not really sure how to go about fixing this when you filled the board and get the game over overlay clicking new game will remove all the tiles on board but will sometimes fail to initialize adding two new tiles similar to previous problem pressing restart in the beginning or middle of the game will remove all the tiles on board but will sometimes fail to initialize adding two new tiles i think the issue is related to iOS being async with sprite kit run actions both scenario described above runs the same block of code on M GameManagerm As you wanted I created a pull request Now you can see all changes When you swipe a lot of times in any direction quickly the tiles go out the board And some blocks become unavailable ios simulator screen shot sept
