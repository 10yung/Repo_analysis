Add support for authenticating with the Nakama server by providing Facebook Instant Game signed player information Depends on Description It would be useful to get a list of the keys in a collection of the DataStorage without getting the full content Use case Im trying to write a news popup that lists news to players But before opening the popup Id like to show the number of unread news to players in the news button without reading all the news and their content which is what happens if I call ListUsersStorageObjectsAsync Because most of the time they wont open that popup One news item is a storage Object in the collection inbox owned by the system user So Id like to get all keys in that collection to compare with the ones the player has already read Thanks we have a lot of system owned records and in the console theres no way to see them all or filter them by collection name It seems theres a max limit of how many records will display for a user and no pagination controls to see additional records Alternately or in addition to be able to filter records per user by collection name would be handy Description As explained in we want to have a way from the client to easily demote user in a group While current method to demote is available via removing from group and then readded it from the pov of the user being demoted will received two messages kicked and then added which will cause confusion to that user It would be better to handle it if we have message code for Demotion and a way for a client to demote user Context x Unity Your Environment Nakama Description I believe these are separate but related issues ContentType in response is controlled by AcceptEncoding instead of Accept in request Given request contains AcceptEncoding identity ContentType in response is reported as textplain despite Nakama actually sends json both with unwraptrue and without Steps to Reproduce Create a lua module which responds anything to incoming request Send GET request with headers AcceptEncoding gzip deflate or AcceptEncoding identity Accept applicationjson Expected Result Server response has ContentType applicationjson Actual Result Server response has ContentType applicationxgzip or ContentType textplain charsetutf Your Environment Nakama Database does not matter Environment name and version does not matter Operating System and version does not matter It would be nice to be able to enter the matchmaking as more than player looking a match The use case is local couch multiplayer games where you can have friends at home and want to play with more players from elsewhere Suggestion json query presences mincount maxcount Before you submit an issue we recommend you drop into the Gitter community and ask any questions you have or mention any problems youve had getting started with the server Please provide as much information as you can with this issue report If you believe it may be an issue with one of the client libraries please report

Reproduce Example Register a new user Connect to server socket Send message to fetch current users friends Errors reported to client and in server logs Rename the extension of the attached file to go its a go module Build an so and start the server with it Using postman or any other tool for sending requests Auth Send this request to this RPC URL BODY command ADD id id score Send this request to this RPC URL BODY command GET id id Expected Result Example No error is thrown and results are returned by server There shouldnt be any discrepancies in the meowner position and the real position on
