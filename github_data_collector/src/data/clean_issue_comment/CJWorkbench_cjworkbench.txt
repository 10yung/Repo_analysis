In fact this issue has two different cases Account creation on social login locale id is not set correctly its always the default one We can easily fix this by overriding allauths social account adapter see commit Social login with existing account locale cookie is never written because execution does not pass from our login view for normal logins so the locale shown after login is the one that it was before login instead of the one saved in user profile Since we need a response on which to set the cookie and since each social provider has different urls and views this cant be fixed equally easily The hamburger menu is hidden for not loggedin users hence they do not have access to locale switcher In lesson VIII Make a chart of police stops by race the file cannot be found it throws Service Unavailable Encountered three times different workflows create a workflow and try to edit it after several hours It works as read only cant edit or create a new tab tab shows but cant move to it or rename it and disappears when browser is refreshed Last workflow tested was last edited hours back Using Chrome on Win I can still start a new workflow Further I found if I go back to Workflow List my workflows and open the read only one it becomes editable failed to reproduce later may be server or connectivity or load issues In order to make a new data loader I had to add this to my YAML config yaml idname versionselect type custom name Update This should be in the docs Its supercritical anytime anyone is working with ACS data that they understand that the data has inherent error I see some evidence in the code this was intended to be supported but just hasnt been fully implemented It would be useful if I could add a longer help string for each individual parameter It would make it much less likely a user has to jump out to separate documentation in order to understand how a module works Perhaps this could be displayed as a tooltip alongside the name Currently any Workbench module can only have a single Python module This makes it difficult to write wellfactored and readable code It would be great if we could have the entrypoint discovered either by magic module name eg mainpy or by having it documented in the YAML config Hi when I add from URL a file workbenchdata does inferencing to map the field types Its a great feature but sometimes gives wrong results In example here I import an XLS file and it maps the field CODISTAT as number and its a problem because in the source xls file its a text field And then in workbenchdata the value becomes and its not so good It would be great to have an option in the module to have no inference and have all fields as text field Thank you
