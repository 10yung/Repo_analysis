Browser Name and versionMicrosoft EDGE Operating System and version desktop or mobile I upgraded from sharelatex to through the official docker container I foolishly forgot to duplicate my mongodb before i updated therefore my current mongo database has been migrated When I run all flat text files work beutifully but any binary files dont like pdf jpeg jpg png etc Its as if it cant find the file When you click on a binary it says sorry no preview abailbe and if you click download it cant find the page Now i rolled back to but since i accidentally migrated it without a backup i have a weird issue The share button has disappeared for all of my users I would like to figure out how to roll back the mongo db migration so that the sharebutton returns or else figure out why cant find my binary files Any and all suggestions are welcome Thank you Hello I tried to setup Overleaf and all went well on my test machine But before installing on my main computer I kept playing on the test machine Here we are I just wanted to test my abilities concerning backup and restore the mongodb So here comes the problem I successfully made a backup using this command dockercompose exec T mongo sh c mongodump archive dbdump Just after I created a new project And finally I wanted to restore the old backup using dockercompose exec T mongo sh c mongorestore archive dbdump This did not work since I always got the error E duplicate key error collection I achieved to bypass It with the drop argument dockercompose exec T mongo sh c mongorestore archive drop dbdump However from now the compiler does not work anymore So what is wrong with what I did I dont understand why this happened Thanks for providing opensource overleaf But I got issue when setuping overleaf in my computer Problem I use dockercompose with the dockercomposeyml file to setup overleaf in my computer But I got Bad Gateway Install type Yes I follow the Quick Start Guide and use the dockercomposeyml file in master branch
