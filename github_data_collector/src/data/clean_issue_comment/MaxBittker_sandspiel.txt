the Security Alerts page details Hey there thanks for this game Me and my brothers have already spent hours playing around with it slightlysmilingface It would be nice if there was a way to save and load scenes to and from the local filesystem without using the cloud connection That way you could still save your scenes while offline Hello I was looking for something inspirational to dockerize and put in my teams kubernetes stack for training and education purposes and so when I saw this amazing project I wanted to take a stab at it I created this Dockerfile feel free to use it FROM rustlatest RUN aptget update aptget upgrade RUN aptget install curl gcc y RUN curl sL bash RUN aptget update aptget install nodejs y RUN curl sS aptkey add RUN echo deb stable main tee etcaptsourceslistdyarnlist RUN aptget update aptget install yarn y RUN cargo install wasmpack RUN mkdir sandspiel WORKDIR sandspiel COPY sandspielpackagejson sandspielpackagejson COPY sandspielyarnlock sandspielyarnlock RUN yarn install COPY sandspiel sandspiel RUN cd crate wasmpack build RUN npm run build EXPOSE WORKDIR sandspieldist CMD python m httpserver I was hoping that even if I didnt have a connection to a postgres database and firebase that Id be able to get the Canvas to come up but doesnt seem to work Anyway since I spent a solid day getting a Dockerfile together I wanted to share with you before moving on to find another project to try Again awesome project Super cool to see and the write up was great I made a strong wind tunnel here so you can see the effect all you have to do is add seed and zero gravity seeds I dont know much about internationalization would it be configured with a cookie or via subdomain or something One of the biggest issues is not being able to control saves you have made I had a user system idea but i think this system is more unique and probably easy to get into the game I think there should be a system which a user can claim hashtag and only they can use the hashtag Then a user could put a password to use it Also maybe when you post something you would be given a code that you can use to edit your level Maybe entering this code could grant access to change the name revise or make edits or possibly it would load a page with all the levels with that tag with the options listed before Also i think that there should be a downvote to discourage horrible spam levels These are all my suggestions I dont think i asked to much and all of these are reasonable suggestions So please think about adding these But at the end of the day it is your decision The other day my friend and me were playing this game and we usually put our names on it so we can easily view each others levels this worked kind of like usernames that would make it easy for people to see our work But then someone started spamming inappropriate levels under his name and also made a few bad ones that still havent got unpublished im very lucky to say this hasnt happened to me but if this issue keeps going on it could get worse SolutionUsername system that you can publish saves under your name Also ive noticed its very hard to make builds without jagged lines so i have to rely on undo button alot Solution Copy Paste system andor Zoom in and zoom out feature Light dust press undo its still lit even if you press undo alot of times After running npm i npm run
