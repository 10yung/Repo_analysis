Just thought that Id mention that a downside to using eps for figures is that transparency is not supported As an example I have found that having a legend that is semitransparent and overlaps a curve slightly can allow for a better figure Made some sentence more concise and clear Hope this helps Some packages of mine that may come in handy matplotlib tikz Convert matplotlib figures into native easily editable LaTeX code matlab tikz works the same way betterbib Improve your BibTeX bibliography with online data blacktex Correct some common LaTeX antipatterns Just adding a comment here that I prefer to use one script usually plotpy at top level that has a positional command line argument using argparse for which figures to create This seems cleaner to me because you can keep your plotting functions all in one file and generate multiple figures with a single command I had a journal request that your final PDF should not contain Type fonts and in my case the culprit were matplotlib figures I found that with this setting in configmatplotlibmatplotlibrc you can make matplotlib avoid Type fonts pre psuseafm True pdfuse corefonts True textusetex True pre Maybe you consider this useful and can add it here somewhere
