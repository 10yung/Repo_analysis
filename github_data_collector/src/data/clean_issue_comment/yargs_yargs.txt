robot I have created a release beep boop Features completion takes negated flags into account when booleannegation is set ad This PR was generated with Release Please Hi all it seems that when calling help on a yargs project it can exit before all of the help content has been flushed to stdout I found this while trying to get nycs test suite running consistently on my local machine the nyc issue is here nyc has a test that compares the help output generated by yargs using nyc help and a call to yargsshowHelp These generate the same output most of the time but the call to nyc help may get truncated if the yargs call to processexitcode on line of yargsjs is hit before the buffer has flushed According to the NodeJS docs the call to processexitcode can be heavy handed and exit before writes to stdoutstderr have completed Allow setting deprecated true for an option or a command like yargsoptions oldOption type boolean deprecated true newOption type boolean which will show up in help as Options oldoption deprecated newoption Ive been tightening up yargs team permissions in prep for fully automating publication This has included switching most folks to triagers rather than maintainers or admins enforcing FA on GitHub adding branch protection rules such that one code review must have taken place before a PR may be merged These changes will put us in a position to more fully automate the yargs project and were not related to any specific contributors actions youre all great helpfalse does not appear to be working correctly in v when used in a default command It does hide the help option from the help text but yargs still prints the help text if you run myapp help or myapp help This is contrary to the docs which say If the boolean argument false is provided it will disable help I got the desired behavior ie yargs did nothing with help in v by not calling help at all I noticed this issue when trying to upgrade See If you have a default command and the user makes an error in the args then yargs should not output usage for the default command current behaviour The problem is the user may want to use another command not the default and the user does not know the app knows other commands yargs should output general help node indexjs help instead it contains list of commands and args for the default command too Example js const options yargs command cmd Command value demandOption true commandcmd Command value demandOption true helpstricttruedemandCommand parse Then run node indexjs foo an error argument and output is shortened Command Options version Show version number boolean help Show help boolean value required But I would expect same similar to node indexjs help ie Command Commands indexjs cmd Command default indexjs cmd Command Options version Show version number boolean help Show help boolean value required So that the user knows the app has more commands I couldnt find any instructions on serving the docs locally to test my changes My yargs structure shows toplevel help when I call node yargsissuejs help generate plain html from json Commands yargsissuejs plain json generate plain html from json default yargsissuejs
