ControlPlane MacOs Catalina Content is detected properly but Network Location is not switchedactivated in other words it is remaining in last selected network location When I visit I get the following message This group either doesnt exist or you dont have permission to access it If youre sure this group exists contact the Owner of the group and ask them to give you access I see no mechanism to request access This URL is what the app provides when you click ControlPlane Support in Status Bar Icon menu Control Plane Catalina B I have separate possible ethernet connects Thunderbolt Ethernet Slot part of a OWC Thunderbolt C Dock and a Belkin USBC LAN dongle The dock is new previously if the dongle was active it would disable WiFi and enable it again if the dongle was inactive What I am trying to achieve is that if EITHER ethernet connection is active that WiFi be disabled or if they are both inactive Wifi is enabled I tried creating rules onoff for each network connection source but it seems to have given CP a headache because it just stops switching and will only switch to the desired network state if I restart CP CP MacOS Catalina Beta A d After upgrading to Catalina the Nearby Wifi Network evidence source is greyed out in the Rules tab I also see these logs EvidenceSourceSetController startEvidenceSource Starting Power evidence source EvidenceSourceSetController startEvidenceSource Starting ShellScript evidence source WiFiEvidenceSourceCoreWLAN doUpdate WiFi interface is active but is not participating in a network yet or network SSID is bad I recently created a rule using the light sensor on my MacBook Pro Retina inch Late running However when I check the value with the lid closed docked to an external monitor I am getting a crazy value that indicates it is very very very bright when I would assume it should be dark Screen Shot at AM As we know there isnt any current development happening on ControlPlane But its still very useful for me Unfortunately the app tends to crash a couple of times a day and I only notice when something that was supposed to automatically happen doesnt happen So I found this Stack Exchange post and put together a LaunchCtl service which automatically relaunches ControlPlane when it crashes I hope this is useful to someone Name it ControlPlanerestartplist save it to LibraryLaunchAgents and launch it with launchctl load LibraryLaunchAgentsControlPlanerestartplist xml version encodingUTF DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC AppleDTD PLIST EN plist version dict keyRunAtLoadkey true keyKeepAlivekey true keyLabelkey stringControlPlanerestartstring keyProgramArgumentskey array stringApplicationsControlPlaneappContentsMacOSControlPlanestring array dict plist One very useful usecase would be to pause Spotify playing while you are in a meeting I would measure being in a meeting as having an application running in my case BlueJeans When this application is running I want to tell Spotify to pause Optionally I would like to resume it when the meeting application is quit The author has written a post in stating he needs help to keep this project going I dont know ObjectiveC well enough to help but wanted to put the link here no one asked me to since this project is great but is breaking more and more with every macOS release The ControlPlane icon does not appear in dark mode It looks like support for dark mode with a light icon needs to be added screenshot see red circle indicating location of ControlPlane icon I see a high sierra fixes branch which contains various fixes I hope it is possible to create a b ta release out of this branch At least one issue is causing me trouble on a daily basis and it seems to be fixed on that branch fix crash when displaying default browser dialog I would really appreciate a version of Control Plane with that fix applied even if it is not perfect
