error Failed at the padloc pwastart script error This is probably not a problem with npm There is likely additional logging output above verbose exit true What is the purpose of only allowing certain fields to be maskable As a user I would like to be able to mask any field type I want In a previous issue I mentioned FArecovery codes which I am storing in a note I would like them to be masked It would be acceptable for me if I could just use the password field for this but the password field is not multiline so it doesnt work Another benefit of being able to mask any field type is that I can have Padloc open when someone is looking over my shoulder or when Im sharing my screen without having to worry about accidentally exposing any kind of sensitive information Please consider giving the user the ability to mask any field type Good news Weve started working on the browser extension and will have something to show very soon In the meantime wed love to get some feedback about what features youd like to see how the optimal autofill flow would look like for you etc So wed really appreciate if you could take a moment and answer the following questions just reply to this issue Have you used other password manager browser extensions before If yes a which b How reliable was the autofill in general c Where there any instances where the autofill did not work as expected intended d Anything specific you really liked e Anything specific that bothered you f Did you encounter any performance issues What features would you like the Padloc extension to have assign a priority rating between and Do you have any specific securityrelated concerns Rate the following aspects in terms of priority a convenience b security c performance Anything else youd like to add When creating a new item filling all fields and saving the desktop Mac OS saves the item with all fields empty This doesnt happen all the time It happens often probably of the time and I havent been able to identify any pattern on whywhen this happens img width altScreen Shot at AM src Current behavior User is in Vault X User creates New Item New Item is placed in My Vault by default user can change that when creating the item but if doing it quickly they will likely overlook this What I think should be a better behavior User is in Vault X User creates New Item New Item is placed in Vault X by default user can change it if needed when creating the item Would it be possible to have an LDAP Active Directory integration for Teams Some ideas as a brainstorm Login with LDAP username passwords Filters for login Attribute mapping when a custom LDAP server is used Group synchronization with tags RO RW Group synchronization with vaults RO RW Group synchronization with organization admin role This approach would be compatible with RBAC as well I know youve confirmed with me offlist that the newer Padloc will have hosting instructions and instructions on how to build the mobile apps for using these custom instances since the newer apps wont support custom instance for syncing anymore added to their repositories Im opening this bug to track the efforts for these tasks since as much as I love the new services and am I beta user myself I wont use a centralized managed service to sync my passwords Padlock in the past has been a phenomenal tool for managing my passwords and secrets efficiently and I would love for Padloc to carry on this legacy PS Obviously Id rather love to have the official apps support custom servers but right now there isnt any other choice Im afraid It would be very helpful to have an option of All Vaults when creating an encrypted backup of your vaults Currently the app expects various scripts and assets to be located under the root path within the pwa host url This leads to problem is the app ist hosted on a subpath eg Well probably need another environment variable to allow customizing this Relevant lines Both major mobile Operating Systems now support an API to integrate third party authentication providers for logins within the confines of the OS like apps and browsers Android iOS I havent looked at the Padloc mobile app code yet but this is very likely a cordova plugin requirement A quick google of that did not show any results So this feature request might be blocked until that is available Video Tutorial for iOS App
