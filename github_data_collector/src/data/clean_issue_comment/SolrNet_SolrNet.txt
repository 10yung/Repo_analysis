Hello I have to build a query with grouping I decided to use the ready to use the CollapseExpand property with a CollapseExpandParameters instance This works just fine For some reason I want to facet on the whole results rather than on the filtered results On way to achieve this is to issue a query like this q fqcollapse fieldGroupingField nullPolicycollapse taggrouping expandtrue facetfieldexgroupingAuthorexact facettrue The CollapseExpandParameters doesnt have a Tag property and I dontt know how to inject that without leaving CollapseExpandParameters and building the whole FilterQuery by myself which would be sad If you know a better to do this this would make my day Thanks for your attention and your great piece of software Guillaume Hi Is it possible to use basic authentication with synchronous methods in aspnet core MicrosoftExtensionsDependencyInjection and how I have noticed that servicesAddSolrNetApplicationContextAppSettingsSolrSearchServer options optionsHttpClientDefaultRequestHeadersAuthorization new SystemNetHttpHeadersAuthenticationHeaderValueBasic solrCredsBase only adds header if async methods are used like AddAsync DeleteAsync etc Sometimes it is quite difficult to convert code to async We use SolrNet quite extensively thank you for providing this great package In a lot of projects were bound to using LightInject DI and have no real possibility to use another DI container next to it It would be great if somebody could create a SolrNet implementation package for LightInject DI I have tried to do it myself but my knowledge of the way SolrNet uses DI is not sufficient I was wondering if it would be a good idea to allow specifying the collection name on the type Example csharp SolrCollectionproducts public class Product SolrUniqueKeyid public string Id get set SolrFieldmanuexact public string Manufacturer get set SolrFieldcat cat is a multiValued field public ICollectionstring Categories get set SolrFieldprice public decimal Price get set SolrFieldinStock public bool InStock get set SolrFieldtimestamp public DateTime Timestamp get set SolrFieldweight public double Weight get set nullable property it might not be defined on all documents I noticed in the code for solr cloud that when a collection name is not provided it defaults to the first collection in the state provider I think being able to specify the collection name on the class would be very useful Thanks Using the AutofacContribSolrNet package and wiring up multiple cores with HttpWebRequestFactory as follows doesnt actually inject the HttpWebRequestFactory because its not implemented in the multicore logic var factory new BasicAuthHttpWebRequestFactorymyLogin myPassword builderRegisterModulenew SolrNetModulenew ListISolrServer new SolrServercore id typeofPersonAssemblyQualifiedName new SolrServercore id typeofPersonAssemblyQualifiedName HttpWebRequestFactory factory I resolved this in my fork see in the simplest way possible and Im happy to submit it as a PR but wanted to see if there might be a better solution An obvious limitation with my implementation is there is only one possible HttpWebRequestFactory for all cores Thats fine for my use case but is it feasible that you could want a different factory per core And if so any thoughts on how wed do that with Autofac Perhaps by registering IHttpWebRequestFactory itself and letting the caller decide how to implement Im not an Autofac expert so this is just speculation Update The original use case for the above multicore config was the requirement to customize the URI because were using a middleware product in front of SOLR and it expects incoming requests go to its custom URIs including NOT going to select I was ultimately able to work around this by setting QueryOptionsRequestHandler on each request to the custom URI In case it helps anyone facing a similar situation Hello everyone Firstly My english is not enough sorry When I use the build and dll schemas look like pluralsight videos version there is no problem but when I try to install by nuget I dont understand what to do Ive been looking for examples for days on google but unfortunately I couldnt find anything After downloading dll from nuget i want to open new core But solr admin ui want the config file for the core I couldnt find the default config to use as an example How will this happen if I open a new core while use dll install Nuget package I would appreciate your help Have a nice day Since v of solr it is possible to map for example the generated field content to a custom field via parameter fmapcontentmyfield Could solrnet add this parameter in the near future Hi how can I see if a version of SolrNet is compatible with a Solr version Hello I have started using solrnet core version in my net core application I am having difficulty getting the grouping functionality to work I have items in my SOLR instance Sample code thissolrGroupinApi ServiceLocatorCurrentGetInstanceISolrOperationsProjectItem works like a charm gets the items var results thissolrApiQuery only returns the first item result seems to be a simple list var response thissolrGroupinApiQuery new QueryOptions Grouping new GroupingParameters Fields ProjectCode this is a valid field Format GroupingFormatGrouped Limit Ngroups true Main true I have played around with the grouping options but nothing seems to work What am I doing wrong
