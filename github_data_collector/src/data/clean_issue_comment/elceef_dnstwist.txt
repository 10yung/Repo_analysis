In the context of packaging dnstwist for Debian I am trying to document the copyright information for the files included in your software It seems to me that at least for the files inside the database directory proper copyright information is missing Could you please add the following information for those files the copyright years the name of the authorscopyright holders the licence the URL to the source of those files For the file effectivetldnamesdat Ive found information for the last two items but unless I overlooked something the remaining information is missing BUILDLIB pip install r

attached patch dnstwistpypatchtxt Great tool however for coverage the following tool finds far more domains Would love to see these functions incorporated into urlinsane From looking at the code and if I understand correctly the whois package being used is This is an old package and from the tests I did it is failing on many queries mostly issues with parsing the response Are there any plans to move to the following whois package It seems to work better on most queries Also it does direct queries and not via the whois executable Note that there may be some confusion as the debian package pythonwhois is actually using the package dnstwist registered maximumfunorg V V Processing domain variants vs python dnstwistpy registered maximumfunorg V V Processing domain variants
