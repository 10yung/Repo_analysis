item means how much mAh left in battery Further more which part of andriod system service recorded this value If possible I want to collect this value in a constant rate how can I do this As other people have reported I also get errors when analyzing Android bugreports Note Could not parse aggregated battery stats I then pulled and ran googles latest image and it does indeed work with Android bugreports So after this I tried extracting all the files from the image and running it myself These are commands I use I use Ubuntu Create new container docker create namebh p expose gcrioandroidbatteryhistorianstable Copy all files from container to current local folder docker cp bhgopuresrcgithubcomgooglebatteryhistorian PWD I then ran setupgo and then batteryhistoriango The application launched but I still get the same error Could not parse aggregated battery stats With the same source I have also tried building my own docker image with the following dockerfile Use latest golangalpine version which is smaller than regular golang FROM golang alpine Get the battery historian code from local code commit repo WORKDIR gosrccodecommitbatteryhistorian COPY gosrccodecommitbatteryhistorian Install Java git and python and cleanup after in the same layer RUN apk update apk add openjdk jre git python rm rf varcacheapk Install dependencies recursively and remove the thirdparty directory after it has been used for compiling RUN go get go run setupgo Open default port EXPOSE Run the start file for battery historian in a container CMD go run cmdbatteryhistorianbatteryhistoriango port But when I use this image I still get the same error as before What are I and Google doing differently Trace finished analysisServer processing for GET Trace
