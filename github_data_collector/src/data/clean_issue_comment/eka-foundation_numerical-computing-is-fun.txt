Notebook had mixed print statements for Py changed all to Py My first pull so hope Im doing this right there are lots of edits in the comparison that I dont understand its confusing considering I just added brackets in a few places Wondering if its due to copies or something about underlying code any help with my understanding greatly appreciated Hi In this notebook you use the is keyword to compare numbers This should be avoided because Pythons semantic does not guarantee that is In fact in the CPython implementation this is only True for integers lower or equal to a b a is b False a b a is b True decimnals decimals Translate READMEmd Add translated cover image later link can refers to it This project is very interesting and I believe that it can be a motivation for brazilian students I think that more contributions can be added if more people could understand the texts So I propose to translate content to brazilian portuguese as it be published and suggest changes according brazilian speakers use it
