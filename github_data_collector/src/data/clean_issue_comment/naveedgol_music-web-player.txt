Im getting this error every time I skip a song Whats also weird is that while logging the playbackState every time it changes Im noticing that pressing skip will cause the playbackState to change from LOADING WAITING PLAYING PAUSED then the error occurs then LOADING WAITING PLAYING again The song plays correctly but its causing tons of these same errors and also making the playpause button flicker from different playback states while skipping songs ERROR Error Uncaught in promise PLAYACTIVITY A play stop method was called without a previous play descriptor PLAYACTIVITY A play stop method was called without a previous play descriptor at FunctionMKErrorplayActivityError musickitjs at PlayActivityanonymous musickitjs at musickitjs at Objectnext musickitjs at musickitjs at new ZoneAwarePromise zonejs at awaiter musickitjs at PlayActivitystop musickitjs at PlayActivityanonymous musickitjs at musickitjs at resolvePromise zonejs at zonejs at rejected musickitjs at ZoneDelegatepushnodemoduleszonejsdistzonejsZoneDelegateinvoke zonejs at ObjectonInvoke corejs at ZoneDelegatepushnodemoduleszonejsdistzonejsZoneDelegateinvoke zonejs at ZonepushnodemoduleszonejsdistzonejsZonerun zonejs at zonejs at ZoneDelegatepushnodemoduleszonejsdistzonejsZoneDelegateinvokeTask zonejs at ObjectonInvokeTask corejs Please add function for Airplay like Spotify has You can select your devices that are connected with airplay I want to make version Apple Music for other platformsEg Windows Phone Android TV but I dont help Apple Developer Account Can I ask you use your key for my app Thanks Added a dockerfile to support building and running this app with Docker Instructions to use it were added to the readme file Music that is not available throught apple music is displaying in the user list Which is good but it wont play In the console the error is UNKNOWN ERROR The exact album I have tried is King Crimsons In The Court Of The Crimson King Add the native Apple Music feature to Love heart or Dislike crossheart a track as it is playing I am using fedora gnome with midori and firefox browsers and anytime i press on a song it wont play or load to the bottom bar Hi I cant play any music on the plug in I actually use Brave Browser on Linux Mint Cinammon If anyone got an idea Thanks I see someones already tried this on their own in but if theres any way to get a desktop version packaged for Linux systems in something like a snap appimage or whatever necessary to get it running in a desktop app that would be great iTunes and Apple Music are pretty difficult to get going on systems like Ubuntu these days so this would be an insanely great workaround for that
