Noticed that setting displayTrue without an encoder was failing rather than intuitively picking the display encoder in We need to change the setuppy to indicate the library is python only and do a pass for any bytesstr checks in the code that should be simplified to the python variant only Well probably pin this to release rather than doing a major release since this project is still a beta project without a release yet I am trying to read notebooks in a s bucket that is located in the nonAWS S compatible object store using import scrapbook as sb book sbreadnotebookss mybucket But I get an error saying my Access Key Id does not exist ClientError An error occurred InvalidAccessKeyId when calling the ListObjectsV operation The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records I can access the bucket contents from boto successfully Am I missing anything here in the configuration with respect to endpoint url I am trying to create PDF reports from Jupyter notebook outputs graphs tables visualizations using scrapbook I been trying to get the scraps and somehow convert that data into a PDF report is scrapbook the best way How could that be done If not do you suggest me taking a look at any other nteract tool Thank you Hello I just use papermill and scrapbook recently and they are fantastic I have a small issue now and Im sorry if its a little naive When I load a single notebook with scrapbook I can access the parameters I use for papermill python import scrapbook as sb nbs sbreadnotebookpathtonotebook nbsparameters However when I load all the notebooks from a directory I can not find where is the parameters for each notebook book sbreadnotebooksresult python book sbreadnotebooksdirectorytonotebooks Can I know how to access the parameters of each notebook in the latter case It is convenient to use an ipython console to quickly look for scraps using sbreadnotebooks so I wondered what would happen if I try glue outside a notebook environment like this When I tried this there was no error message or anything so my question is Should there be an error message Does anything happen Should something happen Hello Im using Papermill to create a a directory with output notebooks In those notebooks I have used sbglueWord Count dfsum display to glue a data frame then using sbreglue in another So in this summary notebook I have the reglueWord Count for each of the files in the directory which then displays of the same data frames run on different data using Papermill I would like to take a sum of the values of a certain row across all of the data frames in this summary notebook that uses reglue Is there a way that you suggest I go about doing this I am having trouble because when I reglue I am unsure of how I can actually touch the data in the reglued data frame to do an operation across many such as the sum Thanks in advance In conversation with MSeal I raised an issue that as a new developer it is somewhat difficult to begin contributing to this project Out of concerns around busfactor and long term sustainability we arrived at the idea that we should have better developer documentation This came up in part because of and how much is changing as a result of introducing external reference based storage I in part wouldnt know how to review it because I dont know how it relates to the current way of internally organizing all of the logic My proposal is that before making massive architectural changes we should try to express how the pieces are intended to work together today That way the changes can be described at a higher level that is distinct from the details of the implementation In the nteract meeting captainsafia suggested that we create this issue and tag willingc who has been amazing for helping solidify efforts like these This will help explain where and how data is persisted recalled and how the api calls fit in This is arising from some confusion Im having around the current glue displaying api I am likely to create a few issues like this Im guessing most of them will be closed without action The comment seems to say one thing is intended and then the behaviour is otherwise where if the display is not None and encoder is undefined then it is assumed to not be display However if Im defining a display type so display would be not None but also would not evaluate to False it would seem to be reasonable to encode it as a display as well without needing to declare it as the display encoder So should the logic earlier include something like if encoder is None and display encoder display
