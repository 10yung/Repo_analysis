receive only security updates if desired details I dont really know if it qualifies as a bug report but I have had very mixed results running the spotifydfullgit package on Arch Linux When I follow the instructions to install it as a service It creates the service but everytime I try to check on it with a systemctl status spotifyd it claims the service does not exist I have tried using etcsystemduser and configsystemd and I cannot get it to run as a service One time I got it to run by issuing the spotifyd command and I could see it in spotifytui But I could not get it to replicate because even after a reboot I get the following error every time I try to run the executable thread main panicked at called Resultunwrap on an Err value Os code kin stack backtrace x e a aa unknown x

issue I just cant get it to start This is the only way spotifytui is worth using because if I cant get spotifyd working then I would be forced to run the full GUI client anyways Currently spotifyd listens on a random port when it starts This is a problem because layer firewalls cannot cope with random ports so one must either open all ports to clients iPhones and other untrusted devices or simply not use spotifyd The program needs another command line option not at all present in the help output of the latest Linux release as of today to force a specific port on spotifyd Thanks I noticed that I didnt have the pulseaudio backend available from spotifydbinfull from the AUR Looking at this CI run It appears that the same build command is used for both slim and full usrsharerustcargobincargo stable build locked release target x unknownlinuxgnu nodefaultfeatures features alsabackend Building spotifydfull from source does include the flags Hi please upload this to cratesio we need this in order to package it for Debian Removed some not necessary lines and made a fix for cargo searching in wrong file path for libasoundso please uncomment the deploy section
