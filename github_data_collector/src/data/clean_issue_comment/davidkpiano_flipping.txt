cant seem to get this working in Firefox OSX get the above error in the console Works fine on Chrome others Hi Im working in a TypeScript project with webpack I stumbled across this post and decided to try your library In your example you use this import syntax typescript import Flipping from flippingadaptersweb Unfortunately this doesnt work Im using the latest version The only way I found for importing the Web Adapter is this which feels unnatural typescript import Flipping from flippinglibadaptersweb This works but the editor complains about that file not having a default export I think that with some minor changes to your project structureconfiguration we should be able to use the syntax you used in that article let me know if Im doing something wrong Cheers copied from Still a good recommendation on which to use would be great And how far the css one is
