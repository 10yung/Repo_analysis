When is stabilized and implemented it should be possible to create binaries that dont depend on std but do depend on alloc This would be a step between nostd and nomain because at least you could use the heap The actual sample hello world code would probably not change much It would probably be best to show off using a Vec in this instance This could probably be added now as a nightly subproject Use or add less trivial example with some external dependencies For example opening a file calculating md summ outputting it in hex Include not just target size for MacOS but a table of sizes across major platforms On macOS the final binary size is reduced to KB On macOS the final binary size is reduced to KB I think each section including baseline before optimisation should have a demo project with target file size available The size may even be in section title
