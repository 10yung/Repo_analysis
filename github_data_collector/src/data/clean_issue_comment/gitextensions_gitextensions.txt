sincerest form of flattery Copy implementations from the MicrosoftDotNetArcadeSdk that is used by NET projects This SDK offers a number features and provides a number of tasks such as clean restore build rebuild test etc Which both work from Visual Studio and command line I decided against using the actual package for a number of reasons The package isnt published to nugetorg The package is being actively developed and may be causing unnecessary overhead if the package maintainers modify behaviours The package contains significantly more functionality catering for the Microsoft NET development process The package would require a significant number of adjustments to the project and its structure to make use of it Taking the limited subset of the SDK provides a greater control over the executed targets and their configurations Supported CLI commands ps build with restore and binary log enabled default set same as supplying restore build bl buildcmd default build and build C
