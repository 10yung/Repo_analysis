Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe When implementing auto login via spsl if it is a user name password authentication there is no choose but have to put the password into the spsl script which has a security issue Describe the solution youd like To avoid putting sensitive information like password into the script implementing a special command to trigger a user input dialog that prompts user to enter the password shall resolve the problem In addition it is useful in scenarios that require interaction with user dynamically Describe alternatives youve considered Encrypted variable Additional context nil In the GUI tab of Tools Options the Misc section contains a Show Document Icons checkbox which is not checked by default When checked each tab the tab control gets an icon to the left of the tabs name Please clarify this preferences role either by Moving it to the Tabs and Docking section next to Tab Text and renaming it something like Show session icon or adding a tooltip with an explanation Fix so the green send button sends a return on Click Hello is there a config file or setting I can change to have my SuperPuTTY select files from a folder I specify by default currently when I import sessions from file it always defaults to the C Program Files x SuperPuTTY folder which is not where I keep my xml files to import Thank you it seems that superputty doesnt really take into account the appearance settings in a putty session and as a result the font is huge with every putty tab i have open unless i right click change settings and change it manually this might be related to but the relevant registry keys in the registry that putty stores appearance info main key Computer HKEYCURRENTUSER Software SimonTatham PuTTY Sessions SESSIONNAME sub keys Font FontCharSet FontHeight FontIsBold FontQuality FontVTMode TermWidth TermHeight LockSize when window is resized setting these should also probably be stored in the SessionsXML file that superputty maintains examples superputty after loading the sessions from putty img width alt src putty loading the same session itself img width alt src I just noticed that the main keyboard shortcuts NextTab and PrevTab which I have respectively defined to CtrlNext and CtrlPageUp do not switch to the proper tab sometimes Normally just like in web browsers if there are n tabs NextTab while on tab t should bring to tab t unless nt in which case it should bring to tab For its part PrevTab while on tab t should bring to tab t unless t in which case it should bring to tab n In my current session this is halfworking and halfbroken That is in a minority of cases switching will bring to the wrong tab I have tabs open If focus is in a tab between and NextTab cycles as if n would equal That is cycling that way excludes tabs and unless its already in tab in which case in goes to As for PrevTab if the focus is in tabs to it always stays in that set The problem is similar to the one with NextTab Restarting SuperPuTTY without closing the tabs open does not solve this OS Windows Version To Reproduce I do not know how to reproduce from a new SuperPuTTY session but I assume this is the result of one of the following actions which I am positive I took since SuperPuTTY was last started Reordering tabs Bringing a tab to a new window and bringing it back to the initial window Works for my colleague but not for me Trying to send commands across multiple sessions concurrently In my case script editor only sends to session tab currently displayed If i spread my tabs across the screen like tiles then it works Very strange Describe the bug I have superPutty on windows When I send window to the background only minimize it and then bring it back I always see how SuperPutty window hang up for a seconds After this I usually catch KeyboardEventaltKey state change This hung operation programmatically changing state of the Alt key I tried all version since until May it depend from anything else To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Open SuperPutty on Windows Activate some other window and send supper putty to background You need to minimize window initiate redraw I tried just open something above superputty and didnt catch hung ups Maximize superputty window Expected behavior No hung ups putty Desktop please complete the following information OS Windows Describe the bug Commands bar issuing commands twice to one session in a layout To Reproduce Load PuTTY sessions using layouts Use Commands bar to issue a command One PuTTY session will receive the command twice always the same session Expected behavior Expecting command bar to issue a single command once to all open PuTTY sessions Desktop please complete the following information OS Windows Version When the focus is in a session some shortcuts involving the Windows logo key are not usable At least Windows logo key Up arrow Maximize the window Windows logo key Left arrow Maximize the app or desktop window
