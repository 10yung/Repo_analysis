We have decided to deprecate this library as we dont have an active maintainer If youd like to take take ownership please feel free to fork or discuss over here This fixes this issue Ive changed the recursion so each level is aware if its father was in the path because if no obviously they doesnt have to be market because even if they are contained in the path keys array they doesnt belong to this hierarchy There is a bug in BasicSunburst that cause duplicate values from same levels but other hierarchy to be all selected together whenever one of them has to be Example Given the tree root one hello two hello three hello with the given path root one hello All hello items will be marked because the updateData recursion could not treat duplicates In fact this could be solved with a minor change for this recursion that will seep the validity of each node down to its children I have many bar charts with outliers that have really large values compared to other items in the bar chart barchart I would like to crop the long bars so that the chart takes less space Something like this ignore the orientation barchartscaleBreak Does reactvis support something like this first off thanks for this awesome lib I was going through the Treemap docs and came across the broken link so I fixed it cheers t search correctly On SearchableDiscreteColorLegend the default implementation of the searchFn is lowercasing the items but not the search criteria The Legend example page is even showing the problem If you type Ap nothing is shown but if you type ap the entry with Apples in the name is shown searchFn items s itemsfilter item Stringitemtitle item toLowerCase indexOfs Should be searchFn items s itemsfilter item Stringitemtitle item toLowerCase indexOfstoLowerCase Im trying to format the time scale to hours using the example given here The hours format is still used when I set the time format to HMS or X using timeFormatDefaultLocale but Im able to change the periods days and months tags which at least tells me the config is read Heres an example showing my issue Edit damppine iczr Am I doing something wrong here Any clarification is appreciated I have a Time Series plot with Y axis containing counts of alerts With the given dataSet I am getting the tick values in the plot as I want it to be Not in Decimals like I tries with tickValues and yType Not able to achive what I m looking for
