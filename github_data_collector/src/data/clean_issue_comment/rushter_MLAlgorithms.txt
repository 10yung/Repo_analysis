There exists a problem about the function axscatter in kmeanspy TypeError scatter got multiple values for argument c I want to add some of the algorithms used on recommendation systems I have completed my graduation recently and in my final paper I wrote a recommender system an hybrid implementation using some simple algorithms I like to share them in your repo if you permit In the variance ratio of a component is calculated as the square of its eigenvalue divided by the sum of all squared eigenvalues But according to the proportion of variance of a component should be its eigenvector divided by the sum of all eigenvectors Any ideas it is really great code only how to run it MLAlgorithmsmlafmpy may you add example as you did for other models When I run nnetconvnetmnistpy in the IDE it throw the error Thank you rushter I cloned the repo and tried running the example in READMEmd without explicit installation python m exampleslinearmodels I get the following result using MacAnacondaPython x anacondabinpython Import by filename is not supported Any ideas as to why the standard example wont work I notice you use a rd party module to evaluate the gradient of your cost function in your GD routine What was the reasoning behind this and why not implement it
