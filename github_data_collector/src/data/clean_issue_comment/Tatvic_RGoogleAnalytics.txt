Hi I see Rgoogleanalytics is not in CRAN anymore because lack of maintenance I use the package a lot and I am willing to support keeping the package compliance to CRAN as a contributor Regards Manuel I love this library its made analyzing GA data so much easier for me There is a bug with how caching works Currently the result of a query is cached regardless of the return status The issue is that the next time the query runs with cache TRUE youll relive the error code even if the error came from rate limiting Whats more because of how RGoogleAnalytics builds up the cache file name its not obvious how to quickly delete just the right file This means that if youve built up a solid cache of responses over time for historical reports you either need to spend time discovering the filename or need to delete the entire cache I could see a couple of better solutions here Dont cache responses with error codes Add a delete cache function for particular query params Use a library like memoise to make cache management easier What do you think Hi I am getting this issue when I use the following segment and it gives me this error querylist Initstartdate enddate dimensions gapagePath metrics gapageviews sort NULL filters NULL segments mysegment maxresults tableid ga startindexNULL Create the Query Builder object so that the query parameters are validated gaquery QueryBuilderquerylist Extract the data and store it in a dataframe gadata GetReportDatagaquery token splitdaywise T Error in ParseDataFeedJSONGAData code Reason Invalid value My segment i have followed an example as below i am looking to retrieve i found an example pulls the top pages for the last thirty days for visits that occurred on a mobile device mysegmentelement segmentelementdeviceCategory operator EXACT type DIMENSION expressions Mobile mysegmentvector segmentvectorsimplelistlistmysegmentelement mysegmentdefinition segmentdefinelistmysegmentvector mysegment segmentga Mobile Sessions Onlysessionsegment mysegmentdefinition I have some issue withe downloading data related withe the gakeyword dimension which is actually not the direct Analytics dimension but it is displayed correct in the API explorer or other API scripts While downloading the query based on the bellow scrip gaqueryinit Init startdate enddate dimensions cgakeywordgadate metrics cgaimpressions maxresults filters gamediumcpc tableid gaxxxxxx The dataframe returns something strange keyword date impressions U U U U U U U EU U B The keyword is not the proper value Hi yes I get this error despite getting the success message va the webbrowser Authentication complete Please close this page and return to R when i then to try to get the Token Waiting for authentication in browser Press EscCtrl C to abort Authentication complete Error in oauth accesstokenendpoint app code code userparams userparams Unauthorized HTTP Failed to get an access token whats odd is that I very carefully copied the ClientID and Client Secret to the RScript any help much appreciated and thxvm for the R scripts and packages btw kind regards Andrew Hi Im basing my code off of this setup code When I try running it sometimes Ill get this error ValidateTokentoken Error in curlcurlfetchmemoryurl handle handle SSL certificate problem self signed certificate in certificate chain Has anyone else run into this Im new to using R for APIrelated purposes so if someone could help point me to a workaround for this Id be very thankful Hi I guess this is due to me working in a corporate environment and thus the firewall is slowing down the connection I am getting the following error Error in curlcurlfetchmemoryurl handle handle Timeout was reached Would it be possible to allow to set the timeout value manually Thanks When i execute the code it gives me this error Could you please help me solve this Error in initoauth selfendpoint selfapp scope selfparamsscope Unauthorized HTTP Failed to get an access token The Init function does not work when it is passed a parameter dimensionsNULL and it does not work when dimensions are unspecified ie the default argument is used However on page of the CRAN documentation it states dimensions are optional in the Init function The call fails with Error in if greplga argument is of length zero Hi can somebody point me to the right direction in order to authenticate using service accounts Thanks
