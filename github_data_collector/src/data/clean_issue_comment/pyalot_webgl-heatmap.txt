 I got this error at compile time Any idea my app is a pure front app no js back app Hello pyalot I want to confirm the license about this library Whats the detail BSD license References this website By the way is this library published on npm Thanks very much Hello pyalot I am the member of the cdnjs project We want to host this library But there is a question want to ask Could you add git tag for repository Its helpful for user to know the version and status And is this library published on npm package Thanks for your help Hi pyalot Thanks for the great library i use it for a personal project I would like to plot a heatmap from an area which i would like to split into a grid eg x meters is that possible and how can you overlay the heatmap on google maps somehow Thanks This isnt really an issue but thought it might be a good context to mention that I forked this project and converted it to ES and CommonJS then published it to npm see I did this mainly to require it in the heatmapoverlay I created for use with reactmapgl Hello there I have an accuracy issue with this awesome library Here is an example I have heatmap with blue yellow and red colors gradient I want to add three points like this example Point addPoint color must be yellow Point addPoint color must be blue Point addPoint color must be orange And there is that I get Point is orangered Point is blueyellow Point is red But I expect to have Point yellow Point blue Point orange Between Points and yellow to blue gradient Between Points and blue to orange gradient Between points and yellow to orange gradient This is very important because there is a legend to show which color match with values but because of this sum this is not accurate at all So I wanted to know if there is a way to have this kind of interpolation Thank you for your work First of all thank you for the work you have done with WebGLHeatMap library I am using your library for a personal project I encounter a major barrier because the library does not have any method to obtain the intensity of a given point Is there any way to get it When trying to convert the canvas to a png I kept getting empty canvases This can be fixed by using getContextexperimentalwebgl preserveDrawingBuffer true when using getContext Just wondering whether the code should be changed accordingly I wanted to clear the heatmap without reinstantiating it and was pleased to discover in the source code that this clear method exists Just want to make it clear for anyone else who is interested in using this plugin
