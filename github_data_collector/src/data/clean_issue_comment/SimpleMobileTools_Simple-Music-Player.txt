When playing a opus file when I try to move the cursor in the progress bar to another point of the song it jumps right back to the current position effectively making it impossible to go forward or backward through the song It works as intended on mp and m a files Version v My playlist is built from a folder on extern SDcard which ist FAT formatted Half of the items appear like this Atlantis Shadows The other half Aquarius Hairmp unknown If I play the first one then everything is as expected the runtime is shown and I can forward and rewind with the progressbarbutton If I play the latter no runtime is shown and I can not fast forward or rewind the music Every file is encoded the same way with metadatas filled and I can not find any difference between the first and the second kind And I avoid any special characters in any filename like German umlauts and others old behaviour since homecomputertimes My computer with which I make the files is an uptodate Linuxmachine set to UFT characters Every file is coded as MP with bit kHz In the attached screenshot there are three files of the oddkindtype on the left and three of the normaltype on the right side What could be the reason for such behaviour Spielmops MediaInfoMusikenklein sample video and reproduction steps at email from richard on rd november I have some music files that are louder or softer than others It would be great if smp supported audio normalization so i dont have to manually change the volume for almost every song Thank you for considering these ideas It would be nice to have an pull down gesture swipe down to refresh in your other apps to rebuild the playlist in case new songs are added to the same folder How to replicate Download a song Import it in the app Everything right Then move the file to another folder Reimport the song and play it Progress Bar dead cant forward and backward Song time Then rename the song whatever works Reimport the song again Everything right Why Id like to suggest an small feature Since Im using this app mostly to play podcasts which I download in advance It would be cool if you could add a jump sec buttons Like Netflix Player thanks for reading it I didnt see anything about it Is it possible to add cast support Or does that require nonFOSS libraries It would be nice if the app can store the last play position I use it often to play long podcasts and when I pause the playback to do something else and after some tim come back to the program the last play position is gone and I have to find the position again
