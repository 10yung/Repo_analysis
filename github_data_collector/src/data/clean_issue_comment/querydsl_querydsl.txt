There are entity in my project java Entity public class Project Id private Long id OneToMany JoinTablename pmprojectfile OrderByvalue createdDate DESC private ListFileInfo files Entity public class FileInfo fileInfo I want to query files with querydsl How can I do this I know that can be query by jpql like this Queryselect f from Project p inpfiles f where pid order by fcreatedDate desc but how to query with querydsl I do not want to change onetomany to mappedByxxxbecause the FileInfo entity will be used other way My English is not good sorry Im trying to run the following subquery using the comquerydslsqlSQLExpressions class sql selectExpressionsstringTemplategroupconcat QSoilAmendmentsoilAmendmentcode fromQTreatmentSoilAmendmenttreatmentSoilAmendment

orghibernateenginejdbcinternalResultSetReturnImplextractResultSetReturnImpljava I understand that the subquery is trying to return more than one row which is indeed what I want This exact code has worked for me with MYSQL but when I try it with a Postgres db I get the error above Any ideassuggestions Subclasses of AbstractQuery may override createQuery but not createQueryQueryModifiers boolean This leads to issues when subclasses want to adjust the rendering method While overriding createQuery covers most use cases some specific methods use createQueryQueryModifiers boolean instead As a result one has to override fetchCount fetchResults getResultList fetchOne and getSingleResult as well As a proof of concept see how Ive extended AbstractQuery for it to execute queries on top of BlazePersistence Criteria Builder API in Kind of a companion to my other PR this PR makes it more easily to extend QueryDSL The AbstractModule already exposes its RoundEnvironment but not the ProcessingEnvironment Any Element returned from the RoundEnvironment is very likely to need processing by the Types utils only available through the ProcessingEnvironment Exposing the ProcessingEnvironment through AbstractModulegetProcessingEnvironmentclass provides this flexibility hi just experiencing perf issue on first few runs of querydsl queries we have spring rest controller fetching one simple select query row and whole endpoint tooks for the first time eg sec for the second time ms is there any cache or warmuping of query parsing or something like that version one

seems to be the problemthanks What maven repo is this supposed to be resolved from springframeworkrooorgspringframeworkrooannotationsjar RELEASE And is it still needed going forward After update
