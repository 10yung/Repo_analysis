Hello Im not very familiar with this codebase but Im trying to setup Ahoy to work with polymorphic users The AhoyVisit works well all I needed to do was to add the usertype column and the belongsto user polymorphic true option to it So I figured that it will be easy with AhoyEvent as well but it wasnt It keeped saving only the userid and never the usertype So I found this line It seems that it sets only the userid before saving the event Anyway I got it working with a simple workaround Im using this beforevalidation callback in the AhoyEvent ruby beforevalidation setuserfromvisit def setuserfromvisit return true unless visit user present selfuser visituser end But is not ideal So is it possible to have the Event working with a polymorphic user as Visit does without needing this callback Thank you Duccio I have the following message when I try to install Ahoy Could not find a declaration file for module ahoyjs nodemodulesahoyjsdistahoyjs implicitly has an any type Try npm install typesahoyjs if it exists or add a new declaration dts file containing declare module ahoyjs How can I fix it ruby rails
