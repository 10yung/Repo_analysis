 Steps to reproduce Create a new rails project Run rails generate scaffold apiuser emailuniq passworddigest api Look at appviewsapiusersindexjsonjbuilder it references apiusersapiuser not apiusersapiuser Expected behavior The partial references should be apiusersapiuser Actual behaviora The partial referenced is apiusersapiuser which doesnt exist System configuration Rails version Rails Ruby version ruby p revision x mingw I have in my partial jbuilder jsonkeyformat camelize lower jsoncreditbalance useravailablecredits jsoncompanystate usercompanyprofilestate jsonsubscription do jsonmerge usersubscriptiontoh end But rendered json doesnt produced by following camelize lower rule json creditBalance companyState NJ subscription active true currentperiodend See currentperiodend should be currentPeriodEnd I am using Rails I saw a deprecation warning from jbuilder when trying my test suite on Ruby and it looks like it was already fixed in jbuilder master Could we get a new release with the fix jbuilder libjbuilderrb warning Capturing the given block using Procnew is deprecated use block instead This PR removed namespacedfilepath from Rails The jubilder controller template still uses this method I replaced this method by namespacedpath and all tests keep green Is there anything against this change JBuilder doesnt seem to using the configured format DateDATEFORMATS default dmY How do I customize it without having to add tos to every date It seems jbuilder make SQL query before render it jbuilder Is not using ActiveRecordAssociations passed from controller correctly Example ruby Model class Product hasmany productsides hasmany productsideimages through productsides end ruby Controller def index products Productincludesproductsideimagesreferencesproductsideimages end Jbuilder make SQL query for getting each productside and each productsideimages NM query Calling Productincludesproductsideimagesreferencesproductsideimages and iterating from all it productsideimages from console for example it did just one SQL query asserttemplate tries to create a failure message and Jbuilder errors Failed to add inspect property because it tries to inspect the Jbuilder railscontrollertesting tracks locals JbuilderTemplate passes json self into subrenders like partials The problematic line in railscontrollertesting is specifically the renderedviewslocalsforview that returns an array eg BasicObjectnew tos raises the same problem I understand Jbuilder tries to define as few methods as it must and hence uses BasicObject but i feel inspect is very specific to ruby so it may not be a problem in that case im happy to create a PR I just added support for generating models with richtext attachment and attachments fields for ActionText and ActiveStorage to Rails recently This updates jbuilders scaffold generator to also support these fields and retains the old functionality for older Rails versions I am using UltraEdit as my text editor in Windows I changed save settings yesterday to get around a UTF display issue It doesnt negatively affect any other file in my project but the Jbuilder template now fails after saving it today There are a number of encoding options when saving including UTF with BOM UTF no BOM These are explained quite well here The former causes a server error when trying to load the JSON from a browser eg localhostwidgets json with an unhelpful error message syntax error unexpected keywordensure expecting endofinput ensure The latter works fine Given that this only seems to affect JBuilder files I thought this might be an issue for you In the interim Ill choose the no BOM option when saving JBuilder files I may try which may or may not have the same issue
