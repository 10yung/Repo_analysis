Any new functionality is covered by tests Could be very helpfull to have an integrated HTML text editor for text fields The first lines of a database export with default settings in phpMyAdmin are SET SQLMODE NOAUTOVALUEONZERO SET AUTOCOMMIT START TRANSACTION SET timezone The last lines contain COMMIT SET CHARACTERSETCLIENTOLDCHARACTERSETCLIENT SET CHARACTERSETRESULTSOLDCHARACTERSETRESULTS SET COLLATIONCONNECTIONOLDCOLLATIONCONNECTION I see that the AUTOCOMMIT is disabled but never enabled I have noticed because we imported a SQL generated by phpMyAdmin and in the same session also executed some INSERT statements These rows where not visible in the database because they where never committed In the MySQL docs I read this With START TRANSACTION autocommit remains disabled until you end the transaction with COMMIT or ROLLBACK The autocommit mode then reverts to its previous state This states that a SET AUTOCOMMIT automatically when starting a transaction Is there a reason why phpMyAdmin disables the autocommit and then never enables it Is it possible to remove the SET AUTOCOMMIT or add a SET AUTOCOMMIT on the last line of the export
