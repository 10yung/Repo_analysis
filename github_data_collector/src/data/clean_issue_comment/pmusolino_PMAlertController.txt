I want to open another alertVC when you click a button like a conformation type system I implemented it like this swift alertVCaddActionPMAlertActiontitle Delete style default action in let conformation PMAlertControllertitle Really delete this post description nil image nil style alert conformationaddActionPMAlertActiontitle Yes style default action in printCapture action OK TapticEngineimpactfeedbacklight selfgetTopMostViewControllerpresentconformation animated false completion nil This does not work and doesnt show the controller Any ideas how can I achieve this add auto dismiss option to action update sample project for usage of auto dismiss option Hi i m using PMAlertController installed via pod within a objc app After some issues with with pods i ve removed my podsfolder and reinstalled every pod After reinstalling i ve got some builderrors in connection with textFields inside the alert controller My relevant code objc PMAlertController quittungDatenAlert PMAlertController alloc initWithTitleBlahfasel Title descriptionBlahfaselDescription imagenil stylePMAlertControllerStyleWalkthrough quittungDatenAlert addTextField UITextField textField textField setPlaceholder Betrag erhalten von textField setKeyboardTypeUIKeyboardTypeDefault PMAlertAction alertSend PMAlertAction alloc initWithTitleOK stylePMAlertActionStyleDefault action NSString quittungsVon quittungsVon quittungDatenAlert textFields firstObject text quittungDatenAlert addActionalertSend self presentViewControllerquittungDatenAlert animatedYES completionnil Instead of accessing the textfield Xcode now created the following build error No visible interface for PMAlertController declares the selector textFields How else could you access the text fields or where is the error Add initialisers to PMAlertController and PMAlertAction classes to allow customise the alert even more I want to add a custom function when PMAlertController dismiss but the function print simply wont be fired in the viewDidDisappear function Anyone has idea what s going on Hi Im looking for a function to prevent the alert from auto dismissing but Im unable to find it May I make a suggestion that you should add one more autoDismiss parameter to the addAction function so the user can now choose to let the library do the rest or they can turn it off themselves If there is any function with the same feature but Im unable to find it please show me and sorry if this issue bother you Thank you in advance img width altscreen shot at pm src Hi I love this project however the disappearing animation does not suit my app I need to change it to something like a fade out or something else really I couldn find any way to achieve this Please help Some example code would be appreciated You can now add UIPickerViews in the AlertViewController Is subj possible If the alert text cannot fit on the screen the text cannot be scrolled UIAlertController in contrast supports scrolling by default Whats worse is that the PMAlertController places the cancel action off the screen so a user cannot then cancel the alert The App is effectively blocked from user interaction Being able to handle an alert that wont fit completely on screen is important With devices with different configurations eg screen sizes portrait landscape and dynamic type sizes ie through the settings App a user can increase the text size its easy to imagine some alerts not fitting a screen Otherwise a great library thanks
