not exist Current Outlier widget usually does not find desired amount of outliers Description of changes wrap sklearn classes for outlier detection LocalOutlierFactor IsolationForest introduce separate editors for each outlier detector output annotated data appended Outlier feature Things to discuss the widget could accept distance matrix and use it for LocalOutlierFactor custom method identify outliers using distance from the mean threshold could be some multiple of std for each feature responsive widget the widget could make calculations in a separate thread to make Orange responsive but it is impossible to show progress or terminate the calculation Includes X Code changes X Tests Documentation Describe the bug After successful installation of orange when visualization tools such as scatterplot line plot distributions widget are opened even without connecting them to a dataset they throw an error of some sort To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Open orange canvas Right click to add a new widget in the workflow Select scatter plot or distributions or line plot See the error Orange version Orange version Expected behavior Functioning scatter plot when dataset is provided Screenshots Operating system Ubuntu Additional context Add any other context about the problem here Issue Eg Fixes Closes Resolves etc Or a short description if the issue does not exist Fixes Order of probabilities does not match list on the left colors do not match too SVM works wrong when the class attribute has a value that does not appear in Y In this case we expect that probabilities shape match to class values but they dont since SVM has its own predict function that works differently than other models Description of changes Fixing sorting problems from Fixing SVM which now uses the same predict function than other models Fixing problems with colors when different orders of probabilities Fix probabilities order when different values order TODO This PR is not finished yet Tests Includes X Code changes Tests Documentation Issue Users can connect arbitrary classifiers to nomogram if the classifier is not naive Bayes or logistic regression the widget informs the user that this type of classifier is invalid It would be nicer if classifiers of wrong types couldnt be connected at all Caveat are there or could there be widgets that output models and this model can be naive Bayes or logistic regression but not necessarily Eg what if ROC would output the optimal model for some operating condition In this case the current code supports connecting and checking later while this PR prohibits it Description of changes Implement a mixin that serves as a flag and mark the acceptable models python setuppy test issues a warning WARNING Testing via this command is deprecated and will be removed in a future version Users looking for a generic test entry point independent of test runner are encouraged to use tox We should look into tox and see how to test with it Issue Eg Fixes Closes Resolves etc Or a short description if the issue does not exist Implements Description of changes Add stateWhenDisabled where appropriate Includes X Code changes Tests Documentation Issue Eg Fixes Closes Resolves etc Or a short description if the issue does not exist In the new implementation of the ImageEmbedding widget I have a case when I call start from onexception The case is I call start for the first time then exception happens in onexception function I change something in the widget and call start with new configuration again It works well The problem is that then waituntilfinished does not work correctly since after onexception is called state invalidated is set to False it happens after the start is called again Description of changes In this change I just added if clause which checks if there is still any task running before it sets invalidated to True When no new task is run it should be ok since selftask is set to None before this function VesnaT hope the solution is good If you have any better solution or this solution can cause problems let me know Includes X Code changes Tests Documentation Many widgets disable check boxes when they are not applicable For instance if Split by in Distribution is set to None check boxes Stack columns and Show probabilities are disabled However if they are checked they remain checked so that they are checked when they are reenabled The widget itself ignored the state but the information that the user sees is wrong in orangewidgetbase merged but not yet released resolves this by introducing an argument stateWhenDisabled In case of Distributions settings stateWhenDisabledFalse would ensure that check boxes would be shown as unchecked when they are disabled although the underlying setting is still True When reenabled the box will be shown as checked Somebody would need to go through all widgets or perhaps just search the code for setDisabled and setEnabled see whether it disables check boxes and if so provide the stateWhenDisable argument with the proper value This PR wont be mergeable until orangewidgetbase is released
