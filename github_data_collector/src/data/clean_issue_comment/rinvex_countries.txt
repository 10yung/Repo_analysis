First of all thanks for the great package It would be great to have the currency symbol included in the currency information you get with methods like getCurrency Im referencing this line It should be mbstrtolower instead of mbstrtoupper I want to add an Arabic translation name for all countries Where is the right file to put it This popped up in production for us Some japanese users type their adresses using latin characters instead of katakana and per the recommendations such addressing should be reversed ie the traditional western addressing system ie name followed by street followed by zip and city etc It also gets quite confusing when westernized addresses are used since the JP format looks like this postalcode nregionshortcitystreet nrecipient ncountry ie no separator between region city and street So maybe we need a jpwesternizedjson file with a format something along the lines of recipient nstreet npostalcodecity nregionshort ncountry As to how we would select that format instead of the official JP one Im not sure A helper function to analyze if the address contains mostly latin characters or not maybe Or just a flag to pass westernizedtrue Any chance of implementing ISO codes instead of ISO codes PHP plays better with ISO codes At the moment Im resorting to a helper class just to convert ISO to ISO languages ab abk aa aar af afr ak aka sq sqi Some countries has multiple currencies but mostly only one is used or at least theres a default currency but this package returns the first currency regardless which make it weird We need to sort currencies and change the default behavior to return the officialdefault currency of the country and if needed all other currencies will be returned optionally Related issue Currently all JSON files are compressed which make it difficult to review PRs and check differences between revisions or even read source files humanly its compressed for the sake of size saving on production but we can do better Well convert all JSON files into well formatted source files and will add command line tool to compile these files for production usage optional PHP Fatal error Class Rinvex Country CountryLoaderException not found in E www labs shipmenttracking vendor rinvex country src Loaderphp on line Version I know its has been fixed in v because of my php version i can only use v will you relase a fix version for v
