I have such a DOM structure I need to interact with div div classmultiselectselect div div classmultiselecttags input name idcampaignappid typetext placeholderSelect div div

unique id I can use inputcmpaignappid divmultiselectcontentwrapper its actual dropdown and its hidden by default To make it open be visible I need to perform a click to divmultiselectselect I did not find a way to do it with CSS selectors so I made XPath selectors and both working on Firefox console select divmultiselectselect as I need to make a click to open the dropdown selector looks like input idcampaignappid parentdiv classmultiselecttags precedingsiblingdiv classmultiselectselect select the option from dropdown selector looks like input idcampaignappid parentdiv classmultiselecttags

generatesuitetest command synched with IDE when a file is addedmodified In this scenario sometimes calculated relative path for the generating test file contains a dot In that case an invalid syntax is inserted in the resulting generated test file Passing a relative path is useful to keep a synchronized structure with the source directory For example passing foobar creates a test file unitfoobarTestphp This is great bash php codeceptphar generatetest unit foobar However when it contains a dot like bash php codeceptphar generatetest unit foo it creates a file fooTestphp with an invalid namespace syntax The dot something passed by IDE What do you get instead A namespace with a dot gets inserted at the beginning of the generated file which is invalid syntax and causes a fatal

attaching the file on line elsendKeysrealpathfilePath then Selenium ends up not being able to find it because it is a different container Due to my Docker Composer configuration I cant share volumes

the integration test there is only one it appears that tearDownAfterClass is run an extra time I can see output from the first run all normal Then it runs again and fails because an important variable is not set I can fix this problem by wrapping the code in setupBeforeClass and tearDownAfterClass like so if issetvariable variable instanceof MyClass That seems to indicate that the methods are being called an extra time with that variable no longer set With the wrapping all the actions in both methods are completed correctly and all tests pass regardless of which order the suites run in
