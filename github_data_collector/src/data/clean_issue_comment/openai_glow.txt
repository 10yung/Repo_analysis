give me some advice Bumps tensorflowgpu from to details summaryRelease notessummary Sourced from tensorflowgpus releases TensorFlow Release This is the last x release for TensorFlow We do not expect to update the x branch with features although we will issue patch releases to fix vulnerabilities for at least one year Major Features and Improvements As announced tensorflow pip package will by default include GPU support same as tensorflowgpu now for the platforms we currently have GPU support Linux and Windows It will work on machines with and without Nvidia GPUs tensorflowgpu will still be available and CPUonly packages can be downloaded at tensorflowcpu for users who are concerned about package size TensorFlow contains a complete implementation of the API in its compatv module It contains a copy of the main module without contrib in the compatv module TensorFlow is able to emulate behavior using the enablev behavior function This enables writing forward compatible code by explicitly importing either tensorflowcompatv or tensorflowcompatv you can ensure that your code works without modifications against an installation of or EagerTensor now supports numpy buffer interface for tensors Add toggles tfenablecontrolflowv and tfdisablecontrolflowv for enablingdisabling v control flow Enable v control flow as part of tfenablev behavior and TF BEHAVIOR AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions allowing users to write regular Python inside tffunctiondecorated functions AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tfdata tfdistribute and tfkeras APIS Adds enabletensorequality which switches the behavior such that Tensors are no longer hashable Tensors can be compared with and yielding a Boolean Tensor with elementwise comparison results This will be the default behavior in Auto MixedPrecision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to float for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with tftrainexperimentalenablemixedprecisiongraphrewrite Add environment variable TFCUDNNDETERMINISTIC Setting to true or forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and maxpooling algorithms When this is enabled the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic TensorRT Migrate TensorRT conversion sources from contrib to compiler directory in preparation for TF Add additional user friendly TrtGraphConverter API for TensorRT conversion Expand support for TensorFlow operators in TensorRT conversion eg Gather Slice Pack Unpack ArgMin ArgMaxDepthSpaceShuffle Support TensorFlow operator CombinedNonMaxSuppression in TensorRT conversion which significantly accelerates object detection models Breaking Changes Tensorflow code now produces different pip packages tensorflowcore containing all the code in the future it will contain only the private implementation and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflowcore and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow We dont expect this to be breaking unless you were importing directly from the implementation TensorFlow is built using devtoolset GCC on Ubuntu This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow Deprecated the use of constraint and constraint with ResourceVariable tfkeras OMPNUMTHREADS is no longer used by the default Keras config To configure the number of threads use tfconfigthreading APIs tfkerasmodelsavemodel and modelsave now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel kerasbackendresizeimages and consequently keraslayersUpsampling D behavior has changed a bug in the resizing implementation was fixed Layers now default to float and automatically cast their inputs to the layers dtype If you had a model that used float it will probably silently use float in TensorFlow and a warning will be issued that starts with Layer layername is casting an input tensor from dtype float to the layers dtype of float To fix either set the default dtype to float with tfkerasbackendsetfloatxfloat or pass dtypefloat to each of the Layer constructors See tfkeraslayersLayer for more information Some tfassert methods now raise assertions at operation creation time ie when this Python line executes if the input tensors values are known at that time not during the sessionrun When this happens a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked nonfeedable In other words if they are used as keys in feeddict argument to sessionrun an error will be raised Also because some assert ops dont make it into the graph the graph structure changes A different graph can result in different perop random seeds when they are not given explicitly most often Bug Fixes and Other Changes tfestimator tfkerasestimatormodeltoestimator now supports exporting to tftrainCheckpoint format which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible

the Security Alerts page details hi Why use cross h to get mean and logs Is there any difference to get mean and logs from its contiguous splits of h I guess maybe you want to cross split the featuremap to get the z z in the previous lines As feature feed to split d are concated from two parts of formerly revnet d layer the first half and second half of which are not that equal doing a cross split to get z z may be a better choice Hi there I am trying to calculate the loglikelihood of data points To do so I directly modified the provided loss function img width altScreen Shot at PM src Then I tested it on the cifar dataset and got the following This result is similar to the one in the paper DO DEEP GENERATIVE MODELS KNOW WHAT THEY DON T KNOW so I assumed the logpX function is correct Problem The question is when I sampled from cifar it seems that the sampled images have overall higher loglikelihood than the real images std here has unit ie implies sry for ambiguity I am not sure why this happens Is this a bug or it is desired Thank you in advance The article briefly describe the architecture and refer to Real NVP for more details This lead me to believe Glow implemented the Squeeze operation as done by Real NVP It turns out this is not the case please see the images below GLOW RealNVP This can be fixed by changing a single line in squeeze d which can be found in tfopspy x tftransposex differs to RealNVP x tftransposex the same as RealNVP Please not similar changes needs to be done for unsqueeze d Does anyone know if this was intentional It might be that mixing up channels this way slightly improves performance The flow based model is very very interesting But it is too GPU hungry I see that some pretrained models are uploaded Now I have a question about the pretrained model on CelebA For unoptimized model the input for encoding includes three tensors encx inputimage encxd inputdownsampledimage ency inputlabel I want to know the relationship between encx and encxd If I want to test the model on x CelebA how should I use this pretrained model In order to perform inference on the trained model the input and output nodes for encodedecode must be known Does anyone know how to figure this out what the naming scheme is for a generic model with given hyperparameters Ive tried visualizing my trained model in tensorflow but the graph is extremely cluttered compared to that of the pretrained model making it impossible to decipher outputs input nodes Any help would be appreciated i want to train on imagenet datasetbut i cant load the dataset where shoud i change the correspoding code
