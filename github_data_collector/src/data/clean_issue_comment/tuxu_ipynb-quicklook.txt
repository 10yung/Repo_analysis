nbviewerjs started to implement LateX support I updated this repo with their master branch in hope you could release a new version of nbviewerapp on brew supporting LateX Cheers Developer cannot be verified img width altScreen Shot at src I noticed that the extension doesnt work without internet access Without internet it just shows a blank page Im not well versed in HTML but its obvious to me that the templatehtml file relies on external resources from buttflare servers This seems like a big design flaw for multiple reasons Obviously quicklook shouldnt need an internet connection to display offline content even though Buttflare is incredibly reliable relying on an external source introduces another point of failure and most importantly it doesnt allow the user to use a custom local stylesheet Is there a way to include the files locally I could be wrong but theoretically it should be possible to put them in the same directory as the html and then include them via relative paths I tried many different pieces of advice I found on various forums on this topic such as srcfilefilename srcfilename srcfilename srcassetsfilename where filename stands for the filename and assets is a folder But none worked My ugly solution Including the Javascript code inline inside the scriptscripttags it works but its ugly and lack modularity Id appreciate any input even if its just a hint how to to it with src attributes And even this solution leaves me with the problem how to include a local CSS stylesheet From what I read it should be possible to do although Im afraid this is beyond my rudimentary HTML knowledge Any help would be greatly appreciated Idea for enhancing the documentation in READMEmd You might want to mention in that if the user copies to his local LibraryQuickLook instead of the global folder LibraryQuickLook that then nothing will work I stumbled over this as I normally prefer to install in my local users folder Anything I could do Would it be possible to add MathJax to the code so that Latex equations appear instead of the in the quicklook view Or something more difficult is needed to add Latex support It is just a question Thanks
