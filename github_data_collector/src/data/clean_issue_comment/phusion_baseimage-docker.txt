My docker file FROM phusionbaseimage COPY limitsconf etcsecuritylimitsconf COPY sysctlconf etcsysctlconf The etcsysctlconf is worked but etcsecuritylimitsconf is not valid Hi Activity on this project is pretty rare the target of baseimagedocker really resonated with me Is there a maintained alternative Im trying to set a timeout for a container following this hack docker stop t docker run d stopsignal rm phusionbaseimagedocker but as docker stop sends a SIGTERM first my container is instantly stopped as if stopsignal wasnt considered by myinit So I have questions Is myinit compatible with stopsignal option Should I use another approach like timeout XX docker run d rm phusionbaseimagedocker I tried it with SIGKILLSIGTERMSIGINT without success and can myinit handle this Thanks a lot for your work it provides a really smooth path deeper into docker usage PS I followed this thread before thinking you could be interested by this question PS I expected to use a timeout for this kind of usage PS Here is my usage of your image Hi contributors to baseimagedocker Thanks for working on this repo I wanted to share with you an issue I hit tonight I use bazel to pull images from hubdockercom I was looking to pull tag or tag latest However I was getting this issue Image pull was unsuccessful reading image indexdockeriophusionbaseimage unsupported MediaType applicationvnddockerdistributionmanifestv prettyjws see It seems like Bazel wont support pulling schema images I dont know much about schema or schema version manifest images I was wondering if baseimagedocker was considering updating to schema version manifest images In the meantime Ill try an alternative Maybe Ill pull manually or Ill use another base image I have noticed that exposed ports are reachable only from localhost In spite of the fact the the hosting systems itself shows that the container is listening againts FROM phusionbaseimagelatest MAINTAINER Andrew Spear

for the tagging of baseimagedocker container images to match the version of LTS Ubuntu which it is built from and attach our semantic version Here is one idea phusionbaseimagedocker Any additional feedback is welcomed I would like to solidify this before we cut the next release The error is listed below the problem arise since recently before that there was no problem building images The step is RUN apt upgrade y Configuration file etccronweeklyfstrim Deleted by you or by a script since installation Package distributor has shipped an updated version What would you like to do about it Your options are Y or I install the package maintainers version N or O keep your currentlyinstalled version D show the differences between the versions Z start a shell to examine the situation The default action is to keep your current version fstrim YINODZ defaultN dpkg error processing package utillinux configure end of file on stdin at conffile prompt Errors were encountered while processing
