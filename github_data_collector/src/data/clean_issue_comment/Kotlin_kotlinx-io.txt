In Bytesappend function limits seems to grow too big This is current code with a comment that shows the problem kotlin if tail bufferssize buffers bufferscopyIntoarrayOfNullsbufferssize buffers has now a size old size limits limitscopyIntoIntArraybufferssize FIXME incorrect here limits size new buffer size old buffer size should be equal to new buffer size Hello everyone I would like to know if this library had support for communication over serial for receiving packets and sending them back Thanks in advance To properly evaluate end of file and safely treat trailing read symbol after r in readUTF Line I do not see safe way to implement it without changing how decodeUTF Chars works Trying to call eof inside condition does not work because of inline nature of the method With besteffort zerocopy To give users precise control over count of bytes to read As one of the most useful shorthands for readByteArrayarr I encountered few places where I need to either partially read or partially write Buffer For example I read some data read from file with limiting window I would be easily done if I could open for input only part of the buffer It would be quite easy to implement if Buffer would be an interface and not an expected class I think it is a good idea to make it an interface in any case since we probably will want to have multiple buffer implementations for a single platform It should not affect performance
