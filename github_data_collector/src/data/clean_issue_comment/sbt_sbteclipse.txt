See PR Add support for Java Execution Environments Hi I am working on eclipse for last one year Now I faced an issue in using scala project settings instead of default Eclipse cannot apply the scala installation I attached Screen shot in which my project required scala installation is selected but apply and close button is not working on any type of scala installation If anyone can help me screenshot from I would love to be able to customize the link names created by createLinkName Currently doing a crossProject results in some enormous link names for me It becomes pretty tedious to tell the different links apart quickly as there is so much redundant path info at the beginning whereas the only meaningful bit is at the end Alternatively instead of full customization another solution might be to have some builtin link naming convention for known CrossTypes ie CrossTypePure or CrossTypeFull that reduces some of the redundancy When I link my projects together in a certain way sbt produces this error when running sbt eclipse info About to create Eclipse project files for your projects error a required artifact is not listed by module descriptor error a required artifact is not listed by module descriptor error a required artifact is not listed by module descriptor error a required artifact is not listed by module descriptor error a required artifact is not listed by module descriptor error a required artifact is not listed by module descriptor Everything else works fine compiling building assemblies Even the project generation doesnt seem to suffer One special thing about the projects is that they transitively depend on other modules in the project Say my project has modules mA mB mC mD mE And one extnernal dependency which can be used both as a source as a binary dependency d They depend like this mA mB mC mD mE d It goes sour in modules D and E but if I look at the dependency tree everything looks as expected eg version conflicts are resolved as expected One thing I might add is that I systemically use EclipseKeyswithSource true And when I run sbt updateSbtClassifiers I get a somewhat unexpected failed download warn warn FAILED DOWNLOADS warn see resolution messages for details warn warn comtypesafesbteclipsesbteclipseplugin sbteclipsepluginjarsrc warn I will note the latter was observed by trying pretty much anything without any success As stated everything works Id just like to get some understanding why it produces the error and ideally how to avoid it as seeing errors from build output hurts the eyes sbt sbteclipse scala motivation most SBT projects are ignorant of the eclipse environment in the sense of how things are named in the workspace and possible name conflicts for example scalajs scalanative this proposal is to implement better name policy to be supported provided enforced by this plugin by default similar to the pr I created inner project using guidelines from Documentation Project compiles under SBT and runs correctly but when I invoke eclipse it Doesnt honor EclipseKeyswithSource false and EclipseKeyswithJavadoc false for subproject it downloads it anyway In Eclipse folder containing source of a subproject is not being added into Source folder in Build Path Dependencies for subproject are not being imported into Eclipse despite aggregatebackenddependsOnbackend Im using the SBT protobuf plugin together with sbteclipse on SBT addSbtPlugincomgithubgseitz sbtprotobuf addSbtPlugincomtypesafesbteclipse sbteclipseplugin Now it seems that sbteclipse doesnt see the extra managedSources that enablePluginsProtobufPlugin puts into a project configuration unless thats explicitly invoked before running eclipse In other words in a clean workspace sbt eclipse will generate a correct classpath But running it again will not have the srcmanaged generated protobuf sources in it Touching a proto file opening the SBT console and typing compile and then eclipse will once more yield the correct result I stumbled onto this when doing an SBT upgrade Im unsure whether this worked before or whether Im just missing something extra in my project Id expect that managedSources is interrogated by sbt eclipse before generating the classpath though so I dont know whats up On Mac Os X when upgrading an Akka project from sbt to sbt I get a javalangClassNotFoundException scalaInt when starting the

different scalaVersion In eclipse both are seen as which gives problems when adding dependencies buildsbt scala lazy val xproject project settings scalaVersion lazy val yproject project settings
