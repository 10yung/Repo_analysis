rootmodelsresearchslim python cant open file rootrootmodelsresearchobjectdetectionbuildersmodelbuildertestpy Errno No such file or directory Last few days I have trying to do object detection for custom dataset Problem is it works for single class detection like given here eg dog I tried it with and there is no bounding box appearing after inferencing the fine tuned model When i do it for single class it works normally What am I doing wrong I tried with different models from tensorflow zoossdfaster rcnn as suggested here but nothing works for multiclass training MODEL used fasterrcnninceptionv coco Link to my drive made in a rush Please help Hi While running your code on colab I found that for me its going in root directory so objectdetectionbuildersmodelbuildertestpy gives me error I modified that part by replacing ospathabspathoscurdir from hard coded value Thank you First of all let me say this is not an issue regarding your code but I think you will have some suggestions to make I am training custom object detector with ssdmobilenetv coco as the pretrained model For this I am following this tutorial But in the training section it crashed after about steps My train set has about images and test set has The batch size is which is the default value in the config file Have you faced any similar issues when training Would like to hear your suggestions
