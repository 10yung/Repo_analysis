samples showing how the API will be used Feature request can we please get a geofire version compatible with firebase xx Version info UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY firebase firebaseadmin firebaseauth firebasefunctions firebasetools geofire objecthash tslint typescript npm ERR peer dep missing firebase xx xx xx required by geofire Expected behavior Compatible geofire library with the latest firebase Actual behavior The requirement restriction makes it impossible to use firebase and firebaseadmin together as it shows the known issue where google cloud complains that a database has already been registered when these two packages are imported in the same file I am learning how to work with GeoFire and started on a quite simple project there is a bunch of locations I want to make a query based on some point and radius here is the code so far js var geoFireRef firebasedatabaserefchildlocations var geoFire new GeoFiregeoFireRef Create a GeoQuery var geoQuery geoFirequery center radius geoQueryonready function consolelogGeoQuery has loaded and fired all other events for initial data Test get key location geoFireget thenfunctionlocation if location null consolelogProvided key is not in GeoFire else consolelogProvided key has a location of location functionerror consolelogError error geoQueryonkeyentered functionkey location distance consolelogkey entered query at location distance km from center The data structure is also very simple Here is the response in the console scriptsjs GeoQuery has loaded and fired all other events for initial data scriptsjs Provided key has a location of I am certain there are a lot of points in my dataset which should fall into km circle but I dont get any Get request does provide location for given keys so I presume the issue is in the way I handle the Query Version info What versions of the following libraries are you using Note that your issue may already be fixed in the latest versions RNFirebase GeoFire Steps to reproduce I am using geofire with react native application there are multiple nodes location present around the world in my db and now I am fetching them using geoQuery in km radius but if the fetched nodes are less than the radius increase by km and so on I figured if I use km as MaxRadius then Ill cover the globe But once my radius crossed km I was only getting the nearest nodes but where as I am getting all the nodes at km even those which are km away from center So I set the max at km but that differs with respect to center like km is max to C but km is max to C and increasing that would result only near nodes Expected behavior Get all nodes as I increase the radius Actual behavior Getting only nearest nodes at MaxRadius Description Update the example applications to use Firebase xx and GeoFire xx Code sample In the head of the HTML files HTML Firebase script src script src GeoFire script src And when we create a GeoFire instance in the JavaScript JavaScript Create a new GeoFire instance at the random Firebase location var geoFireInstance new geofireGeoFirefirebaseRef Think you found a bug Yeah were definitely not perfect Please use the bug report template below and include a minimal repro when opening the issue Version info Firebase GeoFire Other eg Node browser operating system if applicable Using GeoFire without NodeJS Test case Try to use this fish example with version Steps to reproduce Try to use this fish example with version var geoFire new GeoFirefirebaseRef Expected behavior GeoFire instance is created without an error Actual behavior You get an error ReferenceError GeoFire is not defined GeoFire class is not found Workaround Using geofire object worked var geoFire new geofireGeoFirefirebaseRef Is there any callback similar to GeoQueryDataEventListener which is present in Java Thank you for contributing to the Firebase community Please fill out the pull request form below and make note of the following Run the linter and test suite Make sure your changes

GitHub is not the best place for them and they will be closed Here are some resources to get help Start with the documentation Read the full API reference Try out some examples If the official documentation doesnt help try asking through our official support channels Please avoid double posting across multiple channels Think you found a bug Yeah were definitely not perfect Please use the bug report template below and include a minimal repro when opening the issue Have a feature request Great we love hearing how we can improve our products Just remove the template below and provide an explanation of your feature request Provide code samples if applicable Try to think about what it will allow you to do that you cant do today How will it make current workarounds straightforward What potential bugs and edge cases does it help to avoid Version info What versions of the following libraries are you using Note that your issue may already be fixed in the latest versions I think there is a problem with index rule of Firebase ref because it worked well with other reference however it just didnt work with this ref from geoFirejs Firebase GeoFire Other eg Node browser operating system if applicable Test case Provide a minimal complete and verifiable example using either Plunker or JSFiddle Steps to reproduce const onChildChange data const position dataval consoleloggeofire with Firebase firebasedatabaserefgeofirelimitToLast onchildadded onChildChange This is my code inside componentDidMount from my React Native project For now this function was not be called after a new item added to Firebase database refgeofire is the reference geofire in the local app as well This is my Firebase database Provide the steps needed to reproduce the issue given the above test case Expected behavior onChildChange should be called each time new item has been created on Firebase server What is the expected behavior Actual behavior There is nothing log out in consolelog right now A new item has been created well What is the actual behavior
