I am currently using this command to lock the screen betterlockscreen lock timeposx h timestrIMS p Once locked it shows the time as without the AMPM It is also pushed about two spaces to the right This issue does not occur when using a nonwhitespace character as a separator so IMSp works I want to add some more information to lock screen like date nmappletor connection properties but there is no way to do it in the current state Changed minor details to comply with shellcheck I normally use WinSpace to change my keyboard layout Everytime I forgot to change it back to En and my screen is locked I cant change my keyboard layout So I cant enter my password and lock back in Maybe a setting to automatically change keyboard layout to En when screen is lock would be great As the title states Ive been trying to get the lock to exit the menu after I make a choice so when I log back in I dont accidentally log out or something bindsym mod mode modesystem set modesystem lock exit switchuser suspend hibernate reboot Shiftshutdown mode modesystem bindsym l exec betterlockscreen l dimblur bindsym s exec betterlockscreen s dimblur bindsym u exec nostartupid i exit switchuser mode default bindsym e exec nostartupid i exit logout mode default bindsym h exec betterlockscreen l systemctl hibernate bindsym r exec nostartupid i exit reboot mode default bindsym Shifts exec nostartupid i exit shutdown mode default exit system mode Enter or Escape bindsym Return mode default bindsym Escape mode default Any idea how can I achieve this It used to work when I used to run bindsym l exec nostartupid i exit lock mode default Hello I got betterlockscreengit from the AUR on archlinux I am having a x screen and I tried different wallpaper exactly the same size IMG The box is kind of misaligned or too small the circle is also outside the box Maybe you can look into it sometime updatecolor generated images based on hex color provided as argument betterlockscreen c abeb Generates images lcolorpng and colorpng with background color as abeb betterlockscreen l color Locks screen with background image lcolorpng Resolves This flag displays the current keyboard layout next to the time Intends to close Very small changes in order to display the keyboard layout on the lockscreen as cleanly as possible The perfect way to do it would be to change the size of the rectangle on update but that is way too complex and unnecessary for an option like this in my opinion Another solution would be to use setxkbmap query in order to always get twoletters code us fr cn ru and not i locks keylayout option that displays us french chinese Let me know what you think Ive been searching for screensavers and noticed that some of them offered to block tty access as well obviously none of them was has good looking as this one so i think this would be a nice feature to be added Im using Gentoo with openRC so the s option doesnt work Currently Im using pmutils with a hook like this bash usrbinenv bash This file is a pmutils hook to start betterlockscreen when suspendhibernate is started This file goes in etcpmsleepd and must have execution permission s here is needed for whatever reason without it betterlockscreen will start and lock the suspend process until I provide my password case in hibernatesuspend su USER c betterlockscreen s lock blur esac It works but I wonder if it would be possible to integrate it in the script itself
