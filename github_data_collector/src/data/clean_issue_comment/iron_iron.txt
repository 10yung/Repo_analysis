Handling requests from an upstream server or tor is a must If the upstream server is local it becomes encumbering to use ports on a localhost interface for IPC Enter Unix Domain Sockets Some typos and depreacation warnings addressed Is this repo still in active development And if so who are the users that have the rights to reviewmerge pull requests cc phlmn which is the only one I know for sure can merge For some reason query strings were no longer being taken into consideration and the routes would get no query string value at all if they wanted to So this fixes and adds a test to ensure it wont come back Several compilation errors related to try macro were fixed as well Ive just started looking at possible web frameworks to use with Rust and based on the cratesio Web programmingHTTP server category and the list of five other frameworks on the homepage of arewewebyetorg I wasnt considering Iron I just found it in other searches Looking at the Cargotoml in the iron directory I see that it doesnt have category nor keyword entries which presumably explains why its not listed in the aforementioned category I was wondering if at least the category and perhaps some suitable keywords should be added to that Cargotoml Im having trouble getting the example in the documentation to work Even the examples throw errors UrlEncodedQuery parses fine no problems Is Params still supported Url Handler fn getStatesByCountryIdreq mut Request IronResultResponse Code printlnParams reqgetrefParams match reqgetrefUrlEncodedQuery Okref hashmap printlnParsed GET request query string n hashmap Errref e println e Output Params ErrInvalidPath Parsed GET request query string name jason age This seems to be a regression between and master The issue currently exists on master and Im not exactly sure why but it is very easy to reproduce rust extern crate iron extern crate hyper use hyperStatusCode use ironprelude fn testhandler mut Request IronResultResponse OkResponsewithStatusCodeOK Test response n fn main Ironnewtesthandlerhttp Running the code above has Iron successfully listen on the port Using curl the request fails with a Bad Request like so curl v Trying TCPNODELAY set Connected to port GET HTTP Host UserAgent curl Accept HTTP Bad Request contentlength date Sun Mar GMT Connection to host left intact And the server produces the following error when I setup and configure the rust logger ERROR T Z ironiron Error creating request Couldnt parse requested URL invalid IPv address Can we replace WriteBody with a boxed IntoBody or a custom trait It seems that the whole response is now loaded into memory and Id like to avoid that in some cases This is probably also related to Simplify Chains handle method by using iter and fold on the BeforeMiddleware and AfterMiddleware and andthen on the intermediate result As a result the functions that were previously used are now unneeded and the code is therefore shorter cleaner and more concise We should compile a list containing all middlewares and plugins we can find It should be categorized and include links to the corresponding documentations and repositories Edit We could use the GitHub API to check which version they support and if they are being updated This issue is used to collect them Official Middlewares mount persistent router urlencoded logger ironsessionstorage staticfile Plugins params bodyparser Community Middlewares ironcsrf rustsecuresession handlebarsiron ironjsonresponse ironmiddlefiddle corsware ironhmac ironcors ironerrorrouter oven Plugins Other maud multipart askama Projects that use Iron rustless mdbook aurelius simplehttpserver gauc
