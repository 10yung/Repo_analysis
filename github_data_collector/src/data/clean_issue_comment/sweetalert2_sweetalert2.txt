 Current behavior When showCloseButton true and the text is long enough the text goes behind the close button Expected behavior The text should avoid the button Live demo GitHub Package Registry is in public beta stage now tada tada tada What does that mean for us Well theres a small note in their docs Note GitHub Package Registry only supports scoped NPM packages Scoped packages have names with the format of ownername So I published the package with the scope The sweetalert package was published years ago in and at that time I didnt put much thinking into naming If I would name this package today Ill go with sweetalert sweetalert because thats IMO logical and aligned with GitHub repo no repo can be without an authororganisation or in other words a scope As were getting close to the next major release I propose the change in the package name diff name sweetalert name sweetalert sweetalert Would like to hear your thought and objections gverni zenflow toverux other opinions are of course welcome as well Thanks Hi All We are really keen to collect your feedback and to start with wed like to know who is using SweetAlert We would really appreciate if you Share your company name Share your logo in which case it might be used in the readme frontpage etc What kind of project How large code base size or team size If your project is open source or public please share a link What do you like most about SweetAlert what could be done better And of course you can show your heart and support by making a donation Is there any support for optgroups in select input types I need to show some hierarchal options in select input Babel recently release support for private instance method see here Given the following comment I tried using the new private instance in babel The work is very far from being finalized and there are still quite a lot failures but the basic functionalities are implemented ie Pressing ok and cancel button Call close method What I did was Refactor main as private instance method main Refactor swalPromiseresolve as private instance method swalPromiseResolve Change implementation of close to use private method swalPromiseResolve As I said its more of a proof of conept than anything else but I wanted to start gathering your feedback limonte zenflow sorry I pressed the wrong button when i created this PR and it was created without comment and wrong title Right now for backwards compatibility all instance methods are also exposed as static methods via proxy methods defined here We should drop this block of code change the appropriate static methods to instance methods eg SwalgetTitle swalgetTitle Should make sure that calling these methods apply to that particular instance and not the currently active swal since they can be different Note there are no instance methods that should become static methods add static method like SwalgetCurrentInstance which will be generally useful and also allow for easy migration in situations where a user is using one of the methods that were changed to an instance method but they didnt save a reference to the instance Split documentation on methods into static methods and instance methods Hi When I try to use sweetalert on iPhone iOS latest the VoiceOver assistive tech for blind people doesnt read the description of sweet alert modals Example swaltitle desc success The VoiceOver reads Ok button title modals but no desc I try the modals on bootstrap docs page and everything works the example in sweetalert homepage doesnt work instead If you need another test or infos ask me Regards So having things split into modules now after is awesome but I want to go a step further in organizing the code base and start separating concerns by extracting distinct features into separate layers as core Swal extensions in modules in the srcextensions dir I commented about this here and here Dumping my unsorted list of observations in here These may likely need to be split into separate discrete issues x Custom HTML thumbsdown button example lacks labelname focus set to great user has to reversetab to get to links best to set focus to start of content instead A warning message with a function attached to the Confirmbutton the second modal after Yes delete it is not announced only OK button is ditto for following and by passing a parameter you can execute something else for Cancel x A message with a custom image and CSS animation disabled image lacks proper alt Ajax request example input lacks labelname visible custom error message not associated with input busy indicator not announced temporarily hear focus moving to top of page before new modal appears Dynamic queue temporarily hear focus moving to top of page busy indicator not announced result modal still has Your public IP will be received via AJAX request text somewhere Inputsform controls lack labels may need a new parameter to be able to provide explicit label input types example email example password example textarea example select example range example multiple inputs example select choosing not ukraine shows error message but this is not announcedassociated at all selecting ukraine shows success modal which is not announced only OK button radio busy indicator at start not announced successresult modal not announced checkbox error when continuing unchecked not announcedassociated success modal not announced multiple inputs success modal not announced Improvement x nonalert part not ariahidden inert eg using JAWS can use cursor key up to navigate back out into page may require extensive work though x in demo page itself clearer contrast and focus indication Hello Is it possible to change the spinner when using showLoaderOnConfirm and reuse the previous loader from sweetalert button with dots Thanks
