matcaffe WHCN HWCN subpixel Convolution layer SRCNN tensorflow layer the paper said it can reach fps on CPU but I test it on i with set only fps Hello I am just wondering if it is at all possible to make FSRCNN to look like Waifu x does with full denoising and still running it in real time on a high end gpu The image scaling I want is x up to p and around fps solver max w fixed w loss ESRCN Implementation details For the ESPCN we set l f n f n and f in our evaluations The choice of the parameter is inspired by SRCNN s layer model and the equations in Sec In the training phase r r pixel subimages are extracted from the training ground truth images IHR where r is the upscaling factor To synthesize the lowresolution samples ILR we blur IHR using a Gaussian filter and subsample it by the upscaling factor The subimages are extracted from original images with a stride of Pmod f r from IHR and a stride of Pmod f from ILR This ensures that all pixels in the original image appear once and only once as the ground truth of the training data We choose tanh instead of relu as the activation function for the final model motivated by our experimental results What is the performance of your fsrcnn implementation in psnr I cannot make my network to the same performance as the paper given How many iteration does it need to reach the same performance of fsrcnn Thanks
