I would like to express my thanks to Maarten Baert for creating such great software Thanks If an OpenGL game is launched in full screen right after stopping recording it loses focus the moment encoding popup shows up Some games might not even be able to take back control afted the dialog closes and the input to that game might be rendered as broken The prime example is minetest running in full screen and while ingame after stopping the recording it loses focus wo a way to get back in where the cursor is shown instead of the game being in focus and be controlled by mouse and keyboard OS Ubuntu LTS Xfce Affected game Minetest SSR Version SimpleScreenRecorder Compiled with GCC Qt header lib libavformat header lib libavcodec header lib libavutil header lib libswscale header lib Can we stop recording after n minutes where n is a user defined parameter Hello I get in Linux Buster Intel bit When recording a constantly black video as if he does not find the monitor Even the preview shows only a black picture the title probably isnt very clear but is there a way to somehow get the ffmpeg command SSR calls with all the options attached something like ffmpeg f x grab videosize x framerate showregion i f pulse ac i videomp im sure it doesnt look like this at all but is there a way to get it Can it do Motion Detection thx Hey there This is a great project exactly what I was looking for Unfortunately for me I hadnt installed it earlier because I didnt realize that it had a GUI for doing the recording There wasnt a whole lot of description in the README so I didnt know if it was just a commandline tool or a userfriendly GUI It would be great to have screenshots of it in the README along with maybe a little bit more explanation of what it provides It would be nice if the file extension was automatically appended or was autofilled in the filename entry box Took me a little but to figure out why a file upload was being rejected and it was because myfile wasnt a recognised mp file but changing to myfilemp fixed this Hi Maarten My use case is Im making a screencast with SSR to demonstrate how to use different audio jackenabled apps One of those apps is Claudia an audioMIDI session manager based on LADISH During the screencast I have to stop the claudiastudio to for the user demonstration purpose then to relaunch it A part of Claudia stopping the studio is that Claudia kills jack My issue here is that when cutting jack off SSR stops recording complaining that jack isnt there anymore which is obviously true What I would like is SSR to keep recording maybe by autoswitching itself to a none audio recording when jack disappears then automatically switch back to jack when it does reappears That said I know that were not in a magic world and I have no clue if that is already doable or if that would need a lot of code or whatever Just wanting to share the thought with you MaartenBaert in case of it does ring a bell Anyway thanks for SSR still a wonderful piece of software Hey there I cant tell you enough how much I love SSR I was using Peek before and it is garbage compared to this I was wondering though if it were at all possible to request a feature I pretty much always use the same settings the only thing I end up changing is the Select Rectangle and then I start recording stop and save I do a lot of development in the Unity game engine so I often want to quickly be able to select and area and record what something is doing so I can send it to a friend or similar So my request is would it be at all possible to have something of a quick record feature I see that when SSR is opened there is a tray icon so perhaps if there was a close to tray and it could stay opened then add a hotkey for directly initiating the Select Rectangle then once selected I could just hit the record hotkey without ever having to open the main window and flip through the settings pages to get to the selection and the record button Another option would be instead of having it sitting on the tray if I could call from script something like simplescreenrecorder selectrectangle startrecord timer this might allow me to start the application minimized begin selecting the rectangle area and then after a second timer or just by hotkey again it would automatically start recording That was I could set a keyboard shortcut to that command and be able to set different settings flags Along with those if either of them are able to be done once the recording is stoppedfinished if it could bring up the main menu right to the save screen is there a way to preview of what was recorded before saving it so it could either be saved or canceled and started over Lastly this one is not dependent at all on the others and would just be a nice overall addition If there could be an option to automatically open to the folder in which the video was just saved after it is completed that would be awesome None of these are showstoppers for me or anything but I record often enough that they would be super beneficial Again love the application keep up the great work Thanks MH
