humans behind Greenkeeper details Your Greenkeeper bot palmtree Bug Report Operating system Linux Fedora Node Version v Dat Version Expected behavior dat init should create a datjson or if it already exists update selected properties such as title and description while keeping any previously set properties intact I am hoping to keep eg experimental intact for Beaker Actual behavior dat init discards all previously set properties in datjson creates a file that only has the title and description set Note A similar issue was previously discussed in but it seems the behavior has since changed again The devDependency hypercore was updated from to This version is not covered by your current version range If you don t accept this pull request your project will work just like it did

anyone successfully running dat from inside kubernetes The following Deployment is currently working for me but it would be nice to avoid requiring hostNetwork true Also wondering how to best specify the dat keys I am currently sharing them from the host which works all right in this scenario but isnt a very general solution Also the node this container is running on essentially has a public ip which might be making this easier I havent yet tested it from inside kubernetes on a node without a public ip apiVersion appsv kind Deployment metadata name datserver labels app datserver spec

you Run dat v to see the version of Dat you are using Operating system Debian Node Version v Dat Version I am trying to store a borg repository in dat It creates a file called lockexclusive while writing to the repository and deletes this when it is done I have added lockexclusive to datignore in many formats just to be safe but dat still crashes regardless My datignore includes lockexclusive lock lockexclusive lockexclusive lockexclusive Expected behavior What do you think should happen Dat should not look at ignored files and would not crash Even if it is watching the file it should
