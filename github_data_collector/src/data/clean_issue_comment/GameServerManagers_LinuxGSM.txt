with Insurgency Sandstorm server installed type in the commands shown above Enjoy the errors Expected behavior The expected behavior would be an updated on the application that is trying to be updated The current instructions on the website look like this yum install mailx postfix curl wget tar bzip gzip unzip python binutils bc jq tmux glibci libstdc libstdci However on CentOS there is no python package It should probably be replaced by python which worked for me I realize that for CentOS python is a valid package So maybe there should be a new tab for CentOS or a different soltution Basic info Distro Ubuntu Game Cstrike Command Monitor game dig LinuxGSM version v Further Information Server will default to max players after hours If I hardcode maxplayers to not seeing it happen so far I

refactoring the ouput from the dt command most of the output works fine as Im splitting the string around the character to produce the array EG Key value LinuxGSM version v this works fine in most cases and most other outputs are easy enough to create a key for with the exception of this part mcserver outputs Game INBOUND tcp Query INBOUND udp Rcon INBOUND tcp however most other games output like GameRCON INBOUND tcpudp SourceTV INBOUND udp Client OUTBOUND udp the easy fix is to add s after the title and remove the and any thoughts Basic info Distro Fedora Game Garrys Mod Command Update LinuxGSM version v Further Information I downloaded and attempted to start Garrys Mod on the default public branch Then in configconfiglgsmgmodservercommoncfg I set branchx to try the new bit branch I then ran the update command where LGSM said that my build number matched the desired one it did not it still matched public I used forceupdate to pull the branch which worked I then ran update again but LGSM complained that I had a version mismatch and attempted to update to the latest public branch build again I confirmed using the details command that LGSM is correctly detecting the brach I set gmodserver details Garrys Mod Server Details Server name Gmod Server Branch x gmodserver update after forceupdate gmodserver u OK Update gmodserver Checking for update SteamCMD Update available Local build Remote build Cplying update The local build is correct the remote build is incorrect and still points to the latest build on public borzaka In this update I get the same bug with didnt restart servers like in this issue Issue was closed but I cant reopen it so I create this one Scripts logs Log with bug csgoserverscriptlog Log without bug csgoserverscriptlog I can give more logs with the same trouble after today update and without it Just say what logs do u need Description While installing the No More Room In Hell server went smooth every startup after the first one results in a crash The logs revealed that certain files were missing these files according to Steam Community posts were renamed around I added a sh file based from a fix posted on the Steam Community forums that only runs on the No More Room In Hell server installation which automatically creates symbolic links towards the old filenames Fixes Type of change x Bug fix change which fixes an issue New feature

your Pull Request Rust server is not saved immidiately after server restart or restart with forceupdate Players abusing that User Story After installing a new No More Room In Hell server with default configuration attempting to start the server after stopping or restarting the server will result in a crash Basic info Distro Ubuntu LTS Server Game No More Room In Hell Command Start LinuxGSM version v Further Information The logs in logconsole claim there to be a missing file AppFramework Unable to load module soundemittersystemso Unable to load interface VSoundEmitter from soundemittersystemso Looking through the Steam forums revealed that some files got renamed somewhere in for example soundemittersystemso is now soundemittersystemsrvso It can be manually fixed by adding a symbolic link And although that fixed the problem with that file it appeared that there were more files suffering from the same problem A user on the Steam Community Forums listed a full list of symbolic links that should be made and sure enough no more errors were to be seen afterwards To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behaviour Install the nmrihserver with default configuration Start the server Restart the server The server will fail to launch and a log file is generated with the missing file error Expected behaviour The server should ideally be able to restart without issues
