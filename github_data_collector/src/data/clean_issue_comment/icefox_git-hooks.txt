 When listing hooks I get an error Usersjasonkarnsconfiggithooks postcheckoutfatal ambiguous argument unknown revision or path not in the working tree Use to separate paths from revisions like this git command revision file fatal ambiguous argument unknown revision or path not in the working tree Use to separate paths from revisions like this git command revision file fatal ambiguous argument unknown revision or path not in the working tree Use to separate paths from revisions like this git command revision file fatal ambiguous argument unknown revision or path not in the working tree Use to separate paths from revisions like this git command revision file cmdreminder postcheckoutctags postcommitctags postmergectags postrewritectags Having global hook location be configurable is awesome Would love the perproject location to be configurable as well would be in that repos gitconfig file naturally Example git config hookslocal scriptsgit I am using some custom hooks myself I think an essential piece of functionality is missing from your code In order to perform test whether or not my program compiles my tests pass I need to clean the environment first I use the following lines for this namegit describe long dirty abbrev tags fullnameprecommit name git stash save q keepindex includeuntracked fullname git clean f d run tests etc git stash pop q This gets me out of problem such as including anontrackedfileh Shouldnt this be possible in the scripts via some push pop or similar functions Would you consider having an option that would enable userglobal hooks by default It would still be necessary to run some command to enable project hooks This should remove any security concerns and would make things a lot more convenient for those who only use githooks for these purposes How do you enable just a single hook in a local repo Git add repo gitmaster git add insideLibraryApplication SupportSublime Text PackagesUserPreferencessublimesettings Git commit repo gitmaster git commit m Minor update grep insideLibraryApplication No such file or directory grep SupportSublime No such file or directory grep Text No such file or directory grep PackagesUserPreferencessublimesettings No such file or directory master ec a Minor update file changed insertion deletion I see some grep commands in the main file but dont which is causing the issue Change IFS when looping in result from function hookdirs Hi I think that fix for issue is not complete I still had trouble when repo path contains spaces in hooksdirs function The fix that I did consist to set IFS to n before looping through result of hookdirs and now it works githooks list and githooks run works using correct paths BR Regards
