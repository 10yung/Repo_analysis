 Can you publish this to Firefox Addons Maybe I got something wrong but it seems that octohint only works for public repos not private ones im talking about golang that use tab officially an example I ran yarn yarn start But it stops at Child htmlwebpackplugin for optionshtml asset Entrypoint undefined optionshtml nodemoduleswebpackbuildinglobaljs webpackbuildinglobaljs bytes built nodemoduleswebpackbuildinmodulejs webpackbuildinmodulejs bytes built hidden modules Whats going on And if I download the crx from chrome store install it to firefox resulted in There was an error during installation File UserslinonetwoDownloads does not contain a valid manifest Can you provide a release for firefox officially When trying to use this on a Bitbucket Server it does not work I added to the options Tested on github not an installation issue Is Bitbucket Server supported Could the port in the pattern be an issue Is there a way to tell if octohint is active on a page possibly changing the extension icon when active Chrome octohint First awesome extension I tested it by immediately browsing this same repo and the hint gets clipped by the code view You can reproduce by going to octohintscriptsgetnodelibsjs and hovering over fsreadFileSync screen shot at It would be really cool if this extension worked in pull requests as that would make reviewing things a lot more efficient Is this possible at all
