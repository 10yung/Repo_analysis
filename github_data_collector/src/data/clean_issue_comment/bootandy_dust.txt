Awesome work Any chance of adding a man page Maybe something like ripgrep has using asciidoc man dust No manual entry for dust I see dust help works but itd be handy to have a man page too since its many peoples first instinct when trying a new cli tool DaisyDisk uses this and it is very fast at gather diskspace information It doesnt seem to work on Windows dust m M m I get the same output no matter which flags I pass Any idea why Im mostly writing this so I get the close notification when this happens but it would be neat if there were rpmdeb packages for dust
