Cloud Environment projectsmantl master terraform version Terraform v It looks like either the nodename should be set to a mantl friendly name hostname mantlcontrol or the cert should be build with the aws internal dns name move etcD to Was discussing with thomasvincent on Mattermost that changes in the recent minor release of Kubernetes v have changed the way that access to a cluster is granted and propagated The old method that I was using in was to log into an APIcontroller node in the cluster directly and run kubectl against this mode of access has gone away with now I think you are meant to connect via SSL with the generated certificate admin credential for the first time and perhaps also grant permissions to users somehow using RBAC controls that are in beta now I have no idea how this works but I am sure that how it works is new and complicated and should be mentioned in the FAQ Updating Traefik to latest version and fix fixes Removes deprecated call in apiserver yaml file tracking
