When I Inspect element in the elements I see that my SCSS code is already being output to CSS If I click on it it will redirect me to CSS file Is there a way for me to get the line number of the SCSS so that I can pinpoint directly where that code is and do my changes rather than finding the classes and elements in the scss or sass file For example test In chrome debug it points to the CSS file line number but in my scss file that code is not in line number but in a different line Is there another way to debug it or get the line number of the scss file Thank you the ng shortcuts create import statements like import Component from angularcore instead of import Component from angularcore auto Enable automatic nesting and Autonest selected items do not work even though automatic nesting is enabled I have to manually rightclick on my ts file to nest it under my html file WebEssential Bundle doesnt minify properly vendor specific keyframes removed Critical bug When we minifiy css using bundle it removes the vendor specific animation which breaks the css Examples are shown in the below screenshots Please let me know if there is any confusion Moreover this is a critical bug should be fixed Code Differences Left BundledStylecss Right we have BundledStylemincss which is beautified to compare webessential error Bundle code bundlecode Version webessential Sorry for creating an issue but I wasnt sure where else to turn to Im using Web Essentials but the current project setup has an entire IIS dev environment set up on my local machine Most of the content is static content but it gets served through mylocalmachinecompanytldcom on our intranet Attempting to access the application over localhost doesnt work as it messes up the networking calls authentication How can I use browser link with the above setup Im assuming I probably cant as Web Essentials is setting up its own server when run from Visual Studios I have file name xyzdevjs and I want minify file name is xyzjs not xyzdevminjs Is there any way to solve this problem as soon as possible I have tried to resolve this thing using hacks but my bad luck Please help me to resolve this issue Ever since I installed this update Browser Link is broken The script gets injected into the html page but the browser cannot open the url stating that the connection was refused In Chrome Failed to load resource netERRCONNECTIONREFUSED This is the closest SO article that describes the issue and I went through everything on the list Still broken Disabled my firewall tried different browsers verified port conflicts etc I am having a problem I cant minify a css codes by rightClick on page Web EssentialsMinify selection version HTML is not minified when using the HTML bundler with minify set to true if you have your HTML within script tags Not sure if anything inside the script tags would minify This could be FAD but it would be great if the minifier would either also minify content within script tags especially if the typetextngtemplate Bundling HTML seems like a perfect solution for placing Angular app view templates into the cache if it could get beyond the script tag
