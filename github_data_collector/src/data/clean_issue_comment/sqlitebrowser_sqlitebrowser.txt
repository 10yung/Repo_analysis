to work with Spatialite in DB S I have had a series of issues that I think I have finally narrowed down to a legitimate bug In DB S I create a clean inmemory database and then I run the following SQL Ive provided inline commentary with expected behavior SELECT sqliteversion Return SELECT loadextensionmodspatialitedll Return Null load extension SELECT spatialiteversion Return beta SELECT InitSpatialMetaData Return create Spatialite MetaData tables and triggers SELECT CheckSpatialMetaData Return indicating the DB MetaData is Spatialite compliant CREATE TABLE test Field INTEGER SELECT AddGeometryColumntest geom POINT Return This however doesnt work SELECT spatialiteversion works as expected the extension appears to be loaded However SELECT InitSpatialMetaData returns indicating that the Spatialite function didnt run AddGeometryColumntest geom POINT likewise returns After a lot of trial and error what I discovered is that this code does workish if I do the following SELECT sqliteversion SELECT loadextensionmodspatialitedll SELECT spatialiteversion SELECT InitSpatialMetaData SELECT typenamesqltblname FROM mainsqlitemaster SELECT CheckSpatialMetaData CREATE TABLE test Field INTEGER SELECT AddGeometryColumntest geom POINT PRAGMA mainTABLEINFOtest SELECT InitSpatialMetaData still returns But when I run SELECT typenamesqltblname FROM mainsqlitemaster I see that in fact all of the tables and triggers have been created this is reflected in the GUI only after I run SELECT typenamesqltblname FROM mainsqlitemaster When I run SELECT AddGeometryColumntest geom POINT it appears to fail as well But after running PRAGMA mainTABLEINFOtest the new column is reflected in the GUI Checking the SQL Error log in DB S the following errors show up On loadingcreating database API call with invalid database connection pointer misuse at line of db d On SELECT InitSpatialMetaData statement aborts at BEGIN cannot start a transaction within a transaction table spatialrefsys

ALTER TABLE test ADD COLUMN geom POINT duplicate column name geom in ALTER TABLE test ADD COLUMN geom POINT duplicate column name geom in ALTER TABLE test ADD COLUMN geom POINT Looking at the Spatialite logs spatialite appears to be perfectly happy Despite InitSpatialMetaData and AddGeometryColumn returning the log shows the underlying operations as successful with no error My theories from troubleshooting are as follows DB S for some reason doesnt like the bulk operations being performed by the Spatialite functions It only reflects the changes to the DB in GUI after being forced to by touching PRAGMA I figured this out by noticing that the changes showed up in the GUI after the application submitted SQL code involving PRAGMA The SQL Error Log combined with the Spatialite Log is leading me to believe that what is happening with the functions returning is not actually that theyre failing There is something about the SpatiaLiteSQLiteDB S interaction which is causing the underlying SQL to loop and the errors to be handled but logged The zero that is being returned by InitSpatialMetaData isnt telling me the operation failed but that it ran successfully and then immediately ran again the that I get as a response is the response from whatever the last iteration of the loop was and Spatialite saying the last iteration didnt run because the tables had all been created the first time It appears to be something about the way DB S batches SQL statements but I havent the fuzziest what to do try from here As housekeeping I did confirm that all the dlls Im using function using the SQLite CLI Ive replicated this behavior across two computers with both the stable release and nextgen variants of SpatiaLite Using all three possible methods in DB S of loading extensions Useful extra information DB S v Jan built for x littleendianllp on Windows winnt x using SQLite Version and Qt Details for the issue My scenario is Im trying to open a db file from a shared
