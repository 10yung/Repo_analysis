I choose auto mode to start shadowsXbut all my request is transfer in the socket eg I open ipcn with auto mode connected to usca then i got my ipaddress was which in Los Angeles California United States Ive registered the shortcuts but they stopped working once I reopen the software Any solution for that If you create a new Shadowsocks configuration with KCPTUN enabled leaving the Shadowsocks port field with its default value you will not be able to save the configuration as it doesnt pass the programs validation I think in this case port field can be safely ignored since this is already configured on KCPTUN serverside
