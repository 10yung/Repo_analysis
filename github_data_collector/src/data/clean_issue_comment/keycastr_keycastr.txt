I use an option key with mouse drag to copy a clip in Adobe Premiere I would like to show the option key press on the screen Currently it doesnt show unless I press a regular key with the modifier Can this application be set to a fixed position it will return to the bottom left corner each time it is turned on Delete key is forward delete is but shifted forward delete shows as a boxed question mark indicating I guess an unknown character I have a full mac keyboard with number pad and home end page up page down keys section including the forward delete key I use a key combination in Adobe Premiere for ripple delete which poses problems for KeyCastr Shift Glyph doesnt show at all See my comment on akitchen s issue about shift modifier behaviour for my thoughts on a menu style mode for how to handle shift and key labels and shifted forward delete shows as a boxed question mark Allow including key commands in a Blacklist that will not be shown in KeyCastr Use case screencasting or screen recording where some key combinations are for operating the screencasting software and should not be displayed on screen while recording another operation Specific Example I record my screen using OBS I have a key combination set to switch screens for recording but I do not want that combination displayed on screen while I record whereas I do want most other key presses displayed on screen Whitelist would operate conversely where ONLY key combinations in the whitelist will appear on screen Added a new screenshot and instructions for Mac OS Catalina since preferences changes a bit Holding down a key eg x will make KeyCastr show xxxxxxxxxxxxxx etc but on my screen I will only type a single x There is a configurable setting in System Preferences with which I have disabled key repeat I want to know that if it is OK to add localization support If it is OK I can work on Chinese localizatoin because this software is quite mostly used among Chinese people I just downloaded on a mac mini running when I launch it I get the dialog requesting Accessibility API access I removed readded Keycastr as suggested but the process just repeats Anyone else having this problem Could not create keyDown event tap Please grant KeyCastr access to the Accessibility API If KeyCastr already has access please remove it and add it again While I was investigating a failing brew cask install of keycastr shellsession brew cask install keycastr Updating Homebrew Autoupdated Homebrew Updated tap homebrewcore Updated Formulae lerna Satisfying dependencies Downloading Already downloaded UsersjosungbinLibraryCachesHomebrewdownloads be d ca c c d f afe c f e b e ec KeyCastrappzip Verifying SHA checksum for Cask keycastr Installing Cask keycastr Purging files for version of Cask keycastr Error Failed to quarantine one or more files within usrlocalCaskroomkeycastr Heres the reason xattr No such file usrlocalCaskroomkeycastr KeyCastrappContentsFrameworksSparkleframeworkVersionsAResourcesfrCAlproj xattr No such file usrlocalCaskroomkeycastr KeyCastrappContentsFrameworksSparkleframeworkVersionsAResourcesfrlprojfrlproj So I unzipped the file manually and tried to investigate what is the nonexistent files shellsession ls la KeyCastrappContentsFrameworksSparkleframeworkResources total drwxrxrx josungbin staff B drwxrxrx josungbin staff B rwrr josungbin staff B Infoplist rwrr josungbin staff K Licensetxt rwrr josungbin staff K SUModelTranslationplist drwxrxrx josungbin staff B SUStatusnib drwxrxrx josungbin staff B delproj drwxrxrx josungbin staff B enlproj drwxrxrx josungbin staff B eslproj drwxrxrx josungbin staff B frlproj lrwxrxrx josungbin staff B frCAlproj UsersandymDevelopmentBuild ProductsReleaseSparkleframeworkResourcesfrlproj drwxrxrx josungbin staff B itlproj drwxrxrx josungbin staff B nllproj rwxrxrx josungbin staff K relaunch drwxrxrx josungbin staff B rulproj drwxrxrx josungbin staff B svlproj ls la KeyCastrappContentsFrameworksSparkleframeworkResourcesfrlproj total drwxrxrx josungbin staff B drwxrxrx josungbin staff B drwxrxrx josungbin staff B SUAutomaticUpdateAlertnib drwxrxrx josungbin staff B SUUpdateAlertnib drwxrxrx josungbin staff B SUUpdatePermissionPromptnib rwrr josungbin staff K Sparklestrings lrwxrxrx josungbin staff B frlproj UsersandymDevelopmentBuild ProductsReleaseSparkleframeworkResourcesfrlproj Im not sure why the wrong symlinks are there my crude guess is that youre locale is french and macOS treats the developers locale specially but I think they should be removed from the release zip file
