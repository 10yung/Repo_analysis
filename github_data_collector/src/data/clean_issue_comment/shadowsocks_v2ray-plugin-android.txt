 mux Android Concurrent connections libsslocal exits too fast exit code was closed without any comments so I opened another one If the server side using a selfsigned certificate and the certificate using an invalid host name the client cannot connect to the server as the server side logs remote error tls bad certificate For example I configured a server on and selfsigned a certificate and its host name is examplecom but Im not holding it so accessing the domain directly wont be my server Then on the client side I set the server to and specified Hostname in plugin options as examplecom and paste the base encoded certificate content Then I started the connection but its not working serverside says remote error tls bad certificate The same configuration is working on Windows by importing the cer file to trusted root certificate and working on iOS by ignoring SSL error The upsteam v rayplugin has supported completely disabling mux Will this android plugin merge this feature Android with quic not work at all My server doesnt get any request from my phone Windows use quic fine Android use websocket fine my pluginopts servermodequichostmydomaincomcertpathmycrtkeypathmykey
