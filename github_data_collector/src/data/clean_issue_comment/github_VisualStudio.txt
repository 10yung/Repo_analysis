Additional context Add any other context about the problem here When viewing changes using one of the four views View Changes View File View Changes in Solution or Open File in Solution and choosig a different view nothing happens You have to close that view and then open the other view Currently comments can be added when in the View Changes view or View File However IDE tooling like ReSharper do not work while in these views View Changes in Solution and Open File in solution allow IDE tooling to work but comments can not be added Which means that either you have view the changes in one view close it and switch to another view Then close the view and go back to viewing changes in solution and rinse and repeat The alternative is to view changes in the solution and have github open in a browser window side by side with defeats the purpose of doing code reviews in the IDE
