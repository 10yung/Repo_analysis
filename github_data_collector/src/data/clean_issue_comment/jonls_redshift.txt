 An article just came out suggesting redshift should be blue shifting Describe the bug When switching to a workspace with a Java application open such as one of the JetBrains IDEs in the i window manager redshift is momentarily disabled It starts working again after a few seconds I have no idea if this is redshifts fault or i s but I decided to open an issue here first If it turns out not to be something that can be fixed on redshifts end I will open an issue with i instead x I have checked the FAQ and my issue is not mention there There is a simillar issue mentioned in the FAQ but I thought this was worth raising since it only happens when the programs are used together in a specific window manager To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Start an i session Run redshift Open a java application Switch to a different workspace Return to the workspace with the java application to trigger the bug Expected behavior Redshift should stay active like it does in other window managers or desktop environments Software versions please complete the following information OS Linux Redshift version Distribution Arch Linux Redshift installed from AUR yay S redshift Describe the bug I accidentally closed the Redshift that was running in the tray on Ubuntu I then went to restart it via GUI I got the following error message Unknown location provider geoclue Expected behavior I expect it to start as it always does on startup Software versions please complete the following information OS Ubuntu Redshift version Distribution Ubuntu Redshift installed from probably via aptget Extend redshiftgtks Suspend for menu with a Custom option which pops up a dialogue for the user to enter a number of minutes up to a maximum of ie hours When i start the service with systemctl user start redshift it crashes with the following log x I have checked the FAQ and my issue is not mention there To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Install redshift wlroots and sway version rc gf
