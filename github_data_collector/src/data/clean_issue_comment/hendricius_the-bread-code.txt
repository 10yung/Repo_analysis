Why not make some burgers this weekend I did it yesterday and thought I share with you my recipe for making the buns Its yeast based so no sourdough needed Unfortunately I could not fully focus on the dough I guess they could have turned out even better next iteration then I took the basic recipe from King Arthurs but then adjusted it slightly to my liking I also changed the recipe to include values instead rather than absolute values That way you can scale the amount of buns you want to make burgerbuns It would help to mention that the butter should be softenedroom temperature and creamed together with the sugar before mixing in with the banana to avoid clumps of butter in the batter I followed the basic dough recipe and used white flour from Migros Switzerland Flours have no types here but white flour has proteins which is what I understand type to have The variations I did from the recipe I let the dough sit for about hours instead of and then let it rest h instead of overnight in the fridge I also used a KitchenAid to mix the dough in the second stretch and fold not sure if that was a good idea I didnt have any razor handy so I didnt score the bread before putting it in the oven And the dough was very wet so I didnt flip it because it would stick to my hands too much and I worried fall apart In the end the bread is ok it rose and looks decent but it could have more bubbles I think this is because mixing it with the KA was too much and it collapsed all the gas pockets What bothers me the most though is that it has the texture of glutenfree bread Its rather powdery compared to regular bread Any ideas for improvement thanks so much for your bread instructions Im trying to make the mother dough but Im worried Im doing it wrong Im using whole grain wheat IMG The first day it was fairly dry but I measured g flour g water like the instructions say IMG The next day I transferred it to a larger jar and added g flour g water That night it expanded large and touched the plastic on top I stirred it to let the air out and continued to add g flour g water each day This is what it looks like on day and days and IMG You can see there are almost no bubbles You can also see the high mark from day on the side of the jar My apartment is around c constantly Heres an gif to show the constency of what I have ScreenFlow Any ideas Did I mess up Can it be saved Thanks I got very inspired by your repo and tried it Haven t tasted it yet but I m already proud of it Thanks for sharing all these recipes and techniques BE BC D B CDCE AD D Sorry I have been inactive a little recently Ive been doing a lot of research to optimise the breads that I bake Ive started from scratch rethinking all the steps that I do This pull requests contains the knowledge that I gathered in the last months Ive mostly been focusing on this one recipe baking it approx times Every bake I tried to adjust only one parameter at a time It was really worth it I got a much better understanding of each step Its still work in progress I will add more chapters over time Just wanted to create this issue to share some interesting experiments we can conduct See PR for details where I added the section Some experiments that would be interesting on hydration hydration vs hydration hydration vs hydration hydration vs hydration hydration vs hydration hydration vs hydration Flour types All purpose flour vs cake flour All purpose flour vs strong flour Yeast wheat vs spelt Yeast wheat vs rye Yeast wheat vs yeast einkorn Yeast wheat vs yeast emmer Sourdough wheat vs spelt Sourdough wheat vs rye Sourdough wheat vs einkorn Sourdough wheat vs emmer x Sourdough einkorn vs emmer Sourdough einkorn vs rye Sourdough einkorn vs wheat Sourdough emmer vs rye Sourdough emmer vs wheat Rye sourdough starter vs wheat sourdough starter and rye bread Rye sourdough starter vs wheat sourdough starter and wheat bread Stretch and folds No stretch and folds vs stretch and folds stretch folds vs stretch and folds stretch folds vs stretch and folds Autolyse hour autolyse vs no autolyse at all Yeast Yeast vs sourdough yeast vs yeast vs yeast vs yeast sugar in dough vs no sugar in dough Dry yeast vs active yeast Baking Baking with steam vs without steam Baking half time steam vs full time steam Baking with dutch oven vs baking with steam Baking at max temperature vs slowly getting to core temperature Proofing Proof yeast for hour vs no proofing Proof yeast for hour in the fridge vs at room temperature x Proof sourdough for hours at room temperature vs proofing hours in the fridge Scoring x Scoring a X at an angle vs vertically Scoring a X at an angle vs no scoring Scoring with angled central cut vs scoring a X at an angle Scoring with angled central cut vs scoring with central cut vertically Just some ideas Feel free to suggest more
