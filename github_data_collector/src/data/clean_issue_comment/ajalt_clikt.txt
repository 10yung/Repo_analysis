Consider that I want to wrap some text to a fixed number of characters regardless of any other mechanisms to determine the width Currently I have to implement my own wrapText method and create an own formatter Proposal Would it be possible to have an optional wrapText Int parameter for echo which specifies a different wrapping width Or maybe just make wrapText available outside of the module Fixes New CompletionCandidateCommand allowing to generate candidates from an arbitrary commandshell expression Updated CliktCommandargument to support an optional CompletionCandidate argument Necessary to call any command to generate values for autocomplete My use case was this CLI using clikt having a cli do VALUE command which values can be autocompleted by calling cli list Let me know what you think Sidenote may I suggest this conventiontool to help manage the changelog from the commit messages Awesome project by the way thanks Hello New to Kotlin Im building an installer for an app with your tool I was wondering if it would be possible to retrieve values from a file instead of envvars I saw so I could first load my file content as env variables but I would prefer to have access to the file especially as its a yaml file with nested values in it Any idea on how to implement this use case Global idea is if values are in the file use them and if not prompt for them Thanks Would be great for CLI
