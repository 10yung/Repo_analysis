Fixes I wanted to use intrarustdoclinks everywhere to fix the broken links but it looks like procmacros arent supported So I used relative paths for incrate linking macroembedmigrationshtml and docsrs urls for crosscrate linking refineryRunner docs dont include the Runnerrun and Runnerrunasync functions I noticed that docs metadata was commented out in Cargotoml toml packagemetadatadocsrs features postgres mysql sqlite extras nodefaultfeatures true was this intentional Also the links for embeddedmigrations and includemigrationmods are broken in Django and other more mature ORMs such as TypeORM can automatically generate migrations based on the data structure This increases productivity and frees users from having to keep DB layout and code data structures in sync In Enterprise settings there are tooling that take the declarative database management concepts even further for more robust database management However for simple use cases the Django style automigrations will suffice
