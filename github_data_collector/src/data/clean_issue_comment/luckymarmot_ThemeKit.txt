Hi ThemeKit is wonderful thank you I wonder if you can help I have an app that I wish to apply dark theme on macOS older than Mojave back as far as El Capitan I am having problems with the styling of selected cells in NSOutlineView and NSTableView when the view does not have focus The problem can be demonstrated with the ThemeKit Demo app Here it is on Mojave Screenshot at And here it is on El Capitan n In both cases the text field has focus so that the outline view does not have focus On Mojave the cell text is readable however on El Capitan the cell text is difficult to read due to the grey text A similar situation exists for the Lady in Dark Theme and Purple Green Theme on El Capitan Can you please advise how this might be resolved Thanks Al
