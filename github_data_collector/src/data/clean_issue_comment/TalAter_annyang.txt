Although Firefox should support the Webspeech API now annyang gives errors Firefox does not supports recognitioncontinuous If I have debug disabled there are no errors but also it shows nothing Any fixes As per the definition of the trigger method accepts a single string or an array of string and the first string that gets matched to the defined commands gets invoked What happens if none of the given strings are matched will annyang trigger a resultnomatch on each of the strings or only once at the the end is there a way to stop resultnomatch to be triggered when the annyang trigger method is being called is there a way to have a call back to trigger when all the strings in the array has been attempted to be triggered Repo branch with logs Relevant files clientcomponentsrecipestepjs clientannyangCommandsjs Browser we are using Chrome My team and I have been working on adding annyang with Web Speech API to recognize multiple commands some of which trigger navigation We are using the browser console to test We speak a number of commands and get responses but after a few commands the console stops recognizing the speech event for the command We have logged within the methods and the heard command and we are getting the correct logs we just arent hearing anything We are also logging commands twice The more commands we give we start to eventually log the commands more than twice Is this a garbage collection issue We believe this is a bug with how we are integrating our annyang commands and the logic of how we trigger our command methods Perhaps the same annyang event is persisting Would love some help if possible Screen Shot at Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above Although Firefox should support the Webspeech API now annyang gives errors The problem here seems to be that Firefox does not support recognitioncontinuous found out by using the nonminified script If I comment out the two occurences of it in the script the error goes away Anyang now seems to start but it doesnt recognize anything if I enable debug I get another weird error If I have debug disabled there are no errors but also nothing happens In case you are wondering here is my script javascript if annyang consolelogAnnyang found listening var commands finde tag startSearch annyangdebugtrue annyangaddCommandscommands annyangsetLanguagedeDE annyangstart autoRestart true continuous false consolelogannyang started Expected Behavior Firefox should work too Current Behavior Javascript errors see above If I fix them still nothing happens Steps to Reproduce for bugs Open Firefox in aboutconfig search for speech and enable all relevant settings Go to Try examples Check javascript console Your Environment Current Annyang version latest Firefox on MAC OS and Windows Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above Expected Behavior The annyangtrigger event should pass a command and be able to accept tags etc even especially when annyang is not listening When speech isnt available an input field is normally shown and it would be nice to have a trigger event that would parse it the exact same as a speech command This would provide a great deal of continuity to the end user Current Behavior If describing a bug tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior If suggesting a changeimprovement explain the difference from current behavior

or mobile Link to your project Hi there we can analyse microphones input by web audio api while using browser default recognition Ref well i tried to do the same with annyang but i failed any help or suggestions will be appreciated Hi all I have make a new project with last version cordova actually I have add plugins cordova plugin add cordovaplugincrosswalkwebview cordova plugin add cordovapluginmedia I have add the platform android I have verified permission in AndroidManifestxml usespermission androidnameandroidpermissionACCESSNETWORKSTATE usespermission androidnameandroidpermissionACCESSWIFISTATE usespermission androidnameandroidpermissionWRITEEXTERNALSTORAGE usespermission androidnameandroidpermissionRECORDAUDIO usespermission androidnameandroidpermissionMODIFYAUDIOSETTINGS usespermission androidnameandroidpermissionREADPHONESTATE I have enable debug mode in annyang when I launch my application with usb debugging I see crosswalk is loaded in console navigatoruserAgent Mozilla Linux Android MI BuildOPR AppleWebKit KHTML like Gecko Chrome Crosswalk Mobile Safari But the speechrecognizion dont worknothing append when I talk If I try on my desktop all are ok I have tried to add a plugins speech reconizion for force authorization the in board application recognizion work but not the annyang There is a way to get more debug log Thanks a lot I want to say pause and let annyang stop until I say resume and start listening again is it possible Is there a way for commands trigger upon hearing just a sole word Like if I want a function to trigger whenever the word up is heard whether it be move up turn up up up up etc Other than simply grabbing the potential possibilities and running a forloop to check the entire array for an instance in the string
