I am getting the following when attempting to run etcinitdnodeapp start Starting nodeapp stdin is not a tty nodeapp started with pid but it does not start can start manually no problem It would be nice to have an option to open the log file in append mode rather than open mode for the following reasons for some applications it is desirable to keep the log file when the service is restarted With the open mode the log file is overwritten each time when the service is startedrestarted using the append mode allows for simple logrotation in copytruncate mode While copytruncate does not always fit as you may loose some bytes of logdata during rotate it comes handy if you dont want to restart the service after log rotation The latter seems to be the only choice with nodestartup as it does not support handling for the HUP signal to reopen the log file which would be tricky anyway One more issue the PID recorded for the nodestartup app is pointing to the bash shell used to start the script instead of referencing the node app that is actually running why would this happen And how can I fix it nodestartup is real simple and cool I tried to use it for setting up an app on AWS EC instance Initially I had a few failures from a Needing to add sudo to all the commands including rm pid file mkdir chown etc Why would this be required this was required when I was running this from the bash shell directly to test out the script b Even after setting this script up in etcinitd and setting up the chkconfig add nodestartup I noticed that the app does not start up after a reboot automatically What might be wrong c One of the reason that at reboot the nodestartup does not work is the old pid file is still around Hence the start command fails How can i ensure that the nodestartup app is shutdown or pid file is ignored only at the reboot and initial startup Thanks for your help Again this script is nice and simple restart from Admin Panel is not possible when app is running from nodeapp script metarestart Could not restart are you sure NodeBB was started with nodebb start Hi I was wondering if you could help me out but Im using your script but the generate pid always seems to get number below the real process id of the running node app ie the reported pid is but when I tried to do a ps aux grep node i could see the pid is actually Do you know what might be going wrong I am running on a VPS and have a nd IP address that all the Node stuff runs on on port is it possible to add this option to the script Ie Host xx port I follwed the instruction now I can use service nodeapp to start stop But when I reboot the host nodeapp will not running automatically updatercd nodeapp defaults is ok OS ubuntu precoderootHomeKitPi etcinitdnodeapp start Node app stopped but pid file existscodepre I looked at issue and I am using the latest version which includes the change to line but for some reason it still doesnt work
