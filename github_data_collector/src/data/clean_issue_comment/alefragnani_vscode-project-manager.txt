It would be nice if the Open recent menu in under File would filter projects that are in the project manager My use case is that my most used projects are in the project manager but prototypes and such are in Open Recent and now they get pushed out by projects from the project manager that I never open through Open Recent Update tags fields on Marketplace publishing git workspaces remote When working with remote workspaces Project Managers List Projects to Open command is no longer a good replacement for the builtin Open Recent As far as I know theres no way to let Project Manager know about remote workspaces while they do appear in Open Recent Heres an example with a workspace opened via the Remote SSH extension It is possible to run the Save Project command in that workspace but this doesnt actually work when you try to open it the saved project has the path on the remote machine as a rootPath Im not sure how Project Manager could programatically open a remote workspace Maybe it would have to invoke a command of the specific remote extension that is used SSH WSL Container I wonder how VSCode does this internally in the Open Recent UI closes When you have a remote workspace open you will suddenly notice that the project manager commands are no longer working This is because VSCode defaults to running extensions on the remote as a workspace extension This fixes this by changing the default to ui so Project Manager runs locally Im not sure it makes much sense to run Project Manager remotely but having it in the extensionKind array still allows for this The documentation of this extension keeps mentioning the term project but never clarifies what is meant by that VS Code already has a builtin way of managing what most of us think of as projects but decided to name them workspaces instead This leaves me a bit confused How does a project differ from a workspace What does the notion of projects add that isnt already achieved with workspaces What relationship if any is there between projects and workspaces When using projects do we still need to set up workspaces as well Yesnooptional And if optional what features would we miss It would be nice if these things were clarified in the README to avoid confusion Often a project repository name is not verbose enough and an additional field description may be useful to provide that missing information layer Maybe that information can be displayed in the side bar as a hover string or something similar what do you think Hi there A little context about my scenario Im usually working on VVV vagrant projects involving WordPress theme development That means every time I start a new project VVV creates a new WordPress instance as git repo in the www folder For each instance I start a git project inside its publichtmlwpcontentthemes folder and thats actually what Im working on and what Im interested in tracking Example wwwsite publichtmlwpcontentthemesproject wwwsite publichtmlwpcontentthemesproject and so on I tried to setup projectManagergitbaseFolderswith a wildcard as Usersusernamevagrantlocalwwwpublichtml to filter out site site etc but I found out Project manager its not supporting wildcards yet Of course I can add projects as favourites saving them manually not a big effort but as I discovered there is some interest in this see do you think that can be a feature to look forward in the near future As mentioned thats not something that prevents me to use and love this extension but would be very handy having the option to just load all projects at once as git projects automagically When scanning for projects it would be nice to have the ability to include the parent folder name For example if you have this structure projectsclientAsomeproject projectsclientBsomeproject projectsclientCsomeproject You currently will have no idea which project is listed because they have the same name like so someproject someproject someproject It would be nice to have at least one above folder visible clientAsomeproject clientBsomeproject clientCsomeproject Hi I have been facing this issue since the last months If there is an unsaved file and If I try to switch to another project It shows a popup window asking what should be done for the unsaved file If I select Dont Save everything freezes until unless I kill vs code Ubuntu version Vscode version vscodeprojectmanaget First thanks to all developers countributing to this plugin I like this plugin very much But when I add too many projects in project manager list I find its hard to find out which project this is So I wander could you add this function highlight current project in list Finally thanks for your reading
