Wincompose Win x Right click on any item in Sequences window Copy to clipboard got an fatal error Running as administrator make no difference With the Compose key set to Right Alt and builtin sequences disabled WinCompose seems to ignore both the following from my userdefined sequences Multikey grave Alt e U B SMALL EPSILON Multikey grave Alt e U F GREEK LUNATE EPSILON SYMBOL Looking at the WinCompose parser regex Im not sure that it accepts modifiers at all The exact grammar is described in more detail in this libx commit which unfortunately hasnt made it to very many distros man pages The corresponding parsing code in the ChromeOS ComposeKey extension is here You can see that were also using regexes but tokenbytoken rather than all in one go Using Wincompose on Windows Pro b Came here via ticket since the described behaviour is similar to what Im observing But the ticket is quite old closed and after all slightly different and it seems not to exist a current issue on this so I open a new one My PC is usually continuously in operation Wincompose autostarts with a reboot and runs smoothly But every other days no excact timekeeping Wincompose just ceases to operate and the icon disappears from the system tray It is no problem to restart via start menu grafik which also brings back the icon to the systrem tray grafik Everything then works again but this behaviour ist quite annoying Is this known and under investigation I also noticed that when restarting from start menu as described the UAC dialog doesnt announce Wincompose but the configuration tool for task scheduler grafik Does that give hints Bye Philipp Using almost without major problems but this version introduced a strange error never seen in previous ones When I use WinCompose after a long hiatus like the first time in the morning seems it messed up the received characters Example I push compose o and instead of outputting as it should it outputs o From next time on it behaves normally Wish you happy festive days mario Hi the Restart button in options panel is tranlated by R initialiser which is a bad translation R initialiser means set to default You can use Red marrer instead Thanks Hi I just tried the option Insert zero width spaces in Office applications After that in Outllok when I use Wincompose to write an the system seems to react as if the right CTRL key my compose key was permanently pressed which produces all the possible actions when using the CTRL key pressed zoom with mouse wheel text or file cuted instead of displaying an x Checked yes the remanente keys sticky keys are deactivated if I uncheck this option Wincompose behaves correctly even in Outlook Thanks Windows v Wincompose v Im using WinCompose in Windows and since when I updated to this version sometimes it doesnt accept some combination examples of not accepted combinations are Multikey Multikey equal Right Right Multikey equal Right Up Multikey question question backtick last one should give a backtick instead of those I get moves right moves up and right Im not sure how to replicate this its not from system start or at least not always it seems it happens after a while the PC is on if I restart WinCompose it works fine again Edit It just happened again nothing changed since I restarted it it seems after a while it has issue and restarting it solves them for a bit I literally used WinCompose to do a backtick wrote four character tried again to do a backtick and I got instead I wanted to use the print key as the compose key since I rarely use it otherwise except using CTRLPrint If I configure Print to be the compose key I cant use CTRLPrint anymore Normally CTRLPrint copies the whole screen to clipboard At the moment the main groupings like Favorites and Emojis in the Sequence window is translated but not the sub groupings that corresponds to the blocks in Unicode like Arrows and Basic Latin I have by copying everything to the user defined sequences and turned off the other ones been able to translate the individual symbol descriptions in my own system So this is the only thing left for Wincompose to be fully translated for me anyway To input the symbol U you can type metain But the solutions for the negative symbol U does not work metain leads to n since metai is already matched with the letter with dot the other two solutions require a key which I dont have
