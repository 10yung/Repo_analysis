I find that when working with multiple repositories or especially with git submodules it can be useful to see in the prompt which one Im currently in This will often be the current working directory but not always Installation did not work for Ubuntu with default instructions Adding required commands to the bottom of bashrc fixed it Implementation of paulejs suggestion in issue When use PS export PS debianchroot debianchroot m u h m m w m txtcyn gitbranch txtred gitdirty txtrst below bashrc Teminer lose path folder lose notlose Through the variable DISABLEGITAWARE allow disabling the software This is needed for example when using a huge git repository if we dont want the script to slow the command line work Hi There While it iswas working with other Debian it did not work with Ubuntu Is there anything that I should take care of Sometimes branch names get very long Adds a hostname username and for python developers vritualenv names and you can easly get a multiline shell prompt This helps keep branch name within a size predefined I wanted to add ability to get the tag at HEAD not the closest tag Nothing big The function findgitdirty delayed prompt display by over a second when in a large repo so I now use the plumbing commands instead of git status Because we dont actually need to generate a list of all the changed files just to see if the repo is dirty Further improvements possible Also theres some more verbosity to keep the command output reliable Errcode applies eg when in any git folder Finally I surrounded this by the test for branch name as in findgitbranch to avoid output on nongit folders Other implementation imaginable
