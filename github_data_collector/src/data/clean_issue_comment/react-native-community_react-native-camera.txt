ANDROID IOS Describe the Feature Get RAW image from camera in JS thread This function can be useful for training neural networks All cameras in mobile devices use software algorithms for image processing This has a negative effect on the final image Some details that are important for training may be lost The RAW image acquisition function could solve this problem without developing a native module hi In my android studio build gradle is failed i dont know how so then i check the log and i saw this error ErrorCould not find method compile for arguments comandroidsupportrecyclerviewv on object of type orggradleapiinternalartifactsdsldependenciesDefaultDependencyHandler Please install the Android Support Repository from the Android SDK Manager Open Android SDK Manager then i check it but android support respository is already installed version i restart android studio but it shows same error how i solve this error from android studio please help me to solve this problem Bug Report Did you try latest release Yes Did you try master No Did you look for existing matching issues Yes Platforms Tested on Android Only Android Samsung S One UI reactnativecamera reactnative react reactnavigation DescriptionCurrent Behaviour On rotating a phone with One UI without autorotate enabled the user can press a button to change the phones orientation otherwise nothing happens When rotating the phone and NOT pressing the button the bounds for barcodes and text scanned by RNCamera havent tested facial features are rotated anyway causing them to be in incorrect positions on the screen Expected Behaviour When the camera is rotated but orientation has not changed feature positions do not get rotated Steps to Reproduce Enable google barcode detection and record the position Check how the position changes normally pitching up and down changes y dimension etc Rotate the device WITHOUT changing orientation then check position again this time pitching up and down changes the x dimension Additionals My explanation may be a bit confusing sorry I have attached a video that shows more clearly what is happening In the video I first move the camera whilst the device is vertical Then I rotate the device without changing orientation and move the camera Then I change the orientation The yellow dot is calculated to be at the centre of the bounds given by onGoogleVisionBarcodesDetected Link to video Ive tested this with onGoogleVisionBarcodesDetected and onTextRecognized React Native for Windows vNext support Describe the Feature describe the requested Feature React Native for Windows enables React Native apps to target Windows via UWP React Native for Windows is under active development by Microsoft Most recently the platform has been updated to leverage highperformance C known as RNW vNext Now that the RNW vNext supports native modules as a platform we have identified several key native modules to add Windows support for including reactnativecamera to help validate that the platform has the right set of capabilities and to bootstrap the community of modules that target Windows Possible Implementations describe how to implement the feature Microsoft devs are signed up to help build out this implementation but we wanted to track this work here as well to help provide some transparency that were doing this work and hoping to contribute back to the repo Related Issues link related issues here Love reactnativecamera Please consider supporting our collective Want this feature to be resolved faster Please consider

the PinchGestureHandler function included in ZoomViewjs react native camera Can the examples included in reactnativecamera be executed as an expo client I wonder how to implement it Should I run as an
