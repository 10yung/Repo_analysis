aptget install nvtop The following NEW packages will be installed libnvidiacompute libnvidiacompute The following packages will be REMOVED libnvidiacompute Can nvtop be updated to use the current driver Thanks Dear Maxime Please consider this PR as a small improvement over this great tool It fixes consistency throughout all units displayed theyre all now multiples of bytes Also availabletotal RAM is displayed with decimal digits Thank you Ubuntu After I upgraded the Nvidia driver to I can no longer use nvtop and cant install it Is there any solution other than downgrading the driver bash base admin admin ubuntu sudo apt install nvtop sudo password for admin Reading package lists Done Building dependency tree Reading state information Done Some packages could not be installed This may mean that you have requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or been moved out of Incoming The following information may help to resolve the situation The following packages have unmet dependencies nvtop Depends libnvidiacompute but it is not going to be installed E Unable to correct problems you have held broken packages Ive found option to select or ignore some GPUs but the barplot still draws two main GPUs charts on one plot Ive GPUs device to connect to monitor and draw Xserver and two more ti devices and for DS calculation With default htop run we have two plots one for both ti on one chart and one for not needed When i run htop i it selects right GPUs but still draws only one plot with both ti on it Is it possible to have two separate graphs for GPU and GPU Thanks Following the instructions to build for Ubuntu with NVIDIASMI Driver Version while running make the build fails with

imagining a flag nvtop daemon metrics metricsport or something that would be useful to get the information into Grafana Thanks Would it still be possible to have the consumed watts drawn in the
