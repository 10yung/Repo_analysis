feature request related to a problem Please describe macOS is parsing every App on local file systems and by default autoenables every apps document provider capabilities and adding all actions to the respective share sheets throughout the interface Anyone with an aboveaverage collection of software tools know how fast the open with system dialog list grows sometimes returning every app able to provide service for that particular file type Rightclicked a txt on Catalina lately In parallel the share sheet dialog also quicky ridiculoulizes itself here coincidentally illustrated via two screen shots superimposed on top of a funny I made with my cat flying through the universe AppDelete by Reggie Ashworth RIP development taken over by a friend of the family has a feature called Archive Describe the solution youd like Id like for mas in addition to install uninstall also gain archive and restore from archive features When you archive an app with AppDelete it copies the entire App bundle to a ZIP or tarball along with all the preferences and supporting data then deletes said files effectively disabling the apps document provider capabilities and also the share sheet actions In addition to enhancing your the macintosh operators mental well being you also get a simple way to have a rudimentary backup of the particular version of the app as well as a configuration set known to work on that version As you are aware Apple restricts access to old versions of apps and previously having a previous version including its config has saved my bacon couple of times Easier way faster and less errorprone than restoring from backup Describe alternatives youve considered A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered Using git LFS and a dotfiles bare repository setup eg on github is a more complete solution to the above problem I will argue however that this is complex for many to set up and keep maintained In addition having both mechanisms in place has no negative effects and can be a clever move for fun and profit anyway Additional context Thoughts from the top of my mind mas archive move app and all its files to a zip in Apps or Apps mas archive tar same with tarball mas backup tar create ziptar but keep application untouched Thank you for your time and your awesome success with mas cli Keep up the great work Best
