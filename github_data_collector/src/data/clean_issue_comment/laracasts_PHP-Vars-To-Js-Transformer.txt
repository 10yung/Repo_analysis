 Fix for php support in build test This solves issue Queued tasks add the JS code multiple times The fix keeps track of each js that is to be added with an array with hashes in the view data If there already is a hash for the js code skip it It seems todo the trick Its not really a solution to the problem that the queue is adding multiple unnecessary listeners but it is a failsafe This way the config file still gets published if php artisan vendorpublish tagconfig command is used In certain cases a user of this package might need to add one or more HTML attributes to the script tag outputted in the compiled view file For example if CSP headers are set up for the site you need to add nonces to inline script tags so that the browser allows them to execute This is achieved by adding a new function to the ViewBinder and Transformer classes setHtmlAttributesarray attributes If this method is called the ViewBinderbind method will include the attributes that were given to the setHtmlAttributes function For example php JavaScriptsetHtmlAttributes foo bar JavaScriptput fizz buzz Will result in the following output in the HTML file html script foobar JSfizz buzz script Does it support json format like windowApp csrfTokenTpqYeKgl ejmbPaSNPBjmpf lwYjW TaP rfpreeuseruserid userfirstnameEsperanzauserlastnameSashauseremailjewellmckenzieexamplenetusercreatedat userupdatedat signedIntrue PHPStorm complains about passes arguments to a function with no parameters This is because the put method uses funcgetargs to dynamically retrieve args from the caller img width altscreen shot at am src I followed the suggestion on this Stack Overflow answer and it fixes the issue I am also using Laravel IDE helper For Laravel This change adds publishable blade template for when there is a need to change script tag Ex to add CSP nonce Can i set dynamic value of bindjsvarstothisview In addition to controllermethod specific variables is there an easy way to also specify some variables to use on all pages This would be used for example to pass options from config files to JS frontend apps
