 Example traits from our triton datacenter deployment CN Traits hvm bhyve CN Traits hvm kvm ssd true VM IMAGE PACKAGE The base Image should be allowed to provision on any hardware assuming that package traits are also properly aligned Hence the reason for the JSON array below Base Image Traits hvm kvmbhyve The package traits mandate that this base image should be provisioned on a CN with the SSD trait set Package Traits ssd true Actual Behavior Attempting to provision a base VM with the aforementioned IMAGE and PACKAGE traits assigned causes provisioning to fail The provisioning system chooses CN immediately and since the ssd trait is not set simply produces failed to provision no compute resources available Workaround Within ops portal or CNAPI Update CN and set ssd false the provisioning system will now skip CN and provision onto CN successfully Expected behavior A compute node that has a nil trait should automatically be skipped during provisioning preventing every compute node in the datacenter that does not match a specific trait from requiring a manual update to its traits property joyenttriton External network shouldnt have QEMU DHCP service This PR was

docsdeveloperguidecoalsetupmd johnlevon alphanumeric docsdeveloperguidecoalsetupmd johnlevon Substitute According to IRC my headnode install failures was from using a domain thats publicly resolvable This is apparently a sin so I suggest a line like this be merged into the CoaL docs so future uninformed people like me can hopefully not have failures before success I have a VM machine with core GB RAM installing RHEL Installed VM Workstation as you mentioned Then i tried running the below which is not required my understanding curl s sudo bash It did not went fine gave errors tar zxvf coallatesttgz C DocumentsVirtual Machineslocalized also did not went fine could you please help here We want to use Joyent as a dedicated product image meaning photography server for our ecommerce websites and There are some product photographs on these web properties We are currently serving the site from AWS with an integrated or partially dedicated server for these product images My understanding is that using Joyent they could be delivered faster and cheaper Am I correct We are currently using AWS to serve the images AND the site on separate instances but I am not sure that this is what you would call a dedicated image server Then these are on CloudFront as CDN What I want to do is have a Dedicated product image server on Joyent and use CloudFlare as CDNproxy The question is this what are the best choices in provisioning for this particular usecase I could not find this published on your site Sorry if I missed it somewhere Anoop from Corra is working with me on this and in fact there may be another ticket he opened to discuss Again what stack is best for a dedicated server to deliver product photography with CloudFlare CDN Dylan I followed the instructions in the README to get CoaL running on VMware I installed VMware Fusion on a new machine macOS that has never hosted any VMs in the past When running the coalmacvmwaresetup tool I saw the following richard

such file or directory Checking out the script it seems that we use cd to LibraryPreferencesVMware Fusion and look for networking in that directory but it didnt exist for me richard Downloads ls alh

created an empty Solaris VM and after clicking through the wizard ending up at the console for that VM I could see that I now had a networking file richard Downloads ls alh LibraryPreferencesVMware

Sep thnuclnt I deleted the test VM and ran coalmacvmwaresetup which then worked When installing VMware Fustion for the first time I opted not to create a VM so perhaps this networking file is only created if weve created a VM in the past Ive just been deploying manta to my coal and found out that the slow IO within the VM affects the imagadm action simply causing it to take more than an hour which is made the default timeout of SAPI and causes failure of the mantadeploycoal Would you consider adding some tunable for COAL Or is there a plan to fix this in manta
