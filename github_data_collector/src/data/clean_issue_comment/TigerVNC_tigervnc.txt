Underscore key does not work properly in macOS Japanese keyboard This patch fixes the problem I am testing TigerVNC latest bit version between two Windows Enterprise bit installations in a domain The product installs successfully on both machines but I cannot successfully remote from either one to the other I found that the installer does NOT create any Windows Firewall rules I manually added an inbound rule for the server executable for all profiles IPs protocols ports By the way why does it not create a Windows Firewall rule automatically The viewer requests the password which it accepts but then displays nothing and closes No blank screen or anything else I have the options set at their defaults and have defined a password I have tried between other PCs but get the exact same result Interestingly I have the same issue with UltraVNC However TightVNC works perfectly with a default install and it automatically creates the correct Windows Firewall rule Any ideas as to why TigerVNC is not working Id really like to be using this version Lastly surely good Windows documentation would not be difficult to create for TigerVNC Why isnt there any bountysourceplugin Want to back this issue

time in seconds passed That can solve problem described in issue and can be useful in other cases when using tigervnc viewer on windows i can connect to x vnc on my freebsd machine fine UNTIL i start using a window manager and such for example fluxbox and xfe when i add those i suddenly cannot connect via VNC citing a image library mismatch seriously this vnc has so many problems

Telneting to the port works If I use the server running as a service client still x it works But if I use launch Winvnc server as Administrator with Log file I cant connect either and the logs show basically the same error My Windows firewall is on I only use the loopback interface and rely on an SSH tunnel To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Install x register service enable service ssh into Windows server with port forwarding open VNCviewer x and connect to forwarded port When I tried it with x I just reinstalled over x Expected behavior Console windows should be displayed

ADDRES sleep done Connect to windows machine with vncserver Reboot windows machine VncViewer will restart and reconnect you will see windows shutting down screen After that vnc will wait forever for mouse or keyboard event and dont disconnect from server that closed connection gdb backtrace gdb bt x f eabd cbd in select from usrlib libcso x f eaea a in flwaitdouble from usrlib libfltkso x f eaea f in Flwaitdouble from usrlib libfltkso x f in runmainloop x fc in main I think main problem is that network events processed only after keyboard or mouse events acquired Because without ViewOnly flag
