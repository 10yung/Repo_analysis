import css directly from reactwithstyles is deprecated If themes is registered using React Context API calling css function will crash because theme is undefined This fix passes the firstDayOfWeek propdown to the getVisibleDays function and uses it Fixes I found this issue when trying to customize the day picker for our own project It can be reproduced by adding a story like this to Storybook addblocks weekend days withInfo SingleDatePickerWrapper isDayBlockedday momentweekdaysdayweekday Sunday momentweekdaysdayweekday Saturday autoFocus enableOutsideDays firstDayOfWeek numberOfMonths The numberOfMonths prop is not required to reproduce the issue Here is the result This is the same in all months Notice that all Saturdays and Sundays are blocked as expected including the first one of the outside range except for the last one displayed If I look at the html I see that the last day doesnt get the CalendarDayblockedcalendar class and also the arialabel doesnt say Not available If I click that last day it doesnt get selected so to the click event handler it is blocked The issue also exists if I make the isDayBlocked function always return true The issue does not occur when I leave out firstDayOfWeek Im in a situation where Ive got a start date and an end date but they are not consecutive fields because of a start time field between them StartDateField StartTimeField EndDateField EndTimeField Is there an existing way to get the benefits of the DateRangePicker on the SingleDatePicker Id like to show the range highlight on one calendar when the other date has been selected ariaInvalid allows for more accessible form validation ariaDescribedby allows users to use custom elements for the field description instead of the built in screenReaderMessage behavior I suppose following issue because of firing onClearFocus with start and end dates from props thats not right it should use values inside onEndDateChange function If dates are not choosed from calendar but entered manually in inputs onClose handler returns null or previous date in endDate It is visible in storybook reactdates version eg reactdates Describe the bug Hi when I change the width of the browser window Chrome the calendar goes outside of the view only horizontal to the left It calculates and add inline CSS something like top px left px for browser width px This happens and if I change the height of the browser window It goes always to the left and it doesnt matter if I make the window bigger or not it just goes to the left Source code including props configuration Steps to reproduce the behavior DateRangePicker startDatethisstatestartDate startDateIdyouruniquestartdateid endDatethisstateendDate endDateIdyouruniqueenddateid onDatesChange startDate endDate thissetState startDate endDate focusedInputthisstatefocusedInput onFocusChangefocusedInput thissetState focusedInput If you have custom methods that you are passing into a reactdates component eg onDatesChange onFocusChange renderMonth isDayBlocked etc please include the source for those as well ScreenshotsGifs You can see only the arrow here all the calendar is outside to the left Desktop please complete the following information OS Windows Browser Chrome Smartphone please complete the following information Device eg iPhone OS eg iOS Browser eg stock browser safari Version eg Is the issue reproducible in Storybook No Additional context I am using latest Bootstrap grid system This is the HTML bodydiv idrentDatesdiv No additional styles Fixes Disclaimer this fix is probably very naive and I make it for the sole purpose of bringing attention of contributors and maintainers on this bug that has been around for way too long now Given that neither of the very long comment the git commit history the tests my very dysfunctional brain are of any help at understanding why relatedTarget was looked for in the first place and given that it introduces a bug in the appendToBodytrue case this is the most logical PR I could come up with Really sorry for the offtopic issue but Ive run out of official channels trying to point a couple of obvious bugs in the Airbnb web app Search in reviews doesnt find certain existing words Review text swallows whitespace Suggested places in and around are nowhere near Can someone ping the relevant devs internally please
