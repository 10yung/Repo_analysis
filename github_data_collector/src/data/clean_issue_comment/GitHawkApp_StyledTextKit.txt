 Hi rnystrom Could you please help to release a new version for Swift It seems already done on master branch TextStyle doesnt respect its own min and max size noticed its not actually applied anywhere These seemed to be missing Im trying to create a string that has a mix of two font sizes but I cant seem to make it work Is this supported by StyledTextKit if not would this be addressed by issue Heres a sample of what I tried Adding calls to save restore dont affect the behavior nor does changing the contentSizeCategory let attrStr StyledTextBuildertext addtext Foo attributes font UIFontsystemFontofSize addtext Bar attributes font UIFontsystemFontofSize build rendercontentSizeCategory unspecified Love this blog post Removing all colorfont from building would be amazing Instead Use style builder pattern that registers styles Need to still be able to push and pop styles Should all props be in one style font foregroundColor etc or should there be a style per prop Latter seems harder to maintain Remove UIContentSizeCategory from all params until render Necessary to make progress towards GitHawkAppGitHawk so you can have themesstyles and rerender missing all caches wout having to rebuild everything which youd have to do today This blog post was great We could get rid of all the hacky fontscaling math Hi Thank you for this amazing library I have a question about links and attributes StyledTextKit provides three attributes tapable tapHighlight highlight Are there usecases for using these attributes separately These just increase complexity in my opinion As alternative for UITextView Is it not enough to have only NSLinkAttribute Once you create the StyledTextRenderer you would need to create an entirely new object to change one small attribute like font size This is an expensive process ht SD for the idea Inspired by TTTAttributedLabel Just curious as if there is a performance tradeoff for creating an attributed string and then using the convenience initializer of the StyledTextBuilder that takes in an attributed string vs just using the StyledTextedBuilder API to build up a string Does this affect the background rendering as well
