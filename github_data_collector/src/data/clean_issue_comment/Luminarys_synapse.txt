Ive been reading over the RPC code in synapse and I wonder if it would make sense to use a websocket crate like tungstenite to handle the the sockets and connections and the readwrite implementations I look forward to hearing opinions on this It seems synapserpc is on cratesio but only defines the structs Theres a nice client inside sycli that is used to talk to the daemon but when starting a project that automates synapse this code needs to be copypasted into the new project Any chance this could be wrapped into a library on cratesio that can be imported into projects Ive been unable to connect to a synapse instance with sycli over wss whereas ws works fine Luminarys can you reproduce this If it means anything receptor works fine Though if the synapse instance is listening on ws then the cors policy in firefox prevents receptor from working So I have the issue of not being able to use both This is with current master Tribler protocol support for anonymised traffic would be a nice feature Hello Im really liking this but there is lack of a single feature that is preventing me from using it for all my torrenting I figured out how to set separate watch directories by simply running multiple instances and combining that with fswatch and in general I really like how this is done as a very nice selfcontained module Please keep up the good work The feature I would like to recommend is the ability to move torrents to a configured directory upon completion I apologize if this is already in there but I couldnt find it in the configuration example or the source code Thank

handy for keeping torrent sizes down Theres a limited number of unit tests currently implemented for synapse however these arent nearly sufficient to catch significant regressions in behavior or simulate certain types of unusual situations To deal with this Id like to implement a general end to end testing suite for bittorrent clients to validate their conformance to the various BEPs and track down any bugs they might have Something Ive noticed quite a few bittorrent clients lack is the ability to effectively cross seed Its worth supporting this due to lots of duplication across private trackers The general approach for allowing this should be deduplicating torrents by both infohash AND announcemaybe url list too
