Hello I was wondering if it would be useful to open an issue that would not be a real issue but a way to collect info about the projects using RuntimeCompiled CPlusCPlus such a ImGui does in its Gallery issue Feel free to close this issue if you think this is not appropriate Thanks for this excellent tool For Debian amd In RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlusAuroraCMakeListstxt at line you missed the link with Xrandr The correct line should be setGLFWLIBRARIES glfw X Xrandr pthread else this will produce undefined symbols like XRRGetScreenInfo See For VS we always handle exceptions ourselves as VS changed to always catching these before the app However C exceptions are handled first by the app so they dont get a chance for the debugger to catch them Reported potential problem with Atom and OSX not triggering recompiles on file changes The splash screens in SimpleTest are not appearing in the XCode build but are in the cmake one on OSX Workaround Use cmake to generate project files Add MinGW support See Move Systems Renderer and Common into SimpleTest project
