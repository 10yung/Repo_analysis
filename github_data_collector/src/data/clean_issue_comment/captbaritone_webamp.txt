Just putting this here to save some work that I keep losing track of locally Due to bad rebase it includes some commits that should be stuck on other stuff We gotta in unhook the nodes This is just a way to get a Netlify build that still has the media library Just happened to notice this tweet with a neat skin Clicked through to try it out and got a failed to parse skin error Ive attached the skin file e de eef ea fefad eebwszzip Test whether a GuiObject can have images with different sizes and how thats handled For example what happens if a button has an image of one size for its default state and an image with a different size for its pressed state How is this reflected in the UI and in calls to getWidthgetHeight Full description is in GuiObjectgetwidthgetheight need to fallback to using the image widthheight if a wh isnt specified on the Object like we do when rendering In definition files but missing in objectsts AlbumArtLayer ColorMgr Application Core Frame File Found by running yarn analyzewals and looking at the errors This skin causes Webamp to run out of memory when we try to extract the maki scripts Ive blacklisted it for now but we should figure out whats going on So feel free to reject this and we can just keep things simple its not a large performance increase I do believe there is a slight performance increase It is hard to measure because I think its about but there is more variation in the runtime of the updates than that Id like to think it shouldnt be slower than comparing the node objects but could be wrong X Maybe there is a better way to measure specifically the memoization equality check Also think its kind of cool to have available the of updates a component has had but dont actually have any plans of what we would do with that haha
