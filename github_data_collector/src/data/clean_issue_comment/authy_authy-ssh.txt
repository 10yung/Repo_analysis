When my Twilio account trial period ended all SSH logins started failing with this misleading error Invalid token try again Its not helped by the lack of information on the Authy Dashboard regarding the linked Twilio account There are several security issues with this implementation of token checking or Are there any plans to implement a pam module like google authenticator I believe it is a more standard and less error prone way of implementing the authentication checking Since installing authyssh Ive noticed that the normal Ubuntu banner which displays how many updates might be pending and whether a reboot is necessary no longer shows on logon Why would authyssh prevent from this displaying and is there a way to unwind this or display both authysshs banner and the original Ubuntu one Whenever I try and add new public keys using sshcopyidfor new remote clients to a server that uses authyssh it will give me three immediately failed attempts to enter the authy generated token into the terminal without giving me the possibility to check authy for a code and entering it Is there a better way to send keys to an authyhardened ssh server do I need to disable authy temporarily or are there some other options I should be using Im not aware of I was using authyssh on a gateway server in AWS to talk to other machines that werent accessible from the public internet before I found out about Allowing port forwarding without the second factor in my use case was the same as having no fac auth at all Thats a pretty big deal and if it cant be fixed Im surprised its not documented in the README might also be a big deal for a lot of use cases I am using Bitvise to access my ssh But when I open sftp it cant open Any suggest registeruseronauthy currently failed if email contains eg kazukisudaauthygmailcom Very interesting project Have a security question have you had the Shellslocker in mind or maybe this bug is already solved dont know Even with a patch there are still a lot of servers out there without the patch and still with this vulnerability Maybe a quick solution would be to patch the bug with the installation script Still wonderful project Hello I really like this script but would like to get a log of the login attempts so that I can forward this to fail ban Would that be possible Will OneTouch be supported in authyssh
