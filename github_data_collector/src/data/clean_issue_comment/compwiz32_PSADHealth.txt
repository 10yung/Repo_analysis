le would render a failure mail even if the numbers match Probably ne would be even better Thanks for your Quick Fix but it was not enough The Problem is that we have DCs The Hostname of one DC is set with a capital character Lowerdomainlocal For this DC the System generates two Records in ldaptcpdc Lowerdomainlocal lowerdomainlocal That results in Records in DNS for DCs in the Domain Hello One of our DCs Hostname is set with a capital Character ex Berlin In the msdcs Zone the system generates two Records one with all lowercase an one with the uppercase Name So your Test with No of DCs eq No of SRV Records fails Solution could be to normalize the Hostname to lowercase and count distinct records or change to No of DC le No Srv Records Thanks for your tools block anyone from committing straight to master add a required task to increase the increment the module version before a merge to master is allowed the push to the PowerShell gallery will fail without the increase in module version number the task registration script in nonmodule scripts is excellent but not easy to find on its own add relevant documentation to WIKI and README so that users can find that info easier Also it allows for deeper discussion of topics and concepts than what is feasible in the notes section of a script Remove commented out commands from script theyre old and arent relevant anymore add RegisterScheduledJob syntax for remaining functions not already covered in script i would like to add a way to identify which server sent an alert the reason for this is that some environments may have multiple methods tool servers that could generate alerts Over time and with staffing changes the possibility exists that a team may not know where the alerts are being sent from A simple one liner text addition to email body would suffice See example below This alert was sent from SERVERNAME at TIME taking that one step further maybe we could also identity the account used to send the alert This alert was sent from SERVERNAME at TIME by SVCACCTNAME By making the output more generic it will support multiple output plugins without needing to reformat multiple times in the function code
