Currently the lintr configuration file is read with readdcf after which an evalparsetext command is applied on each field of the result This use of evalparsetext seems to me not safe enough in case I use a lintr provided by someone else Could this be avoided Disclaimer I have posted this question first on SO but I guess it is a bug and hence it should be better posted here Problem Consider the following code snippet comments at the end indicate line numbers and are not part of the problem r setseed mydat dataframex runif w runif mydat yorig mydat x mydat w mydat yobs mydat yorig rnorm mystat functiondata origmod newmod updateorigmod data data r residualsnewmod f fittednewmod l lowessf r res clx ly res When I lint this file via lintraddinlint I get the following strange error List of testRList of filename chr testR linenumber int columnnumber int type chr warning message chr no visible binding for global variable x line chr res clx ly ranges List of int linter chr

List of int linter chr objectusagelinter attr class chr lint attr class chr lints However if I remove lines and I do not have the error any more r setseed mydat dataframex runif w runif mystat functiondata origmod newmod updateorigmod data data r residualsnewmod f fittednewmod l lowessf r res clx ly res There is no error when linting this file The wrong line number maybe solved in but I am still at loss why the error appears in the first place and why it goes away if the lines are removed Session Info R version Platform x w mingw x bit Running under Windows x build Matrix products

lintr bot gave me some useful linting comments in a PR then I pushed a change fixing the issues and lintr bot commented again but with the original now incorrect comments again This is obviously only a minor thing since the local lintr run tells me its all good Just thought Id flag it in case there is an easy fix parenbracelinter flags the within regex definition below Checks if a file has a tar

packagedir When calling lintpackagepath any excludedfiles specified in a lintr file were originally handled relative to the working directory This meant lintpackagemyPackage called from the parent of myPackage lintpackage called from inside myPackage gave different results for excluded files the former including files that were supposed to be excluded Ensure readsettings handles exclusions when passed a directory readsettings was modified when it is passed a directory any excluded files that are specified in a user config are now specified relative to the directory eg the package root rather relative to the current working directory Added dirprefix argument to normalizeexclusions normalizeexclusions is used to specify filepaths of the excluded files When running lintdir or lintpackage the directory packageroot is now passed to normalizeexclusions excluded files are pinned relative to this Added a test to ensure lintpackagepath handles excluded files A couple of tests were added These set up a temporary package with lintcontaining source files run lintpackage from outside and inside the temp package exclusions Exclusions of the form listfilename linestoomit and listfilename are both included in the test Hi I recently started using lintr and its pretty great Thank you to everyone involved I bumped into an issue related with the exclusions extracted from lintr files It seems that the lint report depends on the current working directory of the R console Running the following script while the working directory was in the root of the project lintr R lintpackage does not show instexamplebadR in the report since its path is in lintr Then if I run R setwd lintpackagelintr the file instexamplebadR shows in the report There is a similar issue with lint I added a file lintrinstexamplelintr with the content exclusions listbadR Then I ran the commands R setwdlintrinstexample lintbadR and badR did not show up in the report as expected However that was not the case when I ran R setwd lintexamplebadR Furthermore when run directly from the console it seems that lintdir always ignores the exclusions in lintr Can you clarify if any of these contrasting behaviors are expected or what the expected behaviors should be Thank you Jo o I noticed that in RStudio a syntax error in a function name say priint instead of print will raise a No symbol named priint in scope warning I would have to have the same warning pop un in emacs where I am using ess flymake but I cannot figure out which linter provides it With the default linters in ess flymake a syntax error like this does not get flagged Thanks for the help Linting the following code square functionx return x x results in RtestR style Remove spaces before the left parenthesis in a function call return x x However return is not a function call To be consistent with for and if a space should be allowed maybe enforced before the parenthesis This should be fixed in functionleftparentheses Also for consistency with for and if there should be a style warning if there is no space between return and a left parenthesis maybe in spacesleftparentheseslinter R tidyverse style guide recommends x This implicitly recommends a space after the operator because without this space the expression is ambiguous and very prone to bugs eg does x mean x assignment or x inequality test Recommends a new linter to check for the existence of space character after an operator Thanks for developing this linter Jim One of the first things I wanted to do was figure out how to run it from the command line Im used to running others linters like pylint and shellcheck from the command line I want to echo the suggestion of greggles in to document how to do this As a novice R programmer I knew about Rscript but did not know how to run lintr from the command line until I found that issue I ended up adding this to my bashaliases alias lintrRscript e lintrlintcommandArgstrailingOnly TRUE
