Connection reset by peer Apologies for this question which is unrelated to PonyDebugger itself I am now stuck at downloading curl s Is there any other source I could obtain this script from I reside in China behind the nation wide firewall but I am accessing this via a VPN I can visit google facebook without problems but not cloudgithubcom which have absolutely no clue I am no network guru but I tried nslookup and obtained gitmaster nslookup googlecom Server Address Nonauthoritative answer Name googlecom Address cloudgithubcom Server Address Nonauthoritative answer cloudgithubcom canonical name d z fz y fagcloudfrontnet This is as far as I could get cloudgithubcom seems available in from dns but I still do get it why I could access cloudgithubcom It would be useful to be able to add a sqlite file rather than just a core data file I have error on devtoolsdevtoolshtml Hi there I tried to install ponyd on my mac but the script seems to fail while installing setuptools I tried to install setuptools manually via pip or easyinstall both worked but didnt fix the issue Im using homebrews python on macOS Thanks in advance marcelsmbpDownloads marcel curl s python
