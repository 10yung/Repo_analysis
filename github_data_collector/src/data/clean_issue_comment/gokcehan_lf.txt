version r Hi I opened lf in an external drive with lastdirpath option copied and deleted some files for a couple of G total then exited Several minutes later I was unable to unmount the device because of some lf process taking hold of it sudo umount mnt umount mnt target is busy fuser vm mnt USER PID ACCESS COMMAND mnt root kernel mount mnt polve c lf At the moment to override the default icons the environment variable LFICONS has to be specified in the shell I think it would be more natural to do this in the lfrc file When deleting a file and getting prompted to make sure delete homemefile yN Enter should confirm deletion just like y I have delete mapped to x and its far easier to press enter than y and other programs like pacman allow this and condition my hands to confirm with enter Enabling incsearch feature performs a search in a forward direction only whether you use ctrl or ctrl In Zathura and other places you can follow links by pressing f then a pattern of numbersletters as hints zathura follow links feature I think having set numberrelativenumber all the time is kinda ugly and IMO should only be enabled on the current directory but another way is to follow open not highlight directoriesfiles on demand vimiumc for example generates unique characters which are themselves configurable so you dont need to press enter for your selection to take effect And also visually helpful as hints get narrower in zsh you can set WORDCHARS for instance to fish zshrc WORDCHARSWORDCHARS and that would allow you among some other things to remove gradually eg cd mediabooksuiux to cd mediabooks as opposed to cd mediabooksuiux to cd How can we set this to lfs cmd or have it respect zshs rename READMEmd should instead be rename README md as keeping the extension is a more common use case The recommended way in the wiki removes the extension and leaves the dot and forces you to have multiple keybindings for files files without extensions and directories I find that the prompt on the top is kind of useless and even if I set it to there still will be a blank line where the prompt would be It would be great if in this instance lf prepares preview for the B in size file and the this too folder Behind a set option of course Display a message of success on successful copymove in green Sometimes I dont know what lf was doing being open after a long copy operation there is just no way to tell This may be possible to change locally but I dont like to change core commands if possible
