the above form as complete as possible GOOD JOB ALLAN RITCHIE The DateTimePicker will now display the title and keep displaying the title also after picking a date Previously the behaviour was to display the title when showing the picker and after picking a date it would display the date as the title This is unnecessary since the date is shown directly below already also in string representation Additionally when setting MinimumDate or MaximumDate in the DatePromptConfig it would override the title and never show it not even when the picker is shown Please check all of the
