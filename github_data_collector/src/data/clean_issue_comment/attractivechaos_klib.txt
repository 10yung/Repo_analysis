Please could you provide an example on how to use klisth Im having to forward declare structures defined by the macro expansion which im pretty sure is not the way to do it Need to define kfloat as float and pass fsingleprecisionconstant or similar for other compilers It would be extremely nice for potential use on embedded devices if floating point math ie use of acHASHUPPER and addition of could be avoided in khash If that is not possible it would be quite a bit better already if acHASHUPPER became a float at least as an optiondefine WDYT Are you open to a PR for either of those two the example uses ifret even though ret isnt declared i assume k is meant When compiling a library that uses ksorth on Windows I get the following error error LNK unresolved external symbol drand referenced in function ksshufflesortspritebatchitem As far as I know drand isnt implemented in mathh on Windows This PR fixes some potential UB found in kbtree minor API doc fix fix the kva in kvech error lvalue required as left operand of assignment Hi I noticed this TODO on khput TODO implement automatic shrinking resize already supports shrinking and above I see theres a resize call with hnbuckets and the comment clear deleted elements so it seems like it does shrink on certain situations but not in others Can you give more details on this please Thanks Added new function to return the current number of items in the list
