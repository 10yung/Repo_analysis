I would like to enter text mode instead of visualeditor I tried the following method but I could not enable text mode addfiltertailoreditorsettings functioneditorsettings editorsettings teeny true editorsettings tinymce false return editorsettings addfilterwpdefaulteditor function return html The wordpress version is And the theme used is Twenty Seventeen How do I enable text mode Thanks php version PHP Tailor version Using the Sample Extension format when I create or update controls it seems I need to change the name of the shortcode and class in order for the changes to register with php Otherwise atts are updated in javascript but in php the old ones persist Not sure what Im doing wrong Add new element with setting and control class TailorNewCoolElement extends TailorElement

the title control to say heading atts still hold title I imagine its something obvious Steps to Reproduce Go to any existing pages edit screen Change the title and update the page Tailor the page make any change and save it Go back to edit screen see title is reverted to previous title This is due to this function Im unclear at the moment on what the best way to address this Current working theory is that it probably makes sense to hook into post title changes and update the posttitle meta key so they stay synced in both directions Hey I really love your plugin Im using sandstormio to build wordpress sites For some reason the editor doesnt consistently startup for me What can I do to start debugging this issue Hello Tailor Team I have extended TailorElement class with other elements but the problem is these elements model window have more than tabs which result as the following tailoring home google chrome Solution using pure CSS Changing modalcontent position to relative instead of absolute Setting the top value to for modalcontent Setting overflow to hidden for modalcontent Setting overflow to scroll for modalinner Adding modalfooter before the closing tag for modalcontent div Solution using Javascipt Using javascript to detect the top value for modalcontent depending on the number of section tabs Solution using Javascript and CSS Adding extra class to model window if the tabs width is larger than the inner width then apply extra top value for modelcontent using this class Im having rendering issues Tailor appears to create the right separation between columns at least when viewed in the page editor of the dashboard screenshot from But it doesnt actually visually place any of the content blocks into columns when I drag them alongside each other peek The issue persists when saved and viewed outside of the tailor interface Im on WP with the latest release of Tailor This issue crops up consistently across a few themes I tested Twenty Fifteen Twenty Sixteen Twenty Seventeen Hestia Shoreditch and Themelia Tailor relies on the WordPress Heartbeat API for edit locking but WP Engine and possibly other web hosts disable Heartbeat except on certain whitelisted WordPress core pages out of performance concerns Tailor doesnt handle that scenario well and throws a cryptic error It would be better to detect when the Heartbeat API is blocked or detect WP Engine specifically and either provide guidance to the user or use a possible workaround Other plugins also warn users of this quirk in documentation for example When run on WP Engine Tailor throws an Uncaught ReferenceError sidebarApp is not defined JavaScript console error in canvasjs when attempting to edit a pagepost The errors were different under Tailor and earlier Uncaught TypeError Cannot read property findWhere of undefined Uncaught TypeError Cannot read property channel of undefined When these errors crop up Tailor just shows an allgray screen with a perpetually spinning circle instead of its editor Possible starting point for workaround implementation Beyond warning the user the plugin code below might offer a starting point for coding an automatic workaround for this issue It provides an interface for whitelisting additional WPAdmin URLs that should be allowed to use the Heartbeat API However I havent tested the plugin because WP Engine has already applied a blanket fix to my account Background on WP Engines Heartbeat blocking Heres what WP Engines support told me The root cause of the issue is that by default our mustuse plugin disables heartbeat so we have to manually enable it when issues like this happen Just so that youre aware as well though enabling heartbeat can potentially cause higher server load and thus lead to a higher load time for the site on the install In this case though since its just related to the page builder plugin that shouldnt be much of a concern its generally only problematic if you have other plugins using heartbeat as well Immediate fix for WP Engine users Contact WP Engines support live chat is usually quick and ask them to enable the Heartbeat API so you can use Tailor They will have references to it in their internal support system Possible DIY fix for WP Engine users It might also be possible to install the whitelist plugin above and add Tailorspecific admin URLs to the whitelist to get this working without the help of WP Engine support in a pinch As far as I check there is no way to extend the responsive breakpoint so at least you can add one more to core plugin like Bootstrap breakpoints For advanced layouts we need more breakpoints I have a carousel where I am displaying customer testimonials There are carousel items per row like this img width altscreen shot at pm src When my screen goes below the mobile screen width set in customizer tailor layout I think the carousel items should go full width and only be item per row similarly to how other elements do when they are within a tailorcolumn div This looks very awkward on mobile but I still want this content to show on mobile and not be hidden And since the tailorcarouselitem has dynamically generated inline styling Im not having much success overriding the style with CSS img width altscreen shot at pm src Im not sure if it also happens to you guys but if you disable tailorsavecontentashtml the content of Content elements always revert back to defaultplaceholder after refreshing the canvas not in the frontend its ok in the frontend Can someone confirm it
