hello while trying to load a diff I get this into the error message area Reading commit diff cli output failed bufioScanner token too long ubuntu GRV version RV Git Repository Viewer v gcffa compiled with go at UTC git version The ability to drill down from one view to the other is what allowed me to migrate from VScodes Git integration to GRV One of the very few missing pieces would be a blame view Sure one can git blame on the command line but doing so within GRV could allow clicking on a commit to go directly to its diff view something which requires copy pasting commit numbers with vanilla Git Hi foiks I cant get to open a bare repository with no working copy I always this error FATAL Unable to initialise grv Unable to find a git repository in or any of its parent directories In the same directory all git commands are working correctly How can you use an url for the repoFilePath or equivalent Our projects are on a server Where ip stands for an ip address component for exemple related When gvr starts the Refs is always the focused view but most of time I use Commits for branch view directly so I have to Tab a few times to switch to it So providing a setting that I can choose which view to focus when grv starts is better grv I dont know whether this is my own problem but STab key donest work as expected it doesnt call grvprevview which is the default binding according to even I put the following line into grvrc map All STab grvprevview I tried map All Esc q map All Escape q map All Escape q map All Esc q map All ESC grvremoveview map All Escape grvremoveview map All Escape grvremoveview map All Esc grvremoveview All of them dont work There are two main issues Im submitting here both to do with how the display changes with interaction As a demonstration please see the imgur album with two gifs Highlighting The first is random block highlighting that happens when you move around See screenshot below for more specific details In the Status window the two green blocks circled shouldnt be there as the Changes no stages for commit line is the one selected In the Diff for unstages files window Im not sure what the red and green blocks are attempting to highlight Scrolling Best demonstrated in the gifs there is some really odd behavior where the program is not writing the screen correctly In the first gif simply going up and down on the Status window causes the Diff window to creep upwards then eventually just repeat the same lines of the file over and over In the second gif scrolling down works fine but if I try and scroll up only the top lines of the window actually change System Info grv version GRV Git Repository Viewer v g da compiled with go at GMT grv is running on top of zsh in a tmux window This is being run through SSH on a server running RHEL
