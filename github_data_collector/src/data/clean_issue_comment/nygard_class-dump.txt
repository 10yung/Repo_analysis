Xcode Hi Small update for Build in this configuration I dont known what is PLATFORMIOSMAC is missing on my mac I put value of but i am not sure and i commented it in CDLCBuildVersionm Id like to request a new release of the classdump binary It was last released in and since then a particularly annoying bug rereported in has been fixed but we keep having to build from source to get the fix Classdump sometimes fails to process bit files because the data cursor unconditionally aligns its ObjectiveC data pointer to a bit boundary When it comes across the MachO file which uses ObjectiveC and Swift at the same time classdump exits And I just made some modifications so that classdump can dump objc headers normally while the application is written in both ObjectiveC and Swift interface Bla AccountUtilities accountUtilities property weak nonatomic AccountUtilities accountUtilities synthesize accountUtilitiesaccountUtilities Compiler error Existing instance variable accountUtilities for weak property accountUtilities must be weak Thus needs weak AccountUtilities accountUtilities I compiled classdump from source this morning linking to OpenSSL zh Analyzing a decrypted iOS binary generates an unacaught exception in libcabidylib Desktopclassdump ooVooarmv decrypted classdump Assertion failure in CDObjectiveC Processor loadMethodsAtAddressextendedMethodTypesCursor UsersjwrightclassdumpSourceCDObjectiveC Processorm classdump Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInternalInconsistencyException reason Invalid parameter not satisfying listHeaderentsize selfmachOFile ptrSize First throw call stack CoreFoundation x fff d f exceptionPreprocess libobjcAdylib x fff e f e objcexceptionthrow CoreFoundation x fff d f a NSException raiseformatarguments Foundation x fff f NSAssertionHandler handleFailureInMethodobjectfilelineNumberdescription classdump x a a classdump classdump x a classdump classdump x a classdump classdump x ffe be classdump classdump x fdca b classdump classdump x fee c classdump libdylddylib x fff f ad start x x libcabidylib terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException Abort trap The target binary is decrypted from an iOS device using dumpdecrypted and thinned to a bit ARMv binary with lipo Im running classdump on OSX El Capitan Should I be doing something differently here Thanks Josh There is Crash infomation classdump Assertion failure in CDObjectiveC Processor loadMethodsAtAddressextendedMethodTypesCursor VolumesLionUsersnygardSourcegitmeToolsclassdumpSourceCDObjectiveC Processorm classdump Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInternalInconsistencyException reason Invalid parameter not satisfying listHeaderentsize selfmachOFile ptrSize First throw call stack CoreFoundation x fff b dbd exceptionPreprocess libobjcAdylib x fff eddd objcexceptionthrow CoreFoundation x fff b aa NSException raiseformatarguments Foundation x fff ff NSAssertionHandler handleFailureInMethodobjectfilelineNumberdescription classdump x d c e classdump classdump x d d a classdump classdump x d fc classdump classdump x cfabf classdump classdump x afc classdump classdump x bf b classdump libdylddylib x fff f ad start libcabidylib terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException Abort trap Should i do someting Eg NSStringCKUtilsAdditionsh instead of NSStringCKUtilsAdditionsh A common naming convention is that the base file name of the category is the name of the class the category extends followed by followed by the name of the category This category might be declared in a file named SystemClassCategoryNameh Support UTF encoding the variable name method name and class name
