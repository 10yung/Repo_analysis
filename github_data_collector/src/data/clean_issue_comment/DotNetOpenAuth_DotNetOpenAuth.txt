or is it permanent A typical setup such as in the examples project produces tokens longer than bytes Tokens with extra data may be even longer around KB Is there a way to make access tokens smaller In March Facebook will disallow returnUrls that arent in a static list DotNetOpenAuth seems to put dynamic parameters into all returnUrls meaning it will no longer work with Facebook Does anyone have a workaround or fix for this Received this error when calling google api for a service account using open auth Cannot seem to track down the root cause Error testing email server conn

communication is there any approach to make it work without make C with https thank you very much in advance Denny As on this link DotnetOpenAuth in not competible with least available FB version The two calls to IAuthorizationServerHostGetClient had mutually exclusive requirements Throw an exception if the Client is not found do not return null Return null if the Client is not found do not throw an Exception The problem prevented an OAuth Authorisation Server implementation from correctly handling an invalid ClientID either the Authorize request would fail with a ProtocolException or the Token request would fail with an ArgumentException This changes to match the pattern of which is also how the interface is documented Hi Please how can I include the audience parameter in OAuth token request I read the below page about Secutiry Scenarios but I don t understand Below my code var server new AuthorizationServerDescription serverTokenEndpoint new Urixxx serverProtocolVersion DotNetOpenAuthOAuth ProtocolVersionV var client new UserAgentClientserver clientIdentifier xxx clientClientCredentialApplicator ClientCredentialApplicatorPostParameterxxx var token

was unable to dynamically modify the config file may I ask how to modify whitelistHosts list when you run the program THIS REPOSITORY IS DEAD THIS REPOSITORY IS DEAD THIS REPOSITORY IS DEAD Thanks for your interest in DotNetOpenAuth
