 Version of macOS G Version of the app What were you trying to do when the issue happened I changed Download folder to Documents If it is a hang beach ball please provide a process sample I used Instrumentsapp and discovered that DownloadManagerupdateDownloadedFlagsByEnumeratingFilesAtPath freezes the app because I changed Downloads folder to Documents where I store all my files Gb guard let enumerator FileManagerdefaultenumeratoratPath path else return guard let files enumeratorallObjects as String else return enumeratorallObjects freezes the app because I have a lot of files in the Documents directory img width altScreenshot at src As a solution we can disallow choosing an nonempty directory as Download folder Also there is no button to reset Download folder to default value I think we should add this button I can open Pull request with this button Hopefully this desired functionality can adequately be described as being the opposite of what the Downloaded filter provides Essentially displaying what videos have not yet been been download allowing one to hone in on what videos may want to be added to the download queue This would be in addition to the existing downloaded indicator within each list cell and would most likely hopefully have no bearing on this nicety As described in the ConfCorerealm file can get quite big Realm offers a way to resave a database file in a way that compresses it I remember trying to do this automatically a long time ago but having trouble getting it to work reliably Maybe something changed that would allow us to implement this now or at least offer a manual way for the user to do so that doesnt require downloading another piece of software My MBP is running macOS Beta A f Im running WWDC Version I have been going through the videos I wanted to see using the filters Downloaded and Unwatched to ensure that I was always getting new one But for a while the Unwatched filter has not been working It could be that it stopped when I installed Now after watching a video to the end it still shows up even when I have Unwatched switched on The videos I watched earlier are excluded and if I turn the Unwatched filter off those ones come back to the list If you answered YES to all of the questions please provide as much information as possible about your issue Version of macOS Version of the app What were you trying to do when the issue happened Mark session as read If it is a wrong behavior list all steps required to reproduce it What happened Trying to use the Mac OS standard approach of CtrlClick for context menu does not work What did happen Only a two finger click summons the context menu I was hours into the using the app was frustrated with anther bug in which watched sessions were not recorded as such and was hoping for a way to mark watched sessions as watched To be sure it wasnt my keyboard I double checked with the keyboard viewer and again with a browser to make sure there wasnt some change in the routing of secondaryclick messages What should happen The WWDC app should support both modes for controlclick two finger tap and CtrlClick as is the case for every other Mac app that I have tried How to reproduce Open app hover over left index column hold down control and tap the trackpad Nothing happens Only doing a doubletap with a trackpad seems to work Great app though thanks There are three colours in the playback progress indicator the current time the hovered time the background colour The WCAG contrast ratio not normally applied to two nonfont elements but doesnt pass on simply the current background colour never mind the intermediary hover colour img width altScreenshot at src I suggest we increase the contrast between these elements to increase legibility When the user filters the amount of items in the left list decreases It would be nice also as motivation to watch more session videos to know how much videos are left in the left list eg when I activated the unwatched filter macOS WWDC Version The action Add to Favorites syncs via iCloud to my other Mac but Remove from Favorites does not sync Not a huge deal but would be a nicetohave feature It would be cool to provide an option in the settings to autodelete watched session videos so they do not clutter up disk space Specs Version of macOS Version of the app
