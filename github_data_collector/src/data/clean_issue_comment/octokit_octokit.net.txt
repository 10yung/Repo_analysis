This PR fixes issues and stack overflow when attempting to retrieve events on issues due to large ID numbers and replaces the seeminglyabandoned PR In addition to changing the types of the relevant field and parameters the names of the parameters have also been updated from number to eventId to better reflect whats expected to be passed Apologies if this is a duplicate issue the closest I could find is which isnt quite the same question but it is also in the realm of authentication As part of a developer workflow I would like to add some logic which uses octokit REST APIs to query GitHub to check open pull requests In order to do this it seems I need to require every developer to go to GitHub to generate a personal access token with at minimum repo scope and store that token locally per host The developers have already configured a publicprivate key for git the command line I would like to leverage the existing privatepublic key that developers have set up for git auth to use with octokit and I would like to avoid having to ask every single user to create a personal access token for accessing GitHub explaining the difference between git vs GitHub to several hundred users is not something I have any desire to do Is there any way that octokit can or will soon support this Bumps GitHubJwt from to details summaryRelease notessummary pemSourced from a href releasesaemp blockquote

ApiPaginationcsline FIddler output If I move ASPxGridView to the root the error is gone In my case Im building a set of org policies and I want to exclude template repos from certain polices eg that inactive repos should be archived This allows someone to use TeamsGetorganizationName teamName to retrieve a Team object in cases where someone may not know the team ID offhand NOTE This uses First on the result of GetAll which I think is sufficient in this case as wed want an error to occur if no matching team is found However let me know if youd like this error to be more expressive
