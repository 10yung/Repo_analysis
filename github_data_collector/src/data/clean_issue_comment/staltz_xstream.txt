have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems

This pull request addresses Since there are no other opinions over a half year Ive sent a PR as an advanced step of the proposal staltz If you are against for the changes please feel free to close this Hey Staltz I was wondering if youd be open to exporting two interface subtypes of StreamA one that contains all of the methods that are contravariant in A maybe called SinkA and one that contains all of the methods that are covariant in A maybe called SourceA This would allow for proper subtyping of methods that are expecting source sink streams as StreamA is currently invariant in A For example ts export type ContravariantMethods addListener removeListener subscribe export interface SinkA extends PickStreamA ContravariantMethods Most of the covariant methods on StreamA are static with the exception of remember and debug So the Source type makes less sense Hey guys fpts moved away from a method chaining API to a more static land style API which means it doesnt gel very well with xstream anymore Would you be opposed to exporting all of operator methods as static functions curried in their stream argument Right now I have a little helper file that reexports methods as needed eg export const map A Bf a A B StreamA StreamB mapF What do you think of adding the support for handling common addListenerremoveListener event emitter targets to fromEvent not just dom nodes
