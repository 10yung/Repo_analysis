 GitHub now allows a wellknown folder for these All the packages use docs For example So it should be part of the skeleton Note that I am not that codesniffer fully supports PSR There is an ongoing discussion here And also I am not sure about styleci Detailed description and context The packagevendor variable is currently used for both the Packagist vendor name and the PSR vendor name Ie I am using sandervanhooft as my Packagist vendor name and SanderVanHooft as my PSR vendor name sandervanhooft as my github username Yes thats inconvenient but its too late to change now The prefillphp and the markdown document do not make a distinction between these variables so I end up editing them manually How can it benefit other users Possible implementation Use separate variables in the markdown files for the vendor githubusername packagistvendor psrvendor Find a way to conveniently integrate this into the prefillphp file Provide a general summary of your changes in the Title above Description Allows composer checkstyle to be ran on precommit and composer test on prepush Motivation and context For me it is about bringing all engineers inline At the end of the day we are only human and automation on things like this allows to concentrate on the problem to solve and reduce potential stress How has this been tested Ran vendorbincaptinhook install and made breaking changes on code and tests to check the errors stop committing and pushing to remote Types of changes What types of changes does your code introduce Put an x in all the boxes that apply Bug fix nonbreaking change which fixes an issue x New feature nonbreaking change which adds functionality Breaking change fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change Checklist Go over all the following points and put an x in all the boxes that apply Please please please dont send your pull request until all of the boxes are ticked Once your pull request is created it will trigger a build on our continuous integration server to make sure your tests and code style pass x I have read the CONTRIBUTING CONTRIBUTINGmd document x My pull request addresses exactly one patchfeature x I have created a branch for this patchfeature x Each individual commit in the pull request is meaningful x I have added tests to cover my changes x If my change requires a change to the documentation I have updated it accordingly If youre unsure about any of these dont hesitate to ask Were here to help As outlined here the copyright notice should probably be updated to include contributors But in the case of open source there will likely be multiple contributors each retaining their own copyright You might write something like Copyright year Alison Ben and Charlie but as the number of developers grow things will quickly get out of hand So lets simplify things and just write Copyright year the project contributors if you want to be super technical there s no reason you couldn t say project founder and the project name contributors In either case just putting the project founder or maintainer is strictly speaking wrong assuming others have contributed How about updating LICENSEMD to say something like Copyright c authorname authoremail and the packagename contributors Since commands diff and patch do not exist on Windows composer format fails GitHub now exposes release information via the sitegithubreleases Jekyll namespace Is this something we might want to display on our sites
