Problem Description Hello seems that this library doesnt work when bulletin is opened when app is not taking of the screen When running in any split view combinations or of the screen widths the bulletin view is displayed as it would take the whole screen estate therefore part of it is hidden I have tried both showBulletinaboveanimatedcompletion or showBulletininanimatedcompletion they seem to give same result I attach an image of the problem to further clarify the issue img width altScreenshot at src Is there any workaround Steps to reproduce Run the app present bulletin board when app size has been reduced with split view Present bulletin board with either showBulletinaboveanimatedcompletion or showBulletininanimatedcompletion Environment Device iPad Pro iPad Pro OS iOS Version of BulletinBoard Problem Description The action buttons do not update their background colors when dark mode is toggled This is caused by the fact that the background color is in fact an image and thus it will not respond to the dynamic nature of UIColors traitcollectionchange callback Steps to reproduce Have a bulletin present on screen and toggle dark mode The background color wont change to the correct value Environment Device Any OS iOS Version of BulletinBoard Latest as of Oct When I try to scroll through my picker which is positioned under the title all the rows disappear I have searched for this issue and I have found not here that the issue is connected with the view that contains the picker Are there any solutions my code import BLTNBoard class PickerBLTNItemT Pickable BLTNPageItem

the simplest picker implementation doesnt work and causes the same issue It seems that librarys Localizablestrings conflicts with projects same file The issue appeared when I tried to archive and sent an app version through Fabric App seems to use the librarys file with effect to show only localizable keys and not translations Pasting my translations to librarys file resolved the issue In addition because app uses libarys Localizable files language fallback functionality is not workingI have installed library through cocoapods Swift PM is officially supported in Xcode so it would be great if BulletinBoard supports it img width altScreen Shot at PM src I think something is wrong here And I should change Swift version manually Showing All Messages SWIFTVERSION is unsupported supported versions are in target BulletinBoard If I call bulletinManagerdismissBulletinanimated true when the bulletin has already been dismissed it crashes saying BLTNItemManager must only be used from the main thread If the dismissBulletin function is called immediately after the manager has been dismissed bulletinManagerisShowingBulletin is still true There needs to be a check like if the manager is no longer presenting or is in the middle of dismissing ignore the call to dismiss Im using the latest version of BulletinBoard I need to know when the bulletinManager has completed dismissal of the bulletin however there doesnt seem to be a way to do this Could someone add it in so we can have bulletinManagerdismissBulletinanimated true completion block Thanks Problem Description How do I show a specific pageBLTNItem on demand Steps to reproduce Say I have a selection of bulletins created like in the documentation and on press of a button I only want to show bulletin number Currently Im using bulletinManagershowBulletinabove self animated true let fourthItem BLTNItem makeFourthPage bulletinManagerpushitem fourthItem However I get a glitch during the showBulletin animation where it very briefly shows the root item for half a second before pushing the intended Item Ive tried changing the order so creating and pushing the item first then showBulletin but I get this error You must call the prepare function before interacting with the bulletin Environment Device iPhone XR OS Version of BulletinBoard latest Problem Description The action buttonshandlers do not work Steps to reproduce
