javaawtEventDispatchThreadrunEventDispatchThreadjava Hi I need to extend scalala to work with class BigDecimal I implemented an implicit object for Scalar BigDecimal and a lot of implicit objects for the different operators but since the trait DefaultArrayValue is sealed I cannot define an object of class DefaultArrayValue without changing the scalala source code Why is this trait sealed Wouldnt be better to make it nonsealed If I do val m DenseMatrixrand val m DenseMatrixrand m m I get TransA must be or but is set to TransB must be or but is set to Parameter to routine cblasdgemm was incorrect ERROR in F J JNI getTrans got n and then JVM crashes silently I have no trouble running MTJ or jblas code Any ideas Hi Ive updated the build to use Scala instead of At the moment it is only crossbuilt to and as previously as I did not think was required anymore given that x should be binary compatible However if you want to keep a crossbuild let me know and Ill add it to another pull request assuming you reject this While doing some basic linear regression in my program it calculates the parameter matrix ok but then I get results like this ERROR Second call to constructor of

the above line to scala val result DenseMatrixzeros V size vectorssize The result became scala res scalalatensordenseDenseMatrix Int If that is the right fix let me know how you want the patch submitted I am new to git and github I tried to follow the instructions on the wiki but couldnt build it because RC SNAPSHOT isnt in the This is really just a repost from the google group but since noone has answered in quite a long time and I feel that this might be an issue please let me ask the following question While Im probably not seeing the wood for the trees Im somehow confused with Librarysum for matrices or more specifically its result For val foo DenseMatrix Id expect sumfoo AxisHorizontal to return the sum along the horizontal axis ie some VectorCol The same applies to the vertical sum only vice versa However the horizontal and vertical axes seem to be swapped hence sumfoo AxisHorizontal returns some VectorRow So my question is whether this is the desired behaviour as I would have expected the contrary Maybe this is due to the fact that English is a foreign language for me and Im mixing up the meaning of summing along the horizontal or vertical axis not mocking here I really think I might have misunderstood the meaning Regards Alexander
