 This will allow to connect to databases that requires unix socket connection like Google Cloud SQL Is this config parameter expected to work with the current jasync MySQL driver I m convinced it was running before and it is referenced here MemSQLTestjava in this repo but new I think I was mistaken I didnt see where in the source its handled and it seems to go unused in assembleConfiguration If not Id love to implement it for you but a nudge in the right direction would help thanks I dont want a dependency on JodaTime for my projects so I decided to start fixing TODO x Common library x MySQL x Fix TimestampEncoder Fix MySQL tests Postgres Fix Postgres tests Looking for comments on this before I finish the whole thing ideally from someone who has in depth knowledge of javatime Im not sure Ive converted the calls successfully in some cases Mostly followed this as a guide Implementation notes TimestampEncoder is definitely broken probably need to use ZonedDateTime instead of LocalDateTime etc Will take a look at it later and resolve Even though TimestampEncoder assumes no time zone it formats times using a Z suffix to represent the UTC timezone As such I had to make it use ZonedDateTime otherwise a formatting exception would occur at runtime Cheers It would be great if it was possible to support streaming out results from postgresql as it has the potential to reduce memory usage and improve perfomance libpq supports this as is documented here and so do other libraries based on that I am not sure how much effort it would requre but if it being based on Flow that would probably be the most natural fit for the kotlin ecosystem Looking at and various other reports it seems that COPY tableName FROM STDIN is the fasted when it comes to inserting a lot of data to postgresql but it requires support from the driver As far as I can see this is not supported currently Is there a chance though for this to be implemented I think we should use javatime classes instead of jodatime
