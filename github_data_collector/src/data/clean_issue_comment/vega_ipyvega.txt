Add support for datetimedate values in pandas DataFrame as described in Pandas types the SQL DATETYPE as an Object column with standard library datetimedate values This also comes up when converting

updates receive only lockfile updates if desired Security updates receive only security updates if desired details See and It would be nice to provide an easy means for the user to see what version of vegavegalite is installed with this package Currently unless Im mistaken the only way is to look at packagejson find the vegaembed version then go to the correct vegaembed release open its packagejson and look for the vegalite version there Id love something similar to python import vega vegajsversions vega vegalite vegaembed The trick is to do that without too much manual bookkeeping Is it possible to show char from url like IPythondisplayImagemyimagepng do python from vega import VegaLite VegaLiteurlbarchartwithlabelsvljson Comment from Carreau at repr should as most as possible not have side effect that would completely break things like nbconvert If you want an assignment to also display you can tweak the config option of IPython Yo may also try to have a repr widgets maybe instead of having sideeffects Can we update ipyvega andor the altair renderer framework so that ipyvega returns a displayable object rather than calling display as a sideeffect Some database queries return python date objects in pandas frames call pdreadsql Pandas generally knows how to deal with this for example when displaying a table it formats the date correctly However if this frame is passed to ipyvega VegaLitespec df VegaLite throws an error complaining that it doesnt understand the datetime object I think ipyvega should be able to understand the python datetime object Ive encounterd a problem with pyvega and the Python print function The following example works hence the figure is displayed correctly in the notebook import altair altairChartaltairloaddatasetmoviesencodexProductionBudget yIMDBRating If I print anything in this same cell the figure output disappears import altair printfoo altairChartaltairloaddatasetmoviesencodexProductionBudget yIMDBRating Is this expected behavior Niels Because many pythongenerated vega plots result in data being embedded into the notebook notebook size can quickly grow beyond what the browser can handle see Would there be a way to optionally enable PNGonly mode where on save or perhaps on render the live output is replaced by the PNG and removed I think the JS could be tweaked to do this but its not clear to me how this could be easily enableddisabled from the Python side cc ellisonbg This came up in our chat I think its a good idea Could look something like this python class Vegaliteobject def initself spec try spec jsonloadsspec except TypeError pass if data not in spec raise KeyErrorNo data provided with spec selfspec utilsupdatespec DEFAULTS overwriteFalse Advantage is more flexible API ability to outsource dataframe formatting stuff to Pandas the disadvantage is that in some situations wed add an extra
