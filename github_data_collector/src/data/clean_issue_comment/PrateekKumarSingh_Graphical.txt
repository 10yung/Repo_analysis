Just some basic validation of the module and the functions Note currently the Pester is reporting some error since you dont have a LICENSE file on the repo Hope it helps This is best practice and should help with the clarity of the code Using this module in my PowerShell script the header and footer never show up although testing it independently I can get it to work It seems that the header and footer are falling out of the pipeline and never make it to the output To be consistent with the way that WriteGraph works we should output the header and footer using WriteHost also Hey PrateekKumarSingh The graph is already great if the data is in the correct range and the values are steady The problem However in my case for example I hat to do a time complexity analysis for an algorithm Varying the value linear is not really an option because this takes very long so I multiplied by each time I have the following data The time in the second row is the real data I would like to visualize but doing this directly would not be really good because the curve is much easier to interpret when the x value of the graph is proportional to the represented value The next problem was that the graph doesnt scale to fit the window vertically as well as horizontally My quick solution My fast solution is to transform the data before visualizing I did this by setting a fixed width and dividing my x axis into segments with equal width I then check for each segment if a datapoint is in it I set the new datapoint to the old one if its in the segment otherwise I set it to Alternatively the datapoint could be interpolated I also scaled the new datapoints in the y axis so that the maximum hits the height My solution works quite well The only problem is that the labels are not correct then I could think of many scenarios where some kind of linearization and scaling could be useful I am not sure how exactly this feature should be implemented but it would be really awesome I can share some code on demand or maybe some day I am motivated and implement the feature myself Thanks for this great module Currently I am using ClearHost and draw the graph again with an additional data point when I want to display live data It works quite well but it flickers a bit What would be really awesome is if I could pipe a stream of data points into ShowGraph and it would add data points to the graph as they come in When repeatedly drawing a graph with different data I would like to manually set the axis bounds so the axis are stable For example I would like to specify that the Y axis should always start at not the lowest value in the data set Eg if the X axis step is the default and the amount of data points is not dividable by the last box boundary character will be misplaced Datapoints gogoroutines Datapoints gogoroutines Datapoints gogoroutines Datapoints gogoroutines Datapoints gogoroutines Datapoints gogoroutines Datapoints gogoroutines Datapoints gogoroutines Datapoints gogoroutines Datapoints gogoroutines Datapoints gogoroutines Datapoints gogoroutines Datapoints gogoroutines Datapoints gogoroutines Datapoints gogoroutines Datapoints gogoroutines Datapoints gogoroutines I would like to show a graph for data with explicit X values eg where the X axis represents time Maybe Datapoints could accept a hash table where the key is the X value Ideally the key could then be an int float or DateTime object
