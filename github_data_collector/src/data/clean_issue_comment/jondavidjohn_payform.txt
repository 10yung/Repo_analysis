typeerror payform is not a function and i m stuck here i included all the libraries in my project downloaded from GitHub Jquery Bugfix of Caret moved to the end of input after change Fixed for LTR only and testable manually only by indexhtml and jqueryhtml In the ticket there a clear description of how to reproduce the issue and consequently how to test it I have created a jquery and javascript index RTL page in order to test RTL as well Steps to reproduce set up a card number input with auto formatting begin to type in a card number with enough digits to trigger formatting eg move caret position somewhere before the last digit can be anywhere eg delete a digit for instance the second of the example Caret is then moved to the end of input eg Edit The same goes when adding a digit in the middle of the current value set up a card number input with auto formatting begin to type in a card number with enough digits to trigger formatting eg move caret position somewhere before the last digit can be anywhere eg add a digit eg Caret is then moved to the end of input eg Reproduced on This bug occurs as long as there are enough digits to trigger the formatting If there is fewer chars id est only three digits the caret position is not changed Expected behavior Caret position should not change Hi ddayguerrero i hope this is the right one Thanks Francesco It solves the issue according to this document Dinersclub International could starts with Thanks Francesco Hi All with the version it does not validate the DinesClub starts with Example number Checking into the code the regex has been changed Thanks Francesco It appears that Visa cards starting with are not validating properly if I include cardNumberInput It formats the card number properly but when I tab out after entering digits it removes the last digit If I add a space at the end it validates the card number If I remove the cardNumberInput setting it validates after digits without error And without formatting obviously If I test with MasterCard it works as expected including formatting Thanks for looking at this There is a usecase pattern when user presses CtrlA and then Backspace to clear the input However it doesnt work around delimiters How to reproduce Enter then space is automatically inserted Press CtrlA and then Backspace It will remove only the last character instead of entire string Also there is another failing pattern Enter then press CtrlA then start to type the replacement number It will not clear the selected text Hello Thank you for this great module However when using autoformatter and entering the numbers into input field some events are prevented This happens right before space character is automatically inserted eg when entering got events got events got events space is inserted events are not fired got events This makes databinding to fail because we cant know when value is changed Im integrating it with custom Angular component What could be done about this Thanks
