Running vim and tabnine on Fedora Directly after start tabnine doesnt use much memory USER PID CPU MEM VSZ RSS TTY manfred Sl But after some hours it could happen that it really uses much memory and many cores USER PID CPU MEM VSZ RSS TTY manfred Sl Is there anything I could do to debug As shown in the figure above a very simple syntax completion is implemented Once tabNine is enabled the above extension will not work Hello i am trying to present plugin internally in the company In our organization working K employs and local restrictions prohibit to download any exe files or exe that are packed by zip After the first download plugins is trying to update itself by downloading tabnineexe and fails Is it possible to deliver plugin updates by sending zip archive instead I noticed in TabNine logs that it tries to read files like DSStore and any font and image files This doesnt make sense Especially for DSStore and for Thumbsdb if Windows still uses these This should be ignored by default I use Sublime Text Related issues I have OS X and am trying to use it with Python but it says Establishing connection to TabNine Cloud TabNine was unable to install the python semantic completion backend The command that failed was pip install pythonlanguageserver For help see tabninecomsemantic Or type TabNinenosem to disable semantic completion for Python TabNine works well even without semantic completion This is with VS Code I suspect the culprit is pyenv but am not sure Anyone else come across this So I had left sublime open while doing other things and when doing something else noticed that tabnine was sitting using of a core continually when I hadnt been interacting with the editor at all for some hours Closing sublime doesnt appear to cause it to close either Its been dangling for about minutes after I closed sublime as well I have deep tabnine enabled I store tabnineconfigjson in my dotfiles The tool I use to manage my dotfiles happens to make them symlinks to a readonly file which works fine for me in many other programs However TabNine silently deletes the symlink and replaces with a regular file I would like to manage the configuration on my own in a text editor without TabNine deciding to change it for me TabNine should not do anything to the config file if it is readonly Anything that should not be modified by a human should be in a separate file and stored elsewhere not in XDGCONFIGHOME or equivalent This is the email I sent to another extension development team I fount the fucking bug sorry for being rude Im angryTabNine extension when enabled automatically sets autocomplete false in Preferencessublimesettings without any notice It took me more than hours I thought it was because of my other poor extensions ThinkOutofTheBox However I still find TabNine extremely useful Thank you for your efforts but a simple ignorance can cause hours of debugging in many devs schedule javanetConnectException Connection timed out connect at javanetTwoStacksPlainSocketImplsocketConnectNative Method at javanetAbstractPlainSocketImpldoConnectAbstractPlainSocketImpljava at javanetAbstractPlainSocketImplconnectToAddressAbstractPlainSocketImpljava at javanetAbstractPlainSocketImplconnectAbstractPlainSocketImpljava at javanetPlainSocketImplconnectPlainSocketImpljava at javanetSocksSocketImplconnectSocksSocketImpljava at javanetSocketconnectSocketjava at sunsecuritysslSSLSocketImplconnectSSLSocketImpljava at sunsecuritysslBaseSSLSocketImplconnectBaseSSLSocketImpljava at sunnetNetworkClientdoConnectNetworkClientjava at sunnetwwwhttpHttpClientopenServerHttpClientjava at sunnetwwwhttpHttpClientopenServerHttpClientjava at sunnetwwwprotocolhttpsHttpsClientinitHttpsClientjava at sunnetwwwprotocolhttpsHttpsClientNewHttpsClientjava at sunnetwwwprotocolhttpsAbstractDelegateHttpsURLConnectiongetNewHttpClientAbstractDelegateHttpsURLConnectionjava at sunnetwwwprotocolhttpHttpURLConnectionplainConnect HttpURLConnectionjava at sunnetwwwprotocolhttpHttpURLConnectionplainConnectHttpURLConnectionjava at sunnetwwwprotocolhttpsAbstractDelegateHttpsURLConnectionconnectAbstractDelegateHttpsURLConnectionjava at sunnetwwwprotocolhttpHttpURLConnectiongetInputStream HttpURLConnectionjava at sunnetwwwprotocolhttpHttpURLConnectiongetInputStreamHttpURLConnectionjava at sunnetwwwprotocolhttpsHttpsURLConnectionImplgetInputStreamHttpsURLConnectionImpljava at TabNineFinderdownloadTabNineFinderjava at TabNineFinderdownloadTabNineTabNineFinderjava at TabNineFindergetTabNinePathTabNineFinderjava at TabNineProcessstartTabNineTabNineProcessjava at TabNineProcessinitTabNineProcessjava at TabNineCompletionContributorlambdanew TabNineCompletionContributorjava at javalangThreadrunThreadjava I am using deopletetabnine autocompletion in vim with cloud support Sometimes tabnine uses almost of CPU
