OSX and am performing a copy command such as shellcpRLu srcDir targDir My understanding is that u should copy only newer files But after a copy I am seeing the timestamp on the existing files in the target directory are changed to the current time thus defeating the point of the copy operation to leave existing files unchanged Before posting your issue please check our FAQ Node version or tell us

for an amazing library it has been working great for me in all cases I needed it Apart from today that I tried bundling one of my Node apps It would be great if the calls to requires were explicit and not dynamic as its done at Reason is that when we want to bundle the whole Node applicationscript into a single JS file its impossible to get it to bundle correctly One example is something I was trying to do today using ShadowCLJS more details at I tried almost every popular bundler including zeitncc Parcelbundler Rollup and finally Webpack To be honest I believe webpack managed to resolve the dynamic requires but then had other issues with dirname which I use in my code whole other different issue However it would be much easier to integrate with these bundlers if the requires calls were explicit Any specific reason why you go through the indirection of array of strings and a loop to require versus the direct require of the commands other than saving a few characters Thanks Fixes
