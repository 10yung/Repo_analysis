Hi I have ran your code successfully but after that where can I get the dof camera pose I want to make figure of your paper Eventbased Visual Inertial Odometry what should I do Thanks very much When I run mainm using boxes dof I met this problem Error using vertcat Out of memory Type HELP MEMORY for your options Error in undistortevents line undistortedevents xu yu events validpoints Error in main line eventszeroed undistortevents My machine GiB memory and GiB Swap space I want to know if there is something wrong when I run the code or this project need more memory My first confuse is This system defines two templates efprevshiftedweights and eftemplatedecimated Can em use eftemplatedecimated as a template My second confuse is In the em affinemLine timeshiftedpoints bsxfunminus events featurepos flow dt bsxfuntimes flow events end events In order to calculate timeshiftedpoints Can this use the new feature point position and the new optical flow after the affine warping
