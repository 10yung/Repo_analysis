Looks like the release is pinned to Rails I need a way to run rails on the x branch Bump the rails version requirement or if rails is still considered unstable maybe we need a x development branch I have a strange issue that I think is due to respondwith and how it generates the path I have a subdomain constraint for an admin area in my app and a custom domain constraint for the public side just makes sure a restricted subdomain isnt being used If a user updates their profile on the public side the respondwith profile tries to take them to the admin show page for their profile paths are identical but subdomain is different If I explicitly pass the location using respondwith profile location profilepathprofile it works correctly and they are taken to the public show page for their profile I thought that this location Im passing is the same as what responders are using by default so I would expect identical behaviour As it stands right now Im specifying the location everywhere so I dont run into this unexpected behaviour for duplicate paths between subdomains While using the syntax respondwithfoo it was causing the error uninitialized constant MimeJSON I had to use the original syntax of respondto do format formatjson render foo end This has been raised before I am using responders version and i am getting a empty body when i try to access the api Here is the code ruby class ApplicationController ActionControllerAPI respondto json end ruby class IndexController ApplicationController def index respondwithtest tojson render json test tojson end end I am responding with a static json which is resulting in a empty body I have a repo setup to replicate this issue Access using POSTMAN or any restful client This used to work on prior version of rails Possibly due to this comment in libactiondispatchhttpmimetyperb in the actionpack gem ruby ALL isnt a real MIME type so we dont register it for lookup with the other concrete types Its a wildcard match that we use for respondto negotiation internals Hi there I have a problem with status returning ruby model Modelcreatesomeparams respondwith model I need to return if everything is ok and if some validations failed But I always get I thought about ruby respondwith model status modelerrorsany unprocessableentity success But as for me it looks not so good How may I fix it Hi Using responders def create imagerecorduser currentuser imagerecordsave render show status created location apiv imagerecordurlimagerecord respondwith api v imagerecord th row end And have an error ApiV create image with attachment FailureError before post apiv imagerecords imagerecord attributesforimagerecordmergeattachmentsattributes file fixturefiletestimagejpg NoMethodError undefined method uploader for CarrierWaveMounter x f a de appcontrollersapiv imagerecordscontrollerrb in create specapiapispecrb in block levels in top required specspechelperrb in block levels in top required specspechelperrb in block levels in top required So have no clue where is uploader is called and where this exception is from Definitely theres some lack of stack trace Why When use simple do render everything works fine I use mongoid nested model inside the imagerecord with carrierwavemongoid Please help me to debug it
