example code that you think it would be useful to understand reproduce and solve the problem when pager loads tableview in the first child view controller leaves space from both sides but if I switched tabs then it acquires the screen as I wanted here is the screenshot of a simulator for understanding Simulator Screen Shot iPhone s at And after switching tabs and as expected Simulator

ButtonBarPagerTabStripViewController when we click on the tabs changeCurrentIndexProgressive value is being set first and then the viewDidAppear of first child tab is called whereas while we swipe viewDidAppear of first child tab is called first and then changeCurrentIndexProgressive value of rd party library is being set first Can you please make the behaviour of swipe similar to that of click of tabs Thanks I noticed the API could be made clearer through the use or Swifts type system and also removed the need to make an On check and assert Before submitting issues Make sure you are using

version you are using In case of reporting errors provide Xcode console output of stack trace or code compilation error Any other additional detail such as example code that you think it would be useful to understand reproduce and solve the problem Since Xcode includes Swift Package Manager it would be nice to support it I see that Settings should be called before viewDidLoad is called But in my case I need to dynamically change the tab and text colors Is there any way to update the Style Dynamically How do we do that Thanks Environment version XLPagerTabStrip Xcode iOS Description moveToViewControllerat index Int animated Bool is called when tap tab items but not called when swipe to change index I think that this method has to be called when also swipe to change index Or my operation has some wrongs swift class MyPageViewController ButtonBarPagerTabStripViewController XLPagerTabStrip function add ChildViewControllers override func viewControllersfor pagerTabStripController PagerTabStripViewController UIViewController let child VC CustomViewController let child VC CustomViewController return child VC child VC override func moveToViewControllerat index Int animated Bool true supermoveToViewControllerat index This method is called when only to tap tab items not called when swipe to change index fix type at READMEmd for setting property Would it be possible to document a bit more how to use Segmented type with XLPagerTablStrip From and is not clear to me ButtonBar is clear Thanks
