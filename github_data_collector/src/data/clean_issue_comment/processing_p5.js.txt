be done in CSS by using lineheight property Below is the behavior of lineheight lineHeightDemo Can we add a method textLineHeight to Typography module The signature of the function would be something like this N is the number of pixels param number N function textLineHeightN Resolves Changes Adds i next a js library for internationalization to the p js codebase It lets us use translated for text appropriate to the users browsercomputer configuration It doesnt translate text for us though that must be done by hand It provides language detection and translation loadinguse This PR also integrates it to be loaded with the Friendly Error System and can be used anywhere in the codebase Includes an example using it in the file loading error messages Still needs documentation so others can help spread this through the codebase and add translations PR Checklist x npm run lint passes Inline documentation is included updated I wanted to make an independent thread to locally track development for this feature This was originally discussed in We have been talking about ways to get more people involved in specific discussions on the repo The idea is that a large portion of our community doesnt use github consistently and it would be great to be able to poll opinions generate discussion and encourage contribution through another platform such as Twitter With that in mind we thought it might be cool to automatically create a Twitter poll through the p twitter when an issue notifies a bot along with a set of options Something to the effect of twitterpollbot make a poll prompt When print is called without any arguments the browser tries to print the sketch out on paper This causes confusion so we want to try renaming the function What do you think would be best options a console b printToConsole c log and rename the existing logarithm function gr m suggested adding this functionality as a feature to and development is now underway It can be followed at Moving this from in order to give it the space it deserves Quote from gr m in that thread Talking about other bot ideas Im very interested in enabling editorial contributions to Open Source projects Ive seen it be a huge part of a projects success especially with twittertogether is one of the ideas we had back then everyone can now suggest tweets To lower the barrier further to editorial contributors which might not be familiar with GitHub Id like to create a custom UI for twittertogether that is tailored to the process of suggesting and reviewing tweets Another idea I had is Think Hackernewsreddit and using GitHub as the backend for data persistance and authorization I think a community is defined by common interests and suggesting news items that might be interested to follow p js userscontributors is a great path for contributions that is not code When I created octonews the available APIs where not sufficient but it should be possible now If that is sth that would interest you Id give it another look Ive been waiting for a good reason But let me know what ever would help p js right now Im happy to help as good as I can also happy to coach others so more people will be able to build this kind of automation This is interesting I can imagine this being really cool and useful Is there a live example of either of these things that you can link to I tried looking through the hoodie website but I couldnt find a section that fit your description Or this blog in the way you described I think my main concerns would be with difficulty in implementationmaintenance how to make sure either of these proposals fulfill needs that arent being met yet The social media accounts for p are already pretty flexible in use Would it make more sense to simply expand on that resolves In lieu of the fullyautomated luxury communist future that the bots werent quite ready to guide us to this PR adds a contributors document that attempts to outline How the repository is organized or managed How decisions are made The goal is to articulate and solidify some guiding principles Obviously any and all input is welcome
