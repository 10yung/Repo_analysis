I want to use this function in my project splautoloadregister I think its more a visual studio help but i dont know how to start Im totaly noob with windows and trying to compile my extension phpgtk to windows Ive compiled phpcpp with cmake its created a phpcppcommonlib but i dont know how to compile first test extension without make Can anyone help me to compile first example As the title says this is the standard behavior I cant create constant on interface like c PhpInterface testTest testpropertyX PhpConst Got error error void PhpClassBasepropertyconst char int t int is protected within this context How to fix Add methods void propertyconst char name int t value int flags PhpPublic ClassBasepropertyname value flags into PhpInterface class Hi Does someone created a hello world example Connect to a database sql command and loop to the resultset John Changes to match the internal changes for PHP I want to share my extension to my friend I want to know how to static compile my extension so that my friend wont install phpcpp library Thanks This pull request is related to For now I just commented these missing files out now after running cmake inside of the build directory it configures the project successfully Description Many headers are missing from CMakeListstxt Ive created a basic CMakeListstxt file and setup the required flags with the following configurations cmakeminimumrequiredVERSION projectparentproject CXX setPHPCPPPHPPATH CMAKECURRENTSOURCEDIRphpsrc setPHPCPPARCH x addsubdirectoryPHPCPP When running mkdir build cd build cmake Expected When I run mkdir build cd build cmake on a parent project the cmake configurations does not throw an error Actual When I run mkdir build cd build cmake on a parent project the cmake configurations is complaining on missing includes and headers from zend directory as well OS Ubuntu Compiler C Ubuntu ubuntu PHPCPP implementation of interfaces isnt working very well for me This issue comes with a github project of some combined PHPCPP example classes The extension example code that has problems with adding interfaces is found at Previous commit branch master b ce bdedd bae ec bfbd d a The current master commit had its Interface declarations commented out because php will not run if they were compiled in Commit number dc e fc d faf c a e cb Interface initialisation fails removed appears to initialise and run a simple php test script This sort of worked for earlier php versions possibly with PHPCPP and php At least it didnt stop php from running For what its worth the project has a string class for utf text processing features PHPCPP built in interfaces to implement C hash table string keys KeyTable and sequential array ValueList as part of TOML parser to see how this would go To implement the TOML document relations KeyTable and ValueList derive from a common C class TomlBase and also multiinherit the PHPCPP supplied PhpCountable ArrayAccess Traversable Serialiable The examples and documentation on PHPCPP site are minimal for the interfaces but then I suppose the source code is all So it perhaps stretches the capabilities and complexity of having implements user constructed interfaces by PhpInterface on top of multiinherited classes However the ArrayAccess and others are not declared by PhpInterface construction they are bolted on deeper in the object works by classImpl handlers So checking for interface ArrayAccess does not work in php code even if the PHPCPP extension class has compile this in Also I compiled the extension with stdc to take advantage of extra template classes while the installed shared PHPCPP library defaults to c That is most likely not an issue The two commits can be built with the simple Makefiles The earlier commit code stops php from starting up so the error occurs at module registration
