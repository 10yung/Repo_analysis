Added new prefixes Azercell Bakcell Complemented geo tagging for land Islands Alla according to the description in Currently only libphonenumber jar is supported in OSGI environement not geocoder carrier and prefixmapper jars that does not have OSGI metadata This pull request update build to allow these jars to be used in OSGI environement as well In OSGI these jars will be fragment of libphonenumber bundle it is necessary because they export things in same package than libphonenumber I have added EclipseExtensibleAPI metadata in libphonenumber this has no impacts for OSGI runtime at all but improve development experience with eclipse PDE by indicating to eclipse that fragments must be added to the classpath This fixes the build error I saw today phonenumbermatchercc error GetNationalNumberGroupsForPattern was not declared in this scope due to the compiler picking an older installed phonenumbersphonenumbermatcherh header than the one under src This problem doesnt usually happen with cmake because normally this would all be done from srcCMakeListstxt with setCMAKEINCLUDECURRENTDIR ON but that would require more refactoring The pull request added support for lock with c but not Singleton This PR provide support of both singleton and lock for both C and Windows native Win API like posix does Polish phone number ranges taken from the published list by the Office of Electronic Communication I also used the wikipedia page to map some operators name eg P to their well recognized brand Play Currently the findrequiredprogram function checks for NAMEBINNOTFOUND which has an extra level of indirection causing the function to miss when a program isnt found Generating srcphonenumbersmetadatacc srcphonenumbersmetadatah FAILED srcphonenumbersmetadatacc srcphonenumbersmetadatah cd runbuildlibphonenumbercpp JAVABINNOTFOUND jar runbuildlibphonenumbercpptoolsjavacppbuildtargetcppbuild SNAPSHOTjarwithdependenciesjar BuildMetadataCppFromXml runbuildlibphonenumbercppresourcesPhoneNumberMetadataxml runbuildlibphonenumbercppsrcphonenumbers metadata binsh JAVABINNOTFOUND command not found To fix this we change the function to check for NAMEBINNOTFOUND instead which works In phonenumberutiltest there are compiler warnings comparison of integers of different signs const int and const unsigned long WerrorWsigncompare Due to lines such as EXPECTEQ typessize EXPECTNE u testnumbernationalnumber Where defaults to a const int and typessize is a const unsigned long By changing to u we can compare two unsigned values to not have this compiler warning This pull request adds two new build options USEPROTOBUFLITE When this is set to ON then it links against protobuflite instead of the full version of protobuf As far as I could see the metadata has option optimizefor LITERUNTIME so it should be safe to use the lite version This is useful when you want to save some disk space The default is OFF REGENERATEMETADATA When this is set to OFF it will skip regenerating the metadata with BuildMetadataCppFromXml Since the metadata is included in the source tree anyway it is beneficial for packagers to turn this OFF it saves some time and it also makes it unnecessary to have java in the build environment The default is ON Please let me know what you guys think Updated Finnish carrier list referring to latest national regulator documentation
