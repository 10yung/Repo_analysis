Couldnt find windowNaviScripts did you call register at crawl directorytoappnodemodulesnaviscriptslibcrawljs The thing with my setup is that I initialized a blog with the createreactblog command and copied the files into an existing React app It worked with reactscripts start but there seems to be an issue with jsdom and the naviscripts build command reactscripts build runs without a hitch but the entire build grinds to a halt when it gets to naviscripts build Any idea what might be causing this issue I thought it might be related to issue After trying to create sitemapxml for my site I think naviscripts build should have some build cycle hook to do things without tears I use this hook to create sitemap for my site at Is it already possible to lazy load components using navi import React lazy from react import useStyles from Blocksstyles const Paragraph lazy importcomponentsParagraph blocksmapblock index if blockblockName coreparagraph return Paragraph keyindex contentblockinnerContent else return null This now throws Invariant Violation ReactDOMServer does not yet support lazyloaded components Is there another way to archive this with navi Im struggling to understand how to make a custom matcher following this doc The doc above talks about needing to return an array of segment objects but I cant see segments in the Types doc I would like to fetch remote data in getData using react hooks however this cant be done within regular javascript functions as per React rules of hooks getData being a regular function that returns object Promiseobject hooks cant be used there My concern is that more and more libraries are embracing hooks for data fetching eg React Apollo hooks I could obviously use hooks in my pagescomponents but that would kind of defeat the purpose of reactnavi getData Do you have any advice on what would be the best approach for this issue Edit I found a somewhat similar issue there I could use plain promise based queries using apollo client as per the above issue example but I would still really like to use hooks instead as I can auto generate them thanks to a package called graphqlgen which makes it far easier and less error prone compared to using the bare apollo client crawl doesnt work on certain older browsers and throws TypeError matcher is not a function The problem seems to be caused by the returned promise from createCrawlTuplesPromise that resolves to incorrect data types The resolved value is expected to be an array where the items is a tuple containing one function and one object but is rather one string and one object Here is an example where the promise resolves incorrectly on Chromium v Notice the string type in the first item of the result starting from index crawltupleswithdifferentdatatypes Heres an example where the promise resolves correctly latest Chromium crawltupleswithcorrectdatatypes Here is the result of the pathsvariable within the createCrawlTuplesPromise I suspect the problem is within this function createCrawlTuplesPromisepaths redirect matchers are resolved correctly but withView and mount matchers do not Ive debugged and went through the code but Im having a hard time understanding the data flow and generators Any idea what may be the cause Following on from this issue could you point me in the right direction where this work might need to be done My previous routing logic relied on reactrouter supporting optional params and not only splitting on a ie my URL could have optional param of amp In reactrouter this works languagelanguageRegexpageididRegexampamp In navi id amp get combined into a single param and thus never match correctly I am working on a universal react app that uses express and reactrouter the first request is rendered server side and then hydrates on the client side Is there an example of how navi could work with express for this application I cant quite see how it works from looking at the static rendering docs I am also not using CRA so wouldnt need naviscripts Hi I apologize if I bring it up as a duplicate but Ive gone through all related issues and havent found a solution Expected behavior I want to be able to control not found route behavior and render a dedicated react component page in that case This is how I would expect it to work jsx routesjs import mount route from navi import Frontpage from pagesFrontpage import About from pagesAbout import Page from pagesPage export default mount route view Frontpage about route view About route view Page js Appjsx import React Suspense from react import ReactDOM from reactdom import Router View from reactnavi import routes from routes const render modulehot ReactDOMhydrate ReactDOMrender render Router routesroutes Suspense fallbacknull View Suspense Router documentgetElementByIdroot Current behavior The route associated with the wildcard doesnt render Instead I get a blank page and the following clientside

The above error occurred in the View component in View in Suspense in HashScroll created by NaviProvider in NaviProvider created by Router in Router Some of my views share a navigation bar and some doesnt how do I combine them For example suppose my app have pages home products and about home and products have a shared navigation bar but about doesnt From the docs I know that I can share component with withView jsx withView NavBar View mount route title Home view Home products route title Products view Products But its not clear how to add other routes that doesnt need the shared component Ive tried to use compose but it seemed mount cant be composed I got for about with this code jsx const shared withView NavBar View mount route title Home view Home products route title Products view Products compose shared mount about route title About view About Ive looked at the source code of frontarmcomnavi but I didnt find routes for learn and articles mentioned here so I guess I missed something So how do I do it correctly
