I got a error message when running ipvsadm l I traced it by gdb and found there is a service with two dests on master lcore whereas the same service with only one dest on slave lcores so got the error message above I checked the code but got confused Why do operations asynchronously in dpvssetsvc As I know keepalived not support to load configurations asynchronously yet I tested the scene below Firstly I add the first dest to a exist service multicastmsgsend return immediately after sent requests to all slave lcores but do not wait for any replies and add dest continuously on master lcore Then I add the second dest but get anther error message repeated sequence number for multicast msg because the previous message reply still in queue Finally I run ipvsdam l and get the same message i mentions at the begining It seems like a bug scheduler module for both data and control plane worker performance tuning method percpu inetaddr and sapool async lcore msg for inetaddrsvcdestsapool mempool underflow bugfix and neigh mempool toa crash bugfix functions as well dpvsdestsetavail dpvsdestclearavail Keep conformity of the same function name style modulenameverb like dpvsconnget Remove dpvscopystats that has no definition when i make the dpvsi suffer it there is a Makefile console rm sockopto libipvso ipvsnlpolicyo make Leaving directory usrlocaldpvstoolskeepalivedkeepalivedlibipvs Building binkeepalived checkchecksslo In function buildsslctx usrlocaldpvstoolskeepalivedkeepalivedcheckchecksslc undefined reference to OPENSSLinitssl usrlocaldpvstoolskeepalivedkeepalivedcheckchecksslc undefined reference to OPENSSLinitssl usrlocaldpvstoolskeepalivedkeepalivedcheckchecksslc undefined reference to TLSmethod i have instatall openssl and the version is OpenSSL d i have the dynamic library usrlocalliblibcryptoso usrlocalliblibsslso my os is ubuntu how can i do it thanks a lot option In this mode dest addr is needed in FDIR instead of dest addr and dest port mask NOTICE number of laddrs should be greater or equal to number of slave lcores Or some slave lcores will have no laddr causing FNAT fowarding failed in those slave lcores Coauthoredby kldeng kldeng gmailcom Coauthoredby lixiaoxiao lixiaoxiao cn Coauthoredby mscbg wangqingmscbg com
