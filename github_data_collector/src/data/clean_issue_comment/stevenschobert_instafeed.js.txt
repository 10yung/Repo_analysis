 I implemented instafeed to a website I am working on and I found an issue There are multiple videos on the feed but one of the videos is missing and I dont know why This is the instagram url of the company This is where I implemented instafeed This is the code I am using for instafeed javascript var instagramFeed new Instafeed userId accessToken get user target instagramfeedinner resolution standardresolution sortBy mostrecent template a hreflink targetblankspan classoverlayspan classoverlaydatemodelcreatedtimespanspan classoverlayclickClick to open on Instagramspanspanmodeltemplatea filter functionimage if imagetype image imagetemplate img src imageimagesstandardresolutionurl else imagetemplate video autoplay muted loopsource src imagevideosstandardresolutionurl typevideomp video return true instagramFeedrun I am using the latest version of Instafeed There is an IG TV item added onto an IG feed when I click on posts on the ig account I can see it however the poster image of that video does not display on the instafeed integration like other videos seem to display Is there a solution for this Currently this issue is just to collect information regarding the new API and what it would involve to update instafeedjs to use it UPDATE stevenschobert This thread has turned into a conversation about how Instafeedjs is going to work with Instagrams new API restrictions Currently new Instagram API clients are not able to fetch much of the data that Instafeedjs relied on to work and we are evaluating options for how to handle authentication going forward Credentials created before the API restrictions went live are not affected for now Original Post Im working on a client project built on Shopify platform and am looking to pull in their Instagram posts by user I have it all setup but it will not pull in my clients account When I plug in my personal Instagram account userId clientId everything works perfect so I know its not an issue with how I have it set up Are there any known security settings that will prevent instafeed from working on a specific account To note the account Im looking to pull in has a very large following not sure if that has anything to do with it Heres the setup I have for reference includes liquid language as used on Shopify so just ignore that Instafeed assign instafeedimg image assign instafeedlink link assign instafeedlikes likes instafeedminjs asseturl scripttag script typetextjavascript var userFeed new Instafeed target instafeed get user userId clientId xxx limit sortBy mostrecent resolution standardresolution template div classgriditem largeonefiftha href instafeedlink targetblankimg src instafeedimg span classlikesspan classicon iconheart ariahiddentruespan instafeedlikes spanadiv userFeedrun script
