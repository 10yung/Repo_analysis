During runtime there were a few matrix size mismatch issues due to some mistakes in the code that have now been resolved On line number The current formula to find the cost J fails as it also includes the theta parameter in the calculations We should not be regularizing the theta parameter in the code as theta parameter is not affected by the lambda parameter in logistic regression Hence that theta parameter must be removed So I used theta lengththeta instead of theta in the formula to find J so as to exclude theta parameter and find the correct value for J Lambda while testing should be not lambda itself In OctaveMATLAB recall that indexing starts from hence you should not be regularizing the theta parameter which corresponds to theta in the code added the subtraction of the first value of theta at line Changed an incorrect spelling You first need to normalise the predict features then calculate its cost price predictions My programming environment is Matlab b and I find that it is necessary to transpose matrix X before slicingif not matlab will prompt error and script stop running Although I know this repo has already been out of maintenancethese changes works
