I used the Pentest Framework to installmanage my utilities So my searchploit script is installed in pentestexploitationexploitdbsearchsploit therefore Findsploits update fails because it is looking for it in usrbinsearchsploit I tried symlinking but it complained about that as well Is there a way around this without changing the source code Right now installsh uses aptget to install dependencies which is not supported by OSX
