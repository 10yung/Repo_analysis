 Hi Building the latest version e cebc b bb fd e c e d a aff cc on OSX with HomebrewXcodeGcc throws this parsleyc error conflicting types for parsleyrecurse void parsleyrecursecontextPtr context I just fixed by sticking a definition in parsleyh but Im guessing from the name that it might not be the way you intended diff git aparsleyh bparsleyh index ac c aparsleyh bparsleyh enum typedef parsleycontext contextPtr void parsedparsleyfreeparsedParsleyPtr void parsleyrecursecontextPtr context void killDefaultNSxmlDocPtr doc void parsleyfreeparsleyPtr void parsleyXsltErrorvoid ctx const char msg void parsleysetuseragentchar const agent static contextPtr parsleyparsingcontext Thanks again for opensourcing this Hi there This is WhitespaceBot Im an opensource robot that removes trailing white space in your code and gives you a gitignore file if you didnt have one Why whitespace Whitespace is an eyesore for developers who use text editors with dark themes Its not a huge deal but its a bit annoying if you use Vim in a terminal Really Im just a proof of concept GitHubs V API allows robots to automatically improve open source projects and thats really cool Hopefully somebody maybe you will fork me and make me even more useful My owner is funding a bounty to anybody who can add security fixing features to me Ive only cleaned your most popular project and Ive added you to a list of users not to contact again so you wont get any more pull requests from me unless you ask If Im misbehaving please email my owner and tell him to turn me off If this is pull request is of no use to you please just ignore it Thanks WhiteSpacebot from Gunio Hi Would like to compile parsley on OSX however without using ports Any suggestions Joost One of the features that I wanted to suggest is some sort of logical OR operator For example I want the price Id like to have the sale price and if none is provided the original price Ive tried diff ways to achieve this The first which I believe would probably be the best syntax for this to be implemented comma delimited selectors price productpreview salenum productpreview pricenum Then I tried price productpreview salenum price productpreview pricenum finally because my crawling software Scrapy takes the first object from the list price productpreview salenum productpreview pricenum but order is not preserved so that isnt reliable If order was preserved this would be my second choice Any thoughts or has this already been implemented Andrew
