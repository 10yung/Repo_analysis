Fixes a bug in fuseeexo adds new masterkey vectors adds dev signing support into sept Feature Request Im studying this amazing project and I think that we could improve the documentation What feature are you suggesting fusemd missing explaining what is fuseemtc exospheremd I think that the upcoming software exploits already is obsoleted Was it really had a big role with Jamais Vu and D ja Vu Exosph re currently only contains one extension is obsoleted On released a new extension was added Are there others extensions what is the purpose of the folders lp fw rebootstub and sc fw stratospheremd would be nice to say that fsmitm is a module inside of a bigger module called amsmitm that it has many others mitm modules thermospheremd and tropospheremd both documents say that these features isnt implemented yet but there are some code on respectively folders is it up to date I would love to help in this improvements but Im still very beginner in this project If someone could help me to improve these documentations I would be very happy Bug Report Whats the issue you encountered When modifying the overrideconfigini at runtime through ftp or mtp servers for example if Atmosphere cannot find the appropriate setting in the config it does not fall back to the default value like it does during startup This creates an issue when the user wants to delete all custom override settings in hopes of it resetting to default values How can the issue be reproduced Set the value of programid under hblconfig to the ID of your game Observe that hbmenu now opens through your game and doesnt open through the album Without rebooting Atmosphere remove the programid setting or the ini file entirely eg the user is lazy and hopes that it changes back to the album ID Observe that hbmenu still opens through your game and doesnt open through the album Crash Report NA System Firmware Version Switch FW Environment I think its pretty clear that this is an Atmosphere issue Using latest release Atmosphere masterd Additional context The relevant function in the source code for updating the override config As you can see it only changes the value if it can parse the option in the ini file If it cant find the option it keeps using the previous value Bug Report On all the Atmo x release the docscheatsmd documentation does not reflect the changes done on AMS on atmospheretitles shoud be updated with atmospherecontents Feature Request What feature are you suggesting Overview To add seperated atmosphere folders for each sysMMC emuMMC instances that can contain different LayeredFS kip exefs nxthemes patches saves redirection or even an entirely different version of Atmosphere so as not to interfere with other eMMC instances Note This is mentioned in Atmosphere s changelog Quote In addition some niceties eg having a separate Atmosphere folder per emummc instance still need some thought put in before they can be implemented in a way that makes everyone happy but other than this there is no other information to be found Smaller Details For sysMMC it can either continue or by default to grab sdrootatmosphere folder for use or add an extra config line to change the location of it As for emuMMC the location of the atmosphere folder may be configured in sdrootemuMMCemummcini eg atmospherepathemuMMCRAW atmosphere hekate can also add support to change this line to achieve a fully configured environment without manually modifying emummcini Nature of Request Addition What component do you feel this would best fit within Fus e Atmosph res custom bootloaderbr Thermosph re Atmosph res emuNAND implementationbr Im not sure where to fit this in since Im not familiar with how the internals of Atmosphere work Why would this feature be useful This can allow users and developers to quickly reboot to different instances of eMMC to test and use their desired controlled environment instead of manually altering folders on SD card or even swapping to another card each time they want to use different patches Words and solution are abruptly thrown together my brain is not really functioning right atm I can explain more details if anything is unclear The service worked fine as a standalone process but is having a few issues as part of amsmitm Pull request opened for code reviews since this issues need to be worked out A full reimplementation of NCM Major firmwares for testing x x x x x x x x x x x This would be really nice onebit debugging really sucks especially for early boot bugs This is a fully functional tested implementation of Note copying from Adubbz comment on Mentioned this on Discord but will also put this here for record keeping It needs to be confirmed that nothing from prodinfo is cached and can potentially be compared with the current values and subsequently be included in telemetry This was a potential issue with vertigos implementation too which I dont believe was looked into
