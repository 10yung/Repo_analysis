from uirouterangular Expected Behavior uirouterangularjs should have uiroutercore as a peerDependency just like the other uirouter packages therefore ensuring that I use the same version of uiroutercore Link to Plunker or stackblitz that reproduces the issue if you want a response to your issue provide a way to reproduce it This is a check one box X Feature Request Feature Request Is there any interest in adding sequential routing as a feature Ie most states can be entered at random but in some cases like long running forms the UI state tree looks like this ParentState Step Step Step For any parentState marked as a sequential section UIRouter would support next and back methods such that the Step components would never need to know what the next step or previous steps UI state name The best argument I can think of against this feature is that it feels like an extension of uirouter So if there is a wayplugin architecture for extending uirouter let me know and I will look into it Hello some event that enter when refresh the browser Thanks Hi I am updating state params in my one of the controller like below var stateParams productId null stateParams productId vmproductid productServiceupdateStateParamsstateParams the above productServiceupdateStateParams call the method define in my root controller which assign the params with new params and try to navigate the same state but here the problem happening is that some kind of infinite loop is creating calling this update method again and again in my routing definition i tried to use reloadOnSearch false but still it is not working any one can please help me on this This is a check one box Bug Report Feature Request x General Query My version of UIRouter is X I have already asked my question on

project there is a sideBar which is implemented by statego used for change url and we use lazyload property to load each module I found that the view will not be updated to the latest state when I click the siderbar very fast to switch url Due to analysis the trace log and the code of uirouter I found it is caused by a wrong transition when the error occured the trace log show that there is a Ac transition after AB javascript var activateViews function transition var enteringViews transitionviewsentering var exitingViews transitionviewsexiting if enteringViewslength exitingViewslength

query here This is a check one box Bug Report x Feature Request General Query My version of UIRouter is Im trying to implement a feature flagging strategy in an enterprise application using uirouter so that we can build new versions of route trees while maintaining existing functionality The desired goal is to use a postbuild configuration switch a feature flag to flip between the old states v and the new states v dynamically without requiring the inbound links or URL from having to know about any sort of versioning strategy There are thousands of inbound deep links to this application spread across multiple external applications so having to update them to know about any sort of url versioning or flagging strategy is untenable We have tried a few implementations with uirouter and found that they generally seem to converge on the router needing to share two states per URL which creates a pretty good illusion but falls apart at runtime if the user ever refreshes a view or if a bookmark is used to access a deep link it will load the first state defined for the url Weve also tried a series of transition hooks that redirect from a root node but that also causes inbound deep links to fail because they all get prefixed with a version in the url Can we get something added to the router to help support this sort of transparent state sharing behavior driven off of a switch
