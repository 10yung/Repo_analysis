NuGetCommandV pack and the build number contains something like alpha for a prerelease the version number for that NuGet package will miss the prerelease part Its caused by this regex let buildNumber

FluentMigrator is a database migration framework for NET written in C The basic idea is that you can create migrations which are simply classes that derive from the Migration base class and have a Migration attribute with a unique version number attached to them Upon executing FluentMigrator you tell it which version to migrate to and it will run all necessary migrations in order to bring your database up to that version T Z In addition to forward migration support FluentMigrator also supports different ways to execute the migrations along with selective migrations called profiles and executing arbitrary SQL T Z Project Url T Z Dependencies None T Z T Z Added file ContentTypes xml T Z Added file relsrels T Z Added file content T Z Added file FluentMigratorConsolenuspec T Z Added

Environment Azure DevOps Issue Description When running our release pipeline tasks Azure CLI both v and v fails due to issues like the one in the screenshot above The weird thing is that previously I was using az cosmosdb collection list command and it failed because it was deprecated and the error message said me to use az cosmosdb sql container list and it now fails because this command is in preview mode What type of sorcery is that I guess the more appropriate place to post this question would be Azure CLI repo but I am fine with a workaround too If there is a way to stop such messages to fail my Azure DevOps pipelines I would take it and leave for a while Error Logs I have copied the lines from the log starting from the line the error first appeared T Z az Command group cosmosdb
