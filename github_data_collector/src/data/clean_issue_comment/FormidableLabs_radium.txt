Demo component import React Component from react import Radium from radium class Checkbox extends Component render return div style backgroundColor red height width opacity active opacity export default RadiumCheckbox Versions react radium Hi Weve got an issue with v Warning React does not recognize the radiumConfigContext prop on a DOM element when using Radium with eg Link from reactrouter import Link from reactrouterdom const RadiumLink RadiumLink I suppose Link simply forwards all props to the underlying a element I have a styles object with nested properties In my hover on the parent I want to change the styles on the child propertiesis there a way to do that So something like this const styles resultItem some styles go here symbol default style for symbol fontSize rem name default style for name fontSize rem hover hover selector for resultItem parent symbol change symbol style on hovering over parent resultItem fontSize rem name change name style too on hovering over parent resultItem fontSize rem color blue Looks like no browser prefixes get added for CSS Grid specifically for ie From my initial research it would appear that this is because Support for CSS grid was only introduced by inlinestyleprefixer in the latest version v Radium currently uses v v of the style prefixer drops the Create Dynamic prefixer option We entirely removed the dynamic version of the prefixer due to constant issues with browser detection and the almost impossible need to keep all the versions updated and in sync There are no other changes except the import paths for this version Improvements additions and bug fixes will be build on top of the new major version shortly Is moving to this version an option or is keeping the dynamic prefixer more important avoiding unneeded prefixes sounds like a good idea until you want to cache SSRresults Including the userAgent in a cachekey is not practical so you have to use all prefixes both on server and client to avoid missmatch I tried to use radiumConfiguserAgent all on server and client but i still get missmatch Eg given this style display flex padding alignItems center justifyContent spacebetween produces Server

justifycontentspacebetween msflexaligncenter webkitboxaligncenter msflexpackjustify webkitboxpackjustify its weird that there are some prefixes eg on flexalign But display flex is missing a prefix on
