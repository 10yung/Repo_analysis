integrated screen working with the internal graphic card Really keenly looking forward hearing from you Freddie TensorFlow requires Nvidia GPUs Has anyone used this script to enable TensorFlow GPU running on a Mac What type of performance gain This is a patch I applied to this script to enable closedclamshell mode with my NVIDIA eGPU In IOGraphicsFamilys IOFramebuffer the line of code gIOGDebugFlags kIOGDbgNoClamshellOffline only executed when an NVIDIA GPU is detected causes closedclamshell mode to be disabled so when I close the macbooks lid the internal display doesnt get disabled This patch adds an optional not installed by default package nvidiaClosedClamshellPatch to install a patch that NOPs out this line of code I understand the repository hasnt been updated in some time so no big deal if this cant be merged at the time just contributing this in case its useful macos egpu Cdocx I installed my ePGU using this script bash curl s beta nvidiaDriver iopcieTunneledPatch Setup ok My systems detects the eGPU but I have a black screen with the mouse not showing I tried the suggested solutions on the page Make your Mac compatible with NVIDIA and AMD eGPUs macOS High Sierra but with no success Attached is the result of macosegpu C I have an Akitio TB SSD enclosure that used to work prior to G Now I cannot mount my SSD array Its as if I dont even connect anything to the computer Ive tried all the other ports with and without my eGPU no dice My eGPU works just fine Any help would be greatly appreciated Im not a programmer and I am limited in my understanding of how this works but I know enough to apply simple terminal commands and so far Ive been able to handle issues by doing research on my own and this problem has me stumped I havent been able to access my external SSD array in about a month now I need to get in there haha Thanks in advance for all your help When I try to open Spotify or some other app but not all apps the whole OS gets really slow and unresponsive When I use safarifirefoxsublime text it doesnt do that This doesnt seem like an issue when I am not using the eGPU with external monitors Setup MacBook Pro with HP OMEN Accelerator and two external monitors with a GTX I have a few small script changes to share My machine is on a corporate network that filters pings so Ive added a second way to check network connectivity Also I use the Homebrews version of find that I place ahead in my PATH and that version complains of the ordering for maxdepth Putting the maxdepth argument before iname works for both
