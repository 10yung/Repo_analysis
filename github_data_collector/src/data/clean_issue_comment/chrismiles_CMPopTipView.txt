Can you add two more directions PointDirectionRight PointDirectionLeft Situation The app is build as a Tabbed App so it has an UITabBarController as root view controller Each Tab has its own view controller On the th tab we have an UITableViewController with an UINavigationBar with left and right UIBarButtonItems Weve created an IBOutlet infoButton and present the pop tip by calling presentPointingAtBarButtonItemanimated ObjC poptipForManual presentPointingAtBarButtonIteminfoButton animatedYES The pop tip is correctly shown screen shot at However when selecting another tab via the Tab Bar the pop tip is still visible screen shot at Analysis Method presentPointingAtBarButtonItemanimated determines the container view of the UIBarButtonItem and calls presentPointingAtViewinViewanimated with it The problem is it uses ObjC UIView containerView targetViewwindow Where the app window is returned This is the reason why the pop tip is visible on all tabs in a Tabbed App Solution The proper container view is the superview of the parent view of the UIBarButtonItem The public parent view of an UIBarButtonItem is one of UINavigationBar UIToolbar UITabBar So the first step is to search upwards in the view hierarchy to determine whether the Bar Button is located in a Navigation Bar Tool Bar or Tab Bar When a Navigation Bar Tool Bar or Tab Bar is found return its superview and abort the search When no Navigation Bar Tool Bar or Tab Bar is found the default strategy is to use the app window existing situation Here is my updated code for this method ObjC voidpresentPointingAtBarButtonItemUIBarButtonItem barButtonItem animatedBOOLanimated UIView targetView UIView barButtonItem performSelectorselectorview UIView containerView targetView Search upwards in the view hierarchy to determine whether the Bar Button is located in a Navigation Bar Tool Bar or Tab Bar while containerView nil Get super view containerView containerViewsuperview Check Class if containerView isKindOfClass UINavigationBar class containerView isKindOfClass UIToolbar class containerView isKindOfClass UITabBar class When a Navigation Bar Tool Bar or Tab Bar is found return its superview and abort whileloop containerView containerViewsuperview break When no Navigation Bar Tool Bar or Tab Bar is found if nil containerView Get the Bar Buttons window containerView targetViewwindow if nil containerView NSLogCannot determine container view from UIBarButtonItem barButtonItem selftargetObject nil return selftargetObject barButtonItem self presentPointingAtViewtargetView inViewcontainerView animatedanimated Validation This has been tested and now the pop tip is only shown on the view controller of the specific tab which is the intended behaviour An added benefit is that this also works when presenting the pop tip from a Tab Bar button this can be added to the ReadMe In this case the intended behaviour is that the pop tip is always visible no matter which tab is selected Because the new code uses the superview of the UITabBar this is the case In this example the pop tip is always presented from the th tab even if its not the selected tab ObjC poptipForConnectedTv presentPointingAtBarButtonItemUIBarButtonItem selftabBarControllertabBaritems objectAtIndex animatedYES screen shot at screen shot at I want change the distance between targetView and pointView when PointDirection is PointDirectionDown Couldnt find any support for this nor could I find an issue addressing it Any plans for adding support for setting line height If the trigger popView control including the keyboard of the rising landing event how should I set up Can you add two more directions PointDirectionRight PointDirectionLeft fix resize custom content view by use presentPointingAtViewinViewanimated fuction add a single instance can add to diffierence parent view Hi Can we bring the popup to center of screen but arrow still pointing to sender direction I have attached the image to show what I am facing Currently the popuptip is shifting right and arrow is correct But I want to keep the tip in center to screen as client demands Can help simulator screen shot feb am Can I init a tip view with a custom view using auto layout
