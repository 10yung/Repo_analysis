Hi so I was testing actions and tried it on a file by pressing a followed by pressing l lower L on the first item UniActions The result was that hunter crashed thread main panicked at index out of bounds the len is but the index is rustcff e f bd b ab b d b c aa dsrclibcoreslicemodrs note run with RUSTBACKTRACE environment variable to display a backtrace It seems UniActions is just a headline I thought it was an action but I think hunter shouldnt crash if someone presses l on that headline This doesnt happen for other headlines and I can execute the synchtop action without any problems by pressing l PS Here is the output with RUSTBACKTRACEfull which doesnt seem to provide any additional information RUSTBACKTRACEfull hunter thread main panicked at index out of bounds the len is but the index is rustcff e f bd b ab b d b c aa dsrclibcoreslicemodrs stack backtrace x c unknown x bc unknown x f unknown x f e unknown x ecfa unknown x unknown x e fd unknown x e ae unknown x bd unknown x unknown x df b unknown x b f unknown x ca unknown x a b unknown x cc unknown x d f unknown x unknown x fab f libcstartmain x b e unknown x unknown Hi It seems several new features are not included in the last release from last July I couldnt get image previews working until I installed the dev version of hunter from my package manager The u option also wasnt available So trying to build hunter on Mac OS X Mojave and I get the following error error E this function takes parameters but parameter was supplied cargoregistrysrcgithubcom ecc db ec hunter srcstatsrs selftotaltostringfalse expected parameters error E this function takes parameters but parameter was supplied cargoregistrysrcgithubcom ecc db ec hunter srcstatsrs selfavailtostringfalse expected parameters error aborting due to previous errors For more information about this error try rustc explain E error could not compile hunter warning build failed waiting for other jobs to finish error failed to compile hunter v intermediate artifacts can be found at varfoldersvswxzs qm zgf pxpjrf l TcargoinstallXRil Does anyone have any ideas Building from source after clone generates error error cannot find macro formaterr in this scope srchuntermediars let sixfail e formaterrSixel failed with e help a macro with a similar name exists formatargs rustc version rustc nightly f af c Feature request while youre working out custom key bindings Would it be possible to do key arpeggios as per ranger Ideally would support more than one inbetween state Use case I often find it useful to do multiple types of file sorting that dont really deserve toplevel keybindings For instance in ranger I may use o s to sort by size o c to sort by ctime o t to sort by type Fitting all of these under one generic sort keybinding is very useful Also for inspiration emacs hydra mode It would be helpful to look up the help without leaving hunter Right now hunter just pipes stdoutstderr to a textview but this means subprocesses dont know about the terminal size and dont use colors unless forced with flags This could be improved by plumbing everything through the pseudoterminal interface Additionally it would be nice if it was possible to send input to those subprocesses turning hunter into a real TUIshell proxy
