The project folder includes a Packages subfolder now to see the contents of installed packages The path it reports with AssetDatabaseGetAssetPath isnt where the actual package items are stored so when doubleclicking a script in a package VSCode opens a new blank file with unsaved changes instead of viewing the actual contents of the script To get the path where the item exists the one that opens when you right click and choose Show in Explorer the PathGetFullPath method can be used as per To get it working for me Ive replaced string completeFilepath appPath PathDirectorySeparatorChar AssetDatabaseGetAssetPathselected with string completeFilepath PathGetFullPathselectedFilePath in the OnOpenedAsset callback When using this plugin and VSCode as my editor instead of Visual Studio I noticed OnGeneratedCSProjectFiles was no longer being called Traced it to a change in source of unity where it now branches in PostprocessAllAssets of AssetPostprocessorcs Incase anyone else needs it workaround Im using for now is to have monodevelop somewhere in a folder name leading to my vscode install which makes unity see it as ScriptEditorMonoDevelop instead of ScriptEditorOther so it runs the SyncVS version of PostprocessSyncProject and does the callbacks again Which in turn lets me change the framework versionCPU type so omnisharp actually loads it properly with net as wont install on my system Also the asset store version of this plugin is listed as from august but its which seems to be several years old Pressing Force Update works but some people wont try that if they have a version listed as being the current Probably minor but noticed the header of my sln was tagged as Visual Studio not so tweaked the ScrubSolutionContent part to account for that and added another newline or itd end up without one I have Unity f x and official portable VS Code x on Win x After installing the VSCode ther is no VSCode tab in Unity Preferences menu I got a warning in Unity f saying that Assets VSCode Plugins Editor VSCodecs warning CS PreferenceItem is obsolete PreferenceItem is deprecated Use SettingsProvider instead Im seeing this error in the logs when closing Unity

RevertExternalScriptEditorOnExit preference setting When the callback is triggered the Enabled property is queried which results in this issue I dont know what the solution is but this needs to be

if you have it on your machine install Unity f without VS Community and without the VS integration install code and and the unity vs code extension there is no way to create the solution and assembly files needed by omnisharp AssemblyCSharpcsproj AssemblyCSharpEditorcsproj AssemblyCSharpEditorfirstpasscsproj AssemblyCSharpfirstpasscsproj projectnamesln Assets Open C Project does not do anything Expected behavior always uptodate solution and assembly files Actual behavior no solution and assembly files at all or only outdated ones if they were generated before omnisharp will not find any new references How I fixed it dirty install VS Community with the unity intergration disable vs code and switch to VS Community in the unity preferences click Assets Open C Project to create the solution and assembly files which only works with VS Community switch back to vs code vs code with omnisharp is working again as expected You have to do this all the time something changed so this solution is really not practically How I fixed it less dirty First I still need to have visual studio community with the unity plugin installed Second I changed the constructor line to this static VSCode if Enabled UpdateUnityPreferencestrue disable vs code and reset vs community as the default external editor EditorPrefsSetStringkScriptsDefaultApp EditorPrefsGetStringVSCodePreviousApp sync will now

for these releated issues My session gets overwritten each time I close VSCode and open a file from Unity or double click on a debug output line This means I lose track of the files I had open If I do EditOpen C Project in Code it opens the previous session The problem is probably with Unity itself not this plugin but is there a workaround for now I get this error when I put the VSCodecs File into AssetsPluginsEditor folder AssetsPluginsEditorVSCodecs error CS The type or namespace name PlayModeStateChange does not exist in the namespace UnityEditor Are you missing an assembly reference Unity Editor xf Linux Personal on Ubuntu and Visual Studio Code I have been trying for a long time now and I cannot get intellisense to work and I figured maybe youd like to know this is a problem so you can help me and others to identify and hopefully fix the issue When I open vs code in any way double click file Assetsopen c project in code Assetsopen c project or even actually just opening the vs code application after seconds a little popup box appears that looks like this img width altscreen shot at am src When I click Show output I get a bunch of output in a console It looks like the problem is that Im missing some sort of assembly or something Im not exactly sure what it means but I have tried installing a bunch of stuff to try to fix it I have tried all to no avail Assets Reimport all Assets Open c project Assets open c project in code checking unchecking enable integration in the vscode preferences pane there were no errors in the console installing net core sdk Not sure if I should have but I wanted to see if that fixed it deleting sln file and csproj files to let unity regenerate them One thing to note is I dont know if this documentation is out of date or if mine is wrong but my unity doesnt generate a csharpsln file If you can help me figure out a fix for this and add a check in the preferences pane to autofix it that would be magnificent and Im sure you would help other people with the same problem There is at least one other dude on reddit with the same issue as me Thanks the same as title but other files extension is worked
