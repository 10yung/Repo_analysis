 npm audit surfaces vulnerabilities from package Braces I went to create a PR however there are PRs from Is this project dead My application was running fine until last week when I start running it in development mode webpack hot development as usual It starts scanning files that have never changed and kept reloading the project Recently it got even worse start crawling into my nodemodules folder and reloading by each file and eventually crashed It has never happened before until recently and I have no idea what caused it to behave like that suddenly command prompt logs Initial data loaded

else is facing this issue or anyone has any idea how to fix this Any help is appreciated Hi Im getting this error when i run my node express server with piping sh MaxListenersExceededWarning Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected message listeners added Use emittersetMaxListeners to increase limit This is my node server js Restarts App on Save requirepiping import as express from express import as morgan from morgan import router socket from main let app expressApplication express appusemorgandev appusemiddleware router socketlisten applisten consolelogListening on port Im using piping version rc I think es provides a much more readable code This pull request is to allow specifying optionsfirstChar and optionsfilenameStarts partotherpart to include arbitrary names I personally use it like that firstChar null filenameStarts live in combination with webpack modulesDirectories when required files are specified like that import App from liveactivecomponentsappappjs if you use the debugger and piping cannot work How to solve I am getting following warning when use version piping rc possible EventEmitter memory leak detected listeners added Use emittersetMaxListeners to increase limit downgrade to and it solves the problem How can I get something like rubys pry V is a full rewrite in ES with a new mechanism for including piping in your code hooks for reloading events on both the supervisor and application process and a test suite
