Is there a functionpossibility to calculate D between datasets in CERR Eg two profiles If yes do they have to have identical resolution This fixes issue where radiopharma information is not exported or imported correctly in to planC This fix is critical for PET imaging PET DICOM export does not export radiopharma Information sequence As above sequence export has not been implemented Reverts cerrCERR Is there a function in CERR that could be used to extend the FOVCT dataset some distance from the border A design question why is the planC object a cell array instead of a struct Woudnt it be easier to do planSscan instead of planCindexSscan If there is a good reason perhaps it could be added to the wiki page on the PlanC object Im a chinese user forgive my poor english When I try to Import a series of DICOM files I get this output and error massage javaioIOException at sunawtimageGifImageDecoderreadHeaderGifImageDecoderjava at sunawtimageGifImageDecoderproduceImageGifImageDecoderjava at sunawtimageInputStreamImageSourcedoFetchInputStreamImageSourcejava at sunawtimageImageFetcherfetchloopImageFetcherjava at sunawtimageImageFetcherrunImageFetcherjava Reading header CERR DICOM Import has no methods defined for import into the planCindexSheadersponsorID field leaving empty CERR DICOM Import has no methods defined for import into the planCindexSheaderprotocolID field leaving empty CERR DICOM Import has no methods defined for import into the planCindexSheadersubjectID field leaving empty CERR DICOM Import has no methods defined for import into the planCindexSheadersubmissionID field leaving empty CERR DICOM Import has no methods defined for import into the planCindexSheadertimeSaved field leaving empty CERR DICOM Import has no methods defined for import into the planCindexSheaderlastSavedInVer field leaving empty CERR DICOM Import has no methods defined for import into the planCindexSheaderCERRImportVersion field leaving empty CERR DICOM Import has no methods defined for import into the planCindexSheaderanonymizedID field leaving empty Reading comment Reading scan Manufacturer populateplanCfield line manufacturer dataSscansAdded scanInfo DICOMHeadersManufacturer dcmdir planC line cellData populateplanCfieldcellNamesi dcmdirPATIENT CERRImportDCM CHE line planC dcmdir planCdcmdirSselected wy CERR line CERRImportDCM CHE UIControl Callback Dear Friends I am just trying to make a field box treatment plan I prepared using EGSnrc and imported all the beams firstly into seperate files and secondly into the same file Although I can see all beams individually I cannot merge them Would you please guide me with that Im using Matlab a Here is the error I get error
