Id like to filter a column by review requests to users only not teams For example Id like to show PRs that requested review from diegohaz with the option to exclude teams of which Im member The problem is that Im part of a team on whose review is always requested because its the owner of the codebase The repository has plenty of new PRs every day Its impossible to keep track so I ended up turning off the notifications on GitHub But that also means that I wont be notified when someone requests my review not my team It seems like I cant filter with multiple usersorgs Unsure if this is a feature request or a bug Currently its possible to zoom in by pressing kbdkbd kbdkbdkbdkbd But we have to press kbdShiftkbd in order to produce the kbdkbd character It took me some time to figure that out Most apps allow us to use kbdkbd kbdkbdkbdkbd instead console chmod x DevHub AppImage DevHub AppImage FATALsetuidsandboxhostcc The SUID sandbox helper binary was found but is not configured correctly Rather than run without sandboxing Im aborting now You need to make sure that tmpmountDevHubUcWLlFchromesandbox is owned by root and has mode trace trap DevHub AppImage Relates to My menubar is full Even with menubar mode turned off it still appears up there It should not force an icon up there It would be wonderful to list and manage Stars and Watches Eg look at all Starred repositories swipe left or right to unsubscribe etc From what I can tell most other apps that have similar funcitonality either dont do it well or dont do this at all Love the app thanks Hey guys Im really amazed at the brilliant product youre working on however theres a bug bothering me every time I start my OS up It resets to Sign in with Github mode and I should signin every time Not sure why its like that Feel free to ask for any information you to debug this Thank you bash OS Windows macOS Mojave Same problem DevHub version Some users have both their open github accounts and also work to a company that uses Github enterprise it would be great to aggregate both accounts into DevHub and better manage the flows from the different repos It wont start when I open it normally but Im getting this when I try to run devhub from the terminal A JavaScript error occurred in the main process Uncaught Exception Error EPERM operation not permitted chown homeiansnapdevhubx configdevhubconfigjson at ObjectchownSync fsjs at FunctionwriteFileSync as sync snapdevhubx resourcesappasarnodemoduleswritefileatomicindexjs at ElectronStoreset store as store snapdevhubx resourcesappasarnodemodulesconfindexjs at ElectronStoreset snapdevhubx resourcesappasarnodemodulesconfindexjs at init snapdevhubx resourcesappasardistindexjs at Objectanonymous snapdevhubx resourcesappasardistindexjs at Modulecompile internalmodulescjsloaderjs at ObjectModuleextensionsjs internalmodulescjsloaderjs at Moduleload internalmodulescjsloaderjs at tryModuleLoad internalmodulescjsloaderjs The primary goal is to increase user productivity so it can do everything inside the app instead of opening a new browser tab Open an issue close addremove labels assign read comments leave a comment etc The secondary goal is Growth Hacking GitHub will show the app name on each comment which will probably make more users discover the app
