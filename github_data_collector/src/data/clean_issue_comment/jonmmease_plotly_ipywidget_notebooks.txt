Hi Im trying to make an interactive map by Plotly I make a static map by scattermapbox successfully But I fell into trouble when I tried to add an interactive part I find Figurewidget but I dont know how to combine it with a map Is someone can help me or give me a demo Im very weak in this area Thankyou The notebook raises some exceptions Eg cell contourcolorscale Hot raises AttributeError colorscale Seems like the code uses outdated API and the requirements file does not pin explicit package versions When I execute the cells of the Interactipynb I get an exception after executing the last cell AttributeError Traceback most recent call last c users florian virtualenvs dataprocessingam qh p lib sitepackages ipywidgets widgets interactionpy in updateself args value widgetgetinteractvalue selfkwargs widgetkwarg value selfresult selffselfkwargs showinlinematplotlibplots if selfautodisplay and selfresult is not None ipythoninput f in updatea b color def updatea b colorblue with figbatchupdate scattxxs scattynpsinaxsb scattlinecolorcolor c users florian virtualenvs dataprocessingam qh p lib sitepackages plotly basedatatypespy in setattrself prop value else Raise error on unknown public properties raise AttributeErrorprop def getitemself prop AttributeError x Package versions ipywidgets numpy plotly Hello Unless error for my side FigureWidget does not work on google colab Have you any get around for that I ran the code from in jupyter lab It works fine I can mark the points and they change their color If close the the jupyter lab window and start it again I get the following error message in the anaconda prompt IPKernelApp WARNING No such comm f aced e d e ec e a da The error is not completely reproducable I ran one of the examples from the notebooks here yesterday and it worked yesterday but failed to run today I created a new notebook with the same example and again it worked but this time it kept working even after signing out and back into jupyter lab conda info gives the following active environment active env location C Users AppData Local Continuum anaconda envs kwenv shell level user config file C Users condarc populated config files C Users condarc conda version condabuild version python version final virtual packages base environment C Users AppData Local Continuum anaconda writable channel URLs package cache C Users AppData Local Continuum anaconda pkgs C Users conda pkgs C Users AppData Local conda conda pkgs envs directories C Users AppData Local Continuum anaconda envs C Users conda envs C Users AppData Local conda conda envs platform win useragent conda requests CPython Windows Windows administrator False netrc file None offline mode False Is this possible specifically I am interested in the interface at the bottom of the carsexploration notebook Can this be extracted from the Jupyter Notebook into a single page HTML file Thanks Is MB of images necessary to demonstrate plotly v Its a bit of a hassle to download such a large repo size just for a demo Id warn anyone about this repo size when recommending this demo FYI I run the carsexploration notebook In the display widget part I got the message no plot show up I followed up the README installed all the packages Thanks FigureWidget data mode markers type scattergl uid bac the same with pic show I copied the code as below and to understand what this project is doing It returned with errors when I run it But how do I view the plot import pandas as pd import numpy as np import os from ipywidgets import Image Layout HBox VBox import plotlygraphobjs as go from ipywidgets import HTML import plotlyplotly as py carsdf pdreadcsvdatacarscarscsv usecols City mpg Fuel Type Horsepower Model Year Torque Hybrid ID carsdfsample imagedata for imgfilename in oslistdirdatacarsimages modelyear imgfilenamesplit with opendatacarsimages AudiA jpg rb as f b fread imagedata modelyear b Imagevalueimagedata ChevroletCamaroCoupe fig goFigureWidget data dict typescattergl xcarsdf Torque ycarsdf City mpg modemarkers figlayouttitle Torque and Fuel Efficience figlayouttitlefontsize figlayouttitlefontfamily Rockwell figlayoutxaxistitle Torque footpounds figlayoutyaxistitle City MPG scatter figdata N lencarsdf scatterx scatterx nprandomrandN scattery scattery nprandomrandN scatteropacity figlayouthovermode closest Set to closest contour figaddhistogram dcontour xscatterx yscattery contourcolorscale Hot contourreversescale True contourhoverinfo skip scattertext carsdf ID scatterhoverinfo text details HTML def hoverfntrace points state ind pointspointinds detailsvalue carsdfiloc ind toframetohtml scatteronhoverhoverfn imagewidget Image valueimagedata ChevroletCamaroCoupe layoutLayoutheight px width px def hoverfntrace points state ind pointspointinds Update details HTML widget detailsvalue carsdfiloc ind toframetohtml Update image widget modelyear carsdf Model Year ind replace imagewidgetvalue imagedata modelyear scatteronhoverhoverfn VBox fig HBox imagewidget details
