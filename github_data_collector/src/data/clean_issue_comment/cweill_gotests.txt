Close What do you think about adding GOTESTSTEMPLATE and GOTESTSTEMPLATEDIR environment variables that corresponds to the template and templatedir options When working with different projects some might being using testing framework like some might not Having these environment variables available allows users to which between the template types easily especially when using it together with tool like that can loadunload environment variables depending on the working directory Maybe what we can do is allow user to set the template or templatedir values via both flags and environment variables with the value of the flag takes precedence over the one from environment variables I can create a PR if you think this is okay First of all very nice your project I would like to contribute too and I have some questions Do you have plans to generate the test cases too Would be difficult to do it Do you have plans to generate separated test functions instead of the table style i want to mock http should i import thirdpart package example gomock Can these tests be generated to be run in parallel Our team is currently having a discussion over underscores being present in the generated Tests for gotests These underscores appear to match the naming convention defined in but that convention implies that is for Examples only not Tests Wondering what discussion occurred that led to this convention in gotests applying for the generated Tests Wed love to know In Intellij Goland when I choose Generate tests for package I get this error gotests fatal error concurrent map writes then an infinite stack trace and then this other message created by githubcomcweillgotestsparallelize I dont really know if I m doing something wrong On installation I receive errors go get v githubcomcweillgotests golangorgxtoolsgointernalgcimporter golangorgxtoolsgointernalpackagesdriver golangorgxtoolsgointernalgcimporter golangorg x tools go internal gcimporter bexportgo objIsAlias undefined type typesTypeName has no field or method IsAlias golangorgxtoolsgointernalpackagesdriver golangorg x tools go internal packagesdriver sizesgo undefined typesSizesFor go env set GOARCHamd set GOBINC Users dcrouc go bin set GOEXEexe set GOHOSTARCHamd set GOHOSTOSwindows set GOOSwindows set GOPATHC Users dcrouc go set GORACE set GOROOTC Go set GOTOOLDIRC Go pkg tool windowsamd set GCCGOgccgo set CCgcc set GOGCCFLAGSm mthreads fmessagelength fdebugprefixmapC Users dcrouc AppData Local Temp gobuild tmpgobuild gnorecordgccswitches set CXXg set CGOENABLED set PKGCONFIGpkgconfig set CGOCFLAGSICOracleInstantClientinstantclient sdkinclude set CGOCPPFLAGS set CGOCXXFLAGSg O set CGOFFLAGSg O set CGOLDFLAGSLCOracleInstantClientinstantclient loci is more usefull then reflectDeepEqual I changed reflectDeepEqual to cmpEqual and add to tErrorf cmpDiff for more detailed view of diff between got and want for exmaple how it looks like RUN TestAddress addressResultSlicetwodiffaddr FAIL TestAddress addressResultSlicetwodiffaddr s helperstestgo Address addressResultSlice addressUIDololo addressUIDtrololo want addressUIDololo addressUIDtrololo diff addressapiAddressResult Precision sother Address sUIDololo Address sUIDololo Distance identical fields Address sUIDtrololo FAIL
