If you use a link with space e g path to file folder on the filesystem or the file or foldername then you must mask the spaces with Example in Windows Path C Program Files x Internet Explorer iexploreexe In Markdown Syntax Start Internet Explorer CProgram Files x Internet Exploreriexploreexe When i try opening mindforger with the current directory using the command mindforgerexe I get an error saying Unknown option disablewebsecurity OS Windows However opening mindforger without any args works correctly Thanks for Mindforger have it installed here for some time but did not really start using it much today looked a bit again and discovered how useful it could be if knowledge graph navigator could be navigated using single keys az if you know Vimperator a firefox plugin hitting f there gives you a list of choices hitting those keys will just navigate there Something like this here could be great if not too difficult Just wanted to share this idea quickly here Thanks for the great work will check it from time to time always As a side note I am not much md user instead orgmode user with org files but it is possible to export them as md then I can continue with MindForger An internal org to md converter inside MindForger could be interesting maybe as well from my point then I can forget the inbetween converting step because editing those in MindForger would have side effects thus I would never edit in MindForger if you do not want to add one more problem to your chain Anyway to increase the global fontsize for the application in windows The only option available is to edit the html fontsize When I create a repository using Linux or Mac I use google drive to sync between devices I cant read it when I use my windows laptop My guess is that is something related to filenames or paths I can use without problems in both Linux and Mac machines Since Notes are already represented by hashsections it would be nice if one would be able to split a toolargenote into subnotes by adding additional lines prepended by and then saving the changes Currently this only spaceindents these lines to avoid parsing errors Its difficult to change the note name field with the keyboard also a changed name is only updated when clicking Remember not when using kbdCtrlSkbd In most Markdown renderers the firstlevel section maps to a h html element which by htmlspec should only be present once and usually also is a document title Since the h Section is easier to edit together with the other text Id suggest using the first h of each saved document as its title For document renaming a link replace mechanism to avoid broken links in other documents might be necessary either way otherwise the names will start to differ from the contents as the users will avoid renaming notes even when changing their contents The documentation mentions a Markdown Preview but I can only find the view and edit modes A preview of the note currently being edited as a sidebysideview like hackmdio for example would be nice For long notes a scroll synchronization mechanism might be necessary Lists and code excerpts in markdown rely on indentation which can profit from two features a Keep Indent When starting a new line the new line should begin with the same indent as the first line above that contains text This avoids the need to reindent each line manually b Indent Refactoring To refactor lists a user usually needs to deindent the code in the list levels below usually via kbdTabkbdkbdShiftTabkbd on marked text in most IDEs Currently this just replaces the marked text with a tab A dark theme for the markdown renderer would be nice
