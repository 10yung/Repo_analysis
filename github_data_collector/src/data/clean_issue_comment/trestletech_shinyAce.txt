We have noticed a change in behaviour when using shinyAce in a module and would like to know if this is a bug or a change in behaviour that we can rely on in future versions This code r modui functionid ns shinyNSid shinyAceaceEditornseditor mode r readOnly TRUE modserver functioninput output session code a nb shinyAceupdateAceEditorsession sessionnseditor code ui function shinyshinyUImoduimy server functioninput output session mod callModulemodserver my shinyshinyAppui server in versions and below will display lines of code In it displays nothing no call to updateAceEditor in this fashion works If that line is changed to shinyAceupdateAceEditorsession editor code ie dropping the ns then the code is displayed in versions and not in This is with shiny and R Is there a possibility to include custom made modes within the package I noticed that instwwwace includes all the available modes for the different languages I can imagine that if I place my custom mode in here and built the package it would be accessible by aceEditor I am not sure if it would be this simple If it is it is still not preferable because it would require to make the package myself It would be easier to use the CRAN version and for instance reference the mode file in the function Could you please advise what possibilities there are Im currently working on a rmarkdown editor with instant preview using shinyAce code at swarmlabeditR It works great and it is very easy to set up Thank you for this My problem is that if I use aceEditor in markdown mode R code chunks dont get syntax highlighting or automated indentation like RStudio does for instance Do you plan on creating a rmarkdown or knitr mode for shinyAce or for Ace more generally I just noticed the link below Looks awesome Just though I would mention it
