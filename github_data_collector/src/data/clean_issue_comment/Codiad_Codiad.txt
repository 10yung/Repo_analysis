I have been a long time user of Codiad and I love it especially when combined with CodeGit However I have stumbled into a potential security issue I have setup external LDAP authentication to protect my instance of Codiad However irrespective of which authentication source is used it only protects Codiads files This authentication mechanism does not protect the project files in the workspaces I have tried to access some of my projects PHP scripts in the workspace area BASEPATHworkspacemyprojectexamplephp and they work without having to login using Codiads login page Is this by design Shouldnt the workspaces and projects be secured with Codiads securitylogin mechanisms After all they reside within Codiad Is there something Im missing Screenshot com android chrome Screenshot com android chrome You can see above two images i am using codiad ide in android chrome when I open settings tab the dialog box doesnt fit screen i tried it in desktop site mode also the server is running in termuxandroid terminal In the download of Codiadv zip PHP Backdown in Github hosted webapp Codiadv zip download Windows Security detected BackdoorPHPYorcirekriksengE in file componentsprojectclassprojectphp Installed Codiad via cPanel Open up Codiad and login I cant even create a new file Its just stuck loading Any help Dear Sir or Madam In the course of an ongoing penetration test of your application Codiad our security analysts have discovered a previously unknown vulnerability We would be happy to discuss the vulnerability with a suitable contact person contributing on this project in order to enable you to close it Please let us know with whom we best discuss the next steps We would also be happy to explain our approach to this case which is based on our Responsible Disclosure Policy to you over the phone Thank you in advance and kind regards usd responsible disclosure team About usd AG usd AG protects companies from hackers and criminals As an accredited auditor we consult and certify companies worldwide Our work is as dynamic and diverse as current threats We review IT systems applications and processes for security vulnerabilities and help with their mitigation With our Security Trainings we raise security awareness the CST Academy promotes an active dialogue and a transfer of knowledge wwwusdde more security usd Registered office NeuIsenburg Local court of Offenbach HRB Board of directors Andreas Duchmann Manfred Tubach CEO Chairman supervisory board Dr Dietmar Kirchner VAT ID DE The default installation on Termux complained that mbord and mbchr were already defined and the error prevented normal operations like listing of files inside s project or adding a new file So I incapsulated definitions of mbord and mbchr into a iffunctionexists to avoid the error when they are already defined Modifications has no effect on existing code if those functions are not defined Hi i hope there is anybody still here for helping I got a the login screen with empty textboxes after login with right userpassword combination With wrong combination i got an error that there is an incorrect username or password I added inisetdisplayerrors in configphp and there was a warning with permission to varlibphp session so i could fix it but the error still is there I think there is a config error CONFIG inisetdisplayerrors PATH TO CODIAD defineBASEPATH varwwwhtmlcodiad BASE URL TO CODIAD without trailing slash defineBASEURL mypublicdnsamazonawscom THEME default modern or clear look at themes defineTHEME default ABSOLUTE PATH this is used as whitelist for absolute path projects defineWHITEPATHS BASEPATH home Hi I installed a fresh version of codiad on a Ubuntu system after the guide in the wiki I can access codiad but if I create a project theres an invinite load loop in the upper left corner of at the Explore I dont see any coding screen nothing Di I really just need apache and php Dont I need something like python or such stuff Is python auto complete and syntax check supported on codiad I cannot save the file let say if i have a file like this demophp and when i try to save the below code it gives Fobidden error php path POST path but if i replaced the POST with REQUEST then it saves the file otherwise it gives Fobidden error
