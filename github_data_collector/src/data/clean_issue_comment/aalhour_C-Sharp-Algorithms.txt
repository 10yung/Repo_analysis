I dont see any implementations for prime number generators For starters how about Linear prime sieve Id like to see that added to the library I was surprised to see a BinaryTreeMap and a RedBlackTreeMap but no AVLTreeMap given the fact that there is an AVLTree implementation in the library For the sake of completion Id like to see an AVLTreeMap added looks not any bitmap in this repo plan for RoaringBitmap support FindGCD is not working as expectedIt runs as infinite loop if I try to find a GCD of with value of r everytime steps to reproduce Write a loop from to each time add a random int to the max heap In theory it takes very little timeNlogN N sec but the program does take a long time Iv also tested the BinaryHeap in it performs well so it is probably due to the bad algorithm Original implementation only supports long as edge weights This PR allows customized edge weight types while keeps default edge weight type as longInt Hi Are there any plans to migrate this project to net standard andor have a nuget package int midIndex collectionCount var leftCollection collectionGetRangestartIndex midIndex var rightCollection collectionGetRangemidIndex endIndex midIndex leftCollection InternalMergeSortTleftCollection leftCollectionCount comparer rightCollection InternalMergeSortTrightCollection rightCollectionCount comparer No need to invoke GetRange as it copies the data and consumes extra memory Passing StartIndex EndIndex along with the original array should be sufficient Dont you think so
