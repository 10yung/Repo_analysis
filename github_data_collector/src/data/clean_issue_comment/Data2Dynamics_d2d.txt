Hi Im unable to load any model file due to a Parsing error Im using a trial version of Matlab R b with optimisation and symbolic toolbox Thanks for your help Romain clear all arInit Data Dynamics Software arFramework defversion cversion code b Website Contact Andreas Raue andreasrauefdmunifreiburgde Copyright D D Development Team All rights reserved Clearing old D D mex files from memory OK arLoadModelABCmodel loading model from file ModelsABCmodeldef ans Error using arParsingError line Parsing error in REACTIONS at p Astate in model in ABCmodeldef Error in arLoadModel line arParsingError fid Parsing error in REACTIONS at s in model d str m There is some code smell in arLink There are several arguments for adding temporary data points here specifically for arPPL The datapoints added here are hardcoded to go into the ppl substruct This should really be refactored to use arAddData instead Tasks Develop test for arPPL Refactor arLink and arPPL to separate concerns If I load a model in which I never did a multistart optimization the arps struct does not exist same for archi s Then if I call arMergeFits it checks for existence of arps in the empty model which does not exist And I am not able to load the results from already existing multistarts This is an example of my code clear all close all clc loadmodelnamematar this is the empty model arMergeFits some plotting Is there a way I can circumvent this problem It seems that arconfiguseSparseJac is set to in arCompileAll in paricular cases Theres already a default for useSparseJac in arInitFields which is Ive reversed the logic in commit db e c fb c fadf f a c a b since it seems strange to use a sparse jac when you set the flag to I have a model where if useSparseJac is set to one the model crashes including MATLAB The error I see in the terminal is Error in usrlocalMATLABR abinglnxa MATLAB realloc invalid next size x fb cd In MATLAB the following is displayed when simulating with full error info Example case where it happens here crashcasezip Dear d d developers I would like to know if d d as been used or adapted to calibration of neuromusculoskeletal model There are many muscle properties and your tool may be valuable Regards Mickael Hi my model contain more than ODEs and it take a long time to load it Is there any way to make it fasterfor example parallel pool Thank you very much SBML models with nonconstant compartments cannot be imported in d d This is a problem with the SBML importer and SBML support in D D This was originally reported in An example model is attached limaxpkpd xmlzip Trying to load the model with arImportSBMLlimaxpkpd xml Results in the following message Specified tEnd Level packages detected Information WILL be lost Error using arImportSBML line nonconstant compartments are not yet supported in D D Best Matthias Could you tell me please why the last lines of the code in this function are commented In the model I work with there are some reactions with only a product A and for import to work I had to uncomment this part For PREDICTOR and COMPARTMENTS sections units werent imported There is nothing in mcompartmentjunits but there is information in munitDefinition Can this be used Best regards Polina
