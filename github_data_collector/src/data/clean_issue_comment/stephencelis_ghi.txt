I spent some time reading through color settings tmux configuration the issues here on github and in the wiki and I still can not get nice output Command ghi list on Ubuntu in bash tmux I see green color first while ghi is processing but can not read that message as it disappears fast the terminal blanks and shows the list in between ESC sequences I press q to close the view the list disappears not what I want my cursor is at the wrong position newline missing That should really not cause users headaches Id suggest a feature to simply disable all this fancy color stuff Or whatever is the easiest way to resolve these troubles once and for all img width altScreen Shot at PM src Why does it occasionally say this when I add an issue ghi list includes repository names while ghi list v doesnt Is this intended Thanks ghi list slarsarleetcodesolutions open issues Traceback most recent call last from usrbinghi in main from usrbinghi in execute from usrbinghi in execute from usrbinghi

ghi edit H Invalid request For propertiesissue is not an integer This error still occurs just after doing brew update ghi just now Let me know what other diagnostics I can provide I was stuck in a loop of security SecKeychainSearchCopyNext The specified item could not be found in the keychain similarly to what was described in The issue was that another tool fue also wants to store a password in the keychain and the latter doesnt support multiple labels for the same website Repro To reproduce the problem do security addinternetpassword a your username s githubcom l Whatever security addinternetpassword a dblock s githubcom l Whatever security addinternetpassword a dblock s githubcom l Whatever ghi config auth Enter dblocks GitHub password never stored security SecKeychainSearchCopyNext The specified item could not be found in the keychain Twofactor authentication code Token saved to keychain ghi list fatal local can only be used inside a git repository security SecKeychainSearchCopyNext The specified item could not be found in the keychain Authorization required Please run ghi config auth username Why does this happen Lets store a password security addinternetpassword a dblock s dblockorg l Label security addinternetpassword a dblock s dblockorg l Label security SecKeychainAddInternetPassword NULL The specified item already exists in the keychain Now find it security findinternetpassword a dblock s dblockorg l Label w security findinternetpassword a dblock s dblockorg l Label w security SecKeychainSearchCopyNext The specified item could not be found in the keychain security findinternetpassword a dblock s dblockorg l w security SecKeychainSearchCopyNext The specified item could not be found in the keychain This makes it impossible for separate tools to store different passwords for githubcom Workaround if you use fue Delete the fue token from OSX keychain Configure GHI with ghi config auth Fue will work too because it looks for a password without a label Whats next One improvement would be that ghi doesnt look for the password using a label This way it will find any password for githubcom Thats what fue does but its far from ideal since the token required for ghi needs write permissions fue is read only and needs the least privilege so any token will work So I am not sure what the best way to fix this is I wrote fue so it could get out of the way but its not really a general solution
