Hello This is not an issue I have been looking around for a Comment Section to no avail I just tested this Lite Version and I like the idea of being focused on Privacy it has a nice UI and I can see the quality work that was put in place to have this done I note you said that this is not PECR compliant Which would cause user privacy concerns as this uses an unknown cookie Are you able to say when this will be addressed as I would really like to start using this in production I am running an ECommerce Store and I want to make sure that privacy is key and I stopped using G Analytics when I saw this system that is how serious I am about Protecting User Data As I said I am not sure if this is the right place to post this I am a bit new to GitHub and its usage Thanks Im running a selfhosted instance of Fathom using the usefathomfathomlatest image together with a PostgreSQL DB using the postgres alpine image Since days ago the Fathom UI shows no metrics and my logs are FULL of errors like this ERROR syntax error at or near x hxddo LOADSOFOMITTEDIDS With a query so long it doesnt fit in a single line of logs which appears to be caused by a huge list of IDs The statements connected to this error appears to be this sql DELETE FROM pageviews WHERE id INLOADSOFOMITTEDIDS One thing I noticed that one of the IDs repeats itself over and over again The log file from just today is roughly GB already Would be great to link a goal to a page so a conversion rate could be calculated ie goalspageviews Would also be good to have funnels I like the way Fullstory does funnels you just select a list of pages or goals I suppose According to all documentation I can find nostore is the strongest do not cache CacheControl header there is and nocache and mustrevalidate are strictly weaker and will have no effect when nostore is present Additionally I cannot find any evidence that these other values are useful for backwards compatibility or older browsers and nostore support appears to be universal Lastly webhintio is specifically telling me that I should not use mustrevalidate This fixes Remove broken link to DO docs removed in Im hosting fathom myself on a docker container and I see in the dashboard that its captured some requests from localhost Probably my own activity during development Is there a way to blacklist localhost or any other specific host I did go over some of the other issues and commits that seem to address this but they dont seem to have applied in my case or no longer work Would it be possible for the WordPress plugin to detect logged in admin accounts and not track those hits from displaying in Fathom Maybe even have options to pick which user levels arearent tracked Thanks I am using dockercompose and traefik to run fathom my dockercomposeyml yml version networks web external true services fathom restart always image usefathomfathomlatest ports environment FATHOMSERVERADDR FATHOMGZIPtrue FATHOMDEBUGfalse FATHOMDATABASEDRIVERpostgres FATHOMDATABASEURLpostgresqlpostrgressuserpostgresspasswddbondigitaloceancom fathomsslmoderequire FATHOMSECRETasecretkey networks web containername fathom labels traefikdockernetworkweb traefikenabletrue traefikfrontendruleHostfathommydomaincomwwwfathommydomaincom traefikport traefikbackendfathomanalytics when I run dockercompose up I get this sh Starting fathom done Attaching to fathom fathom time T Z levelinfo msgFathom version gb commit b fed b c b a a b built at fathom time T Z levelwarning msgError reading configuration File env does not exist fathom time T Z levelinfo msgConnected to postgres database fathomdb which is weird be cause I do have a env file yaml FATHOMSERVERADDR FATHOMGZIPtrue FATHOMDEBUGfalse FATHOMDATABASEDRIVERpostgres FATHOMDATABASEURLpostgresqlpostrgressuserpostgresspasswddbondigitaloceancom fathomsslmoderequire FATHOMSECRETasecretkey So I ran dockercompose up d and after it finished I ran docker exec fathom fathom confighomedocfathomenv server and I got this sh time T Z levelinfo msgFathom version gb commit b fed b c b a a b built at time T Z levelwarning msgError reading configuration File homedocfathomenv does not exist time T Z levelinfo msgConnected to postgres database fathomdb time T Z levelfatal msglisten tcp bind address already in use Am I doing something wrong here Greetings fellows thank you for a nice OSS project I am setting it up and noticed a small issue in Heroku setup docs This PR is fixing it Best Rust
