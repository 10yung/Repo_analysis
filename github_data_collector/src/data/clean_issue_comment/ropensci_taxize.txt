I was experiencing some weird behavior in the package taxlist and realized it is coming from taxize Im importing the function tnrs into taxlist Each time I load the package in an RSession the objects data frames apgfamilies apgorders rankref and theplantlist get automatically loaded in the workspace The same happens either loading taxlist or taxize with the function library Hello I have a list of species about that I want to verify synonyms spelling recent names etc of which here is a subset data cAbalistes stellatus Abudefduf abdominalis Abudefduf bengalensis Abudefduf concolor Abudefduf conformis Abudefduf luridus Abudefduf notatus Abudefduf saxatilis Abudefduf septemfasciatus Abudefduf sexfasciatus Abudefduf sordidus Abudefduf sparoides Abudefduf troschelii Abudefduf vaigiensis Abudefduf whitleyi Acanthaluteres brownii Acanthaluteres spilomelanurus Acanthaluteres vittiger Acanthemblemaria crockeri Acanthemblemaria hancocki Acanthemblemaria spinosa Acanthistius cinctus Acanthistius ocellatus Acanthistius pardalotus Acanthistius patachonicus Acanthistius sebastoides Acanthistius serratus Acanthochromis polyacanthus Acanthopagrus australis Acanthopagrus latus Acanthostracion polygonius Acanthostracion quadricornis Acanthurus achilles Acanthurus albipectoralis Acanthurus auranticavus Acanthurus bahianus Acanthurus bariene Acanthurus blochii Acanthurus chirurgus Acanthurus coeruleus Acanthurus dussumieri Acanthurus fowleri Acanthurus gahhm Acanthurus grammoptilus Acanthurus guttatus Acanthurus leucocheilus Acanthurus leucopareius Acanthurus leucosternon Acanthurus lineatus Acanthurus maculiceps I search corresponding names in the COL Catalogue of Life database with the following function checkspname functionsplist takes a list of species name that we want to check verifiednames c for i in lengthsplist x NA x colsearchname splist i x x if nrowx verifiednames appendverifiednames Non observation else if sumxstatus accepted name y xname xstatus accepted name xrank species else if sumxstatus synonym y xaccname xstatus synonym xrank species else if sumxstatus provisionally accepted name y xname xstatus provisionally accepted name xrank species y ifelselengthy infraspecies y y ifelselengthy y y splist i y verifiednames appendverifiednames y list of verified species names printi verifiedinputs dataframeinputnames splist outputnames verifiednames returnverifiedinputs The problem is Yesterday I tried the code and everything went fine but this morning while I did change anything I got this error Error in if nrowx argument is of length zero In addition Warning message COL taxon not found I tried the line that fills x alone and it worked In addition the error doesnt occur at the same iteration each time Ive been struggling with this all day One hypothesis I have is that the COL website isnt stable right now Indeed a message is displayed on the front page Can it be why I get this error Does someone have an idea to bypass it Also I have to mention that I tried using the GBIF database but it is not as uptodate as COL is See pkgdown site Hi the French Taxonomical Reference has a nice REST API detailed here and were currently building the taxref package to make the data easily accessible We were thinking that it would be a good addition to taxize sources Im planning to submit a PR to taxize with specific gettaxref functions that would use the rtaxref package as soon as it hits CRAN we would also like to submit rtaxref to rOpenSci xml update docs in pkg to remove api key needed for EOL check to make sure thats true building on article code used classification article code used classification article code dont see any taxize code here article code used classification article code in SI in file scriptsheatmapR in the zip file used classification class tree article code used classification article code used classification article code no code but mentioned in text used classification
