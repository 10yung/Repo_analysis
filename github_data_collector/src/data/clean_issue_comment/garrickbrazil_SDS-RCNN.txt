I run the original code in your github but the MR is worse than the result on your paper RPN only BCN How can I get the same result in your paper garrickbrazil Is the cropped proposals as the inputs of BCN right In SDSRCNNexperimentstestrcnnm I am confused the operation at th line and th line The code is shown as below I think wh should be added twice of whrcnnconfpadfactor Can someone tell me which operation is true x x wrcnnconfpadfactor impadW y y hrcnnconfpadfactor impadH w w wrcnnconfpadfactor h h hrcnnconfpadfactor I finished the Setup by following your instruction When I tried to train the model I encountered the problem as below Preloaded imdb train done Computing roidb train Reference to nonexistent field sizes Error in roidbgenerate line height imdbsizes Error in trainrpn line roidbtrain roidbgenerateimdbtrain false rpnconfcachedir rpnconfdatasettrain rpnconfmingtheight Error in trainall line outjargin trainrpnrpnconfig gpuid Could you give me some suggestions to solve the problem Hi We are trying to implement your code We use the Caffe compiled from githubcomBVLCcaffetreewindows branch However Matlab freezes in training section in trainallrpnconfig rcnnconfig gpuid function In readme file of the project it is written that modified version of Caffe v was used In windows we cannot build your modified Caffe that provided in project files Could you write the modified part or files of Caffe so that we can change the files in BVLCcaffetreewindows and compile them Best regards Hello I would like to change the RPN and BCN feature encore from vgg to resnet I would like to know how you train the pretrainedvgg caffe model Would you give me any advice Thanks in advance Ukhu Hello I was wondering if the modifications you added for caffe are impacting these tests screenshot from Because I got these failed tests Thanks in advance Hi thank you for sharing your code It is a great job I want to know which type of solver is used to achieve the good performance in your paper SGD or ADAM I use SGD but cannot produce as the same good results as you did The final MR rate is on Caltech dataset Hello garrickbrazil I using a new dataset to train and do not change any parameters Train rpn part is completed The validation result shown in the following image the MR of val is but the MR of final test is Do you know what is the problem Hope your prompt reply thank you very much
