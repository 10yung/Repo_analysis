Right now displaypage is based on the text and that isnt always unique This should be modified so you can use the tab names or something else that may be unique Function sbaddsnippets throws an error Error in if res argument is of zero length I changed the syntax and was able to add the snippets Put the GA token in siteyml In many situations a page consists of standalone submodules that are assembled as a combination of tabs and rows This can be made easier by extending the API of satin yaml text Item menu text Sub Item module tabs text Tab module tab id tab text Tab module tab In this case moduletabs is a satin module that accepts a list of modules and turns them into tabs on a page modulerows would turn a list of modules into rows The advantage of this approach is consistency and the ability for users to define custom higherlevel modules to aggregate submodules It does introduce an extra layer of nesting which might be annoying but I think consistency scores higher than the annoyance introduced by a little nesting You could wrap the server function in a safely If the condition doesnt evaluate to TRUE this removes it from both the UI and module levels as a preprocessing step For instance this is useful for hiding a section of the page on main so that it can be evaluated and discussed on staging without fear of it getting released and shown to users In our case we could add this to any tab at either the sidebar or the tab level condition expr SysgetenvSHINYSERVER grepldatacampdashboards getwd Of course this would eventually be something more like notprod
