to reproduce and a minimal demo of the problem Go to getting started link or go to the docs website and click getting started Hi Please help with this issue During zoom markers disappear Chrome Safari I first encountered Angular less than a week ago so first of all I would like to apologize if this turns out to be not an issue but rather a misunderstanding on my side That being said Issue description As described in the heading it seems that the observable returned by AgmGeocodergeocoderequest GeocoderRequest does not complete so eg for geocoder some instance of AgmGeocoder and request some GeocoderRequest the Promise gecodergeocoderequesttoPromise will never resolve Steps to reproduce and a minimal demo of the problem The following slight modification in geocoderservicespects will cause a test failure as the complete spy is never called itshould emit a geocode result fakeAsync const success jestfn const complete jestfn added const geocodeRequest address Mountain View California

geocoderServicegeocodegeocodeRequestsubscribesuccess undefined complete tick expectsuccesstoHaveBeenCalledTimes expectsuccesstoHaveBeenCalledWithgeocodeExampleResponse expectgeocodeMocktoHaveBeenCalledTimes expectcompletetoHaveBeenCalledTimes added discardPeriodicTasks Expecteddesired behavior As said in the beginning I might be completely off here but I would have expected completion at this point ie something like the following in the AgmGeocoder constructor constructorloader MapsAPILoader const connectableGeocoder new Observablesubscriber loaderloadthen

subscribed till application exits thisgeocoder connectableGeocoder So the first time click on a marker on the map the map zoom in on that marker with desired zoom value If i use scrollwheel on mouse to scroll out and then try to click on a marker again the map does not zoom in to my desired value Is this a bug or something i do wrong Stackbliz Code below agmmap idmap latitude lat longitude lng

in GoogleMap interface that should be available according to Missing methods getClickableIcons boolean getDiv Element getHeading number getProjection Projection getStreetView StreetViewPanorama getTilt number setClickableIconsvalue boolean void setHeadingheading number void setMapTypeIdmapTypeId MapTypeId string void setStreetViewpanorama StreetViewPanorama void setTilttilt number void Current behavior Some of methods are missing Expecteddesired behavior All methods should be included in GoogleMap interface according to Google documentation Other information I am using getDiv method and it is working correctly but I got type errors LatLngBoundscontains method can accept either a LatLng or a LatLngLiteral make noncore modules depend on core version not beta add GoogleMap to default exports fixes Hello Im opening this issue as requested in Issue description Providing an API key asynchronously has been possible for years weve been using it from to beta It is required when for example the API key comes from a remote config file Version removed this ability Steps to reproduce the problem Use any agmcore version from to below it works ts import LAZYMAPSAPICONFIG LazyMapsAPILoaderConfigLiteral from agmcoreservices import config from config InjectableprovidedIn forwardRef CustomerModule export class GoogleMapsConfig implements LazyMapsAPILoaderConfigLiteral apiKey string configgmapsApiKey NgModule imports AgmCoreModuleforRoot providers provide LAZYMAPSAPICONFIG useClass GoogleMapsConfig export class CustomerModule Update to agmcore version it starts failing with LAZYMAPSAPICONFIG is not initialized Alternatives Use angulargooglemaps Other information Any of these would be helpful Restoring the feature Implementing an equivalent feature Pointers or instructions of how to implement it if wed like to make a PR Thanks
