at version I use LottieAnimationView to playAnimation in ListViewAdapter but found it cannot playThen I traced the source code and found that it is because in the latest version of playAnimation there is a condition that isShown must be true but in the items in listView the isShown of all views is false so there is no method called I faced with growing memory consumption like it was described here Lg G with Android Lottie version Sony xz Compact with Android everything is fine I have render bug on some animations its looks like black silhouette lottie lib version tested on various android devices version and sample json files QtPonies zip Checklist I think this animations doesnt use any unsupported features because this animations shows properly on telegram and the site lottiefilescompreviewtelegram lottiefilescompreviewtelegram says me that Your Sticker meets all Telegram Sticker Requirements I dont know what part of my animation doesnt work I have no sources AEP files Only what I know is that this animations generated automatically from gif files by some python library and this json files have big size around mb I know several telegram stickersets that are have render bug with this library Screenshots and how it should look original Animation object dont rotate properly for example check this animation when i use this in my android project the fish shows up but it do not rotate and it move while its fixIm using version Fixes Fixes If you dont use this template your issue will be closed Checklist My animation doesnt use any unsupported features I know what part of my animation doesnt work I have created a simplified version of my animation I have attached the AEP file as a zip file so it can be attached that only has the part of the animation that doesnt work Describe the bug I have used simple text to write a single line and multiple line demo for text animation but is that problem to display with given alignment like center left right position also text of Xposition is perfect but Yposition is not displayed properly What version of Lottie did you test this on What version of Android did you test this on All Android OS Steps To

versions since Aep files animation aepzip animation aepzip Animation is not fully displayed on android devices but on iOs and online preview the same animation works greate This is expected animation animation but on android it looks like this Thanks in advance Describe the bug I have project a mobile app for which I recently created a download screen animation In ios everything works as it should and in android there were problems with one of the elements of animation The animation contains a pattern that should be smoothly shaded in blue All design consists of a pattern and a blue circle the pattern is a mask for a circle the circle increases from to for several seconds and this blue pattern has to be visible until the end of animation The pattern I drew in Illustrator and exported to after effects there created a blue circle for which the pattern made a mask As a result after exporting the json file the pattern begins to paint blue and is interrupted on the middle of the animation just disappearing For the experiment I created arbitrary figures and red circle arbitrary figures I made mask for red circle and after rendering these figures are painted red as I need to In animation I used Alpha Matte to create a mask I checked supported features Alpha Matte is supported I think the problem is the pattern but I don t know what s wrong with it please tell me In all animation I have such patterns this one works quite badly and the other little Help us find a solution The question is why does the pattern disappear on half the animation and the arbitrary figures drawn in after effects work normally I attached the file source after effects json file and video as the animation should work and how it works on android samsung galaxy s Please respond as soon as possible because in a few days launch the application in the play market Thank you What version of Lottie did you test this on Version What version of Android did you test this on Steps To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Download json file to android phone Watch the animation interrupt Screenshots Ae json and video This has been happening for a little while for us apparently but we dont get crash logs reported from it since the crash seems to be occurring in native code It happens on the latest version of Lottie and previous ones We have an an animation that causes our app to crash whenever we play it forward or backward It only crashes on devices running pre and post including xx are fine Heres what Im seeing in the Logcat Alibc Fatal signal SIGSEGV code fault addr x in tid RenderThread pid tid
