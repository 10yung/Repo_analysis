In distribution I found Python package I followed the readme file and can import covareppy package may I know how to use it That is how can I obtain the features with a wav file Many thanks in advance The executable file of covarepstandalone which is in the directory for redistribution purposes only is not functioning I have setup all the prerequisites When I ran the application it shows the image for a while and then the application closes Also a suggestion to add atleast one example of the usage of a function Im trying to extract the Sadjadi features in Python While training a DNN everything except HPS makes loss nan The network doesnt learn anything Here is the code def sadjadifeataudio fs winl intfs hopsize intfs win hanningwinl corrwin npcorrelatewin win full start stopwinl ind harm clarity lperr hps try while stoplenaudio seg audio startstop seg segwin rxx npcorrelateseg seg fullcorrwin rxx rxx npisnanrxx lmin roundfs lmax roundfs vec rxx lminlmax maxitmp positmp vecmax vecargmax harmappendnplog absmaxitmprxx maxitmp dxx npsqrt absrxx rxx vec dxx lminlmax minitmp npminvec maxitmp npmaxvec clarityappend minitmpmaxitmp a e lpcseg True e npvare lperrappendnplogabsrxx e xspec fftseg xspec nplog absxspec lmin round fs lmax round fs vectmp nparray for kk in rangelmin lmax inds nparray kk s xspec inds sum vectmp npappendvectmp s axis kk nparray nparangelmin lmax hrm nparray inds hrmkk vals xspec inds vectmp npsumvals axis hpsappendvectmpmax start hopsize stop hopsize ind return nparray nparrayharmconjT nparrayclarityconjT nparraylperrconjT nparrayhpsconjT except return I am trying to set the window and shift I believe I could just change the window via the sample rate but how do i change the shift Im using covarepfeatureextractionCOVAREPfeatureextractionm We are using MATLAB We got an error at enframe function We have also run it in MATLAB Here it says that enframe function will not accept double arguments Please help us out Hi Im trying to run COVAREPfeatureextractionm on octave but Im getting an error I dont understand It breaks on line which is GCI gcisedreamsxfsF med SEDREAMS GCI detection under F GCI detection octave warningoffalladdpathhomerosannaprogramscovarepcovarepstartupindir homerosannadataongridenterfacewavsamplerate octave COVAREPfeatureextractionindirsamplerate Analysing file ent p s fe error concatenation operator not implemented for matrix by scalar struct operations error called from COVAREPfeatureextraction at line column and inside glottalsourcegcisedreamsm I have traced the error to line PotMaxis findpeaksMeanBasedSignal With something not being implemented I wonder if Im missing a package Heres the list of what I have installed octave pkg list Package Name Version Installation directory control usrshareoctavepackagescontrol general homerosannaoctavegeneral io homerosannaoctaveio nan homerosannaoctavenan optim homerosannaoctaveoptim signal homerosannaoctavesignal statistics homerosannaoctavestatistics struct homerosannaoctavestruct tsa homerosannaoctavetsa To get to this point I had to remove getReport error getReport undefined near line column error called from COVAREPfeatureextraction at line column I changed warning An error occurred while analysing basename getReporterr to warning An error occurred while analysing basename err So perhaps thats affected the error message I receive But also I had to remove externalbackcompatibility audioreadm for this to run else I had the same error as above but at line instead when reading the audio xfs audioread indir filesep basename wav error concatenation operator not implemented for matrix by scalar struct operations error called from COVAREPfeatureextraction at line column I have tried with different audio files from different datasets but I have the same error at the same point Thanks for any help you can give me line in COVAREPfeatureextractionm looks strange to me srhf srhf Shouldnt it be something like srhf srhf F min F min F min is set to in COVAREPfeatureextraction Avec remerciement a lIrcam et au projet Chanter Avec remerciement a lIrcam et au projet Chanter
