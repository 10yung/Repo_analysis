Comments on sampling from either prior during testing or the posterior during training are swapped Note that targets contain contexts by design is this is referring to how the latent encoder had previously been run on the contexts rather than the targets themselves actually containing contexts Thanks When I run the attentiveneuralprocessipynb I got the mistakes as follows ValueError Variable layer kernel already exists disallowed Did you mean to set reuseTrue or reusetfAUTOREUSE in VarScope Originally defined at File ipythoninput f c line in batchmlp output outputsizes namelayerformati File ipythoninput a e a line in call hidden batchmlpencoderinput selfoutputsizes latentencoder File ipythoninput a fa line in call prior selflatentencodercontextx contexty Hello I dont know if this is the right forum to ask Is there a available demo on the oneshot classification using the Omniglot dataset presented in section of the paper I am unable to understand how you combined the different channels of convolutional output to compute the statistics and combine it with test image to perform classification None
