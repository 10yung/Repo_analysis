 selfuserCreatedMarkergroundAnchor CGPointx y let vwAnno SVPulsingAnnotationViewannotation MKMapViewuserLocation reuseIdentifier str vwAnnocenter viewpincenter viewpinaddSubviewvwAnno Here is my code Pulsing effect like ring look like little bit stuck Please help to solve these issue Thanks in advance It is danger I think the super class MKAnnotationView has the properities image and annotation we can not override it I love this annotation but I have a question Im using it in a map based app Im working on in Swift I just started developing in Xcode a couple months ago so Im unfamiliar with ObjectiveC but I want the color of the annotation on the map to change according to speed of a user as the location changes without removing the annotation from the map The UserLocation pulsing annotation does this if you change the TintColor of the map In my code Im updating the annotation color as follows I have a class I created called vehicle where I can access updates to location etc of vehicles these vehicles are not necessarily the user their info is stored in a database were accessing I also created a custom annotation called MGAnnotation that has a property called color that I can change dynamically and vehicleicon is an instance of it Finally I have a function updateColor which calculates a color using the speed vehicleiconsubtitle Speed speed ms vehicleiconcolor updateColorspeed vehicleiconcoordinate lastlocation mapViewaddAnnotationvehicleicon In the rendering function I have if let annotation annotation as MGAnnotation let annotationView SVPulsingAnnotationViewannotation annotation reuseIdentifier pulse annotationViewannotationColor annotationcolor annotationViewcanShowCallout true return annotationView In the first block of code when vehicleiconcoordinate changes the annotation changes location on the map accordingly but the color doesnt update Is there any easy fix to this that I could make in the SVPulsingAnnotation code Thanks Hello I want to use your animation effect with my custom Image as current location Image If I am giving your setImage call then the pulsing is not seen around my image Can you advice I am also using ur Pods as instructed iOS issue maybe Some random time after having already set the pulse to green pulse setPulseColor UIColor redColor NSLog string Never works but I get the NSLog after it every time I have no trouble changing just the annotation colors back and forth When I try to change both of the colors at the same time Ill only get the annotation change In order to get the pulse change I have to change the color an extra time so my current work around looks like this pulse setAnnotationColor UIColor redColor pulse setPulseColor UIColor redColor pulse setAnnotationColor UIColor redColor Its as if the pulse change gets put on the stack but doesnt get popped off until I change the color If I add an image to the SVPulsingAnnotationView is stays behind the dot and as pulseColor is no available I cannot set the dot to clearColor I added multiple SVAnnotation to the MKMapView and set pulsingViewcanShowCallout YES But this setting does not work pulsingView can not be Call out Can anyone help me This great code should be used with Google Maps SDK You probably dont have time to this I add this issue so someone maybe me could do this some time So the one who will implement this should probably use UIView and add it as a subview to the ViewControllers view This example does it with the SMCalloutView using mapViewdidChangeCameraPosition delegate method It is possible that GMSMarker can handle CAAnimation though It has a CALayer but I dont know how to use it yet Is it possible to stop the pulse
