If I start dont run and antivirus is off CVE POC exploit repo Hi I am trying to compile the cpp with Visual Studio but the output is like the one in this picture it translates to you can not assign a value of type const wchart to an entity of type LPWSTR I tried adding a cast using constcastLPWSTR and also using LPWSTR before it but then the exe file does not work The steps i am doing are in Visual Studio are I create a new Project Visual C Windows console application I download and paste the code Change the cmdline variable to get the reverse Shell I add the line include pchh at the begginning because otherwise i can not compile the Project and get the exe file I change the option x to x to get a bit file So if i add the cast it compiles but does not work and if i do not add it it does not compile Thank you very much Image CVE exploitdb CVE why not build x binary for it
