Newer iPhones default to capturing photos in heic files using the HEIF format These photos still use EXIF metadata and it looks like the libheifrs crate can parse it out of such files Could the EXIF support in fselect be reasonably extended to cover HEIF files as well libheifrs depends on the libheif C library and its dependencies so this probably would have an impact on build complexity unless it was a compiletime option Im trying to find anything that can sort a folder of mixed HEIF and JPEG photos by date taken and not finding much smaller than fullblown photo management databases Hiya Ive been using this on my mac and its simply brilliant Any chance someone has built this for Ubuntu as well Hi I wanted to try out fselect on my raspberry pi B but it gives me the error mentioned in the title rust was installed just fine this is the version rustc version verbose rustc e binary rustc commithash e bb e fc caa a e a ca d commitdate host armv unknownlinuxgnueabihf release LLVM version and I am on rustup default stable changed it to nightly as some answers on the internet suggested did not work out for me same issue Attached is the whole output of cargo install fselect fselecttxt Just a random thought in a true unix tradition be nice to be able to do things like find whatever fselect maxsize This way fselect would be more composable with other tools Eg could do things like fd fselect fzf with fd being lightningfast when going through massive numbers of files so you could narrow it down before filtering it with more detail In theory you could also pipe fselect into fselect why not Syntaxwise maybe the whole from clause could be then omitted and if theres anything being piped in it would filter those results instead of searching in the current folder The SQL like syntax makes me think that we could implement fupdate or fdelete thread main panicked at called Resultunwrap on an Err value Os code kind Other message File name too long libcoreresultrs note Run with RUSTBACKTRACE for a backtrace First of all I like what it can do and was about to install it when I noticed that there doesnt seem to be a single test Something that came to my mind is to test it entirely on CLI level to emulate how people would use it Here is an example example of journey level tests which looks like this travis when run its all just bash Do you consider this this as much of a maintenance problem as I do Please dont feel pressured or criticized I really am interested to learn about the way this tool iswas developed example travis
