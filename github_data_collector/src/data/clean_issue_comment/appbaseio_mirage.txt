During npm install I have the following error node scriptsinstalljs Downloading binary from Cannot download I checked in v indeed there is no win x bindingnode release Last one is win x bindingnode How can I fix the error When I run a query a modal opens with the results For some reason when this modal is open the scrollbar functionality of the browser is partially disabled I can still scroll through the results using the mouse wheel or page updown but I am unable to move the browsers scrollbar by clicking on it This is mildly annoying with a small result set since it breaks expected behavior and incredibly annoying on a large result set since if I say want to scroll back up to the top from being near the bottom it takes ages Also theres no graphical way to close the modal without scrolling all the way to the top to click that x ESC works but that wasnt obvious to me and may not be obvious to others So in conclusion it would be cool if the scrollbar could work consistently with the standard behavior of scrollbars everywhere Thanks Because Elasticsearch API has been changed mainly because of the removal of types since version mirage is currently completely unable to be applied in elastic practice with Elasticsearch This is the cause of Reproduction steps Install mirage as an extension or run it locally Provide an AWShosted ElasticSearch cluster URL and index Note in the web inspector of your choice that the request to hostindexmapping includes an Authorization header which causes the request to fail This Authorization header should not be sent Regarding Could you be more specific about how I might trivially replace the host name of the shared URL Do you mean under the share icon on the far left I can edit but it doesnt save my changes Ive gone with the chrome extension for both dejavu and mirage so how do I get them to point to each other instead of appbaseio Using the current version of the Mirage Chrome Extension whenever the checkbox Add joining quere is selected and nested is selected from the selectjoiningquery dropdown the generated query changes to instead of generating the nested query wrapper Tested on Chrome Canary Hello First of all thank for you great application It helps me everyday working with ES Im working with Mirage in chromeas an extension I can modify query manually bet every change in gui resets my changes to output fields egsource user message according to this post Is there possibility to add in Mirage button with output where I can define which fields should be returned by ES When selecting a numeric field the option for term and terms query should show as they are applicable However we currently dont show them URL params doesnt support distance field in case of geodistance queries Query Mirage Link Is there a recommended approach for updating the dejuvu Data View url to a local docker instance of dejavu
