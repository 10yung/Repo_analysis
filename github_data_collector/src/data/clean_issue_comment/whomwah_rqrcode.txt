How might I provide attribution to this source when implementing a new function in an unrelated gem that uses this gem as part of its code base I already have a system of getting a ruby script to print off an image set up but going to see if this poetry generator works with this QR Code gem Getting the following error EncodingUndefinedConversionError x from ASCII BIT to UTF on saving png image as the README shows Would be helpful if the gem included a CHANGELOGmd to make it straight forward to figure out what to look out for when updating These tend to be automatically parsed by dependency tools such as dependabot as well which makes for great developer experience Example of formatting As written in it supports to export as pure HTML so it can be styled with css As a bonus it accepts a path to a logo which can be overlayed ascss takes arguments as a hash for size logo logosize id class The logo should always be centered Example CSS is provided Readme updated specs added and all tests passing ive implemented for our project a render method css i did this via railshelper the styling is done via CSS so its fully customizable for example having rounded data instead of just squares different coloring also possible the logo is just a png that will be positioned centered up or down scaling is done by px calculation i can share the helper module but i wonder what would be the best way to integrate it into this gem i can imagine its useful for people who want customization for example look at the anchors those squares some of the corners are rounded each has individual classes so you can style them one for one feel free to try it out and please let me know how we could implement this as a render method helper is i can call it like this rowmb qrcodeinstructiontoqr logosize rowmb qrcodeinstructiontoqr level h rowmb qrcodeinstructiontoqr width logosize level h and it renders me This makes it so the svg can scale via css if used in a browser Hello At first thank you for your great gem rQRCode is very handy and easy to use Id like to embed SVG outout to HTML like follwing erb div pScan this code p raw RQRCodeQRCodenewdrafturldraftassvgxmldecleration false div To allow embedding as such style I need to remove XML declaration tag add viewBox attribute to svg element This PR adds xmldeclaration option for Thanks Setting fill attribute is more straightforward than setting fill property in style attribute Moreover it eliminates needs to add styles to stylesrc of Content Security Policy Tested with Added a class to the table to be used in css and avoid conflicts with other table Css code can now be re arranged as Sass qr borderwidth borderstyle none bordercolor ff bordercollapse collapse td borderleft solid px padding margin width px height px tdblack bordercolor tdwhite bordercolor fff
