That include all dependencies for easy installation From Hi Im hoping to use this package as the engine for checkpoint RevolutionAnalyticscheckpoint Among other things it should be a huge improvement over screenscraping the printout of a system call to detect the outcome of an install While its on CRAN the experimental lifecycle badge leads me to believe that it isnt quite mature yet Would you be able to provide at least a rough idea of when pak will be ready for production usage pakinstall does not document the specifications available in pkg At Jims suggestion I moved this issue from to here

with remotes With remotes we can do r remotesupdatepackageschromote and it will update a github package if this is the one installed without explicitly providing rstudiochromote With pak r pakpkginstallchromote upgrade T does not offer to update the package says nothing about the package However r pakpkginstallrstudiochromote upgrade T If this behavior to be explicit differs from remotes on purpose there is nothing here and this can be closed
