Homebrew has removed openssl and now installs which is causing all builds of MRI ruby or less to fail I was able to get around this by installing the deleted openssl formula with homebrew and passing the path brew install rubyinstall ruby withopenssldirusrlocaloptopenssl I would maintain that copr Very similar to text rubyinstall ruby Updating ruby versions Failed to download to

reinstalling rubyinstall from head and the same issue occurs Hit this when trying to install truffleruby since brew removed llvm in says that llvm isnt required as an external dependency since This was documented in and fixed in rvm in Ref rubyinstall installdir Usersdevaliasrbenvversionstruffleruby truffleruby Error No available formula with the name llvm Installing dependencies failed rubyinstall version rubyinstall brew upgrade rubyinstall Warning rubyinstall already installed This is a feature request It would be good if we also provide binary deb files for Debian and Ubuntu I guess we can host a PPA on I may be able to work on this next year my employer uses Debian but in the same time anyone can pick it up patch for handling distro specific dependencies on CentOS This computer is on Mac OS X Installing rubies has worked before so I suppose it is a problem with upgrading llvm openssl or some such This is the error log for me clang error argument to V is missing

Im baffled really it used to work fine brew uses environment variables to control many aspects of how it operates Using sudo with E allows those variables to be used to keep the buildsetup consistent with the existing environment Is it possible to add support for Fullstaq Ruby Im currently deploying MRI to both development workstations as and production servers with rubyinstall which works like a charm Id give Fullstaq Ruby a shot however Im not sure whether I want to touch this battle proven setup by ditching rubyinstall I have MacOS Mojave on execute command from terminal rubyinstall ruby i
