This is probably out of scope as it has too many variables but for me pacapt could completely abstract distrospecific package managers if it would also support adding additional repositories For instance sometimes I need to install Docker CE on Debian as described in The steps are roughly equivalent to apt update apt install apttransporthttps cacertificates gnupg lsbrelease OSIDlsbrelease si tr upper lower OSRELlsbrelease sc reponamedockerce baseurl curl sSL baseurlOSIDgpg aptkey add echo deb archamd baseurlOSID OSREL stable etcaptsourceslistdreponamelist apt update On Arch Qs with multiple arguments gives results which contain both its an intersection Eg pacman Qs maria java would match a package which has the words maria and java in any order in the pkgname or description rpm searches for each argument on its own but filters duplicates its an union it searches only package names but lets be happy with that Qs is for yum and dnf currently iplemented as rpm qa We can follow how this is evaluated by using bahss set x it evaluates to the single word maria java As there are no packages containing a space Changing it to rpm qa or rpm qa would evaluate to two words maria java This would match a few packages but not mariadbjavaclient fc noarch Now comes the part where I ask for help Transforming it to maria java will match it though it will print all packages which are involved with either of them a lot Its a union Transforming it to mariajava will be close but now the order matters To get identical results as with archlinux we need to transform it to mariajava javamaria In other words we need all permutations of and could then connect them with spaces and How do we do that And in bash Some thoughts In a loop n would give the nth argument single quotes above are only for demonstration A lot of useful packages come from Cask which is now included as part of Homebrew itself To use them from Homebrew you are supposed to use brew cask instead of just brew For example the correct command to install gimp would be brew cask install gimp Here is an example of pacapt failing to install gimp pacapt S gimp Error No available formula with the name gimp It was migrated from homebrewcore to homebrewcask You can access it again by running brew tap homebrewcask And then you can install it by running brew cask install gimp This adds a support for Void Linux and it should be more than enough Id like get some eyeballs on this Help testing opinions discussions etc I dont know what to do with variables like TOPT I leave one in xbpsS because its also in other scripts I cant run xbpsQet which seems to be in line with pacman Qet Need help with xbpsSasdeps Im guessing we want some OPT Need help with xbpsDasexplicit Im guessing we want some OPT Anything else that might need to be fixed Im new to Void Linux so I want to play around with it using pacapt Many thanks Is this something that youre ever planning to do Honestly this would make this a lot more usable for me because itd let me do things like pacapt R pacapt Qsq blahstuff which is a lot more intuitive than having to parse the output further I know itd require a bit of text manipulation and thats not Bashs strong suite Im honestly not sure why people write such large projects in Bash P If this is something you plan to do maybe you should add it to the automatically generated table I really hope it is as itd make things a ton easier You accept pull requests Youre probably a lot better at me at coding in Bash than I am but I could give implementing this a try if no one else wants to Hi icy Do you know if shell completion is implemented in pacapt If not and if its doable for me I could start working on it as I really like being able to do this with native apt and pacman binaries What do you think I would like to keep the top level package name If this script support Qe will be better
