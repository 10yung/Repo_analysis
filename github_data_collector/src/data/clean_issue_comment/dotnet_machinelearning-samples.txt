I need to know how to calculate the WithinClusterSum of Squared Errors WSS for different values of k do we have any samples for this to use it for Elbow method Or do you have any other method samples to find optimal number of clusters in KMean Silhouette Method or Gap analysis Please let me know i want to use it for my usescase to find optimal number of clusters Greetings thanks for providing MLnet to us youre really doing great work for the NET community here With MLnet you introduced the possibility to use inmemory data such as images along with two samples to use them Im still having trouble conveying the concept to using inmemory images for the object detection sample Would it be possible to adapt the sample with the alternative to load an image from memory BitmapFromFile for instance or explain how we could do that here Thanks in advance best regards and keep up the great work Simon NET Core reaches end of life December Either upgrade the version to LTS which is what users should be already doing anyway or target multiple versions of NET Core so users who are still on x are not broken Hi there Im just loading up the material for the style transfer example Well do a once over and then have a review if that works for the team Feel free to message me via email or teams vthreidmicrosoftcom Thanks Tom Hi I trying to modify sample code use my onnx model to classify my image When I want to get image result from OnnxModelScorercs I meet exception like Splitterconsolidator worker encountered exception while consuming source data Could any one tell me how to improve my code Thanks for your attention Rick Here is my model model inputimage Add inputlabel Concat concatenate According to my model I modify my relate cs file as below ImageNetPredictioncs public class ImageNetPrediction ColumnNameconcatenate public string PredictedLabels ImageNetDatacs public class ImageNetData LoadColumn public string inputimage public static IEnumerableImageNetData ReadFromFilestring imageFolder return Directory GetFilesimageFolder WherefilePath PathGetExtensionfilePath md SelectfilePath new ImageNetData inputimage filePath OnnxModelScorercs public struct ImageNetSettings public const int imageHeight public const int imageWidth private ITransformer LoadModelstring modelLocation ConsoleWriteLineRead model ConsoleWriteLineModel location modelLocation ConsoleWriteLineDefault parameters image sizeImageNetSettingsimageWidth ImageNetSettingsimageHeight var pipeline mlContextTransformsLoadImagesoutputColumnName inputimage imageFolder inputColumnName nameofImageNetDatainputimage AppendmlContextTransformsResizeImagesoutputColumnName inputimage imageWidth ImageNetSettingsimageWidth imageHeight ImageNetSettingsimageHeight inputColumnName inputimage AppendmlContextTransformsExtractPixelsoutputColumnName inputimage AppendmlContextTransformsApplyOnnxModelmodelFile modelLocation outputColumnNames new TinyYoloModelSettingsModelOutput inputColumnNames new TinyYoloModelSettingsModelInput Fit scoring pipeline var model pipelineFitdata return model private IEnumerablefloat PredictDataUsingModelIDataView testData ITransformer model ConsoleWriteLineImages location imagesFolder ConsoleWriteLine ConsoleWriteLineIdentify the objects in the images ConsoleWriteLine IDataView scoredData modelTransformtestData IEnumerablefloat probabilities scoredDataGetColumnfloat TinyYoloModelSettingsModelOutput get image result var result probabilitiesElementAt return probabilities Updated web ranking sample to this fixes the null reference crash that was happening now that we no longer need to use reflection for getting evaluation metrics for different NDCG values Added a new sample on how to cluster news articles Sample data came from but its a subset of it and wanted to keep it smaller This addresses dotnetmachinelearning Projects updated with mlnet v
