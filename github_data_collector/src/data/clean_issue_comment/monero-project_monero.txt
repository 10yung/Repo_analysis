H belongs to the wallet monerowalletrpc version Monero Carbon Chamaeleon v release Because the user might do this for reasons unknown Values beyond l will be reduced so are accepted Reported by whobiz We all understand the importance of verifying a PGPGPG signature which is followed by verifying the checksum of a certain release so I will not keep talking about it Also you understand how important it is to educate the average user about the importance of these checks If checking of the checksum is not that difficult then the GPGthing is more complicated even with the good manuals that we have The average user doesnt have a GPGclient installed and he doesnt understand what it is at all And when he sees a recommendation from the community that the GPGsignature should be checked for a new release and he sees one of these manuals let me put it this way the manuals are really good but honestly its not a user friendly experience Whats more you can skip these steps and simplify the GPGsignature verification process itself to copypaste in the browser Even when the average user understands what steps he needs to take to verify a GPGsignature correctly this is where laziness comes in Even in our XMRRU community where there are a lot of technically people and even after the CLI binary was compromised there were messages like So has someone already checked the GPG signature Are the hashes correct Does it match There is a solution and its called Keybase Youve probably seen it before The thing is if the signer has a Keybaseaccount it becomes incredibly easy to check someones GPGsignature just in two steps and there is no need to download the client create yourself a GPGkey search and import the GPGkey that created the signature certify it and so on The average user just needs to Go here Paste a signed message and click on the Verify button What I propose As there have been some recent changes I suggest to the community members who will sign future releases CLI GUI etc to create Keybaseaccounts to make it easier for average users to verify GPG signatures PS To make sure yourself how easy it is to verify a GPGsignature without installing the GPGclient which you probably have without importing my key etc you see a signed message below copy it go to paste the signed message and click Verify BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE Hash SHA Hello Im TheFuzzStone from XMRRUteam

Using latest version Edit on Ubuntu After the CLI wallet was locked the prompt showed the password in clear while typing Im not a big CLI user so this happened only twice so far but I thought its worth reporting this issue Not sure if a screenshot is useful but heres one below anyway The previous version was not working correctly as subprocesscall returns the exit status aka returncode of the command executed The exit status will be if the command succeeds which is interpreted as False then negated by the preceding not Exit status will be something other than if it fails eg etc so we just catch them all The script should fail if docker is specified but the command is not available Finally shellFalse is the default so no need to specify New version will correctly test if docker command is available and fail with a nice message if not Note Let me know if youd prefer this be switched to use the which command I was trying not to modify anything unnecessarily
