Hi It seems that an awful lot of Quicklook plugins no longer work on High Sierra or so I tried debugging with sudo qlmanage p my profilemobileprovision Output is Testing Quick Look preview with files redactedmobileprovision qlmanage CFMessagePort bootstrapregister failed x c Permission denied port x a name comapplecoredrag See usrincludeserversbootstrapdefsh for the error codes qlmanage CFMessagePort bootstrapregister failed x c Permission denied port x c b name comappletsmportname See usrincludeserversbootstrapdefsh for the error codes Any ideas Just needs a new build Adds some neat installation instructions Adds MIT License because none was specified Cheers This is a great little tool which I use regularly for debugging code signing and provisioning issues Ive noticed that it support app and ipa files but doesnt work for iOS today and watch extensions which have appex I assume this can be added to the ProvisioningInfoplist like how the app handling is defined but Im not sure how to find out the bundle type to add to the LSItemContentTypes For a long time Ive had issues with QuickLook showing blank previews of images Looks like its because I enabled the QLEnableTextSelection option after installing the Provisioning QL plugin This is obviously not a problem with the plugin but perhaps a note of caution could be added to the front page Included clarification in regarding to the folder not always existing Since the Provisioning Quick Look plugin handles iOS App IPA files it would be beneficial and meaningful to display the app icon which is archived inside the IPA file in the following places Display the app icon as the icon preview Thumbnail instead of the generic IPA document icon Display the app icon inside the Quick Look Preview panel most likely at the topleft of the provisioning profile information near the app title For consistency other nonIPA file types could display their generic document icon in the same position Display the app icon as the Quick Look Preview default to x points when the IPA file contains no provisioning profile This would apply to all IPA files obtained through iTunes typically stored here MusiciTunesiTunes MediaMobile Applications This concept isnt new the IPA Quick Look plugin by Julien Chauveau julienchauveau has provided the above functionality items and since Its located here It should be noted however that this plugin hasnt been updated since and doesnt appear to work on Mavericks x A casual glance at the Console error logs seems to indicate a Sandbox error but further investigation would be required there Secondly with the release of iOS Apple changed the appearance of all iOS app icons by altering the corner radius of the mask applied to the icon image The icon images of iOS apps are square masked programmatically when displayed on iOS and in iTunes The aforementioned plugin uses a preiOS style corner radius It may be better to apply an iOS style corner radius though apparently this isnt as easy as it seems Some work has been done to determine the new style of corner radius such as by Manfred Schwind manide Looking at the icon rendering in iTunes it looks like app icons are still masked in the preiOS style but its probably just a matter of time before this changes to the new style Thanks
