In my opinion better to switch to HTTPS for external links already checked and every destination supports it Ive tried following the instructions for multiple workers but I cant make sense of the behaviour Im seeing I have a Rails app which calls out to an API this API in turn makes an http request back to the original Rails app If I run my Rails app with Unicorn and multiple workers this works as expected If I run the Rails app using pow and try the same thing the request back into the Rails app appears to be blocked waiting for a workerprocess As an experiment I tried a long running request to the same rails app via pow Then start a second request By tailing the logs I can see Rails responding but again the browser seems to hang waiting for something until the original request is complete Any explanation of this behaviour or help in allowing me to run the scenario correctly using pow would be appreciated thanks Ive just upgrade my machine to and both Safari and Chrome can no longer access my sites served up by pow Error Safari can t open the page because Safari can t establish a secure connection to the server wrapscraperdev And This site can t be reached wrapscraperdev refused to connect Note I have tried both http and https with the same outcome Firefox and curl H hostwrapscraperdev localhost both still work as expected Any ideas on what is happening Thanks for making pow its been a great developer helper for me for many years I originally posted this issue in basecamppowprox but have since noticed the issue when running pow directly Ive configured the domain to proxy a nodejs app running koa with koastatic serving the files When I load the page about a third of the resources fail when running through powprox https and about fail when not running through pow None fail when running directly The requests fail with status errors and a xpowtemplateapplicationnotfound even though the application is there and working for the other requests I originally did a lot of digging in powproxs setup to figure out why to no avail Since observing the issue with pow directly I tried looking at the error log but can only find accesslog in the Log directory as per the User Manual The manual mentions error logs can be found in the apps directory but I cant find a mention of where this is Reading through the code is seems it should be next to the accesslog but isnt This makes me think either writing error logs is broken or pow isnt aware of the error In the end I tried updating the pow config to use more workers which resolved the issue I returned it to workers restarted pow and the issue is still gone It seems restarting pow was all that was needed I will report back if the issue reappears and Im able to find a solution In the meantime where can I find the error logs Thanks Magnus curl getpowcx sh Total Received Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed Installing Pow Installing local configuration files Installing system configuration files as root Version I think it fails at this line in the installation shell script sudo launchctl bootstrap system LibraryLaunchDaemonscxpowfirewallplist LibraryLaunchDaemonscxpowfirewallplist service already loaded POWDOMAINS dropped the S in the config file Since this is the case The test domain is preferred since Google owns the dev TLD and has recently enabled HSTS forcing all requests to use HTTPS Pow supports dev by default for backward compatibility only test domain should be shown as default one on Welcome page and dev left for backward compatibility only My team uses some sort of alias in their etchosts or whatever to make go to localhost They manually start their servers Thats fine but Id prefer to use POW and a simple The problem is that we have some hardcoded URLs in development or external services that want to go to I would like for to work just like Basically I want POW to listen to requests on port and port and map them to the same Rack app I tried sh cd pow echo oursite echo oursite But that obviously doesnt work as its trying to forward requests to as in the POW domain represented by the textfile powoursite to and theres nothing listening to that URLport combination Does anyone know of any way to make this work we should put it as default README This will make pow X faster I find this repo finally updated in I wonder weather this repo still being use Or is there any alternative for local rails development thanks for your suggestions
