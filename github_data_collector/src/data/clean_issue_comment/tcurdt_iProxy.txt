Hello I got this running on iOS and Mountain Lion connected to the adhoc network and setup the http proxy via the pac file but when I try to navigate to any website I get the following proxy error connect to www nytimes com failed connection refused Anyone seen this before and know what Im doing wrong Thanks Steve Would there be any possible way to create a physically tethered option that way WiFi doesnt need to be turned on in order for it to work even though a program on the PC end may be required Shareware program Proxifier makes most other applications work properly by resolving and routing the requests without manually specifying the SOCKSHTTP proxy I was able to get Version of iProxy to work properly using Proxifier but Version it cannot communicate with their the SOCKS or HTTPS proxy I would really want to use Version since it offers multitasking but something has changed that makes it unable to work with Proxifier and possibly other similar utilities The current build of iProxy initially works well but seems to die off after a while and I no longer can surf on Safari Ive tested this in various modes with both HTTP and SOCKS turned on only one of them on and either multitasking in the background or left running in the foreground I manually have to end it and restart the app in order to resume the ability to surf This is being tested on a nonjailbroken iPhone running iOS and a MacBook running Snow Leopard Thanks for all your help in advance I m running version on an iPhone and iPad both running b The HTTP proxy works fine but the SOCKS proxy does not work I am not sure if this isolated to iOS or if it is an inherent problem of iProxy The SOCKS proxy works fine on older versions of iProxy I did notice that the port numbers are different in and have made the necessary changes on my Mac s network settings to reflect that I also made sure I turned on the SOCKS proxy from the application via the ONOFF toggle Is there some additional changes or settings I should be looking at
