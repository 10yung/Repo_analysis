 s Hello using RAPR since long time now and I always wished to be able to export drivers to a selected folder from the application Maybe I miss point exporting all drivers as a CSV list but personally I find this useless Exporting drivers would be nicer imho I have to use powershell for thatDism online exportdriver destinationmypath Would be even better to be able to export selected drivers and not export ALL like in export csv Thank you ps for reference I grabbed the dism command from there Command line support would be very useful especially an option to deletemove all old drivers automatically RAPR finished its process in seconds GB of data freed from the folder but the free space on the disk has not changed Windows now reports GB of used space TreeSize says there is GB of used space I have cleaned the Recycle Bin but I can t figure out where those GB go I have disabled the system recovery no hibernation is enabled Thanks
