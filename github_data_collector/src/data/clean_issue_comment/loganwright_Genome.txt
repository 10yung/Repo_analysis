 Yes we have a new way to work with JSON in swift but project which use Genome could really make use of an update Do you plan to update it Seems easy PS I see the updates brunch but it seems like its abandoned Also allows submapping let testNode Node bar foo baz baq struct Model BasicMappable var bar Int var baz Int var baq Int mutating func sequence map Map throws try bar map bar let foo map foo try baz foo baz try baq foo baq let model try Modelnode testNode printmodelbar true printmodelbaz true printmodelbaq true let node try modelmakeNode printnode testNode true Replaces a lot of force unwraps by optional unwraps and throwing errors Also replaces most instances of XCTAssert by more specific assertion functions I would like to have a submap when mapping so I dont have to type the path repeatedly ex json is test abc sub int string and my mapping function is try mainString map test let subMap map sub try subInt subMap int try subString subMap string but when I do let subMap map sub the subMapnode is still original node since subscript only change result file Mapswift line public subscriptkeys PathIndex Map lastPath keys result node keys return self should it also change node to node keys Hi Could you please add a copyright statement to the license Thank you
