Is there a tool you used to convert the IDL or header or was it done manually Compiled togl lib is not working with source sdk Since Direct D loses a bit of performance by going through OpenGL with regard to state maybe mapping D D to Vulkan would allow slightly better performance for Source games on Linux Emphasis on the slightly I know this isnt a magic bullet I put this under issues but while its not really an issue with ToGL Im not sure where feature requests are best put After some time performace is very bad only restart helps With matqueuemode all source games run without this issue Don know if this is related to ToGL Please make to ToGLES too Straightforward question Do you guys need help with anything and how can I help Thanks for your attention
