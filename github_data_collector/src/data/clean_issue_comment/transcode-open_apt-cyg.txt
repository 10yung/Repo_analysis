No such file or directory Updated setupini Current quickstart says lynx source rawgitcomtranscodeopenaptcygmasteraptcyg aptcyg install aptcyg bin RawGitcom is shutting down and there is also no need to use lynx which is a fullblown web browser I suggest the following Install wget through setupx exe Run in Cygwin wget install aptcyg bin Since this repo is abandoned Im going to request Github support to move the root project marker to According to its the only fork with any kind of active maintaining going on Yes it deviates from the original and has a lot of potentially redundant features But regardless of your stance on that there are no other forks that can compare others do not even fix the reported critical issues so they are unusable The only other fork which seems has meaningful changes is It attempts to make a bootstrapping mechanism but the feature seems incomplete if it was complete bootstrapping operations wouldnt be reported as user commands but rather invoked automagically when any of the packages aptcyg relies upon need to be updated ilatypov as the only potential rival do you have any reservations about this action Is your fork usable andor maintained Since your repo doesnt even accept bug reports it doesnt seem like youre willing to pick up the torch Hello I run sudo aptcyg install git but it doesnt work Unable to start aptcyg There is no application associated with the given file name extension How do I run aptcyg with root priv Pat When I install dos unix it hang after xz OK and it does not response aptcyg install dos unix Installing dos unix dos unix tarxz OK wget is more likely present in cygwin than lynx The only thing that worked for me was the workaround mentioned in issue I try to run aptcyg on debian from gitlab docker I
