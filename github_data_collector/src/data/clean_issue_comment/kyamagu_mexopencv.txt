I am trying to run a code For this purpose I have download that code from github Whenever that code tries to check mexopencv It shows an error error please make sure gcc g is installed Following is the description of system Window Visual Studio Matlab a opencv mexopencv install from your folder LIB i use opencv i have a problem please help me error message Invalid MEXfile C Users Utilisateur Desktop mexopencv cv private FeatureDetectormexw Missing dependent shared libraries opencvcore dll required by C Users Utilisateur Desktop mexopencv cv private FeatureDetectormexw opencvfeatures d dll required by C Users Utilisateur Desktop mexopencv cv private FeatureDetectormexw opencvxfeatures d dll required by C Users Utilisateur Desktop mexopencv cv private FeatureDetectormexw Error in cvFeatureDetector line thisid FeatureDetector new detectorType varargin Error in Untitled line detector cvFeatureDetectorORB Hello I use MatlabR a OS X opencv when I make use matlab here is an error ucdeMacBookPromexopencvmaster mbh make MATLABDIRApplicationsMATLABR aapp ApplicationsMATLABR aappbinmex largeArrayDims cxx Iinclude IusrlocalCellaropencv includeopencv IusrlocalCellaropencv include output cvprivateNet srccvprivateNetcpp Llib lMxArray LusrlocalCellaropencv lib lopencvdnn lopencvml lopencvobjdetect lopencvshape lopencvstitching lopencvsuperres lopencvvideostab lopencvcalib d lopencvfeatures d lopencvhighgui lopencvvideoio lopencvimgcodecs lopencvvideo lopencvphoto lopencvimgproc lopencvflann lopencvcore Xcode Clang Undefined symbols for architecture x cvMatupdateContinuityFlag referenced from cvMatMatint int int void unsigned long in libMxArrayaMxArrayo ld symbols not found for architecture x clang error linker command failed with exit code use v to see invocation make cvprivateNetmexmaci Error I do not known how to deal with this error please help me detector cvSIFTConstrastThreshold EdgeThreshold keypoints descriptors detectordetectAndComputeim g keypoints descriptors detectordetectAndComputeim g matcher cvDescriptorMatcherBruteForce matches matcherknnMatchdescriptors descriptors Goodmatches for i lengthmatches tmp matchesi if tmp distance tmp distance Goodmatches Goodmatchestmp end end when I do matchesin factI found that the two points below do not match keypoints GoodmatchesiqueryIdxpt keypoints GoodmatchesitrainIdxpt howeverthese two below match keypoints GoodmatchesiqueryIdx pt keypoints GoodmatchesitrainIdx pt After successful installation there is no output from cvgetBuildInformation function in Octave on Windows The only difference from instructions for installation for this Octave version is the path C dev octave mingw bin What can cause this Hi I followed your instruction at this My OS is windows bits X processor while the cmake version is and Visual studio version is In attempt to configure using x option it returns error and when I used the default Win it configured Having done the configuration and the generation I opened the C dev build OpenCVsln file and the from the release option I could only select Win and not x as you shown in the link I tried to follow other steps in MATLAB command line and what the following error was the outcome on implementing themexopencvmakeopencvpathC dev build install opencvcontribtrue Error using mexopencvmakepkgconfig line OpenCV library path not found C dev build install x vc lib Error in mexopencvmakemexoptions line cvcflags cvlibs pkgconfigopts Error in mexopencvmake line mexflags mexoptionsopts I want to believe that my inability to resolve the x and win options is reponsible How can I resolve this problem Many thanks in anticipation of your help Thank you I followed the installation instructions but the E dev build install is not include x Can you help me solve the problem win vs opencv Hello When I do brew install opencv it automatically installs opencv version Is there a way I can specify the version of opencv to install Thanks Can I install mexopencv by Matlab Runtime Or the other way around can I include mexopencvopencv functions into a Matlab standalone application Error using mex Netcpp C Users Suhayl Documents MATLAB bg mexopencvmaster src cv private Netcpp warning C argument conversion from sizet to int possible loss of data C Users Suhayl Documents MATLAB bg mexopencvmaster src cv private Netcpp warning C argument conversion from sizet to int possible loss of data C Users Suhayl Documents MATLAB bg mexopencvmaster src cv private Netcpp warning C argument conversion from sizet to int possible loss of data C Users Suhayl Documents MATLAB bg mexopencvmaster src cv private Netcpp error C deleteLayer is not a member of cvdnnexperimentaldnn v Net c opencv build include opencv dnn utils dnnhpp note see declaration of cvdnnexperimentaldnn v Net
