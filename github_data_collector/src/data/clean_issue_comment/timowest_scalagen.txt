How to make a complete conversion from Scala to java Java Code private final static MapString String props new LinkedHashMapString String final SetString propSet propskeySet StringBuilder newString new StringBuilder for String prop propSet if newStringlength newStringappend newStringappendprop On converting this code to scala get an error on the line Scala Code for prop propSet saying foreach does not exist for the class javautilSet String Had to convert it to Scala set using asScalaSetpropSet as mentioned in Being new to Scala not sure if this is actually a bug to be reported here Im getting the following error trying to use the scalagen module via gradle When I add this dependency I see this error orggradleapiinternalartifactsivyserviceivyresolveparserMetaDataParseException inconsistent module metadata found Descriptor commysemascalagenscalagen Errors bad module name expectedscalagen foundscalagen I think the problem here is the way the scalagen module users a property defined by its own profiles to define the artifactid So the artifact is resolved but the scala x profile defined in that same pomxml and set as active by default then changes the id of the artifact itself So you load scalagen and its contents changes its own artifactid to scalagen Ive tried various techniques including seting scalaversion explicitly in my own pomxml disabling the scala x profile setting the scala x profile active by default in my own pomxml but no matter what I try I get the same error I dont believe its possible to use this module without someone having to set Pscala x on all builds So Im planning to fork this library and modify the artifactid to remove this property Ill package a modified version of this library as a module of my own project and The latest version is much more stable and has support for Java cc timowest nightscape hello Im currently working on ScalaNative and we have a lot of java code to port from java to scala I would like to spend some time rebooting this project if there is an interest Hi timowest Ive dug much deeper than I initially planned and made quite some changes to scalagen but I hope they pay off I replaced the Maven build by an SBT one which gives much nicer compilation speed and other goodies and is the de facto standard for most Scala projects I transformed the statefull ScalaDumpVisitor into a stateless ScalaStringVisitor which instead of modifying a local SourcePrinter returns Strings in all visit methods Formatting is now handled by Scalafmt which gives much more flexibility on how to format code and reduces the complexity of scalagen a little The Java parser library is updated to a version that supports Java and the corresponding visit methods implemented so we should be able to transform Java code most likely theres some bugs in there which we can fix as we discover them Comments are copied as good as possible Theres still some edge cases where they can get lost especially when multiple comments occur in a row It would be great if you could have a look at this so we can start discussing on how to integrate and release this If I have time Ill publish a build on Bintray so that people can already start trying this out and finding bugs wink Phew that was a journey smile MINVALUEMinValue should be good candidates for a translation too original code private BigMoney withBigDecimal newAmount generated private def withnewAmount BigDecimal BigMoney should be private def withnewAmount BigDecimal BigMoney original code assert currency null JodaMoney bug Currency must not be null generated code assertcurrency null JodaMoney bug Currency must not be null its definitely a slightlyobscure java codejust reporting it as an issue for tracking byte capabilities new byte thiscapabilitiessize was converted to val capabilities new ArrayofDim ByteByte thiscapabilitiessize which does not compile
