found fatal repository not found PS E Github libfreenect depends Hello I am looking at a way to extend the working distance of traditional usb currently for my project i am running kinects on one system and using usb active extensions to extend the range of the kinects I am having intermittent issues with the usb active extensions particulary when i start to daisy chain the kinects are either not recognized at all are recognized but dont open correctly or open and then crash shortly after However i can run the four fairly stable if i dont daisy chain If anyone has any ideas on making this behave better im all ears My teams preferred solution originally was to run the kinects using four seperate computers some single board computer like the new raspberry pi would be nice but as i understand these will not meet performance standards for decent depth processing frame rate we need hz So the main question is it possible to repeat the raw data of the kinects over ethernet My first idea would be to use the DumpPacketPipeline which constructs a Frame instance with the raw packet data and then send this over ethernet perhaps using ROS This data would go into a highend pc to perform processing on the RGB and Depth packets how could i input this raw data into libfreenect to perform rgb and depth packet processing using appropriate methods eg Cuda depth processing to then spit out the processed rgb and depth images Has anyone tried doing something similar before Any thoughts ideas is much appreciated Overview Description I cant get Video from Protonect or rather i cannot display it on my Screen Havent had any luck with either X or Wayland tried Deepin and Gnome Wayland Gnome X Any pointers in the right direction are greatly appreciated Version Platform and

to get the distance from the sensor in millimeters I ask because i dont find any examples or documentation of it in python thanks Hello Is it possible to use Kinect v as a webcam in Ubuntu to access from other applications such as Cheese In other words I would like to register the RGB camera of Kinect v as devvideoX I have tried as a driver However it didnt work with the test program Protonect Thank you in advance Overview Description I want to edit the SimpleUserTracker to meet my requirement of human follower robot I want to publish the coordinates into a rostopic Is that possible If not can I create a new sample similar to SimpleUserTracker If so could you explain me how to do that Thank you Overview Description i am getting this error CMakeFilesProtonectdirProtonectcppo In function

can somebody help me please Hi I have been checking different issues on performing the offline registration but I cannot find exactly the case I am working on I have RGB and its correspondent depth image of hands saved on memory The problem is that they are cropped to only show the hand so the sizes of both RGB and depth images are not anymore nor but resized to random squared sizes dependent on the hand size color depth I dont know if once cropped the registration can be performed What I am trying to do is adding borders to the image both mirroring or zero padding up to their default size and do the registration but I keep on getting completely black images both for the registered and undistorted images If I dont add any border to the images and perform registration with their squared sizes I get the registered on the left and undistorted on the right registered undistorted Do you know if this can be fixed somehow My code is as follows libfreenect Registration registration new
