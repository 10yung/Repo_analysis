The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

interactive Hi i am having this error where when it gets to the html page i click on show widgets i initialises for a bit and then an error shows up saying error try refreshing the pagebrundefined Help would be really appreciated Thanks Hello Ive tried deploying ipyvolume via mybinder but the widgets are not visualized with some js errors see screenshot below Here are two pages Ive created where bqplot works fine but not ipyvolume img width altScreen Shot at PM src Is the ipyvolume supported by nbinteract Any guidance on how to make it work would be appreciated Thanks Please consider uploading the source distribution to PyPI instead of just wheels PyPI is a canonical place for sdists and very few toolsthird party python packagers debian fedora etc get the source from GitHub I think that the options provided in the default templates are great but for example I would like to create my own template with custom title a GA tracker code and without Bootstrap and I didnt want to alter the source files to do so but rather write my own template currently the marker settings for each plot type is hardcoded in the function itself eg for nbihist we see params marks sample arrayorplaceholderhistfunction bins getoptionbins normalized getoptionnormalized scales lambda opts sample opts xsc count opts ysc which is passed to createmarks then merged with default marks and finally rendered It would be nice to be able to control some aspects of the marks most importantly colors in order to have better control over the rendering eg in order to generate the colorcoded stack bar chart in img width src I needed these params params marks x arrayorplaceholderxfn PLACEHOLDERRANGE y arrayorplaceholderyfn colors bqCATEGORY stroke since you already have the utility functions to merge param specs in createmarks this seems not too difficult to add cc choldgraf
