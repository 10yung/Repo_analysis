It looks like only getting the OAuth token is not enough we should implement it with refresh token Currently notification code lives under tab content side inside Vue app Because of that if there is an event in one hour Im getting the same notification whenever I open a new tab And this is quite disturbing I would want it to see once not everytime I open a new tab I think we should create a background script for the extension and check the events there every minute And we should use chromenotificationscreate inside the backround script since the Notification API wont work inside that script We can communicate between background script and Vue app with that API call chromeextensiongetBackgroundPage We can create a background script that checks the events every minute in background script there is a step by step walkthrough here The only difference we shouldnt use chromeappruntimeonLaunchedaddListener and use chromeextensiongetBackgroundPage to call from Vue app I can mentor someone who wants to work on that issue You can leave a comment here if you want to work on that I can provide additional information Tasks can be separated with groups Im currently using Trello on my job and home projects If we can integrate the Trello boards with the Frame it will be useful In this way our task can be synchronized with Trello In the same time we can complete our the Trello tasks But firstly new column feature must be active Ill review the API documentation of the Trello I think there should be an export feature It could be download to desktop or save to Dropboxlike systems In this way the notes and tasks are will be portable
