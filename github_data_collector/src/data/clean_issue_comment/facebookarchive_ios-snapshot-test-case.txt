Hello I am testing FBSnapshot for adjusting our project I found an issue about setting Edit Scheme on Xcode When I set the path with PROJECTNAME the testing is always fail without creating recording images UsersgibongkimtsDownloadsRxSwiftSignupRxSwiftSignupTestsUITestswift error RxSwiftSignupTestsUITest testExample failed Test ran in record mode Reference image is now saved Disable record mode to perform an actual snapshot comparison deinit SignUpViewController So Ive set paths without PROJECTNAME It is working well I dont understand why it is not working I think it is better to check this issue or modify about setting path of Edit Scheme in READMEmd file Hi I am trying to update carthage using carthage update platform iOS It works well for sometime until it reaches to clone Cloning iossnapshottestcase At this point carthage hangs and no response dont know why it always sticks at iossnapshottestcase Carthage version which i am using is Is there anyways to test snapshot against multiple device and iOS version I want to snap view controller on multiple dimensions Running the same test in the same version of Xcode E b and same version of Simulator on two different machines can produce slightly different images eg certain views being px taller This causes our snapshot tests to fail Do you have insight why this could be happening and if there are recommendations on how to work around this Hey just tried to add this to my project but noticed that all the tests produced square reference images of size x After a long couple hours trying to figure out and comparing to test projects I noticed that the deployment target was the issue Raising the deployment target of the project to iOS would solve this but that s not possible yet Raising the test target s deployment has no effect Here s an example project I created As you can see the reference image is x even though it should be from iPhone plus In our testing host applications are not a hard requirement for snapshot tests bgerstle added this in Would you object to me changing this code to not raise an exception In our setup we have thousands of snapshot tests without host applications But we cannot use deviceAgnostic to have OS specific snapshot file names because fbstrictKeyWindow raises an exception if there is no key window From what I can tell this window is used only to get the bounds to use in the file name But when it is removed the bounds used for the file name is x Alternatively instead of removing the exception we can split deviceAgnostic into deviceAgnostic and osAgnostic which would allow for leaving the exception since it might make sense to have non zero sizes in those file names while still having the OS version in the path without the exception my test is to capture screen during Animation screens using FBSnapshotVerifyViewcurrentVCview identifier element Animation screens are having three screens using single view but last one not able to hit using any identifier Hi there I wanted to run snapshot test cases on a simple new project created with Xcode beta The project includes both XCTestCase test cases and FBSnapshotTestCase test cases The problem is that when I run all the tests of the test target only the XCTestCase test cases are ran a bug very similar to The only project setting I changed after I created aside from adding the FBSnapshotTestCase dependency as a pod was setting the deployment target to Here is my test suite import XCTest testable import SnapshotTest class SnapshotTestTests XCTestCase override func setUp supersetUp Put setup code here This method is called before the invocation of each test method in the class override func tearDown Put teardown code here This method is called after the invocation of each test method in the class supertearDown func testExample This is an example of a functional test case Use XCTAssert and related functions to verify your tests produce the correct results func testPerformanceExample This is an

snapshot test cases ran fine The version of cocoapods I used was You can find an zip of the project here Thats it let me know if you have any questions Thanks At the moment the framework renders test images in the devicespecific resolution dpi context scale the scale factor is set to the scale factor of the device s main screen UIGraphicsBeginImageContextWithOptionsboundssize NO To allow snapshottests to run on both x and x devices we record and store snapshots for both x and x devices This takes time and loads the repository with snapshots identical up to dpi I wonder whether the framework will work correctly with a fixed context scale eg x Are there any pitfalls andor performance issues I appreciate any comments regarding the question I know in the Realm UI and Snapshot Testing Video Luis mentioned that we can test views across devices iPhone vs iPhone etc I want to know which device I am running on within simulator but when I print out the model name let modelName UIDevicecurrentmodelName It would just say I am running in Simulator I was following this Stack Overflow post How to determine the device running in the simulator but using FBSnapshotTestCase is not necessarily related to functionalities available Has anyone ran into a similar problem
