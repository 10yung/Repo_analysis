I read Search results return object identifiers and want to know does the search results also return snippets Thanks First thank you for creating this library I too was disappointed in the lack of a lightweight alternative to Elasticsearch Our use case is a search feature for our website were talking hundreds of blog posts not PB of data Ive searched but have been unable to find if its possible to sort the SUGGEST results by popularity ie the number of objects containing that term It seems all the search terms are alphabetical Is such a capability existing or if not is it planned I did take a look at the source code and didnt see an obvious way to incorporate it but I have no knowledge of Rust so may be missing something obvious My proposed workaround in the absence of such a feature is to run the SUGGEST and then a QUERY on each of the suggested terms counting the results for each Given the small data sets and the speed of Sonic I think this is viable for our use case but open to other ideas too Just curious if supported or planned to be Ive seen reports at scale that Sonic would not behave well in certain cases w searches committed to Sonic Channel in nonLatin alphabets Need to investigate on this First thanks for the amazing project Im the developer the python client my team noticed the count is always off by one err Is there a specific reason Is there a plan to add a CONTRIBUTINGmd This could include template to do a PR guidelines to add tests coding standards etc Im currently learning Rust and am very interested in contributing on this project somehow Thanks What would it take to point Kibana to instances of Sonic instead of Elasticsearch sonic would need to speak fragments of the Elasticsearch API so that Kibana could send requests and then display the responses Similarly to Im considering using this to replace an ElasticSearch cluster We have more than a couple of fields Message text User Tags Message date However it should be reasonably straightforward to implement these using multiple searches and buckets with frontend filtering It may or may not be any faster than ES thats part of what Id like to find out The biggest problem is date which is a range query Is there any guaranteed ordering to query returns If theyre in any order other than insertion time then wed need to retriever every match and filter them in the frontend which is unlikely to be netpositive does sonic support pinyin Because we are from China Chinese users often use pinyin to search Hello at first sight it looks like stopword list is the only requirement for a language to be supported by Sonic Is it possible to include following MIT licensed stopword list to support Slovak slo slk and possibly other missing languages
