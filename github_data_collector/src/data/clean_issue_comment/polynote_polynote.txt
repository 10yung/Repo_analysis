I failed to make polynote work with Scala and Spark my current docker container is Probably the classpath issue as it cannot find orgapache libraries Strangly the same stuff used to work for me for x polynoteissue A bit messy but I figure lets get it out there and iterate Addresses Fixed dangling listeners that keep trying to reactivate a notebook that you closed Added an error display when theres a failure trying to load a notebook A bit more logging around notebook sessions Misc websocket cleanup Addresses When the whole page is filled with cells and a new cell is added it shows at the bottom of the window Like some other notebooks namely Jupyter is it possible to scroll that cell little bit so it will be in the center of the window Please check the difference by checking out these screenshots Polynote new cell at the bottom and not scrollable polynote Other notebook new cell is scrollable kept in the center other I followed the instruction to run it on docker created the configyml and the notebooks directory but wasnt able to run it properly docker run rm it p p v pwdconfigymloptconfigconfigyml v pwdnotebooksoptnotebooks polynotepolynotelatest config java cp polynotejarpolynotejaroptpolynotedepsscalalibrary jaroptpolynotedepspolynoteruntimejaroptpolynotedepsscalareflect jaroptpolynotedepspolynotesparkruntimejaroptpolynotedepsportablescalareflect jaroptpolynotedepsscalacollectioncompat jaroptpolynotedepsscalaxml jaroptpolynotedepsscalacompiler jar Djavalibrarypathusrlocallibpython distpackagesjep polynoteMain config Exception in thread main zioFiberFailure Fiber failed An unchecked error was produced javalangIllegalArgumentException Unknown argument config at polynoteserverServerpolynoteserverServerparseArgsServerscala at polynoteserverServeranonfunrun applyServerscala at polynoteserverServeranonfunrun applyServerscala at ziointernalFiberContextevaluateNowFiberContextscala at ziointernalFiberContextziointernalFiberContextrunbody FiberContextscala at ziointernalFiberContextanonfun runFiberContextscala at javautilconcurrentThreadPoolExecutorrunWorkerThreadPoolExecutorjava at javautilconcurrentThreadPoolExecutorWorkerrunThreadPoolExecutorjava at javalangThreadrunThreadjava Fiber was supposed to continue to a future continuation at polynoteserverServeranonfunrun applyServerscala Fiber execution trace at zioZIOanonfunorDieWith applyZIOscala at scalaPredefanon applyPredefscala at zioZIOFunctionsanonfunfromEither applyZIOscala at polynoteserverServeranonfunrun applyServerscala Fiber was spawned by Fiber was supposed to continue to a future continuation at polynoteappAppanonfunmain anonfunapply applyAppscala a future continuation at polynoteappAppanonfunmain applyAppscala Fiber ZIO Execution trace empty trace Fiber was spawned by empty trace It seems to be impossible to edit an equation after entering it initially I cant figure out a way to bring up the TeX editor for the equation already made It would be very useful to be able to set some environment variables for kernels the problem is that this would only work in remote mode Should we add a delete button to the cell toolbar Right now if you want to launch a Sparkenabled interpreter you need to have some Spark configuration in the notebook We should just have a checkbox that toggles whether to launch Spark or not
