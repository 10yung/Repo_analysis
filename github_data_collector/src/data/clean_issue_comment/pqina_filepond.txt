Support FilesizeBase that is used to calculate the filesize In which you can change this to if you would rather display kibibytes mebibytes etc Revert url is only called after chunk uploads are complete and you press the delete button Is there a way to during chunk uploads processing when cancelled Summary First of all This is a great library Thanks for that Uploading files to the server POST to the url configured with the server option works ok However loading local files added with files option during the FilePondcreate Didnt work The server got the request but did not get the requestParameter which would contain the serverId It took a while before I found the cause My sever url is kind of generated AND does contain already some parameters and thus also a It seems that filePond just adds load ltserverId to the server property while in this case it should have added load ltserverId How to reproduce Just use a server url with already a parameter in it Expected behaviour add the load query paramter with a prefix instead of a prefix when the server url does already contain a WIndows Chrome Version From my experience the error object looks like this javascript type error code body Network Error Summary Hi Im running into an issue in IE with the file card not updating colors when the file has finished processing Whether it is a success or error the file card remains a grey color Currently it will only update when the browse button is selected andor you click any where within the FilePond instance iexploreRbSWDtSEuL iexploreSL Ry QOim Below is the code

greenred depending on successerror Additional information In all the other browsers it updates the color as expected so it currently is just an issue with IE Environment Version OS Windows Device Desktop Browser IE Added getItemWidth function to be used in dragItem to get the number of rows and columns Combining this information with our drag position we can find out where in the grid column mod is a grid of one column we are and how the index should update Known issue If user drags item left or right outside of root it will continue updating the index This branch removes the ariarelevantadditions attribute from the screen reader assistant element This attribute currently prevents assistant text from being announced by screen readers in Firefox tested using NVDA Its my understanding that there are few advantage to setting ariarelevant unless you want to encourage screen readers to announce more changes using all to announce content removals The default value of ariarelevant is additions text Is it necessary to exclude text changes from being announced here resolves Summary Content added to the live region filepondassistant is not read by screen reader NVDA in Firefox This appears to be related to the ariarelevantadditions attribute How to reproduce Run NVDA and add upload or remove a file from filePond in Firefox Expected behaviour The appropriate text is added to the arialivepolite element and announced by the screen reader Currently the text is added to the element but the content is not announced Additional information When the ariarelevent attribute is removed from the live region element or the attribute is set toariarelevantadditions text Firefox will announce the status updates This appears to be due to one of several inconsistencies with ariarelevant across browsers It is recommended to avoid this attribute if possible A fix may be as simple as removing this attribute from the assistant element Environment Version OS Windows Device Desktop Browser Firefox Hello if the max height is set as described here When the filepond is disabled its not possible to scroll I can see the scrollbar but im stuck it doesnt scroll Hey Thanks for your work This is within a react application When I try to create a new FilePond instance and provide it a file prop from the controlled state of another FilePond instance it throws a File is of invalid type error while looking like it attempts to make a get request to the current url the source id or something This only occurs when source FilePond state was created with a mock file It looks like the mock file is processed and displayed correctly by the source FilePond but after postprocessing by FilePond the mock file is not a Blob or File but a plain Object so I think this issue is isolated to mock files Im unable to avoid passing a processed mock file Apologies if this is an issue youve already addressed Best rowrowrowrow
