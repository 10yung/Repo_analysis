 So I found a game I had started making a while ago and never finished I have the export file but I cant figure out how to load it in RPGBoss Every time I try it says No Project Selected Any suggestions Could someone tell me how to make custom sprites I cant find a way to do it and the guide from here has a link to a website which is down I have two collisionrelated issues First for things like lamp posts and caves I want to allow the player to walk behind the lamps and under a roof I dont know how to make it so something will stay visible in front of the player while the player can walk behind it Second I uploaded a custom tileset but the player can walk on top of it Is there any way to make it so you dont walk on it Thank you Add is it maintain flags After changing some sound cursor effects every time I open the project now the terminal only opens and doesnt continue on after EventDispatchThreadrun unknown source Sound effects were mp and removing them did not work Netbeans is a Java IDE and it can open the game and edit maps I can do everything but actually play test the game Is there something I can do besides that It just left two empty folders on my Desktop Little and Duel I just started using rpg boss the other day I started my first map and set a start point and then i went to playtest what i have so far the playtest wndow comes up and im able to use the up and down arrows to go through the new game load game quit options The problem is that when i land on an option and hit enter nothing happens I cant select any options Any idea what might be wrong and how i can fix it I would love people to still update this even if its just the community as it has so much potential This and Open RPG Maker discontinued in had an amazing amount of potential Where did it all go
