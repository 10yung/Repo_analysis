 Thanks for trying out GhostText and opening this issue Before opening an issue for a possible bug please make sure you try GhostText in Chrome and Sublime Text This is the most common configuration and will help me understand better where the problem is If it works with Sublime Text but not with a third party editor please open an issue in their repository Setup Browser Firefox Editor Neovim Description On Overleaf the text in the editing area in source mode an editing mode on Overleaf you basically edit the LaTeX source code directly without any fancy stuff syncs only oneway to my editor but not the other way around The issue doesnt exist in Chrome Reproduction Head over to Overleaf open an account open a new document and activate GhostText in the editing area with Firefox Repeat the same steps with Chrome perhaps without opening another account unless you want to for unspecified reasons and compare Thanks for trying out GhostText and opening this issue Before opening an issue for

but not with a third party editor please open an issue in their repository Setup Browser Firefox on Ubuntu Editor Emacs Description When I preview my edits on a Trac wiki using GhostText in Firefox GhostText gets confused I have tested in Firefox with both Emacs and Sublime Text and they have the same problem so I think its an issue with GhostText Also have tested in Chrome with both Emacs and Sublime Text and I dont have this issue so I think its an issue with FirefoxGhostText specifically The issue is a little hard to describe but its easy to reproduce To reproduce go to the Trac demo wiki at and choose Edit this page which will take you to Now dont edit just click on Preview Page which will take you to a preview at Now scroll up select the text area with the wiki source and start GhostText GhostText will connect correctly and you can start editing Makes some changes to the wiki source with your editor via GhostText and then click on Preview Page again The page will reload at again with your changes rendered Now the problem the text area is no longer connected to GhostText but the corresponding buffer in the editor is still open If you make changes in the editor nothing happens If you click on the GhostText icon now it closes the buffer in the editor and you lose your changes Finally if you click on the GhostText icon a second time GhostText opens a new buffer and you can edit again but your intermediate changes are still lost Thats with Firefox With Chrome GhostText closes the buffer in your editor as soon as you click on Preview Page so there is no confusion and no chance to lose your changes Note that Its All Text did even better with these Trac previews it could keep the same buffer open across all Preview Page clicks so you didnt have to load a new buffer after each prview and you didnt lose your cursor position in the buffer each time Nevertheless your plugin seems better than Its All Text for most things eg it does better on GitHub previews and can edit the magic compose box in GMail Thanks Would you be interested in a PR providing a simple API for other extensions to activate GhostText It wouldnt have to be anything like as complex as Tree Style Tabs but that should give you an idea as to what Im talking about Im asking particularly so Tridactyl users can roll their own using our own keybinding mechanism Thanks for trying out

longstanding bugs Missing x Show user notifications x Support more than textareas Closes Closes Fixes Fixes Fixes Fixes Introduction I just started using GhostText and I really like the fact that I can finally use my Vim heart within Firefox with extensions even tada In fact Im writing this very text using GhostText smiley For my work I have to work in ServiceNow which uses CodeMirror fields for code input Sadly this does not work as expected Linking GhostText to my editor seems to work just fine and the contents of the field are visible and transferred to my editor But changes I make from within my editor are not synced back to the browser However changes I make in the browser are synced to my editor This is also the case when I tried the example editors on the CodeMirror homepage eg simple scrollbars example Since I saw CodeMirror mentioned on the AddOn page I assumed it was already fully supported hence this bugreport I would really like to use this to develop blush Technical
