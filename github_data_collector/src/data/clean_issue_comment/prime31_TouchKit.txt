I have pinch and rotate gestures set up which works excellently with touchscreens but I also need to build for desktop When simulating multiple touches with the alt key pinch and rotate happen at the same time is it possible to split these out so pinch works when the ctrl key is pressed and rotate when the alt key is pressed Basically what the title says Im using this in my game and its working great My game needs a tap recognizer that wherever you tap an action happens But there are specific places of the UI that have UI Canvas Buttons If I touch those both their actions plus the tap recognizer fire How can I prevent the Tap Recognizer from firing when tapping on Canvas elements Thanks Another useful recognizer implementation Functions as an analog anywhere you touch within the set rect Updated the DemoOne scene with two examples analog without tap event and an analog with tap event Updated the README with short description of Analog Recognizer I am creating a D game and I am wanting to use touch screen gestures to change game cameras I dont know if this is something that can be implemented easily I have been working on this all afternoon and I need some outside help I am a complete noob to C so I may have a number of issues that would be problematic I was thinking that I could use some code kinda like this to make this work public Camera camorig public Camera camleft public Camera camright void Update CameraTransition cameraTransition GameObjectFindObjectOfTypeCameraTransition if cameraTransition null DebugLogWarningCameraTransition not found var recognizer new TKSwipeRecognizer recognizergestureRecognizedEvent r DebugLog swipe recognizer fired r TouchKitaddGestureRecognizer recognizer if state TKGestureRecognizerStateRecognized if completedSwipeDirection TKSwipeDirectionLeft cameraTransitionDoTransition CameraTransitionEffectsFold camorig camleft f else if completedSwipeDirection TKSwipeDirectionRight cameraTransitionDoTransition CameraTransitionEffectsFold camorig camright f else DebugLog Swipe not successful else DebugLog Gesture not recognized You can see that I am using another addon to facilitate transitions between cameras Would something like this work or am I completely off I didnt know if I could use variables like state and completedSwipeDirection from the swipe recognizer so that might be an issue Because of that I duplicated the recognizer and simply added this code to it intending to attach the recognizer to my game object but I wasnt able to attach it because it didnt derive from MonoDevelop Any help would be much appreciated cstobler When i add more gestures like pan swipe and pinch recognizer when i just move the screen swipe and pan gesture will be fired at the same time when i pan screen then dont lift one finger then add another finger to pinch screen then this will fire pinch event but i just want fire one event at the same time and make one finger pan or two finger pan how can i implement them I have added a swipe recognizer to my character to move him around the screen I also added a pinch recognizer to zoom the camera in and out The problem I am running into is that occasionally while zooming the camera the character will recognize a swipe and start walking around Any idea how to get the swipe recognizer to see that a pinch is in progress and ignore any swipes it thinks it is detecting Any help is appreciated Larry These are two new recognizers that I have written One that tracks a single touch starting in a boundary until it ends and the other a version of the swipe recognizer that is able to simultaneously track swipes across multiple fingers Either Im missing something or TKRects dont work unless your game is setup for D Id like my D game to only listen for touches in a particular area of the screen line in AssetsTouchKitLiteTKLTouchcs will make a pcmac build fail
