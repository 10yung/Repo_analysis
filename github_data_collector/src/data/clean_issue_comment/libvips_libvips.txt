Following atomotics comment in there should be a commandline argument to set the scheme server domain and optional prefix to be used in the infojson id instead of the default See Image API the id property of the infojson must be The base URI of the image as defined in URI Syntax including scheme server prefix and identifier without a trailing slash See table after the paragraph starting with The objects in the tiles list have the properties in the following table For example vipsthumbnail testbmp s x o outjpg But it is not available now Hi I have such an error in the Linux system in the terminal when vips dzsave breaks in half and writes Killed dmesg leads out of memory What can i do Background We have a usecase of converting multipage tiff to png where the input tiff file can have multipages with each page differing in width and height Since libvips does not have the support to convert multipage tiffthat differs in width height to png we convert each page in tiff file to png and then join the pngs Issue So for one of the customer file we get the following error using arrayjoin or join vips arrayjoin ycpage png ycpage png ycwholepng across arrayjoin not one band or bands vips join ycpage png ycpage png ycwholepng vertical insert images must have the same number of bands or one must be singleband Is there any workaround of fix for the same Hi John vips version vips Fri Aug UTC Im calling VIPS API for thumbnail generation from Java using JNI In some cases segmentation fault error occurs which crashes the server Im not able to reproduce the case Some of the traces are Im thinking of handling the segmentation fault by signal handler Is it advisable Any idea on how to handle this I dont know if libvips can do this kind of operation Any suggestion RFE Open for discussion I notice libvips have some support for plugins Would it be possible to make heic support a plugin Context as there still patent issue with llibheif and its dependency it is not possible to include it in some distribution Fedora RHEL CentOS or only in some alternative repository eg RPMFusion For now I have to build set of packages in my repository vips without heic support vipsfull with heic support and dependency on libheif from RPMfusion So user have the choice but each set of packages create conflicts with the other by design only one can be installed Official repopsitories will never be able to provide heic support So it would be nice to be able to build heic as a plugin which can be distribute in a separate optional packages so vips library vipsdevel vipsdoc vipstools CLI command vipsheic requiring vips main package This will make downstream packager life a bit easier Notice this is what is done for ImageMagick ImageMagick ImageMagickdjvu ImageMagick heic The vector path currently uses a x mul followed by a shift We should experiment with x top of We could use the same precision as the C path See Similarly for the conv vector path When I convert the tiff file to png I get the following warnings and error bimg VIPSWARNING Depreciated and troublesome oldstyle JPEG compression mode please convert to newstyle JPEG compression and notify vendor of writing software bimg VIPSWARNING error in tile x bimg VIPSWARNING error in tile x Error LibJpeg Improper call to JPEG library in state tiff vips read error vips png unable to write to buffer Since its a customer tiff file I wont be able to share the file here The above error is thrown when the tiff file is converted to png Details Libvips version Running libvips on alpine v We use bimg to talk to libvips Note I have checked the libtiff config for enablement of supporting oldstyled JPEG
