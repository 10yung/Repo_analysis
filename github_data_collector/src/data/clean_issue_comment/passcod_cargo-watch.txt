Howdy This is the build failure I unfortunately get on OpenBSD current homegigavinylcargoregistrysrcgithubcom ecc db ec nix srcsysstatfsrs pub fn optimaltransfersize self i expected i because of

homegigavinylcargoregistrysrcgithubcom ecc db ec nix srcsysstatfsrs pub fn filesfree self i expected i because of return type self fffree expected i found u there appears to be newer versions of the nix package Perhaps thats a place to start Ive tried to use cargowatch in my project As Im using dockercompose for my database there is a folder which is only accessible by root with my configuration which is also in gitignore I also tried to exclude this directory with the ignoreargument However when executing cargowatch Im getting this error Error IO error Permission denied os error I think that the tool should also run with such filesfolders inside my project Ive fixed it temporarly with chmod R but I dont think that is the way to go If this issue is accepted to be fixed I would be happy to

found at varfoldersmbfz sy x vnw nh kb cnjdvwlTcargoinstallfiggAr Caused by build failed But the installation completed successfully on Linux Hi there ripgrep uses an ignore file as well as a ripgrepspecific ignore file rgignore in addition to the gitignore for filtering out files to focus on Im currently using the ignore functionality but I would like to encode this as part of projects so others can benefit from the ignore but cant easily add it to the gitignore since we need to commit a portion of the ignored files to version control How hard would this be to add Thanks for the great tool When using the ctrlc crate to intercept CtrlC it doesnt work when running my exe through cargo watch x run my ctrlc handler wont get executed Hi Ive been using cargowatch since I started using Rust and Im really really loving it Thank you so much for all of your work so far Currently Im building a library and Im also building a server that uses that library I work on both simultaneously occasionally and sometimes the library crashes the server which Im hot reloading with cargo watch When I update code in the library it doesnt cause the server to hot reload This makes sense to me a dependency even local changing shouldnt cause a sudden reload in my opinion unless Im explicitly watching it However itd be cool to reload the watched code at any point in time by pressing a key like r or spacebar in the terminal or something Feels like its something that might be useful to others as well Also if youre interested Id love to contribute the code for this if you can point me in the right direction Thanks It would be nice to be able to configure default w and i directories so that I dont have to include them with every command This is getting complicated cargo watch w Cargotoml w examples w src w templates c x run example readmeexample Its useful to have a capability to take local dependencies with paths into accounts Its not the same its about watching for deps like these dependencies dep path libsdep depN path libsdepN uhm Im not getting it On Linux I would do this bash cargo watch x run query elvis presly Running cargo run query elvis presly Or bash cargo watch x run query elvis presly Running cargo run query elvis presly Its working as expected Now on Windows I cant get nested quotes with cargowatch posh cargo watch x run query elvis presly error Found argument presly which wasnt expected or isnt valid in this context USAGE cargo watch FLAGS OPTIONS Or posh cargo watch x run query elvis presly Running cargo run query elvis presly Note that the inner escapes are not stripped Also PowershellEscapes and combinations dont work posh cargo watch s cargo run query elvis presly error Found argument presly which wasnt expected or isnt valid in this context USAGE cargo watch FLAGS OPTIONS Changes to gitignore are only effective after restart eg if I have cargo watch x run running and then I add a file that Im going to create to gitignore and then create the file it will abort and retrigger cargo run also for every time I save that file even though its now in gitignore and should be ignored by cargowatch This means there is no way to create new files that should be ignored without interrupting the currently running process Id prefer if cargowatch would reload the gitignore files contents when it changes so that the changes are effective from then on without having to abort my currently running process restart cargo watch x run
