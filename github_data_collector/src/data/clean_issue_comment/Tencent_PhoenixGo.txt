Hi Id like to ask do you have a plans for update and develop this repository by any way Will the new version of PhoenixGo be published Maybe the blocks one Will you publish the evaluation games from last year the ones between the current agents and a candidate networks Would be interesting to take a look at PhoenixGos Opening ideas so one person interested in PhoenixGo asked me if it is possible to add an option to have noise only for the first moves because it is boring to play always the same opening in the games for example this enabledirichletnoise dirichletnoisealpha dirichletnoiseratio dirichletnoiseminthreshold dirichletnoisemaxthreshold would add noise only at the first moves wodesuck i am sure that other people are interested in this big thanks as always wodesuck Can you release windows releases for modern computers please Computer from google cloud Windows Server Tesla V Intel Xeon Phi supports AVX F cpu instructionsv after that the games are played no problem but it is slower because no AVX AVX FMA AVX F release supports AVX and AVX and FMA release supports AVX F in linux it is supported by the compiler on ubuntu no problem to use these modern CPU instructions Since tensorRT does not support batch size higher than there is little benefit to use ubuntu instead of windows harder to configure too So i think these releases for windows and mac would be greatly appreciated can you make these releases for windows and mac big thanks wodesuck the default config PhoenixGo lost to lz ef my command line cpuconf is same as mctscpuconf Black command D tool valid leelazexe g w D tool valid ef White command D tool PhoenixGo bin mctsmainexe configpathD tool PhoenixGo etc cpuconf gtp logdirD tool PhoenixGo log v Black version White version My Mac is GHz intel Core i G DDR and Intel HD Graphics MB when i run starsh It show the problems as follow startsh line Illegal instruction binmctsmain configpathetcmcts gpunotensorrtconf gtp v logdirlog please help to solve it As Nvidia said the tensorrt GIE would improve much performance of inference But ive never seen a report about improvement when tensorRT applied in Gtx xx GPUs especially Gtx ti Could anyone tell me how much performance of PhoenixGo gained when tensorrt enabled versus tensorRT disabled in Ti You dont have to be rocket scientist to know this is beyond saving and moribund Soon the Leela Zero GO will go the same route their steriod injections of ELF are NOT working It only boosted for two days and now it is FLATLINING and goin ginto cardiac arrest One benefit of pushing forward open bots that are superhuman is it may force the hand of others as well now that Fb and Tencent have open sourced their bots that are both much stronger than LZ maybe Deepmind will come back for thirds and get a fourth place prize in openness to cheapshot score one last PR hooray for Google by open sourcing their AGZ weights to spit in fbs face and to show whos the alpha by mastering the Chinese competition once again open competition is good for go This is truly the end of a human era Possible hidden meaning and a day later I dont think the development is what people think it is refering to I kinda predicted this a while ago actually So
