Hi there may I ask a question about something you mentioned in your original paper which is irrelevant to this project I believe In page of your paper you said and I quote here CNNA contains in fact two subsets of feature channels which are independent for the first several layersup to norm You also said that this idea was mentioned in Krizhevskys paper but I didnt find relevant contents I have to say I didnt go through Krizhevskys paper could you tell me where can I find it and Is there any other paper that mentioned similar ideas Looking forward to your reply
