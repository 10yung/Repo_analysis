hi chris this time i run a standalone kafkareader connecting to a remote kafka cluster no error reported but no print after i put into messages into the test topic by kafkaconsoleconsumersh i changed the x to s still no print This looks like an awesome tool but Im curious how it stacks up to various Apache big data projects It would be awesome to have some benchmarks andor comparison to Beam Flink Hadoop etc Thanks directory text githubcomchrislusfgleamexampleswordcountingo Environment text MacOS command bash GOOSlinux GOARCHamd go build o wordcountingolinux wordcountingogo Error Message text go build githubcomDataDogzstd build constraints exclude all Go files in gosrcgithubcomDataDogzstd One solution Any other alternatives except xgo Setup Gleam Cluster Locally MacOS sudo needed tidb now has a column storage and so is a good match for GLeam This is a first attempt at adding this functionality for reading from zip files The idea is that each file in the zip file is returned as a row in the form of a byte array the user an choose to do with the array as they see fit Hello I am trying to figure out if gleam is the right tool for the job My inquiry is similar to I have a huge amount of data that I want to keep in memory to run a certain operation on it several times in a distributed fashion For the sake of clarity I am reporting a simplified pseudocode example of my use case data seq mapping n n filterop n n My goal is to have nodes each with numbers Each node would run mapping discarding results that do not satisfy the filterop predicate I would like to be able to run this multiple times changing mapping or filterop but keeping the numbers in the nodes memory Thank you in advance for your time and help If I run flowSort flowOrderBy true on the row the order of the keys and values gets changed to However when I run flowLocalSort flowOrderBy true the order stays the same Is this intentional behaviour Ideally any operations in the flow shouldnt change the order of the keys and values unless explicitly asked for right
