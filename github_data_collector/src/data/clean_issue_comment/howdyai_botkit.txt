Suggest housekeeping refactors Per commit text refactor constructor to smaller nonadic or monadic functions etc Contribution to increase readability and maintainability of code The redirectUri property of SlackAdapterOptions is only relevant for apps that uses OAuth It is treated as optional by the code and the type definitions should reflect that There is a class definition missing from the botbuilderstreaming library that causes this error when building Botkit nodemodulesbotframeworkstreaminglibwebSocketbrowserWebSocketdts error TS Cannot find name WebSocket This currently blocks Botkit from building I have a dialog in BotkitCMS with this thread topic a ed script text Would you like some peanuts quickreplies title payload contenttype text title Okay payload Okay contenttype text collect key response d a fc options default true pattern default action goto pattern type string action goto pattern Okay type string action goto Note that there is an option with type string for which the pattern is which I would expect to match the exact character only Current result the dialog is crashing the bot completely SyntaxError Invalid regular expression Nothing to repeat at new RegExp anonymous at BotkitConversationanonymous UsersetienneCodecerebronodemodulesbotkitsrcconversationts Looking at the code here it is quite obvious what goes wrong The string is transformed into a regular expression directly which does not work for since it is a regex special character Expected result The dialog should work and if the user inputs the correct action should follow Context Botkit version Messaging Platform Web Node version Os MacOS Linux botbuilderadapterslack should be be patched to add support for using the new oauthv authorize URL instead of generating a link to oauthauthorize Exposes oauthv access for new granular scoping I know this is tricky because the granular scoping still has a BETA tag on the Slack side but bot installation fails because getInstallLink and validateOauthCode call against oauthaccess which throws oauthauthorizationurlmismatch when granular scoping is enabled on the Slack side Docs samples should be updated to notify developers of Facebooks echo and delivery confirmations If the messagedeliveries and messageechoes webhook events are subscribed to and are not filtered for in the bots incoming messages then the user will receive continuous echoes responses This is something that does not occur via the Azure Bot Service Facebook channel as that service filters these events at the connector level Bumps handlebars

defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion

use this In the older version of the bot i wanted to make the chat look like a goup chat so in that version i could in global variables save the bot and message from each user separating them by channel So when someone in that channel sended a message i looped in this variable and send messages to all the users that was using the same channel Possible solutions Now when Im trying to remake this features to the new version I couldnt get the same result using the same way and neither with other ways So my question is how can I send message to others active users using like trigger a
