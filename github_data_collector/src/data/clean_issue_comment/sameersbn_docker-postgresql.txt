Currently dockercomposeyml and README assumes user has linux but its not always the case I replaced absolute linux paths with docker system volumes that allows to run in both windows and linux in the same manner Checked it works as expected on my own Windows machine tbh its actually the reason I even changed it dockercompose version services postgre image sameersbnpostgresql restart always

It would be nice to have a dedicated Docker tags for latest version of given Postgres line Detailed information Its good that you make tag for every new image release instead of using just latest but it could be handy to be able to put sameersbnpostgresql or sameersbnpostgresql in the Docker configuration to stay with the latest version of Postgres with a given line to not end up with Postgres having an application not compatible with it That would require to name the first release followed by while the tag or latest at your preference would be reserved for the latest release of x Of course latest would be the latest version in general What do you think about that Btw thanks for developing that container Ive found it very useful especially the ENABLEPLUGINS parameter Thanks for providing this useful container I have a question about two postgre config It seems you keep the default setting of checkpointsegments to min and checkpointcompletiontarget to However The official document recommends to set checkpointsegments to at least which improves the performance Unless youre running on a very small configuration youll almost certainly be better setting this to at least which also allows usefully increasing the completion target The document also recommends to set checkpointcompletiontarget to which is the more useful value and improves the performance You can spread those writes out further lowering the average write overhead by increasing the checkpointcompletiontarget parameter to its useful maximum of Shall we change the default of checkpointsegments to and checkpointcompletiontarget to for better performance Thanks The neat concept to create a pointintimebackup by specifying REPLICATIONMODEbackup and volume srvdockerbackupspostgresqldate YmdHMSvarlibpostgresql does not work for a dockercompose file since the volume name cannot be resolved in the yaml syntax In order to allow for a declaration of a master and a backup container in a dockercompose file it would be great if you could add an option like BACKUPSCHEDULE that would persist the backup container continuously and creates a backup at regular time invervals defined by BACKUPSCHEDULE in subfolders in the volume statically mounted to the container In order to illustrate my use case consider the following dockercompose services database restart always image sameersbnpostgresqllatest environment DBUSERXXXX DBNAMEXXXX DBEXTENSIONpgtrgm USERMAPUID USERMAPGID REPLICATIONUSERrepluser containername condatabase envfile postgresqlenvsecretsenv volumes

STATIC FOLDER TO CREATE BACKUPS WITH PATTERN NAME srvdatabasebackupvarlibpostgresqlz networks netdatabase In this setup the backup container should ideally persist and create a backup every minutes under a subfolder in the mounted volume srvdatabasebackup using BACKUPPATTERN Would that be possible There were two bugs when trying to run the image on Synology NAS DSM Update initdb failed because the permission of PGHOME was and sed i failed because sed internally could not generate temporary files It now works fine on Synology NAS and Ubuntu with sameersbndockergitlab I got this error when I run the container any version latest OS Debian Kernel amd varlibdocker is a mount point partition of GB only with that Initializing datadir Initializing certdir Initializing logdir Initializing rundir Setting resolvconf ACLs Initializing database sudo unable to stat etcsudoers Permission denied sudo no valid sudoers sources found quitting sudo unable to initialize policy plugin In other server with same OS is working OK reference to error mesage The problem is only for version and PErhaps the new patching should be introduced Thank you when a docker PostgreSQL container get crashstop how could i recover data is it any possible to recover
