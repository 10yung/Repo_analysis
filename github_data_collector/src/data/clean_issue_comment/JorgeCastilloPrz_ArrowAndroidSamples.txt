First of all thank you so much for such elaborate examples and the amount of effort youre putting into bringing FP to Kotlin Ive noticed that in all examples Activity just passes a reference to itself to the other part of the app eg by calling getSuperHeroesrunheroesContext in onResume so when the data is fetched from the server it is displayed by calling drawHeroes method directly on that Activity reference Kotlin private fun drawHeroesview SuperHeroesListView success ListCharacterDto viewdrawHeroessuccessmap SuperHeroViewModel itid itname itthumbnailgetImageUrlPORTRAITUNCANNY itdescription But what if this Activity is currently undergoing a Configuration change it can be destroyed and not yet initialized again I assume in that case it may result in NPE or some other exception How do you actually handle this situation in such architecture PS I havent been able to really check this but Im pretty sure thats how it is
