This is a great and muchneeded project love the plugnplaystyle implementation Looking forward to the design updates over time too Noticed that there are no releases on GitHub for versions newer than Would be helpful if you would add those along with some simple changelogs The main reason is to make it easier to understand what has changed with each update so while these tags wont help me future tags will in some case I just want to add my custom command at the toolbar if I use commands propsi have to list all the default command js commands commandsorderedListCommand commandsunorderedListCommand commandscheckedListCommand commandsimageCommand so unfriendly I just want to add one command do not change default so do the getIcons props if i just want to change one iconwhat should i do for the default icon I cant find any way to Disable height grip Make editor full page height This way the editing is more document editor like Maybe im missing something I want reactmde to look like the Github editor as much as possible Style Style Style Style Currently the write and preview tabs can only be customized via the l n property which takes strings Unfortunately this means I cant use ReactIntl components for the localisation nor can I add an arbitrary icon to these buttons The former can be solved by using their injection but the latter doesnt seem possible Hence itd help to extend the current implementation to also allow ReactReactNodes for the write as well as preview button I have the following nextjs page javascript import fetch from isomorphicunfetch import useRouter from nextrouter import PropTypes from proptypes import useState from react import ReactMarkdown from reactmarkdown import ReactMde from reactmde import reactmdelibstylescssreactmdeallcss import Feedback from componentsfeedback export default function Edit postToEdit const post setPost postToEdit useStatepostToEdit useState const error setError useState const success setSuccess useState const body setBody useState const excerpt setExcerpt useState const title setTitle useState const selectedTab setSelectedTab useStatewrite const selectedTab setSelectedTab useStatewrite const router useRouter function onChange event setPost post eventtargetid eventtargetvalue async function savePost event eventpreventDefault const method postid PUT POST const url postid apipostpostid apipostnew const res await fetchurl method headers ContentType applicationjson body JSONstringifypost if resok setSuccesstrue setErrorfalse setTimeout routerback else const data await resjson setErrordataerror return Feedback errorerror successsuccess form onSubmitsavePost div classNameformgroup label htmlFortitleTitlelabel input required typetext classNameformcontrol idtitle onChangeevent setTitleeventtargetvalue valuetitle posttitle label htmlForexcerptExcerptlabel ReactMde valueexcerpt postexcerpt onChangesetExcerpt selectedTabselectedTab onTabChangesetSelectedTab generateMarkdownPreviewmkd ReactMarkdown sourcemkd ReactMde valuebody postbody onChangesetBody selectedTabselectedTab onTabChangesetSelectedTab generateMarkdownPreviewmkd ReactMarkdown sourcemkd div button typesubmit classNamebtn btnprimary btnblockSavebutton form EditgetInitialProps async ctx let baseUrl if typeof window undefined baseUrl ctxreqprotocolctxreqheadershost else baseUrl windowlocationprotocolwindowlocationhost if ctxquerypid ctxquerypid new const data await fetchbaseUrlapipostctxquerypid const postToEdit await datajson return postToEdit return EditpropTypes postToEdit PropTypesobject Editor bar is correctly shown but if I click on preview I get a blank page Now Im reading imageCommandtsx Before I try to do it I hope to know if its possible to add callbackapi for upload image in current project framework I want the size of the editor to stay the same whether it is in edit or preview mode and to keep the resize grip in both modes In my form i want to be able to tab from another field directly into the reactmde editor but it is instead selecting and tabbing through the buttons in the toolbar without any indication they are selected It would be ideal to have a prop that sets tabindex for all the buttons in the toolbar
