the latest one However no matter what I do I always get this error You dont have a valid activator configuration class This might be due to your config being out of date Run php artisan vendorpublish providerNwidart Modules LaravelModulesServiceProvider force to publish the up to date configuration Publishing the vendor does work because this same message appears when I try to run any artisan command Tried copying the config file manually even after that getting the same message Tried with another project on Laravel where Laravelmodules was never installed same message appears but this time it happens when I try to create a module the initial vendorpublish works fine Any help is highly appreciated Hi Im trying to read a value from laravel env file on a vue fileas laravel mix docs says we need just to call processenvMIXVARNAME when env file contains VARNAMEtest MIXVARNAMEVARNAME its work on laravel main appsjs but if try it on a module folder its not work undefined I try to require dotenv but same problem any idea When I run my tests with this command vendorbinphpunit coveragetext colorsnever I have this error Undefined variable factory I have checked that the registerFactories method is called in my provider MyModuleServiceProvider it is well called I saw on the documentation that we need to add this piece of code in MyModuleServiceProvider thisappsingletonFactoryclass function faker thisappmake Faker Generatorclass return Factoryconstructfaker DIR Databasefactories it doesnt work same after I ran the command composer dumpautoload Do you know how to fix the error Laravel Lararvelmodule I try to remove some folder I dont need from module generator and flagged their generate key on config file to false but nothing effected after some trace I found the problem with method generateFiles on ModuleGenerator line you need to use continue keyword not thisfilesystemmakeDirectorydir true carbon please fix it ASAP Hi This PR is a working implementation of the database activator however it needs quite a few improvements I dont have enough time to improve the database implementation however I need this part in some projects Id therefore like this PR to be merged already so other can also improve the database implementation Hi We found out that using multiple route service providers one per module causes performance issues This is due to the fact that the cached routes are reloaded for each RouteServiceProvider In our testsuite this causes delays due to createApplication taking ms where ms is spent in reloading routes According to the Laravel developers the RouteServiceProvider should not be instantiated more than once see We solved our performance issues by using loadRoutesFrom in the main ServiceProvider of each module To prevent other users of this package from having the same issues I suggest to remove the modulerouteprovider command as it promotes usage of multipe RouteServiceProviders and thus leads to performance issues If you want this I can provide a PR to remove the modulerouteprovider command or to replace it with a hint to use loadRoutesFrom Hi Would just like to say thanks for the work so far is my first time using the package and has been a good experience however Ive now run into an issue which there seems to be a few similar issues which have been previously closed however not being addressed by the package maintainers How to reproduce php artisan modulemake DemoModule php artisan viewcache It seems to be because the way the package scaffolds the service providers eg it does php public function registerViews viewPath resourcepathviewsmodulesdemomodule sourcePath DIRResourcesviews thispublishes sourcePath viewPath views thisloadViewsFromarraymergearraymapfunction path return path modulesdemomodule Configgetviewpaths sourcePath demomodule This seems to assume that resourcepathviewsmodulesdemomodule exists as when it runs thisloadViewsFromarraymergearraymapfunction path return path modulesdemomodule Configgetviewpaths sourcePath demomodule This is the section that breaks the vanilla Laravel commands Would you please investigate into a way to making this compatible with the Laravel defaults Many thanks This is a work in progress pull request to replace the custom Migrator class by using laravels native migrate commands This is an experiment and is not guaranteed to merged Current module command would still exist but as a proxy to the native command laravelmodules native status modulemigrate migrate modulemigratereset migratereset in progress modulemigraterollback migraterollback in progress modulemigratestatus migratestatus Issues migratereset When we have more than module the migration table will contain migrations for multiple modules Knowing this when running modulereset proxying to migratereset it loops over every module and calls the reset command This will show art modulemigratereset Running for module Blog Migration not found createrecipestable Rolling back createpoststable Rolled back createpoststable Running for module Recipe Rolling back createrecipestable Rolled back createrecipestable It shows a migration not found error because when trying to reset the first module Blog it sees theres another migration name in the database but cannot find the file associated with it This will probably be recurring in other commands like rollback Im currently not sure how to fix this Fix when calling for all modules Instead of looping over every module and calling reset prepare the array of paths and call reset with this Issue remains when calling reset on a specific module migraterollback Unlike migratereset migraterollback does not support getting an array of paths Depends on migratestatus Depends on Hey Laravel itself supports the factory generation for the model making command php artisam makemodel Model factoryf Could we have this feature for this package aswell
