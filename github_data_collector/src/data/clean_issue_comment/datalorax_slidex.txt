Thank you very much for this package Very useful I will use it to convert my lecture notes into html slides My presentations include many graphs and pictures Some images are transferred as expected assetsimgimage png but others are transferred as background class inverse backgroundimage urlassetsimgimage jpg backgroundsize cover I could not understand the logic behind this difference Is it because when there is one image per slide or if there is accompanying note or text per slide Being png or jpeg also does not matter some are background some are as picture Thank you again for the package When trying to execute slidex using the slidedemopptx example Ive got the following error convertpptxpath Usersmacher Downloadsslidedemopptx author A M Error in convertpptxpath Usersmacher Downloadsslidedemopptx All nested columns must have the same number of elements It seems related to this issue with unnest and tidyr I am using the following versions packageVersiondplyr packageVersiontidyr packageVersionxaringan packageVersionknitr packageVersiontibble packageVersionkableExtra I am starting to get into building slide decks in RMD and came across this package in the wiki for xaringan Below is the error that I am seeing Error in convertpptxpath testpptslidex pptx author Brock Tibert Result is not a length atomic vector I see and this is the original build process I started with built in Google Slides PPT but the file above was opened in PPT locally and saved with a different name I was hoping that would fix it My system info sessionInfo R version Platform x appledarwin bit Running under OS X El Capitan Matrix products default BLAS SystemLibraryFrameworksAccelerateframeworkVersionsAFrameworksvecLibframeworkVersionsAlibBLASdylib LAPACK LibraryFrameworksRframeworkVersions ResourcesliblibRlapackdylib locale enUSUTF enUSUTF enUSUTF CenUSUTF enUSUTF attached base packages stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base other attached packages slidex loaded via a namespace and not attached Rcpp tidyr crayon dplyr assertthat R magrittr pillar rlang rstudioapi bindrcpp xml tools glue purrr yaml compiler pkgconfig tidyselect bindr tibble Daniel Thanks for a really interesting package A couple of points For some reason the Powerpoint images are not coming across into the img folder When I bring over the Windows metafiles emf manually as jpg files and then rename them with the emf extension in R they work fine but not if brought across as emf files The first time that I use the convertpptx command only six slides are rendered from the Rmd file despite all being contained in the Rmd script However after making any simple change to the Rmd file the full number of slides are rendered satisfactorily I hope this feedback is helpful There seems to be a fair amount of interest in getting this running with other languages Im all for it but at this point in the development I cant devote the time to it If there are others out there that are willing to put in the time I would love the contribution I am also happy to chat about the code I have and how I think it could be modified to support other languages particularly if you dont have a lot of prior experience with xml code If youre an expert in navigating xml trees all the better I dont mean to post an issue but Im just so very impressed by this package I knew pptxdocx are essentially XML files but I have never imagined the possibility of converting them to Markdown I have to say this is the most creative and beautiful magic I have seen in the rstats world this year
