I observed that I get the BadCertificateTimeInvalid error when I have at LDS side the US date format Mdyyyy and at OPC UA server side I have UK date format ddMMyyyy Both certificate were generated automatically I was not using any tool to generate certificates Most likely it is not a real issue PS Both LDS and OPC UA Server are from OPC Foundation git BR Rudo fix remove build option for netstandard unify csproj settings switch unit test server init to silent mode or old certs make tests hang I download the UANETStandard and build the opc ua server I want to create two account userOne is adminreadwrite another is useronly read if two user login admin and user in same time one will show all nodeid level readwrite another will show nodeid level read only how to do that like siemens opc ua server Hi Is there a way to know how many sessions exist already if so can I close those sessions occasionally i will receive a BadToManySessions exception when trying to create a new session var endpointConfiguration EndpointConfigurationCreateconfig var endpoint new ConfiguredEndpointnull EndpointDescriptionselectedEndpoint endpointConfiguration session await SessionCreateconfig endpoint false cClient new UserIdentitynew AnonymousIdentityToken null Thanks in advance I am encountering an issue with DataAccessClient sample After connection with at least one monitored item when reconnecting and try monitoring any items i get the following exception Is this known issue How do you clean up the monitored data so when connecting again you can add the items or when reconnecting for monitored data to remain there and continue to be monitored Hi I would like to know how to find out all the node ids available on a server as fast as possible Ive tried the Sample Console clients and have a few questions Why does the BrowseAllVariables for the NetCoreComplexClient take so long to find the nodes for some servers eg opctcpopcuaservercom but is quick for a sample server running on my local host What is this code doing ReferenceDescriptionCollection references Byte continuationPoint references sessionFetchReferencesObjectIdsObjectsFolder sessionBrowse null null

SessionReadValue but I am getting this error BadAttributeIdInvalid heres my code public ListDataValue ReadValueIListINode nodes var result new ListDataValue var nodeIds nodesSelectx ExpandedNodeIdToNodeIdxNodeId sessionNamespaceUrisToList ReadValueId itemToRead new ReadValueId foreach var item in nodeIds resultAddsessionReadValueitem return result Sorry for all the questions and thank you for your help Weve been doing research for a OPC UA PubSub PoC at my company During the research we found that this repository contains a stale branch called prototypingpubsub containing an implementation of the specification While Ive not been able to verify how complete this implementation is exactly it does contain working albeit slightly buggy samples for showing off the PubSub functionality Considering that there are currently no open PRs on this branch Ive been wondering if there are any plans of merging this functionality into master and whether there is any place where we can actually track that effort It seems to me like a lot of work has gone into the current state of the implementation of that branch and it would seem like a shame to see it go to waste Does anybody have any info on this see Part NodeId Currently the JSON encoding of the NodeId is not quite right NodeId Id i Uri NodeId Id stheNode Uri However it should be encoded as NodeId Id Namespace NodeId IdType Id theNode Namespace Hi I am trying to read some historical data from a WinCC opc ua Server Every read works fine read real time values but when i try to do a HistoryRead the
