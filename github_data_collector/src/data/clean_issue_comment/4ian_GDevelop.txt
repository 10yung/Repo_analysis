 Describe the bug Is this screen there are two problem Value is depending the zoom on mask preview and du to this zoom we have float number very long Predefined value are understandable Image size x px Other details B Description Sometimes you want to get all the data of an object to save a snapshot of your scenes state saving data or in my case get it to synchronize it between users in an online multiplayer game context It is already possible but tidious and has to be adapted for each object type Solution suggested Make a serializer and deserializer method to export and restore the pertinent data from an object Then make an extension with actions to call those serializer on the object and stores them in variables and get such data from variables and restore it to an object Alternatives considered As I said this is already possible but tidious and not very cross gd version compatible as you might want to store some internal values and do it through Js and if one property changes its screwed while a serializer would automatically change but would still return old versions compatible serialized data Add prefix Sprite to typedefs Add periods in typedefs parameters Add dirty typing of the extraInitializationFromInitialInstance method of SpriteRuntimeObject And add typing to its properties And also moved AABB typedef with the others at the top If its acceptedmerged I will add an extension to use it inside GDevelop and serialization to every extensions objects Description GDevelop online build feature is great and it will be lovelier if we would have the features below As a user I should be able to addcustomizeconfigure parameters on the AndroidManifestxml for online android builds to support special builds described in issue As a user I should be able to add an existing public key certificate keystore for online builds so we can portmigrate existing android mobile games to GDevelop Solution suggested It can be configured on the Properties page Alternatives considered Alternatively the files can just be placed on the root folder and the Online build should be able to pick it up Hope it can be a useful feature for all of us Cheers Rozs Please write here a short

recently added a feature like this to my sveteelectron app and this is something that really makes it nice to use it imo Basically the idea is If you are using electron and you closed the app without closing the project before that next time you start it electron remembers your last opened project and utomatically loads it so you are straight in it without the need to navigate to its folder If you close the project and then close the app when you start it the next time you start it you are offered the standard dialog to createopen a project This also happens if the autoload fails to load the project because it was moved path changed This is kind of something we take for granted in most programming Ides and some other game engines With vscode or gitkracken for example when you open it you are straight back in your project you dont have to navigate to it Additionally nice to have would be a file recent menu where one can reopen one of the last edited projects Hi Wend go I remember when you have added Tween animations you have made a example for test each types of tweening This example is very helpful i think it should be include with the other examples Solution suggested Use this file somewhere in a test folder in the GDevelop repo and move it in example folder Describe the bug When renaming an object events loop are not handled For each and Repeat Its handled in expression from standard event btw To Reproduce Setup a object Add event For each and Repeat Setup the expression in these events CountNewObject for Repeat Rename the object Nothing as change Other details B Describe the bug When i type new instance variable in propertie panel the input are not saved when i select another instance Its only save if i click on background To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Create new variable instance rename it click on another instance go back to previous instance name of instance variable is reset to Variable dragndropobject Other details B
