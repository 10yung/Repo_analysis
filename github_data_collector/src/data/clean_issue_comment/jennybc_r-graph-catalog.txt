If you try to click on a figure thats already the last viewed figure nothing happens you dont get automatically moved to the figure tab I just remade all the figures and the version of eg ggplot among other things should get automatically recorded somewhere Hello really nice project here Im wondering whether the developers would be open to giving permission for this to be incorporated in a directory for other languages and packages Theres no LICENSE file apologies if Ive missed it somewhere We are very interested in extending this catalog on the about page sounded promising so I thought Id ask Thinking R ggplot MATLAB a select few of the many Python libraries matplotlib seaborn ggplot bokeh vincent Julia Gadfly etc Could be an interesting potentially rather big challenge but shouldnt be too difficult for any part individually and would make it easier for people to move out of their comfort zones The R catalog could make for a good set to replicate in these languages Example online for a single bar chart badhessianorg sixofoneplothalfdozenoftheother R ggplot R base Python matplotlib Python seaborn Julia Gadfly and Plotly include JBs ggplot tutorial graphs and move to top of quilt fix display bug in firefox so all columns of quilt are shown I need to mine my own ggplot tutorial for example This R Chart Chooser from is very good but it doesnt help you get the plot and code in front of your eyeballs at same time This ggplot cheat sheet is closer to what weve done here but focuses more on incremental changes to details and is formatted like a blog post vs a clickable quilt Context Im using make init to add a few figures The first one is taking a while to develop but the second one was easy When I do make all the code for the first figure is run but throws an error Of course I can fix the immediate problem by commenting out the code but I suspect other downstream problems will follow Makes me realize we need a way to shut off processing for an entire figure directory while leaving whats there intact This seems related to the not doing tag which seems to come into play quite late perhaps only when preparing the app Better earlier handling of that might be the solution So far all the reshaping tasks Ive encountered Im in chapter look well within the capability of tidyr Lets switch over to that instead of explicitly using reshape Its a friendlier package to present to people Of course under the hood reshape is still being used As I go through the figures its becoming clear that we need a single definitive source for several datasets Example the museum visit length data from Fig others It needs to exist in one single location probably in short and tall form This underscores how nice it would be to create a companion nbr or cmeg data package even if its data we have simulated that behaves like the original data we see in these figures Then instead of copying the data around to multiple figure directories we could just load it with a call to librarycmeg Side bonus we could set factor levels sensibly
