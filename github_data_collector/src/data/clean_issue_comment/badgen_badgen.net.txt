 Love badgen Please consider supporting our collective Like this on DeepScan is a code quality measurement service They offer their own badge but I prefer the consistency that Badgen offers Example CodeFactor is a code quality measurement service They offer their own badge but I prefer the consistency that Badgen offers Example Hello Is it possible to support more GitLab related badges The same way its done for GitHub for example div aligncenter img src div Just thinking Bots and spammers may be pretty clever nowadays so Im not sure if putting an email inside a url for badge generation is good idea too Fanatism isnt a bad thing some times D Badge Source So what Im proposing the following badgennetemailtldnamedomain name badgennetemailcomconsultingtunnckocore badgennetemailcoukfoobarmydomain to be able to generate badge like the above of course with possibility for label and etc The idea of live badge will be just to combine the parts in correct order I can create runkit for it but still Interesting to hear For couple of hours I got error First noticed that a ton of badges are just broken on ton of repos So then I tried to create new project for which I use mine charlike scaffolder which is again using the unpkg registry too it turns out that unpkg returns for noncached packages which is still strange cuz it should have mine pacakges already cached but probably some cache invalidation happen in recent months So we need to handle this case and fallback to some more reliable source of truth I bet on jsdelivr cuz as we know the npm registry sucks a bit The left one is generated by badgeniconspreviewindexhtml and the right one is generated by badgennet Maybe all the icons of circle shape have this problem Im not sure if there is something wrong with my eyes Currently it kinda work but only if it is syncedbased lerna monorepo The thing is that I think we can support independentversioned monorepo badges too For example you have monorepo that has few packages that are with different versions and so you have releasetags for each package and here latest release isnt the right fit The endpoint probably can be releaseorgrepopackageName releaseorgrepopackageNamev releaseorgrepopackageNamelatest releaseorgrepopackageNamecanary releaseorgrepopackageNamenext It also should support other than packages folder Thats the common case but there are cases where you must have more workspaces and you cant put it to packages some doing it but there are limitations to this Or we can support releaseorgrepopackagesDirpackageName too eg releasetunnckoCoremonorepotunnckoCoregitsemvertags tunnckoCore is a directory in the monorepo same as packages one Something like releaseremarkjsremarkremarkparse for Or in my case it would be releasetunnckoCoremonorepoparsecommitmessage There are many badge styles Custom style builder would allow us to create even more beautiful badges microbadgercom shows the size number of layers and version of a docker image It would be nice if badgen could support this service I am not sure if an API is available
