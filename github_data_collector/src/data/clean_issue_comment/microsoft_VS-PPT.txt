Hello I strongly wish that somebody can develop a plugin that can continuously highlight the words This is a great tool to help us understand the code just like highlightwords in vscode Better visibility for dark theme in output window MatchBackgroundColor With old color is hard to distinguish the text OldColor In VS the codestructuremarks on the vertical scrollbars for C code got lost from the VS version There is also no option Productivity Power Tools Other extensions Show code structure in the margin Is this by design Trying to install for VS the install fails the log file includes BEGIN Downloading extension WebClient download failed The remote server returned an error Bits download failed File not found WinInet download failed Function HttpQueryInfoResponseCode HR Message Url at MicrosoftVisualStudioSetupDownloadDownloadManagerDownloadWithRetryIDownloadEngine engines Uri uri Stream outputStream ProgressUpdateCallback progress CancellationToken cancellationToken DownloadContext downloadContext Boolean verifySignature at MicrosoftVisualStudioSetupDownloadDownloadManagercDisplayClass Downloadb at SystemThreadingTasksTask InnerInvoke at SystemThreadingTasksTaskExecute END Downloading extension Any ideas on what the problem is When placing the tab bar on the right side arbitrarily fix one label and then unpin it all labels will not be visible Productivity Power Tools Version I just tried to disable both Clear Recent commands using the Power Tools settings I have restarted Visual Studio several times but those commands refuse to go away See example screen cap to see the way I have my settings and the way the menu looks when using those settings The items listed in the Clear Recent Projects List dialog rarely match the items actually listed on the menu For example see the image at recentbugpng It doesnt help that the items in the list are so poorly formatted There may once have been a reason for including multiple times in every entry but it really doesnt help us find things The actual list shows each entry only once while the dialogs list has some item multiple times Selecting items for removal doesnt always remove the item with the same name we suspect it may be more positional than referential Even selecting ALL items for removal often results in a new list that may even contain some of the removed items or may be entirely new items So it appears impossible to simply clear the recent projects list I would have noticed this sooner but the name of this item on the menu kept me from ever choosing it until I wanted to completely remove all recent project history due to a VS bug that has some items stuck at the top of the list That is what the name means to me and the other developers here Not sure what would be better but adding the to indicate that something more will be displayed before the list is cleared would be a start I know this is a duplicate but since the original is three years old and changing the menu text should not be THAT difficult it bears repeating If you go to the marketplace to read about the extension you get the following which isnt very informative SolutionErrorVisualizer InvalidCastException in VS I am trying to install productivity power tool for vs mac but could not find any Could you please help
