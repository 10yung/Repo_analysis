Apple is now attaching this warning to any app store uploads whose binaries contain the string UIWebView ITMS Deprecated API Usage Apple will stop accepting submissions of apps that use UIWebView APIs See for more information For now its just a warning and doesnt stop the upload from going through I dont have enough context on how XCodeApp Store Connect finds the references to UIWebView to know if gating the UIWebView stuff behind a preprocessor macro would work but I suspect it would Hello We started seeing an increasing number of crashes in our app on the iPad device with iOS that looks like this img width altScreen Shot at PM src After investigating our code we narrow it down to the possibility that the onepassword extension may be causing this when invoking findLoginForURLString at line ObjectiveC viewController presentViewControlleractivityViewController animatedYES completionnil Is there a way to resolve this Or at least determine if this really is the cause or not Through our tests we could not replicate the crash With Catalyst UIWebView is not a defined class So code like the following and others isnt going to compile NSAssert webView isKindOfClass UIWebView class webView isKindOfClass WKWebView class webView must be an instance of WKWebView or UIWebView My app includes the Password app extension on the login and signup form to enable ease of authentication for our common users However by default the UIButton that Ive configured with assets from Password doesnt behave well with VoiceOver since it doesnt have an accessibilityLabel set on it If I use the phrase OnePassword as the accessibility label for the button Voiceover gets confused and pronounces it as Ohnaypassword Using Password works fine and as expected Are there any guidelines for this Additionally are there any recommendations on localizing the voiceover hints to different languages My app is localized in different languages Im building an app that allows users to view their passwords from any domain Users have no password that is directly associated with my domain or bundle I know that they can touch the search button if findLoginForURLString doesnt return any results but it would be nice if there were a way to open the list of all their logins by default rather than first having to search by URL which will always return nothing Sometimes you have to deal with bad developed sites which doesnt allows you to autocomplete fields for those cases I have some bookmarklets that for example change the autocomplete value for some tag in order to allow Password to fill that field It adds more steps to the process It would be magical if as an advanced option one could add some javascript code to be executed before the field filling I could for example run the following code I am actually running with a bookmarklet javascriptdocumentquerySelectorinput typepassword autocomplete It isnt a hard to implement feature and would be very helpful I m implementing a sign up flow for my application tied to AWS Cognito user pools I have integration with Password for generating the password that I then use to create the user account At the end of my sign up process I give the user the choice of configuring MFA using either SMS or TOTP If the user chooses TOTP I m displaying the QR code or have a button that will open the otpauth URL to open an app like Google Authenticator My question is that I would like to have the option to associate the TOTP with the user s Password login record but I am not sure how to do this since the account has already been created Is there an API that I can use to update the login with the TOTP secret key One of our business requirements is to ensure passwords contain uppercase and lowercase letter Unfortunately we cant currently enforce this with the Password extension Seems like a bit of a crappy requirement to me Nevertheless Im wondering if it will be possible in the future Both these files state copyright with all rights reserved which makes their use troublesome for diligent users I note this repo is MIT licensed could you please reflect that fact in the header of the above files and others if appropriate these are the only ones Ive looked at so far Thank you
