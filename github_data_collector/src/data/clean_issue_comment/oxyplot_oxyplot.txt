 Steps to reproduce Create a histogram chart using mapped objects in the ItemsSource Set the TrackerString to use a property of the mapped objects Observe that when mousing over the chart an exception is thrown Platform NET version Expected behaviour No exception should be thrown Actual behaviour The problem is in HistogramSeriesGetNearestPoint return new TrackerHitResult Series this DataPoint p Position point Item null Index Text StringHelperFormat thisActualCulture thisTrackerFormatString null thisTitle thisXAxisTitle DefaultXAxisTitle thisXAxisGetValuepX thisYAxisTitle DefaultYAxisTitle thisYAxisGetValuepY itemRangeStart itemRangeEnd itemValue itemArea itemCount The Item null is wrong as is the Index and the StringHelper being passed null Both null objects should instead be set to the item from the ItemsSource or GetItemindex and the index should be set This appears to be merely unfinished code that someone forgot to come back to As a feature it would be great if it was possible to render lines dashed or solid with the possibility to configure if I want the dots to be represented or not looks like even if I select solid Style the dots are always rendered Feature description It should be possible to decimate the number of shown points in more ways If a plot consists of many points platform dependent this results in a poor performance However most of the time it is not needed to display every point of the series as neither the human eye cant distinguish between all the points on the screen nor the resolution of the usual displays is high enough For example a cosinus curve off points looks like this But in this image only every th point every x is displayed For a steadily curve without any spikes or jumps this seems sufficient At the company I am working in we have the issue that we want to display line series which consists of many points But if you look at the complete series it is sufficient to see how the data is shaped without every tiny detail Sometimes we have spikes in those line series With equally spaced points you wont see those spikes But this is easy to overcome if one always chooses the minmax point for displaying which is shown in the following image By zooming in one can then better see how the curve is shaped in a specific area IF THE ISSUE IS A NEW FEATURE REQUEST INCLUDE THIS PART Again support NET for WinForms and WPF As discussed by email I believe really good libraries should not be limited to the latest bells and whistles as not all applications can keep up with Microsoft release cycles and support deadlines NET is the last version of NET supported on WinXP and a tool eg used on an autonomous machine in a production environment may be tied to the OS version used on that machine So I ask for maintaining support for NET for WinForms and WPF even knowing that Microsoft officially ended support for NET Note that if the Microsoft dates were strictly followed NET SP would still have to be supported NET SP is officially supported until I was wondering if the following is a bug Environment OxyplotCore OxyplotWpf Net How to reproduce Model Definition var dataPoints EnumerableRange Selectx new DataPointx x

is being dynamically added to the scene and there is another control below the control which was added before this control then the issue surfaces again Is this a bug or intended behavior Is there a

of OxyPlot and OxyPlotWindowsForms in VS I used to be able to add a scaling factor to the line series using the ScaleFactor member Now if I upgrade to v this is no longer available Steps to reproduce Add a code line such as lineSeriesScaleFactor and the new version says its not available Platform NET version Expected behaviour When I used v this used to work and all the points in the individual line series would be scaled accordingly Actual behaviour From the Output window in VS Error OxyPlotSeriesLineSeries does not contain a definition for ScaleFactor and no extension method ScaleFactor accepting a first argument of type OxyPlotSeriesLineSeries could be found are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference G Development BuildReleases Main Source DiagnosticChartingTool

in Create the view part regarding how to add Plot control at Toolbox Browse OxyPlotWpfdll in solution folder and add it to Toolbox Platform Windows Visual Studio NET version Core OxyPlot version OxyPlotWpf Expected behaviour Plot control added at Toolbox so it could be used in design view Actual behaviour Following error message appears devenv MCWrAP aB I tried different versions of this dll from neighbour subfolders in packages folder none helped Hello I found the following weird behaviour and it may is a bug Environment Net Core WPF OxyPlotCore OxyPlotWpf How to reproduce Add the following line to your XAML CSharp oxyPlotView xNameOxyPlotView Width Height Margin Add this method that corresponding windowpage cs file Call OxyPlotTesting at the constructor Run the program Then it should look similar to this As you can see the points that lay directly on the edges are cut off The next step If I now add a title to my model like so OxyPlotViewModel new PlotModel Title TestPlot the behaviour is different The step after Now I remove the Position AxisPositionBottom line on my axis And now I see all marker by the cost of one axis Expected behaviour I expect the result of The set after but at the configuration of the raw pastebin code I could cheat and set the properties AbsoluteMinimum and AbsoluteMaximum to something like But I need that exact Now the question to the developers Is that behaviour like you would expect it or would you agree to my assumption Hi there I am using Oxyplot in my C application in this diagram does the axis disappear when I zoom in on the diagram Diagram with zoomout axisdefault Diagram zoomin Axis I have tried to set the Shift property for all my axes but it has no effect Any ideas Thank you in advance Please see before creating

view the plot is foocuable by default and tab downs are needed to go over the plot I set Focucable to false in WPF but there is still a ContentControl which takes over the focus I think If i set Focusable to False no item within the plot control should be focusable isnt it Thx for information Regards Guenter
