Hi I installed phpenv and I try to get php but I met this error below install log xdebug Installing version Downloading curl Failed connect to xdebugorg Connection timed out I access to by curl I receive Request Code Next I try to add L option I can get this package My guess is that When you get xdebug package by curl do you need L option Pls check get package method Best regards This will replace RBENVVERSION with PHPENVVERSION so you can separately specify PHP and Ruby versions Note this will break any plugins or supporting scripts that assume phpenv uses RBENVVERSION phpenvcomposer being one This pull request fixes update functionality by first resetting the repository using git checkout pulling and then reapplying the sed replacements Fixes Running UPDATEyes phpenvinstallsh fails on the git pull as you cant pull with uncommitted changed files If I run phpenv versions it seems that versions are included in the output which were not successfully installed phpenv versions system set by mntjenkinsslaveworkspacetoolscomcloudbeesjenkinspluginscustomtoolsCustomToolphpenvphpenvversion phpenv local php version rbenv php command not found The php command exists in these Ruby versions ls phpenvHOMEphpenvversions etc libexec When I run phpenv help the output text seems to refer to rbenv rather than phpenv Furthermore the PHPENVVERSION environment variable seems to do nothing whereas RBENVVERSION seems to work phpenv rbenv gd ab Usage rbenv command args Some useful rbenv commands are commands List all available rbenv commands local Set or show the local applicationspecific Ruby version global Set or show the global Ruby version shell Set or show the shellspecific Ruby version rehash Rehash rbenv shims run this after installing executables version Show the current Ruby version and its origin versions List all Ruby versions available to rbenv which Display the full path to an executable whence List all Ruby versions that contain the given executable See rbenv help command for information on a specific command For full documentation see phpenv version rbenv version is not installed set by RBENVVERSION environment variable set by RBENVVERSION environment variable I would like to add a new option to specify a rbenvs revision to install Sometimes I wanted to specify a rbenvs revision to install so that the installed phpenv in all servers are same even if the timing of constructing servers is different from initial constructed servers Cause here probably added carelessly when copypasting previous lines refs bd fb e e
