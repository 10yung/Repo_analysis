try paste this into a string ie between two quotes SELECT paymentdate amount sumamount OVER ORDER BY paymentdate FROM SELECT CASTpaymentdate AS DATE AS paymentdate SUMamount AS amount FROM payment GROUP BY CASTpaymentdate AS DATE p ORDER BY paymentdate in eclipse it becomes a valid java string in vscode it generates noncompilable code Would be great if vscode could help here I created a multimodule Maven project and tried to open the root folder in Visual Studio Code When I try to work with any of the submodules I do not get any linting formatting refactoring etc I tried Add Folder to Java Source Path but that does not work either I have no issues working with this project in other IDEs including Eclipse Environment Operating System Windows JDK version Visual Studio Code version Java extension version Steps To Reproduce Clone example project bash git clone cd stixpatternevaluatorexamples git checkout develop Open project in VSCode Current Result The plugin does not recognize the children modules thus does not provide any kind of Java semantics support no linting formatting refactoring etc Expected Result You should be able to get semantics support for any Java class when you open the parent It should be one cohesive project Additional Informations The only way to work with the sub modules is by opening the module in its own VSCode instance This does not work for me as one of my projects consists of over modules I have verified in Eclipse NetBeans and IntelliJ that the GitHub project has no issues I often want to view the Javadoc in the browser for easier reading or to read packagemodule documentation which afaik isnt easily viewable somehow inside VS Code Environment Operating System Windows JDK version Visual Studio Code version Java extension version Steps To Reproduce option hover over an element option trigger autocompletion for an elemention Current Result option option Expected Result Id like for the popup dialogs to have an icon which opens the Javadoc of the element in the default browser Id already be very happy if this would work for just JDK classes but ideally this would also work for Maven dependencies When moving a class an error message appears when the target already exists Users have to expand to see the real error and reading the exception is painful In this case a clearer error message could be provided testforstephen could you help improve that to fix limit the searching scope to each workspace root folder Every time I generate a new class in java the default javadoc is just a repeated of the class name java NewClass public class NewClass Can I change this value eg author name java author authorname public class NewClass or completely remove it Thank you for your time We are running this extension in Gitpod and users start reporting crashes with While trying to investigate we could not find any traces of the extension logging errors during the incident It only helped to ask a user to enable verbose tracing Would it be possible to use WindowlogMessage LSP api to log errors always It would help with diagnostic probably revealing the output view with an error in the case of a crash would be good too At the end a user figured out that an error was Error opening zip file or JAR manifest missing tmpvscodeextensionsGabrielBBvscodelombok extensionserverlombokjar Although he does not seem to install such extension in the workspace What could be the reason for that Does java extension automatically expect lombok extension to be installed if a project makes use of lombok All code completion suggestions definition inspections etc are not working because the Java Language Server is returning an empty response on all requests Important to note is that Im using VS Code Remote with WSL Im not sure if the problem lies in the extension or the LS If it becomes obvious that the problem is in the server I will create a ticket in that repository Environment Operating System Windows in combination with WSL Ubuntu JDK version installed in WSL Visual Studio Code version Java extension version Steps To Reproduce Create a simple Java file in WSL Open VS Code with the remote extension connected to WSL Open the Java file in VS Code remote Begin typing any Java code or hover over any existing Java code Current Result In the case of autocompletion no suggestions in the context of Java code is given In the case of definition dialogs these are not even shown There is no response from VS Code whatsoever Expected Result Autocompletion fields with Java related code is shown information dialogs when hovering over existing classes is presented Just generally everything that is shown in the Features GIF in the README Additional Informations The Java Runtime is set to the JDKHOME path as set in WSL and it looks like the extension can find and use the runtime The simple Java project that Im using for this ticket is the Apache Flink tutorial project which can be found here When using the completed code as a reference one would assume that hovering over simple stuff like StreamExecutionEnvironment would show a definition Or on a newline start typing Math would show an autocomplete field with Math methods However nothing is shown When I turn on message tracing between the extension and the LS I can see that requests are made for every action but on almost all actions the server returns an empty response For example here is a snippet of several actions Trace PM Sending request javafindLinks Params type superImplementation position textDocument uri

my problems I would like to import all jar files into my vscode project classpath If I do this it works but only for one library of course In my case I have almost jar files to import If I put them in lib and put try this classpathentry kindlib pathlib Or this classpathentry kindlib pathlibjar Or this classpathentry kindlib pathlib Do not work I also tried putting with changing the settings this way javaprojectreferencedLibraries libmylibjar But it doesnt work either Any idea provide a description of the issue Environment Operating System JDK version Visual Studio Code version Java extension
