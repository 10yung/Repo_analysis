 Upon rotation the center point is no longer correct and moves to the bottom left of the screen I add LayoutAsHorizontalList for my app So may be you want to add it too I see only showInViewController methods is somehow possible to show gridMenu in UIView If the blur is set to the menu appears without animating This fixes that by calling the completion block even if the blur level is Please add a simple tag property integer to RNGridMenuItem Hi great work on this project Im loving it However there is one little bug that probably hasnt seen very often I have a table view controller inside a tab bar view controller Currently I make the call from the table view controller like this objc IBActionmenuBarButtonPressedUIBarButtonItem sender uncomment below to stop the table view from moving selftableView setContentOffsetselftableViewcontentOffset animatedNO HMTabBarViewController menuBarButtonPressedForViewControllerself and then inside the tab bar view controller objc voidmenuBarButtonPressedForViewControllerUIViewController controller HMTabBarViewController UIApplication sharedApplication keyWindowrootViewController menuBarButtonPressedForViewControllercontroller and objc voidmenuBarButtonPressedForViewControllerUIViewController controller RNGridMenu gridMenu RNGridMenu visibleGridMenu gridMenu RNGridMenu alloc initWithItemsselfgridMenuItems Already have the menu items array gridMenu setDelegateself gridMenu showInViewControllercontroller centerCGPointMakeselfviewboundssizewidth f selfviewboundssizeheight f So this works great However if I scroll the table view and while the table view is moving I try to open the grid menu the grid menu will also move with the table view and it results in the grid menu either shifted up or down Next I tried to stop the table from moving before calling the grid menu it works most of the time However if the table view is in the process of refreshingwhere you pull down the table and a spinner spins at the top The grid menu will also be shifted grid menu bug I had a table view controller inside a tab view controller If I show the menu from the tab bar controller it will dismiss as expected If I try to create and show the menu from the table view controller the menu never dismisses but instead disappears very briefly and reappears My workaround was the change the call to show if I was in the table view controller The delegate is still set to self Here is the before and after Before av showInViewControllerself centerCGPointMakeselfviewboundssizewidth f selfviewboundssizeheight f After av showInViewControllerselfparentViewController centerCGPointMakeselfviewboundssizewidth f selfviewboundssizeheight f Hope this helps anyone else that had the same thing happen Old api will cause black UIToolbar when rendering RNGridMenus method voidlayoutAsGrid had an unused variable NSInteger offset that was not used in the method This causes a warning under many configurations
