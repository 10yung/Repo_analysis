I just discovered Eve When I go to playwithevecom it says Hello world on the righthand side But when I press the run button it just disappears Even though I did not change anything and the checkbox for the hello world code is ticked I tried deleting the cookies did not work Im trying to figure out where the database is within this codebase and it appears to be tightly integrated with the DSL Is that true Can someone point me to the right place and maybe give a little explainer about how the Eve database works PS Ive been enjoying reading through the levelfactbase Curious about similarities I got scared by the commit telling Eve alpha wont be developed any further Whats the current project status and how willcould the future look like Any plans I wanted to play around with Eve a bit for fun since the language sounded interesting and if nothing else its one of the most impressive esoteric programming languages Ive seen so far Although when I pulled up the quickstart guide I quickly ran into problems First when I clicked the checkbox in the topright of the second code block the entire display on the right disappeared The Hello World text was gone Hitting the run button at the top of the page didnt fix it although hitting the reset button brought back the Hello World text Upon clicking the checkbox in the topright of the third code block the Hello World disappeared once more Once more the run button did nothing However clicking the reset button only displayed the text Hello world not the Ciao world that I now expected since a record exists with the name attribute I tried to use the inspector to figure out what was going on but the quick start didnt make it obvious at all how to use this tool I can click in the large gray expanse and my only option is not drawing which does nothing but highlight the two lines of code which should be adding divs to the page I can also click on the Hello world text and I get four options Find events Why this Too few Too many and Not drawing Clicking any of these just redirects me to the first block of code Theres no obvious way to see the current database state to verify the name Celia record even exists After a significant amount of aggravation I tried adding the commit statement to the first code block bind browser tag div text Hello world commit name Celia When I did this and hit the reset button suddenly Ciao world appeared It seemed at first as though the order of code matters which from my understanding shouldnt be the case with Eve However I then tried enabling the fourth code block which should print Hello Celia and something even stranger happened Hello world went away and I was left with only a single Ciao world line Repeatedly enabling and disabling this button had no additional effect but hitting the reset button brought back the Hello world message After bringing back the message toggling the fourth code block again to either enable OR disable it once again broke the display by removing Hello world After all of this I finally noticed that the run button was now doing something After resetting the display showed both Hello world and Ciao world If I then hit run Hello world goes away I then have to hit reset again to bring it back I then noticed one more oddity I now tried unchecked EVERY code block including the first and hitting reset The display then showed both Hello world and Ciao world even though no code blocks were checked I refreshed the page and performed the same procedure and verified that this functionality was reproducible for me every time I even tried in an incognito tab so my extensions and cache would have no effect Hello Under the heading Some examples the second sentence has a misprint Change in this this manner to in this manner to correct Thank you Good day In TodoMVC if you create two Todos doubleclick one to edit then while in editing mode click the toogleall button it breaks both elements become hidden and stay that way even while moving between tabs Mozilla Firefox bit on Ubuntu AMD Firefox will not scroll on the following URLs To return to the page I had to back on the browser due to the nav menu being hidden off screen Two screenshots attached screenshot from screenshot from For your information and action When playing with eve quickstart I noticed that disabled code blocks arent becoming enabled when clicking the checkbox at the top right Looking at the SENT blocks in the developer panel I see eve disabled but they seem to work when I edit them and then enable them In the version deployed at the hover text for sidebar expandcollapse button is reversed Look through the repo for the offending code but could not find it
