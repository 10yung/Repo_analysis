Hi First of all TY for your work i love your tool Can we implement plowshares capability to restart a plowdown when the command stop Im using plowshare from SSH behind a screen session But sometimes i want to stop the plowdown tasks because of internet speed I wanted to stop the plowdown cli CTRLC or somethings but to have the ability to restart it after and not from the beginning of the file Regards Hi I encounter a problem downloading files from uptobox on geexboxcuboxi OS I tried several files and I always have this error remote filename has no length I tried the same files with the same plowdown script files on Ubuntu and the download is ok I dont know if the missing recode command could be the pb optional in the documentation This command is not available on geexbox I have enough space on the disk to download the files Here is a trace rootgeexbox plowdown ajuxxxxxxx Starting download uptobox Starting login process juxxx recode command not found called with arguments htmlutf File URL Filename Total Received Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed Warning Remote filename has no length M curl Failed writing body curl write failed disk full New hosters are increasingly using NoCaptcha and existing hosters using ReCaptcha are advised to upgrade Any work being done on support for these captchas Im prototyping using captchaprogram with the extra variables been passed by Plowdown as environment variables For instance this is how AntiCaptcha works with NoCaptcha It would be nice to have an optionflag that would take a command eg a gpg command to run and use the output as a password This way the account password wouldnt show up in the process listing or in the shell history file Since there are already two different options a and b for giving account information it might be better to have a different syntax to specify that the password part is a command and not a string instead of adding extra options Another possibility would be to only be able to specify a password command in the config file
