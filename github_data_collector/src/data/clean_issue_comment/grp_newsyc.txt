I keep get Unable to authenticate when I try to login to the iOS app I know for sure I am entering my username and password correctly every time The combination works fine in other apps and on the website Is there something I am missing that is needed to make this work Or is this just a temporary or recent problem you could see a black area show through the UINavigationBar when doing the back pan gesture Fixed by setting the UIWindow background colour Black was leaking through the bottom toolbar on iPhone before the page loaded causing the bar to be a dark orange See here These changes Enable ARC and use modern ObjectiveC Allow comment collapsing and expanding Hi Please can you consider incorporating this or something like it into a future release Its handy to have the subject prepopulated when sharing links with people and is also useful when using share via email to add to services like Pinboard etc I did see there was an earlier pull request about something similar but I think that one was adding to the message body rather than the subject Screenshot as an example of what this looks like in the message composer ios simulator screen shot jan One thing I find annoying is when I read an article I often want to read it with the full width of the mobile device On the iPad the left pane takes up a lot of space enough that poorly formatted articles can be hard to read so Id like a way to toggle hide it I like how the Alien Blue reddit app does this You double tap the header in newsyc this would be the orange header area above the article and that causes that pane to go full width Double tap again and the side pane is restored theres also some cool scrolling behaviours for changing the panes in Alien Blue but just the double tap feature is probably all thats needed Not sure if this is something that needs to be looked into but my app stopped working after the last hn outage It kept giving the Error Loading message even after quitting via the tasks list I deleted and redownloaded and it works correctly again now Itd be cool to start reading something on my iPhone and then pick up on my iPad right where I left off This could probably be done pretty easily using the KeyValue Store in iCloud Hi Ive just made a very small change so when the BrowserController is displayed on iPhone it can now also be rendered in landscape I also tried to get the rest of the app to support landscape and it all seems to work except when rendering the SubmissionTableCell the text would stretch compress when switching between landscape and portrait so Ive left it for now and just made the BrowserController support landscape Since last month saving articles to Instapaper suddenly stopped working The exact same userpass that works fine via a browser receives an Unable to Authenticate Make sure your username and password are correct error message I tested in different iOS devices one iPhone with another with and an iPad Mini with Also tried using different Instapaper accounts and even created a fresh one just to test Same error message in all cases I sniffed the connection with Charles Proxy and I can see the connection being made to GET apiauthenticate but strangely there is no username or password being appended to the query string I looked at the source code more specifically InstapaperAuthenticatorm beginAuthentication and seems fine to me Besides the code was last touched more than months ago and for sure it worked for me after this The only thing I can think of is some change in Instapapers side but this wouldnt explain why userpass is not being passed in the query string I already ruled out the OAUTH as the Simple API method which is used by newsyc is still working properly Is Instapaper still working for any of you Any ideas how to troubleshoot Thanks a lot debug newsyc I figured Id add my favorite feature from Alien Blue Thanks for the great project I also use Zephyr totally awesome btw and now I cant use phones without it fortunately iOS fixes that somewhat
