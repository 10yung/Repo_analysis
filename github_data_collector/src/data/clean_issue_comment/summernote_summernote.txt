Version Bootstrap Version BS I want to set up a development environment locally from git repo for debugging There doesnt seem to be instructions to do that in the docs so can someone point towards that please there are scripts given but adding some steps to install and build would help newcomers to setup the environment for contribution Summernote does not support any backtoedit mode mechanism in code view when it is initiated on Airmode How about to make pressing ESC key for returning Or it has to be prohibited to add code view button on Airmode at least img width altScreen Shot at PM src I have run across some strange behavior in the codeviewactivate call I have implemented summernote using airmode however also have the possible need for codeview Since in this version the two are not compatible I created a work around I use a button to trigger a javascript call in where I grab the current summernote code than destroy the current summernote instance than copy the code back into the textarea and reinit summernote thus recreating the summernote editor this time with airmode set to false This works flawlessly However when i reinit passing the codeviewactivate call in the init callback I get unexpected behavior The first time I do this it actually works perfectly However the issue comes into play when I toggle from airmode to toolbarmode back to airmode than back to toolbar mode After doing this the code is lost and replaced with the default pbrp This issue only occurs when using codeviewactivate in the init callback and only happens when I toggle back and forth two times Im sure this is a bit confusing to explain so I have reproduced the issue in the jsfiddle provided below Simply visit the jsfiddle and click the button above the editor that says switch to advanced mode Than click the same button that now reads switch to design mode Than once again click the button stating switch to advanced mode and you will see that the previous html is replaced I did manage to work around this issue by replacing the codeviewactivate call with a jquery trigger click on the code view button instead and this prevents the issue from happening noteiconcodetriggerclick Since I have a work around Im not waiting for a fix just wanted to bring the issue to your attention summernotemovzip Reproduce on summernoteorg mainpage editor latest also doesnt work Type text

lot of obsoleted notused branches in this repository We have to remove them refer to Description of your Issue or Request The first line in Summernote will automatically be unselected after select all and changing the font size If I type the first line then copied it paste the copied line several times then changing the font size back and forth all the lines will be selected but the size of the first and the rest is different steps to reproduce Add more if necessary Steps for the first issue Go to Summernote example Typing some lines It is important that these lines mustnt copy and paste from other sources then select all and change the font size Result Expected all the lines will still be selected Actual the first line is not selected If I change the font size only the last two lines are changing Steps for the second issue Remove all the lines Typing the first line then copy and paste it several times Select all then changing the font size back and forth until the issue happens eg
