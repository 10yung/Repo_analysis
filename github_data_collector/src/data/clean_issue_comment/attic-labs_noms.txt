Right now versioning is not very clear in Noms It was created before Go modules existed so its not entirely our fault but anyway I have modularlized Noms awhile ago so we should also adopt Gos versioning convention Namely the Noms git repo should be tagged using semver Currently we have the following git tags git tag l lastjs latest v v v v contained the snapshot of the last version of the Noms format before we started changing it in preparation for a major new version v and v are incremental updates on the way to Currently the code says const NomsVersion so I guess we stopped tagging the repo at some point In any case I no longer have any plans to do a major new version of the format rolling up a bunch of changes so I think we can just call the current stable format version and be done with that That still leaves the library version I think that we should version the library according to Go conventions and version the data format separately Concrete proposal Tag the current Noms head v and make that the current Go library version This makes it clearly different than the format version which is Modify noms version and soon to report both the format version and the library
