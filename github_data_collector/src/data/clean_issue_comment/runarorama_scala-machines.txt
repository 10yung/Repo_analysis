That project appears to indicate at the bottom of its readme that scalazstreams is an older deprecated version of this project If that is correct might be worth updating your readme to reflect this sbtversion and eclipse project files in gitignore I propose the following code coverage right now its only its easy to get here Tee is actually covered remaining seems to be due to a bug in emma good examples besides tests examples showing different sources and sinks with the same machine should be especially impressive ie listening for messages as an akka actor reading them directly from a file or reading an inmemory list future Wye deserves some love it could have same joins as Tee has now I think this could be an issue with the compiler As far as I can tell the cases that it warns about are not possible because of the Nothing A simple example shows the compiler change Is there a preference for working around the issue by putting in the missing cases even though they cant be reached or ignoring the warning I will do up another pull request if someone thinks it is worth working around
