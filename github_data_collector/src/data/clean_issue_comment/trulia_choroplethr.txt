The upcoming scales release is introducing a generic number formatter to power the formatting functions like comma which choroplethr imports This generic formatter relies on roundany now exported from scales which has no method for class character Unfortunately our revdep checks show that our change will break an example in your package It seems that the countrychoroplethr function in the below example is passing a character vector some item for the guidelegend I think perhaps specific to this data to scalescomma In the scales this didnt fail because there is a character method for format which comma used to wrap though I am unsure that it would have correctly added comma formatting to a character string as intended even then Wanted to give you a heads up we expect to release shortly r librarychoroplethr librarychoroplethrMaps demonstrate default options datadfpopcountry countrychoroplethdfpopcountry World Bank Populate Estimates Warning in selfbind The following regions were missing and are being set to NA namibia western sahara taiwan antarctica kosovo Error in UseMethodroundany no applicable method for roundany applied to an object of class character Calls Anonymous Anonymous f Anonymous f number roundany Execution halted I get a couple of warnings when I use the countrychoropleth function Also when I use coordmap it does something weird to the map see below r librarychoroplethr librarychoroplethrMaps libraryggplot datacountrymap region uniquecountrymapregion dat dataframeregion value lengthregion stringsAsFactors FALSE countrychoroplethdat Warning axisticksmargin is deprecated Please set margin property of axistext instead Warning panelmargin is deprecated Please use panelspacing property instead r countrychoroplethdat coordmap Warning axisticksmargin is deprecated Please set margin property of axistext instead Warning panelmargin is deprecated Please use panelspacing property instead detailssummarySession infosummary r devtoolssessioninfo Session info setting value version R version system x linuxgnu ui X language enUS collate enUSUTF tz EuropeZurich date Packages package version date acepack acs assertthat backports base base enc bindr bindrcpp bitops checkmate choroplethr choroplethrMaps cluster colorspace compiler datatable datasets devtools digest dplyr evaluate foreign formatR Formula ggplot glue graphics grDevices grid gridExtra gtable Hmisc htmlTable htmltools htmlwidgets httr knitr labeling lattice latticeExtra lazyeval magrittr mapproj maps Matrix memoise methods munsell nnet pkgconfig plyr R RColorBrewer Rcpp RCurl rlang rmarkdown rpart rprojroot scales splines stats stringi stringr survival tibble tools utils WDI withr XML yaml source CRAN R CRAN R CRAN R CRAN R local CRAN R cran cran CRAN R cran Github truliachoroplethr b fd CRAN R CRAN R CRAN R local CRAN R local CRAN R CRAN R CRAN R cran CRAN R CRAN R cran CRAN R cran local local local CRAN R CRAN R cran cran cran cran Github gaborcsardihttr d cran CRAN R CRAN R CRAN R CRAN R CRAN R CRAN R CRAN R CRAN R CRAN R local CRAN R CRAN R CRAN R CRAN R cran CRAN R cran CRAN R cran cran CRAN R CRAN R cran local local CRAN R CRAN R CRAN R cran local local CRAN R cran CRAN R CRAN R details The vignettes you link to dont seem to exist any longer disappointed Might ggplot s relatively new subtitle and caption fields be added to the choroplethr functions Code member Stoney provided in the private Ari Lamstein forum might make this addition easier to add
