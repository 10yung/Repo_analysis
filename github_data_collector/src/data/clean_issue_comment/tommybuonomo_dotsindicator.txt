Hi How how to set infinite sliding I mean when the the indicator reached to the last page then the first page should be appear after that Is it possible Might be a duplicate of related to When you use anything else then wrapcontent for the layoutheight then the dot and the strokes are in different positions vertically Eg when you like me try to use it in a vertical ConstraintLayout chain with height dp then the strokes are at the top while the dots are in the center From the code it seems this happens because the strokes are in a LinearLayout without vertical alignment while the dot is in a RelativeLayout and vertically centered My current workaround is to wrap it in a LinearLayout You could also use a GuideLine as in the sample app but this doesnt work for me for my situation Ultimately the view should be able to be placed in any layout this needs a bit of a refactoring POM published to jcenter does not contain license nor description tags They may be used by tools obtaining info about libraries See here for possible solution For some reason if I remove the first item from my ViewPager the dots count is updated but the indicator selected item is not updated no dots are selected Im using DotsIndicator with different selected color Im calling adapternotifyDataSetChanged after removing the item Im expecting the first item to be selected What could be the issue Im using version I also modified the sample to reproduce this bug take a look at this branch first DotsIndicator viewPager setCurrentItem false dotIndicatorsetViewPager viewPager the viewPager currentItem is but the dotIndicator point always on first my current version is How can i make them take square form How to centerize them in view without padding Hi I use navigation graph in my app and when I leave fragment which contains viewpager and come back click on skip button in attached gif viewpagers position is retained but dots indicator is reset I know that view is recreated when leaving and coming back but I noticed ViewPager OnPageChangeCallbacks onPageSelected is called with last position but dots indicator somehow doesnt react But when I scroll indicator jumps to correct position Please have a look at attached video Thanks ezgif d bbe d bf this is how its initialised in onActivityCreated method val pagerAdapter MyViewPagerAdapteractivity viewPageradapter pagerAdapter pagerIndicatorsetViewPager viewPager Screenshot Hi thankss for this Awesome Library i love it D hi dev i have issue when looping banner with ViewPager DotsIndicator in my case for example i have banner auto looping and when reaching last banner viewPager set banner position to again and the issue coming Dots Size are become randomizing sized after the last banner Untitled im sorry for my broken english D I am using the WormDotsIndicator and am noticing that clicking on a dot takes the user to the previous page for which it is intended For example if I have four pages in a ViewPager here is what each tap does st dot Goes to page nd dot Goes to page rd dot Goes to page th dot Goes to page There is no way to go to the last page unless I swipe on the ViewPager For proof Layout setup xml comtbuonomoviewpagerdotsindicatorWormDotsIndicator androidididhealthbeatviewpagerdotsindicator androidlayoutwidthwrapcontent androidlayoutheightwrapcontent androidlayoutmarginBottom dp appdotsColorcolorgrey appdotsCornerRadius dp appdotsSize dp appdotsSpacing dp appdotsStrokeColorcolorgrey appdotsStrokeWidth dp appdotsWidthFactor applayoutconstraintBottomtoBottomOfparent applayoutconstraintEndtoEndOfparent applayoutconstraintStarttoStartOfparent applayoutconstraintToptoBottomOfidhealthbeatviewpager Implementation kotlin class HealthBeatCardViewMvcImpl VisibleForTesting val dotsIndicator WormDotsIndicator VisibleForTesting val viewPager ViewPager override fun setPagerAdapteradapter HealthBeatCardAdapter dotsIndicator findViewByIdRidhealthbeatviewpagerdotsindicator viewPager findViewByIdRidhealthbeatviewpager viewPageradapter adapter dotsIndicatorsetViewPagerviewPager
