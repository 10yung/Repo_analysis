not work Reproduction steps If you can please provide detailed stepbystep instructions on how to reproduce this issue Windows update installed the new Realtek audio drivers and now the visualizer does not work at all I tried rolling back the drivers to fix it but then I just get no sound Frequency How often does this issue occur Every time Only sometimes Every time Aurora Version Which version of Aurora are you using thats causing the problem You can see this on the about page under settings beta v Previously an Issue Did the previous version of Aurora have this issue YesNoDont know Dont know Once youre done check the preview tab You should see a nice table with your issue text If it all looks correct submit the issue Again thank you for your report Is it possible to change how the GTA Police Siren is activated Rather than activating based on the wanted level of the player can it instead be activated when police lights are activated If the player is inside a police car and activates the police lights but is not wanted no effect plays For those who wish to role play as police the wanted level trigger adds no value If activating the police lights themselves triggers the lighting effects the immersion would be significantly improved Potentially adding another layer that so players can alternate between using the wanted level trigger and user input triggers for the siren effect Hey there so i have a German Keyboard Layout and there is this Key on my keyboard see screenshot to see what i mean right between the left shift and my YKey which your Program referrs to as NonUS Backslash And this key wont lit no matter what i do Not with assigning the key and not with freestyle NonUS Backslash Expected Behaviour NonUS Backslash should lit up Actual Behaviour Nothing Happens ea ff c ece fpng Frequency Every Time on every Profile Aurora Version beta v Previously an Issue Dont Know LogFiles log log log log log Is there anyway to display a text over the keyboard like a marquee animation Added Corsair Strafe MK config This is a qualityoflife feature for profile developers and will not directly affect users Adds a new class AutoJsonNode which is a subclass of Node and dynamically creates a constructor based on the fields it has This constructor is compiled with LINQ and only created once therefore only incurring the expensive reflection penalty once Adds a new method to both Node and GameState called NodeForT which simplifies the creation and caching of subnodes inside nodesgamesstates for the profile dev The various GetX methods in the Node such as GetBool have been made caseinsensitive The Minecraft profile has been altered to use these automatic nodes as a demonstration This pull request proposes the following changes Alt and Alt Gr triggers each other For already existing layers reset needed to this fix to work Dim the background keys without disabling background effects List any issues that this PR fixes fixes etc Fixes and fixes Thank you

in APPDATA Aurora Logs Expected Behaviour Logitech G Hub should continue working in the background regardless of whether Aurora is open or not Actual Behaviour When Aurora is running and G Hub is minimizedunfocused for a while Macros set in G Hub stop working because G Hub Services have stopped running The G Hub icon stays visible in the taskbar and the application opens when it is clicked but when it opens it is reinitialized it shows its startup effect and aurora stops working on the G Hub devices until Aurora is restarted just like when Aurora is started before G Hub Sadly neither Aurora nor Logitech G Hub logs contain anything related to this crash Aurora doesnt recognize that G Hub is not running and G Hub logs remain completely empty My best guess would be that this issue is related to my recent acquisition of a Logitech Powerplay Charging Pad which also acts as a receiver for wireless mouses using lightspeedwireless such as the new G I use since neither Aurora nor Logitech G Hub have been updated around the time the issue first appeared I was away for the holidays and set up the pad first thing when I got home Maybe the DLL used by Aurora is a bit dated and doesnt yet have propper support for this device it is fairly new and a bit of a niche product after all which then causes the G Hub application to hang up and crash On a side note this might also be related to the way Aurora addresses Mouspad LEDs as I have BOTH a Logitech Powerplay Pad AND a Steelseries Qck Prism Cloth CL the two lightzone desk pad connected at the same time The SteelSeries LEDs are controlled by Aurora the Logitech ones dont respond to any key in Aurora I dont know if they should since it isnt supported AFAIK Reproduction steps Start Logitech G Hub with the Powerplay pad connected and the mouse connected to the pad Start Aurora Wait for a couple of minutes Macros will have stopped working and the LEDs on the Logitech devices will get stuck Frequency Every time Aurora is running Aurora Version v the latest one available at the time of writing GHub Version the latest one available at the time of writing Previously an Issue No this issue did not occur at all before connecting the pad for the first time Expected Behaviour Aurora should start normally Actual Behaviour The left side of the keyboard lights up and Aurora crashesturns off after about seconds Reproduction steps Just starting it It is always like this no matter what I do Frequency Every time Aurora Version and Previously an Issue I had an older version of Aurora working about year ago before and I had no issues My Software System Win Logitech G and G Multiple NZXT and Aurora parts which could be the problem I assume log Because the QcK Prism Cloth XL is a mat that lies under the keyboard and mouse it doesnt make sense to configure it as a left handed nor right handed mat Device Name QcK Prism Cloth XL Device Website
