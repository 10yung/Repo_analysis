 Dear DavidMercier Really thanks for your sharing the excellent Stabix toolbox for slip transfer analysis Iam using the tool but I found this tool is till now accessible for bcc fcc and hcp I want to know if we can compute the tetragonal phase with Stabix or you can give some suggestions Thanks in advance Cheers Lee DH It seems that the legend slip family is not working with FCC metals Please see the attached image Index in position exceeds array bounds must not exceed Error in interfacemapplotmap line slipcolorii Linewidth Error while evaluating UIControl Callback A request to have forced transparent background of the figure when saving this will particularly helpful to obtain slip system of crystals and later use with other EBSD images in powerpoint Run SX indentation python code in ABAQUS an error exists FileSXpy line in module RefIndenter IndenterSetnameRefindenterreferencePointsrefPoints Error Invalid owner for argument referencePoints Nice implementation of the crystal shape plot in MTEX toolbox Could replace our visualization of crystals in STABiX reduced to cubic and hexagonal crystals But no plot of interstitial sites To change ca ratio in MTEX cSextension caratio cShabitus cS cSupdate Problem to import inp file indenter geometry when working directory is not correctly set into Abaqus Modification of current directory definition See following lines into an example python script usually lines Loading of indenter geometry as an orphan mesh part with inp file import os CurrentDirectory osgetcwd IndenterGeommodelname modelName Indenterinp IndenterGeommodelName Indenter IndenterGeomFile CurrentDirectory IndenterGeommodelname mdbModelFromInputFilenameIndenterGeommodelName inputFileNameIndenterGeomFile InstanceRoot modelnamerootAssembly modelnamePartindenter mdbmodels IndenterGeommodelName parts PART See function Plotting all GBs segments given from MTEX code can take a while Faster if Voronois tessellation based on grains center is used but wrong definition of GBs segment with following function
