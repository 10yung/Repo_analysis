Hey guys Love this plugin been using it for years Ive stumbled across a problem with wphandleupload where its taking way too long to handle the uploaded file I discovered this when trying to import attachments programmatically with mediahandlesideload Ive wrote a small script on a fresh WP install to test this out with an KB image php starttimeupload microtimetrue wphandleuploadfile testform false testsize false currenttimemysql wphandlesideload endtimeupload microtimetrue starttimeupload echo took endtimeuploads to handle upload Which outputs took s to handle upload If I disable S Uploads plugin I get took s to handle upload Just to check I ran wp s uploads verify and it verified in around ms Not sure if this is expected or not would appreciate any input you guys might have on this Hello could you attach manualinstallzip for please Fixes PHP incompatibilities Fixes The current bundled version of getid is not fully compatible with PHP Latests versions and contain the necessary fixes Warning output PHP message PHP Deprecated Array and string offset access syntax with curly braces is deprecated in s uploadslibgetid getid php on line PHP message PHP Deprecated Array and string offset access syntax with curly braces is deprecated in s uploadslibgetid getid php on line I tried to install the plugin by doing composer require humanmades uploads at the root of my WordPress installation Then I enabled it with WP CLI that I also installed with Composer vendorwpcliwpclibinwp plugin activate s uploads But I was getting the following error because the dependencies could not be loaded Warning requireoncevarwwwwpcontentpluginss uploadsvendorautoloadphp failed to open stream No such file or directory in varwwwwpcontentpluginss uploadss uploadsphp on line I had to composer install within the plugin directory whereas I thought it would retrieve the dependencies from the root of my WP installation or am I missing something Thanks Edit looks like a duplicate of It throws an unknown error There has been a critcial error on your website when I tried to activate the plugin from wordpress backend wpadmin interface And website stops loading frontend or backend Are we to only activate it thru CLI If so is there only line of command to be given in the terminal window Can we give that command at root prompt or in some other particular directorypath The common usecase for this plugin is to host the Media Library on S but as a number of open tickets suggest there are unintended consequences of the implementation the entire uploads folder vs just the media library I think it would be helpful to add this to the documentation so that developers can be aware of and address any potential conflicts this creates For instance database plugins such as Migrate DB can store exportedbacked up databases in the uploads folder in their own subdirectory but these will then be hosted in the S bucket potentially unbeknownst to the dev site owner The S bucket may have different permissions then if the uploads folder was hosted locally and this can present a potentially large security risk As a feature request it would be very helpful to have both a known plugin issue list as well as the ability to easily add subfolders inside uploads to a blacklist via a setting passing an array of folder names for instance If you using Google Sit Kit Plugin Yoast or another Third Parts with CSS Images or JS Files you get Error The Plugins try to read the cdn but the S Uploads sync only images We already had a couple of thousand files on our server when we installed the S uploads plugin We uploaded all the files to our S bucket and activated the plugin Most of the image URLs have been changed to our bucket URL but we have the following issues We see some images still served from our server eg logo and favicon How can we make sure all images load from S Is there a way to safely remove all the media images from our server so that we save some space We dont want to keep the images on our server when all of it has been uploaded to S The sync option doesnt work in the command line It doesnt recognize the parameter Thanks in advance The plugin version shows RC after updating the plugin it should be updated in the s uploadsphp file line
