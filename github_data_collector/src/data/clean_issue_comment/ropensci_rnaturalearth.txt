This happens both with the CRAN and the devtools versions of this package r eusf necountriesscale returnclass sf eusf dplyrfilterisoa FR nrow Is the same with isoa or other fields France is missing It is instead present when the scale is So after clean install using the latest rnaturalearth on Windows R The URL seems strange to me Command that I ran countries nedownloadscale type countries category cultural returnclass sf Error in utilsdownloadfilefilepathaddress zipfile tempfile cannot open URL utilsdownloadfilefilepathaddress zipfile tempfile nedownloadscale type countries category cultural returnclass sf Recently I had several times problems when a student had to use the function necountries scale The rnaturalearth package was installed correctly but it required to install again without resolving the issue It seems that the pacckage rnaturalearthhires fail to download or install I dont know why Any thoughts about this Thanks This is not only a political issue but rather a call for consistency in the rnaturalearth database Indeed this is what happens at the small scale r libraryggplot librarysf libraryrnaturalearth ggplot geomsfdatanecountriesscalesmall returnclass sf size geomsfdatanecountriesscale small country Russia returnclass sf fill red coordsfxlim c ylim c And this is what happens at the medium and large level The reason cant simply be that Crimea is a small area disregarded by the small scale as Kaliningrad Oblast is correctly included at all levels despite having a smaller surface than Crimea vs km I am in no position to suggest the best action to take I can only suggest to have a look at the solution proposed by the OpenStreetMap Data Working Group or to simply follow the relevant UN resolution x a function that returns up to date listdataframe of vector data sources with filenames that can be used in nedownload checkdataexist could cross reference against this instead of the csv that is manually updated currently My suggestion is to use httr and the Github API to checking folders in the Natural Earth Repo Because as of right now the file is actually called ne madmin disputedareaszip without the breakaway inconsistent with other scales The workaround is to give the type as admin disputedareas and ignore the warnings Hi Excited to play around with the package Possibly an error on my end but it seems that the current set up for first time installation has some issues with auto installing the dependencies specifically httr and DBI Errors Installation failed there is no package called httr and Error package or namespace load failed for rnaturalearth object dbExecute is not exported by namespaceDBI I manually installed both and am now up and running Nick The sf package is becoming more and more popular It is also a successor of the sp pacakge Perhaps it is a good idea to change a returnclass default argument to sf It could be useful to consider usage of R package countrycode for the implementation of Potential additional datadataframe with ISO and country synonyms
