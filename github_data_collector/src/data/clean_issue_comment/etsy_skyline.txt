I intend to test Skyline to monitor anomalous behavior of cpu usage across several instances hosted on the companys DC I fully understand how to config skyline to find anomalous behavior of a server cpu vs its timeseries What I want to achieve is to find anomalous behavior of this instance vs the rest of the servers as a function of time It will help us flag unwanted behavior of a distributed system that allocates more work or harder computation to that instance For example the mean cpu for all servers is one instance is now at for hour Whereas if this cpu behavior could be found anomalous against its timeseries after hour of that usage it will be flagged as normal In my case because the is compared against it would definitely be flagged as anomalous for the entire cycle When attempting to start analyzer with analyzerd start the test run fails getting attributes on a series object Not expecting a response going to detail my investigation here and hoped someone would post if they had any clue userskyline bin analyzerd start usrlib python sitepackagesstatsmodelscompatpandaspy FutureWarning The pandascoredatetools module is deprecated and will be removed in a future version Please use the pandastseries module instead from pandascore import datetools optskylinesrcanalyzeralgorithmspy FutureWarning pdewmmean is deprecated for Series and will be removed in a future version replace with SeriesewmignorenaFalseminperiods adjustTruecom mean expAverage pandasstatsmomentsewmaseries com Algorithm test run failed Traceback most recent call last File optskylinebinsrcanalyzeranalyzeragentpy line in module ensemble globals algorithm timeseries for algorithm in settingsALGORITHMS File optskylinesrcanalyzeralgorithmspy line in meansubtractioncumulation return absseriesiget stdDev File usrlib python sitepackagespandascoregenericpy line in getattr return objectgetattributeself name AttributeError Series object has no attribute iget failed to start analyzeragent Skyline is crashing every time it reaches k Metrics Analyzerlog stops recording any metrics While horizon logs are working fine Please advise on how can i fix these issues and are there any alternatives available in the market that I can look into Add the option to parameterize the sending of emails Not handling it causes analyzer to crash At the moment when fex carbonrelay will be restarted on the other side listener will end up in infinite loop reading bytes all the time When a recv returns bytes it means the other side has closed or is in the process of closing the connection Set some realistic expectations for users after all how many people expect to see things instantly in this regard Added the ability to allow for multiple skyline nodes to use the skyline graphite namespace sharded by hostname like carbonrelays Modified srcsettingspyexample srcanalyzeranalyzerpy srchorizonworkerpy
