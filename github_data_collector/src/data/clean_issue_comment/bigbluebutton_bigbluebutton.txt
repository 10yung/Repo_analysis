I successfully installed bbb html version on ubuntu I also plan to install greenlight later I want to convert my bbb website to android ios and windows apps which can be uploaded on app stores and have native app features While searching for a solution I found Phonegap and cordova The best thing I found about phonegap is that it has a build tool where we upload the website and it converts into cross platform apps and its free Can I download and then upload my bbb website to phonegap build tool Have you people tried any of the tools out there Please share your experience Describe the bug Reconnecting users are generating an user left message that removes the the registry of that registered user from its meeting data When the user finishes reconnecting the user joined message received does not regenerate that registered user data so the meetings users list gets an user and the meetings registered users list gets none To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Monitor the registered users list on bbbweb Join an user Force reconnect this user On Firefox I did it setting the browser to work offline and setting online again Watch the user being removed from the registered users list and not being added again on the further rejoin Expected behavior I would expect the registered users list to include all users that are in the meeting Im using BBB rc Greenlight It looks like if you know the recording URL you can access a conf room recording without authentication regardless of any Site settings There is no way to restrict access to only authenticated BBB users So if the information inadvertently leaks because someone forwarded an email containing the recording URL by mistake there is no way to block the recipient from accessing the recording Ideally Id like to specify exactly which users can access each recording In the absence of that Id like to restrict access to only authenticated BBB users Is it possible to do either of these Describe the bug Mongod fails to start EDIT SOLVED and cant use Bigbluebutton clicking inside Mattermost JOIN MEETING is nor working To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Installed Mattermost on an Ubuntu server Installed BigBlueButton on same Ubuntu server using the script Installed BigBlueButton plugin in Mattermost Router forward port and to Caddy proxy Caddy proxy to forward port Mattermost to the Ubuntu server Mattermost works perfectly but when I click JOIN MEETING I receive the below error Whitelabel Error Page This application has no explicit mapping for error so you are seeing this as a fallback

screen button I tested rgba and that works nicely though I leave that up to someone more pro at UIUX Here are some screenshots at different resolutions example example Describe the bug Akkaapps marks a still valid registered user as invalid if a moderator takes his time to approve a guest user This is due to incompatible timeouts To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Set bbbweb to ASKMODERATOR guest policy Join as moderator Join as guest Keep monitoring akkaapps logs After minutes akkaapps flushes the guests registered user Moderator still can approve the guest and the guest is able to join what looks risky Expected behavior If akkaapps marks an user as a failed to join I would expect that he wouldnt be able to join after that Fixes This includes in bbbweb a monitor for the guests that are polling for their status If the waiting guest doesnt make a poll to the server for seconds guest page default is seconds bbbweb removes his registered user and sends a GuestWaitingLeftMsg to akkaapps akkaapps removes the user from the waiting guest list and from the registered users list and sends a GuestWaitingLeftEvtMsg for the clients to update I use YandexBrowser when i start room BigBlueButton show me browserWarning about incompatibility with my browser When i switch UserAgent to Chrome for example Mozilla Windows NT Win x AppleWebKit KHTML like Gecko Chrome Safari all OK BigBlueButton version is My UserAgent Mozilla Windows NT WOW AppleWebKit KHTML like Gecko Chrome YaBrowser Yowser Safari When BigBlueButton was everything worked with this browser The problem started after upgrading to Yandexbrowser is the second most popular desktop browser in Russia market share compared to Google Chrome which has My objective is replacing English audio system to Arabic I have wave sound but I could not replace the default audio system successfully As I know bigbluebutton use Freeswitch to run sounds in virtual classroom I went to file location of the sounds which is mentioned in this xml file optfreeswitchconfautoloadconfigsconferenceconfxml Then I found the muted and unmuted sounds in this location optfreeswitchsharefreeswitchsoundsenuscallieconference There are three folders I thought its only bitrate issue So I replaced the following files confalonewav confunmutedwav confmutedwav in those paths optfreeswitchsharefreeswitchsoundsenuscallieconference optfreeswitchsharefreeswitchsoundsenuscallieconference optfreeswitchsharefreeswitchsoundsenuscallieconference optfreeswitchsharefreeswitchsoundsenuscallieconference After restarting BBB and greenlight there is no sound anymore in conference room neither old or new ones Thanks
