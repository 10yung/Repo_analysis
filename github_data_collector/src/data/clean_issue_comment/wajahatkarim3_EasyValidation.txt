Addressed issue Fixed validation of the local part of the email to allow more accepted characters as well as preventing invalid combinations like two periods sequentially Also increased the length limit of the toplevel domain to accept any existing toplevel domain largest has length of characters Also added a suite of unit tests in order to validate my changes Use extending to reduce code duplication The email validation doesnt allow a plus sign before the Plus signs are often used for account aliases for example jsmithexampleorg and jsmithtestexampleorg jsmithtest exampleorg and jsmithtest exampleorg would addresssend emails to a same base email account jsmithexampleorg The email validation allows for a maximum TLD length of characters RFC allows octets for top level domains We experienced this limitation when trying to use cloud in an email address Im unable to retrieve validator from a TextInputLayout view through your source code I couldnt find the appropriate methods for it either The nonEmptyList method doesnt support the same either
