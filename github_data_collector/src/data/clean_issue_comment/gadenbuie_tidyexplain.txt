Animation request for pivotwider and pivotlonger Background Pivotting which converts between long and wide forms tidyr introduces pivotlonger and pivotwider replacing the older spread and gather functions See vignettepivot for more details Link Black text for wide column titles and long key column Slightly lighter background for wide column titles Smaller font for title Rationale Column titles are black Tried to use white color for the long key column but this breaks the association between frames Wanted to get feedback first If we have variable width of each cell we can also animate nestunnest nicely Not sure how to do it yet I used Fira Mono title and Fira Sans cell text originally but I think Fira Sans Condensed is a better choice for cell text I also used sysfonts to grab fonts from Google and showtext to ensure they are handled consistently across systems in particular where the fonts arent already installed We should probably invest some code or time to make sure that either we have good defaults that will work wherever ggplot does or that we have some code in place to make sure that our default fonts are available We need to ensure that arguments passed through are documentable ie are inherited from another function and that their scope is relatively limited Currently nearly every function takes which means that we dont have issues with extra arguments being passed to functions that dont take them This short reprex demonstrates the issue with removing from existing functions r f functionx a pastex g functiony b pastey h functionz pastez g f Doesnt have to capture unused arguments f functionx a pastex h functionz pastez g f hc y e c e a h c y e Error in f unused argument y e In the above example we would need to add x as a parameter to h or do some work to separate the arguments in the In the end though the effort will be worth it because documentation will be much clearer and the user will be able to figure out from autocompletion etc what parameters get passed to which functions to pass inputs to animatejoin so that actual names can be used in plot annotations A major advantage of moving to the package structure is that we can use pkgdown to create a slick website to replace the README In addition to documenting the package functions each major section of the README can be an individual vignettearticle Once the dust settles on the twitter poll Rename this repo It seems that everything will redirect but may need to investigateresolve if not Id like to merge into a new pkg branch that we can use for the package development This way we can push fixes and improvements there while leaving the current animations and documentation on the master branch Once everything is ready to go with the package we can merge to master To facilitate communication Id like to still use feature branches and PRs for any major feature additions or updates Minor bugfixes can be pushed directly to pkg Branch names like pkgaddfilteranimation are great Let me know if there are any questions with this workflow Ill handle getting into the pkg branch in this repo once its ready
