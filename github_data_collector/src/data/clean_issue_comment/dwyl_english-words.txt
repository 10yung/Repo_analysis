Fixed and ran sort script Inital is in wordsalphatxt which is incorrectly spelled wordsalphatxtinital This should be fixed The example for wordsdictionaryjson is readenglishdictionarypy but that file uses wordsalphatxt Could you create separate files for the types of words listed above Clearly wordsalphatxt is missing a lot of words from wordstxt that only have letters no numbers or symbols Why is that How was wordsalphatxt generated All words from original wordstxt that begin with a lowercase alphabet Hi i just wanted to know if you can make a clean version of the file removing curses and such There are words like isn aren wouldn smells like a bug I see that in the file wordsalpha there are the wrong words isnt arent wouldnt and that these right words are not included isnt arent wouldnt Is this intentional
