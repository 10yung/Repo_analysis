A backgroundcolor was specified the textcolor was missing I added it Please set your EDITOR environment variable For example to use nano add the line export EDITORnano to your HOMEbashrc fil fix Sorry if I took some joy from you but I just started to like the feeling created PRs give me When needed to comply with gitsupport it will be one line line gitrepo true n commitmessage git commit mcomitmessage gitpushoncommit true git push but right branch I was wondering if there was a command or an easy way to add on the ability to have bashblog take another method for STDIN I write markdown using a browser extension so I have my posts already in txtmd files Can I feed them to bashblog and have bashblog compile and serve then as usual from inputing filenamesmd instead of typing it in the console I would love a way to do that I prefer to write on an external program but love how small and hard working bashblog is Thanks Added a global variable markdownoptions to pass options to the markdown binary Not an issue as such I wondered if bashblog is still being actively developed Also wish to announce I have created a gui for bashblog called makeblog albeit providing some extra functionality on the fly Temporarily download and info here Tested on DebianDog Puppy Linux murga forum mainly but should work on any DebianUbuntu or a Puppy Linux system as long as gtkdialog installed link to a deb for that provided in above info I may add alternative guis later eg maybe a yad version Unfortunately makeblog currently uses GNU sed since uses sed i so maybe wont work on MAC systems by default but I may also look into changing that GNU sed need later wiak I am currently evaluating bashblog which seems to be the perfect solution for my current use case basically a handwritten PHP website please dont judge me it was the right choice this time which has everything but a blog section because this was still much less work than retrofitting one of the available static CMSs While playing with the config file I noticed two missing features Let me suggest them Configurable file extensions My website has a PHP header which can not be used by bashblog because I cant generate PHP files As there is no real reason for that I would like to have a way to replace html by eg php Configurable output paths My HTML or PHP files are publicly readable for obvious reasons Right now bbsh seems to enforce to be in the same folder as well It should be possible to replace by somefolder with a config setting What do you think If the filename fullpath has dots in it appears to me that html will strip too early For example building a blog in local github directory named anythingyournamegithubio and trying to edit fileonehtml in there If I am correct the result would be anythingyournamehtml so will get a Cant edit post error message since matched on first dot If just trying to strip whatever the file extension is then seems to me should be html Same throughout that edit function timestamps etc ie should be shortest part of Pattern that matches the back end of var if simply wanting to strip the filename extension
