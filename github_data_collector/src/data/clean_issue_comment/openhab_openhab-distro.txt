Remove Jetty redirect rule to the former dashboard since the UI will be served at the root path Depends on Signedoffby Yannick Schaus githubschausnet Largely from a discussion with kaikreuzer the issue with the installationupdate scripts is that the URLs for the various distributions snapshots milestones stables are hardcoded This creates the following issues If something deviates from established norm such as the x downloads the scripts become unusable without manual changes on the users end The scripts have no idea what versions are available and depend on the user to enter the version they want whether its available or not and in the correct format snapshot etc If we ever change providers or URLs the update scripts break until someone either manually makes a change or redownloads the newest script with the updated URLs Id like to propose a file in the distro repo that will describe all the various openHAB versions available some metadata about the version useful for the scripts and the download URL for each That way the installationupdate scripts including openhabian can at runtime Know the download URL for each version Be able to display a list of versions for the user to choose Have extra meta data for the version that the script can use such as a sorting order version category stable milestone etc rather than relying on parsing the version number allows the version numbers to vary in format if we want Although I really dont care what format the file should be comma delimited xml json Im going to suggest json The following could be an example file version SNAPSHOT downloadUrl addonUrl meta title Snapshot category snapshot displayOrder version downloadUrl addonUrl meta default true title Stable category stable displayOrder version downloadUrl addonUrl meta title Stable category stable displayOrder every old version supported Basically you have each version and its download URLs The meta data can then be used by the scripts for display purposes the default would be the current default distribution to download the title is something to display the category describes stablemilestonesnapshot and the display order can control the ordering in the UI Thoughts FYI I can certainly submit a PR for this file assuming against master not x and then followup with PR on the windows update scripts and Ill change the windows installation kaikreuzer we still need to talk about that one btw but would like someone to do the linux side and pull in whoever does the openhabian side as well Pure question why is openhabcli in the linuxpkg rather than part of the distro Id like to create the windows equivalent to it while I can do that on the windows installer seems like this ought to be more of distro thing As discussed here it would be good to move the zigbee feature file to the zigbee binding so that everything remains consistent with the libraries defined in one place Related to After upgrading from to using APT package all mqtt items in the PaperUI have no decimal points and no decimal value The value is rounded to the nearest whole number kind regards After upgrading from tot using APT package on Raspbian Raspberry Pi the logs in varlogsopenhab arent updated anymore The last entries in both openhablog and eventslog are items related to version going down Did I miss something while upgrading to or are does Openhab stopped using the logs in varlogsopenhab on Raspbian kind regards Erik The demo app for the x branch misses restswaggerjson It also misses the restextensions Visible in PaperUI as the menu entry Addons is missing and seems to miss some other rest apis as well I couldnt directly see why they were missing or is this intentional I will continue looking into it but if its intentional of if someone has an idea that might cause this that would be helpful Currently it seems that Docker HUB tagging for OpenHAB is not according to best practices and semantic versioning For example the tag was updated days ago although there was a much older original version of this tag and probably several versions in between A tag that gets updated like this should be called latest or x clearly marking that this is continuously updated If there is a patch release of OpenHAB which is then released as a Docker image its tag should follow the patch version of OpenHAB eg Docker tags like this are supposed to be immutable and only imagebuilding error fixes should change it if they happen at all With the current system deployments behave unpredictably because several slightly different versions can easily be present on my developer machine and on deployed environments without being obvious why this happens Last moments of to be on the cutting edge of technology I have done a clean install of the IDE and made sure that all repos are at the latest commit in order to test out the IDE install itself and the demoapp Something is broken First of all the bndrun file needs to be altered slightly to remove the missing uipaper and and the reference to transformmap this bundle still references smart home Secondly when starting the demo app the runtime does not go further than
