Kindly guide me how to convert angularjs js files to ts files using typewiz For a long time I dream of a tool that would automate or at least simplify the creation of tests Indeed when working with javascript we often work with large json structures And so to write the unit tests we have to write mocks with all this data And this is therefore very timeconsuming more than describing the test itself I would dream to have a tool which when running an application that it is able to record all the input output of a function and then why not generate the tests of this function I have the impression that what the approach made by typewiz could allow to realize that At least record the inputs and outputs of each function What do you think Would that be possible Ps for now I have not yet managed to run typewiz When run serve project I have VM POST Not Found Does we need to run something else before running angular I have added typewiz with the angular typescript schematics the coverage utility is quite helpful i notice that it increments the penalty for every use of an any variable maybe this is working as designed but i think it would be more helpful to penalize any variables once per declaration rather than once per use my thinking is that the magnitude of the fix is proportional to the number of declarations that need to be typed rather than the number of such uses It would be nice to offer a TypeWiz badge for repos type coverage rate While the typewizjest work is baking I was seeing if there was a quick path to getting typewiz instrumentation in jest for createreactapp specifically I tried registering typewiznode before jestrun but no luck I was curious if you had some ideas here in case you have already looked at how to make jest work Ive created new branches in the following two repos under the typewizjest branch A fresh createreactappts project but with a small untyped test added The reactscriptsts that registers typewiznode in the testjs react script To repro cd reactscriptsts git checkout typewizjest yarn link yarn install cd cratypewizexample git checkout typewizjest yarn link reactscriptsts yarn install CItrue yarn reactscriptsts test runInBand envjsdom hellospec The final line runs tests without watcher mode CItrue and runs tests serially with runInBand to prevent forking I verified that the test is running in the same process as the one that called requiretypewiznodedistregister but still no luck As another approach I also simply tried registering typewiznode from within srcsetupTeststs but that causes jest to spit errors about receiving Typescript rather than Javascript This should address We also change here the format of the collected types file so it will be a breaking change Is there an easy way to combine the collected types from typewizwebpack and multiple typewiznode runs I think there are two specific questions here When I go from page to page typewizwebpack regenerates a new collectedtypesjson its cleared on page load Can I combine multiple typewiznode immediately applies types to the codebase on termination Is there any way to instead get a collectedtypesjson in the same fashion as typewizwebpack Even if you had a simple snippet or some such for combining these that would be fantastic I tried simply concatenating the json files and that did not go over well Thanks My use case Im interested in types from many typewizwebpack outputs over frontend code typewiznode outputs over server code and typewiznode outputs over jest executions Typewiz seems to change objects by replacing their fields with property getters and setters this makes sense since it needs to track the types of the values being written However wherever one uses something like Objectassign the spread operator lodashextend etc things seem to break these functions arent able to enumerate the fields since they arent real fields Do you have any suggestions on dealing with this Thanks AngularJS Material uses gulp to build everything so were looking at using for our builds It seems like something could be built similar to the webpack plugin in order to have the types added during the Gulp pipeline Its not clear if typewiznode could help with this already or not We dont have a single maints to point to Should we do something like typewiznode gulpfilets All of our tests are Karma and Jasmine So due to it doesnt look like that is a viable path for generating our types at this time
