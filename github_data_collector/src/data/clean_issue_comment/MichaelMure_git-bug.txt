from bug tracker in my case selfhosted GitLab using bridge Adopt an identity created when pulling via bridge Comment on one of the existing issues locally using gitbug Push to bug tracker using bridge Expected Comment added to issue locally using gitbug should be present on issue in bug tracker based on this Actual Comment not present on issue in bug tracker but present when inspecting the issue locally using gitbug Ive only tested with the GitLab bridge and a selfhosted version of GitLab at that so Im not sure if the same thing happens with the other available bridges or with the main
