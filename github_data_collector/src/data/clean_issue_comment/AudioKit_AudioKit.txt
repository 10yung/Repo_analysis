Im kind of a beginner myself and I had wasted a few minutes when I wasnt able to figure out how I can get the Example Projects to work and from where I can download the framework files Therefore I updated the Frameworks README file to be more descriptive and beginnerfriendly Ready to send us a pull request Please make sure your request is based on the develop branch of the repository as master only holds stable releases This lays the groundwork for generating true universal XCFrameworks that contains every single build of AudioKit iOS macOS Apple TV and Catalyst This is not complete because to make this actually functional well need to rename the AudioKit class to something that doesnt clash with the name of the enclosing module This has large implications needing to patch most examples playgrounds tests and docs It also breaks the API although in relatively minor way so it might be better left off for the next major release AK maybe This is still helpful for the current release because We now generate frameworks with the library evolution feature turned on which in theory should now solve the issue with binaries becoming incompatible with future versions of Swift Fixed a few small things that were getting in the way of successfully building the XCFramework more importantly several bugs in the compiler and other quirks I think the rest of the work to complete XCFramework support should go in a beta branch of some sort particularly since a lot of the usefulness of this hinges on other things being still pending release Travis support for Catalina CocoaPods still in beta with native XCFramework support Generally the tooling support even from Xcode still feels pretty beta I have the rest of this ready to commit and it works even with the new Catalyst examples but dont think it should to the current develop branch Weve noticed in our app when we move the playhead position its starting earlier than the specified time We do this via playerstop playerstartTime position playerplay Ive created a sample project to demonstrate this behavior SamplePlayerzip To replicate Run pod install Open the workspace Run the app Notice a player is started and its currentTime is logged every millisecond Tap Go Back Stop the app Search the console for moving Notice the logs show MOVING PLAYHEAD TO and then the players currentTime logged after that point are before the specified startTime such as MOVING PLAYHEAD TO This is problematic in our app because we run some logic based on the players currentTime To support looping sections of a song in realtime we detect when the players position has reached the end of a loop and move it back to the start time This is breaking our logic because it starts earlier than the loops start time causing us to lose track of the current loop because weve exited the loop and well start a new loop a few milliseconds later I had a problem that was difficult to diagnose with Microphone tracking which I resolved with Aurelius help for this StackOverflow question As of Catalina the OS requires user permission to access the microphone and that requires a specific key in the infoplist file If the key isnt present the user is not prompted to allow access to the mic but it is problem I believe that AudioKit doesnt throw an exception when the mic cant be accessed particularly if it is a security issue By throwing an exception developers would be clued in immediately to what is going wrong Otherwise it can be extremely elusive In my case I was aware of securitypermission issues with iOS but since it had been awhile since Id done app development on macOS I wasnt aware of the new restrictionrequirements While connecting an external IO device It is batter has a setting for user can select which channels are prefer ig User apogee quartet quartet has analog input and analog output you can select specific IO channels for recording and monitor you can select input for stereo recording or just for mono recording For current version I test with quartet if will using default input still works but if your audio is via other channels nothing can be recorded A setting view with real time chart UI will be great for measuring the inputoutput volume img
