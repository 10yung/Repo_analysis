Hi We experienced the behaviour that one skipped showcase that has already been shown blocks the whole queue behind it as it never called onNext to continue with the queue The queue could still have elements that were not shown Eg if the user stops the showcase tour or switches to another app only a part could have been shown In current master branch it is a simple call As with the new Presenter architecture the queueListener in props is not set I had to make it available Passing a proxy allowing for the actual listener to be set later after the constructing call seemed appropriate Please comment if you would prefer another approach Thanks for the great library How you showhide FancyShowCaseView in Activity or Fragment in which method In Fragment onCreateView method I use the code below to show java FancyShowCaseQueue queue new FancyShowCaseQueue addshowcaseView addshowcaseView queueshow I got quite a view Crash reports with following titlemessage Title signal SIGSEGV code SEGVMAPERR libartcompilerso Stacktrace backtrace pc bce systemlib libartcompilerso pc bc c systemlib libartcompilerso ZN art EnhancedGVN VisitBasicBlockEPNS HBasicBlockE pc bc a systemlib libartcompilerso ZN art EnhancedGVN RunEv pc bcd c systemlib libartcompilerso ZN art MTKGVNOptimization RunEv pc df systemlib libartcompilerso ZN art RunOptimizationsEPPNS HOptimizationEmPNS PassObserverE pc b b systemlib libartcompilerso ZN art RunOptimizationsEPNS HGraphEPNS CodeGeneratorEPNS CompilerDriverEPNS OptimizingCompilerStatsERKNS DexCompilationUnitEPNS PassObserverEPNS StackHandleScopeCollectionE pc e systemlib libartcompilerso ZNK art OptimizingCompiler TryCompileEPNS ArenaAllocatorEPNS CodeVectorAllocatorEPKNS DexFile CodeItemEjNS InvokeTypeEtjP jobjectRKS NS HandleINS mirror DexCacheEEEPNS ArtMethodEb pc e afc systemlib libartcompilerso ZN art OptimizingCompiler JitCompileEPNS ThreadEPNS jit JitCodeCacheEPNS ArtMethodEb pc f systemlib libartcompilerso ZN art jit JitCompiler CompileMethodEPNS ThreadEPNS ArtMethodEb pc f systemlib libartso ZN art jit Jit CompileMethodEPNS ArtMethodEPNS ThreadEb pc systemlib libartso ZN art jit JitCompileTask RunEPNS ThreadE pc systemlib libartso ZN art ThreadPoolWorker RunEv pc c systemlib libartso ZN art ThreadPoolWorker CallbackEPv pc a c systemlib libcso ZL pthreadstartPv pc db systemlib libcso startthread Why am I posting this here At this stackoverflow question link I found someone who had the same problem and said that it was gone after he stopped executing the showcase code I have also written my App in Java but not using the ShowCaseView is not a real solution for me Do you have an idea why this is happening Can this be a bug on your side Is it a bug in the JavaKotlin compatibility or Kotlin itself Unfortunately I cant reproduce it so I am not able to test if it is gone if I remove the FancyShowCaseView as well If you have also no idea why this is happening and how I can find a solution feel free to close this issue Fix issues listed on codacy Fixes adding line gradlew FancyShowCaseViewTest to travisyml All test cases should be run on each push FancyShowCaseViewkt contains too many logic to be separated to another small nonui related testable classes FancyShowCaseView not hiding Im using custom View In that layout on click of one of the button im calling fancyShowCaseViewhide Still Some times show case view is not hiding please find my code below how im setting Listener for that Example var fancyShowCaseListener object OnViewInflateListener override fun onViewInflatedview View viewbtnOksetOnClickListener fancyShowCaseViewhide
