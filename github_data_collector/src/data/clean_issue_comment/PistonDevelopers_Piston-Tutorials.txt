cargoregistrysrcgithubcom ecc db ec stbtruetype Cargotoml Caused by editions are unstable Caused by feature edition is required consider adding cargofeatures edition to the manifest In the gettingstarted tutorial glob imports are pervasive While these are generally not the best practice the modules maybe should have preludes to make this easier they also make it difficult to figure out which librarymodule many types come from For example when writing the render function in the impl App block It becomes necessary to use IDE tooling to figure out which module RenderArgs comes from I recomend removing in as many places as possible to make the tutorial easier to read I recently finished a tutorial that covers the square rotating and it compiles yet I do not see any background nor the square itself If it help Im running mac version Attempted to follow the sudoku example up to chapter where you are supposed to compile and the game board is displayed Instead I get the following

spinningsquare openglopengl exitonesctrue resizablefalse build unwrap I added resizablefalse but the window is still resizable In the tutorial it says to import openglgraphicsglyphcacheGlyphCache This doesnt seem to exist anymore What exists instead is openglgraphicsGlyphCache Also the constructor of GlyphCache takes three arguments instead of two There is a factory needed How can I compile the code I cannot find anything about the factory Also I followed the tutorial step by step Maybe problems like these can be solved in the future with adding versions to the dependencies As piston seems to change very fast specific library versions can make sure that the tutorial still works even when newer versions of piston or any dependency came out PS I found openglgraphicsgraphicsglyphcacherusttypeGlyphCache but it seems to be the same struct as openglgraphicsGlyphCache
