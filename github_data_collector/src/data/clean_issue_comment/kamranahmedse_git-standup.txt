Lets assume I have a commit message like this Updates Contribution Tests ehrbaseprojectmanagement added missing check steps moved required testdatasets in dedicated subfolder repored discored bugs tagged failing testssteps and linked to Github issues traceability Is there a cli option to show more than just the first line in git standup output Cheers Fix I would like to use git standup to create a weekly summary of the various repositories I worked at but only for the master branch This way I can forward my colleagues a list of things that went live in the recent week Description gitstandup does not properly handle paths that include spaces in directory names eg pathtomy awesome stuff Steps to Reproduce Install gitstandup npm i g gitstandup Create a git repository in a path that features a space cd mntexternal drive mkdir testrepo cd testrepo git init Initialized empty Git repository in mntexternal drivetestrepogit Attempt to run git standup git standup usrlocalbingitstandup line cd drivetestrepo No such file or directory Expected Behavior The utility should correctly parse paths with spaces and not assume that spaces will not be used Actual Behavior gitstandup appears to split the path of the current working directory on space characters and use the length th element of the split result instead of the entire path Reproduces how often Additional Information This issue has been reproduced on CentOS Linux and macOS Mojave with gitstandup v Sometimes I forget to note the time when I worked what I did that day I use gitstandup to see what I did on that day but I cant see the time Could you add the local time like this cd b ENH Added foo feature days ago Martin Thoma a f BUG Fixed bar bug days ago Martin Thoma e ccf MAINT Update blub days ago Martin Thoma This is great thanks Kamran Only issue Im facing here is that any rebased appear twice whilst temporary WIP commits also show up though they no longer exist Currently my git standup command shows this img width altScreenshot at src Is there a way to either Only show commits that still exist by checking to see if the commit hash is present in any of the origin branches Could maybe include a git fetch to make sure its up to date though may be an undesired side effect for some If thats not possible could it filter and only show the latest commit with the same commit message So if you have add vim to gitignore committed twice due to a commit amend or rebase itd be great to be able to pass a flag that hides the repeated ones Ideally would work best as it would hide WIP commits too and seems to solve the problem closer to the root of the issue but would be a decent fix towards making this more usable with those of us who rebase I find myself often specifying a range of day for example git standup A B git standup d u Would be nice to be able to pass in a date and have only the commits for that day returned I love this project and I use it daily In this daily usage Ive identified just one possible improvement the addition of the branch name to the commit message I work in multiple branches for different features and need to reference the branch name in my daily standup If git standup included a flag that enabled outputting the branch name before the commit ie branchname Commit message I and hopefully others may be able to rely on git standup even more comprehensively Is this possible today and Ive just missed it My user home directory is a Git Repository I ignore everything except a few dot files and some directories Inside dev Ive got all of my other Git projects Running inside dev works fine but when running inside git standup does not work corectly and says Ive done nothing Would it be possible to still go the directory depth down even if the directory that you are currently in is a git repository Running gitstandup like this gives noncolored output watch c git standup m Ive no idea if someone else is using the application this way For me its useful to have a constantly updating list of commits
