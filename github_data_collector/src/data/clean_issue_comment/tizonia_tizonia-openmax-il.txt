Hi All LOVE the software Wondering if we can get the ability to equilize or sound level the music across different tracks Im finding spotify streamed music is loud for some songs others are quiet Much appreciate regardless Thanks Issue Template Have you read Tizonias Code of Conduct By filing an Issue you are expected to comply with it including treating everyone with respect Remember that these are some guidelines use your best judgement Description It would be nice to read tizonia help with man tizonia like other man pages Everything in one page and render nicely in less pager based on the user man page settings Installation Method Used Should be packaged along with source Additional Information Man pages could possibly get input from command line Description Im not sure if this is a bug or a feature request or if the Plex API even has the capability I get an error when I try to search Plex using multiple playlists eg artist AND album The error message seems to indicate that this is expected behavior but being a music player I would usually expect to be able to play a specific album by an artist rather than ALL albums by that artist or ALL albums that have a specific keyword in them eg tizonia plexaudioalbum Ocean brings up multiple albums by different artists Steps to Reproduce Attempt to run tizonia with more than one playlist Example tizonia plexaudioartist Lady Antebellum plexaudioalbum Ocean Expected behavior tizonia plays the album Ocean by Lady Antebellum Actual behaviour Error message Only one playlist type must be specified Reproduces how often of the time Versions tizonia version Debug Info Boost TagLib MediaInfoLib v OS version Raspbian stretch Installation Method Used It was a long time ago so I dont remember but my bash history shows that I used the installsh script Additional Information None Description Ive been playing around with v in a fork of the dockertizonia repo find my fork linked below in Installation Method and Ive noticed an issue I suspect might be a problem with the main codebase Steps to Reproduce Using tizonia v make a call which will give back nonASCII characters My test case for this is tizonia gmusicunlimitedalbum Nivalis which will return the album Nivalis by the band rst ir Expected behavior In previous versions the software is able to convert some characters and ignore others shown below from v Arstiir While This Way Album Nivalis Year Duration m s Track Ch KHz sb Note the accentless A and the ignored Actual behaviour When running v I get the error message shown below Google Play Music UnicodeEncodeError ascii codec cant encode character xc in position ordinal not in range tizonia exiting OMXErrorInsufficientResources OMXArateliaaudiosourcehttpport OMXErrorInsufficientResources Reproduces how often of

was from a specific branch of my fork of dockertizonia in which I was playing around with an upgrade of that project to Python and Tizonia Additional Information I wonder if its possible whether this is related to the Python upgrade and if there are any notable differences in UnicodeASCII parsing between Python and I havent been able to find anything specific yet to that effect but its possible Its yet still possible that its due to how Ive configured the container in which case this is more of a how did i screw up question Description Calling Tizonia from Crontab does not give any result Steps to Reproduce Edit your Crontab with crontab e Add a Tizonia command to be reproduced at a certain time this is what Ive used for test every minute tizonia spotifyplaylistid Sr qSlojHmWQaP ZqdK

an interactive toplevel to launch Tizonia and be able to easily interact with the application I have solved all my issues running the app however i am trying to figure out how to control the app remotely via ssh I have tizonia running on my headless raspberry pi inside a docker container which is connected to my speakers and i would like to be able to control it mute volume next track n previous p by sending ssh commands Does anyone have any idea on how this might be possible I looked at xdotool and similar tools but i dont think this will work in this situation since i am running the pi headless with the desktop disabled I am hoping to be able to use tasker on my phone to send ssh commands in a tasker shortcut i made to effectively turn my phone into a remote Steps on Ubuntu tizoniadevbuild deps sudo aptget remove libspotify libspotifydev tizoniadevbuild noplayer debug install withoutlibspotify Output checking for SPOTIFY no configure error Package requirements libspotify were not met No package libspotify found configure error configure failed for spotifysource The second step is too simulate the fact that it seems that libspotify is not packaged in Fedora In any case it seems that withoutlibspotify has regressed and does not work anymore We are trying to enable Tizonia in the automated builds of gstomx GStreamer OpenMAX Issue Template Have you read Tizonias Code
