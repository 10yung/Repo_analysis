Security updates receive only security updates if desired details Hello I have classes in different namespaces and trait connecting them ex namespace Command Common Traits use Command Model Payment UserAccountDetails trait UserDetailsAwareTrait var UserAccountDetails protected userAccountDetails public function getUserAccountDetails UserAccountDetails return thisuserAccountDetails public function setUserAccountDetailsUserAccountDetails userAccountDetails void thisuserAccountDetails userAccountDetails namespace Command Bank use Command Common Traits UserDetailsAwareTrait use Command Model Payment UserData use Money Money use Ramsey Uuid UuidInterface class DepositCommand use UserDetailsAwareTrait namespace Command Model Payment class UserAccountDetails var boolnull private accountVerified public function isAccountVerified bool return thisaccountVerified public function setAccountVerifiedbool accountVerified UserAccountDetails thisaccountVerified accountVerified return this And logic failure occurs in resolvePartialStructuralElementName context variable content and type UserAccountDetails So it cannot be just simple namespace type I guess it should check within trait namespace of UserAccountDetails but I dont know where it cames from It seems that another library have already resolved this issue you can take a look and this one Maybe context should include UserDetailsAwareTrait trait uses so it would be resolved as namespaceAliases typeParts CRITICAL TypeError Return value of phpDocumentor Reflection Types AbstractListgetValueType must implement interface phpDocumentor Reflection Type null returned in editedvscodeextensionsfelixfbeckerphpintellisense vendorphpdocumentortyperesolversrcTypesAbstractListphp Not entirely sure about the intended behaviour but if null is acceptable value then the getter should be allowed to return it as such no For example php php namespace somens use some other ns class A public function ns ns will be resolved correctly as some other ns not somens ns Such as php php namespace somens use some other class A public function other ns ns will be resolved correctly as some other ns not somens other ns After some discussion with nikic on it looks like ContextFactorygetNamespaceAliases doesnt cope with multiple imports with the same aliased name For example php namespace Foo use Foo X class A extends X use Zap use Bar X class B extends X use Baz If you call getNamespaceAliases on this perfectly valid code youll see X Bar X This is not correct but because it is keyed by the alias name it is too much of a simple representation to allow multiple named aliases Its maybe quite an edge case but it does indeed appear to be a bug
