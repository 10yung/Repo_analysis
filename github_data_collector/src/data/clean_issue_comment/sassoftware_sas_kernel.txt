Im unable to get a successfull installation of saskernel on windows with anaconda The documentation appears to be outdated in a number of areas The defaults for the install of Anaconda on windows do not place it in C ProgramData Anaconda The installation options regarding PATH environment variable are no longer the same as those shown in the screen shot and different default values are checked and recommended Can someone validate from start to finish a complete install with the current version of Anaconda for windows and document the steps While troubleshooting an install issue rare pip wouldnt install saskernel cleanly The last gasp looked like the following PermissionError Errno Permission denied C ProgramData Anaconda Lib sitepackages ipykernel codeutilpy A note or other friendly reminder in the install section of the doc to use elevated privs if python was installed with elevated privs might be worthwhile Hi when we try to use completion function to ask SAS code sugestion it doesnt work correctly With SAS PROC you havent suggestion on options PROC SORT DA Jupyter NB doesnt suggest DATA option With Data step the suggestion only is you writes a correct statement before DATA T SE Jupyter NB doesnt suggest statement It suggest only if you write SET completly I attach a doc with my tests and associated kernal error Regards pascal JupyterNotebookSASKernelUIproblemdocx Same setup as This post was originally part of but I think they are separate issues so I split This notebok is not rendering correctly in Jupyter launched within SAS University Edition When working in the notebook the code under Check for dupes as well as Check for MSRP outliers doesnt display in the browser However the output shows when it is run The code does however show when rendered with nbviewer Will post a screenshot soon Might be a problem with the CodeMirror sasjs Ill work on debugging Same setup as This notebok is not rendering correctly with the online nbviewer Theres weird red boxes around parts of the code results after Get the total number of bad rows weirdred There are span classerr tags being rendered Edit PM Refreshed This is my GitHub hosted Jupyter Notebook The MSRP column contains HTML that doesnt belong it skips every other observation and the table loses its color formatting I tried changing the line endings to CRLF instead of just LF but this made no difference As displayed by the GitHub render the table looks weird this shows the issue bad What it should look like as displayed by Jupyter editor window via University Edition good The problem exists for both Chrome Microsoft Edge on Windows bit In the image it does show any code but it DOES contains some code attach the notebook please rename back to ipynb INTRO Copyipynbtxt thanks I downloaded the notebook as PDF and I do not see the SAS outputs in the file It shows the following in the PDF output IPythoncoredisplayHTML object instead of the actual output and graphs Is there a way to enable inline magics options as the same way we do in Python notebook so that the plots can also be include when we download the notebook as PDF SASHelloWordpdf Foreg matplotlib inline After I execute the above command using Python Shell I can see graph when I download the notebook as PDF
