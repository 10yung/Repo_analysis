There is a behaviour on the current iOS version not sure when this behaviour started where if a collection views layout is set after initialization instead of it being passed inside initframecollectionViewLayout the collectionView property will be set twice That is if you do this swift let collectionView UICollectionView frame zero collectionViewLayout UICollectionViewFlowLayout collectionViewcollectionViewLayout LXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayout instead of this swift let collectionView UICollectionView frame zero collectionViewLayout LXReorderableCollectionViewFlowLayout KVO will cause setupCollectionView to be called twice Consequently the stored panGestureRecognizer is replaced with a new one but the old one is still listening to gestures on the collection view This breaks scrolling because scrolling over the collection view when selfselectedItemIndexPath is nil should not trigger handlePanGesture but it does because this objc BOOLgestureRecognizerShouldBeginUIGestureRecognizer gestureRecognizer if selfpanGestureRecognizer isEqualgestureRecognizer return selfselectedItemIndexPath nil return YES returns true for the replaced but still listening pan gesture recognizer Apple add some new Collection View delegate to support drag and drop function in iOS Could you update this lib to adapt it Hello Expert It is a great one for cocoapods Could you mind update podspec to make sure pod update can get this new release BR StevenC When I move the cell up and down a few times duplicate cell appears and order is not correct Can you figure it out and fix it Is it possible to Swap Cells while using this framework Right it is working fine but not able to Drag and Drop by Locking the cells Hi sir Thanks for your great library works very good i would like to know if you able to add paging so it would be just like iphoneipad home screen It would be great Please let me know Thanks Is there any way to save order of displaying cells when user quit an application CONGRATS can you show demo with move item from setion to section and when didselected in section cell move cell to section or dissected section cell move item from section to section THX
