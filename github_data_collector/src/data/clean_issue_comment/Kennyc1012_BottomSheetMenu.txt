After upgrade to x version I created a bottom sheet menu on tablet landscape orientation I found that only bottom sheet title is shown and i need to swipe up the sheet to show all menu item But when i change orientation to portrait it works perfectly How can i show all menu items when bottom sheet is shown when in landscape mode I found that the hiding of MenuItem doesnt work Is it my way of using it
