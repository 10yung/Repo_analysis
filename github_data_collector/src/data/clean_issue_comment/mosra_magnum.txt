This PR should improve the clarity of the documentation about the use of Magnum as a Cmake subproject I tweaked a couple of paragraphs to make it more obvious that the Modules directory is still necessary even when not using a shared installation of Magnum As you asked on Gitter mosra this is the PR containing the fix to errors when linking with the SceneGraph library on MSYS s build of Clang If there is no magnumdpiscaling specified on the command line dpiscaling is set to default Which according to this code which is run by every ctor of GlfwApplication commandLineDpiScalingPolicy is set here and only here to GlfwDpiScalingPolicyDefault which is just an alias to the platformdependant default policy Crucially GlfwDpiScalingPolicyDefault is not so when this code comes along and checks ifUnsignedBytecommandLineDpiScalingPolicy The other cases are not possible Hi Im attempting to use a static version of OpenAL built through the repo here Using a dynamic library build of OpenAL seems to link fine whereas using the static library seems to cause linker errors CMake configuration went fine and thus Im somewhat puzzled as to whats happening Log C Users daego Desktop Projects

things so better list them so I dont forget Update copyright years everywhere Also on the website x Better CMake subproject usage docs Fix Mac builds of homebrewmagnum because Homebrew is stupid It tries to do Py migration and fails returning a nonzero code Solution is to disable upgrading uhhh Integrate changes from mention in Community Features Mention sequentity in Community Features a new Community Showcase Powered By Magnum page along with other projects webgl releases of the two new physics examples Finish growable arrays arbitrary insertion deletion arrayRemoveUnordered as well Compare to STL folly others write a blog post WMDPICHANGED event on GLFW Windows check also Mac with multiple differently dense monitors Use glfwGetWindowContentScale for getting virtual DPI scaling on windows when we have GLFW at least and make the original just physical and also complain that glfw is too old when trying to use virtual on and below but keep the original handling for Linux as its also used in Sdl App and many Linux distros still have just Look into Android NDK r on CMake Also mosratoolchains and mosratoolchains Finish MeshData rework Add Tangent attribute to the grid primitive at least Add support for tangents use in MeshToolscompile Add support for integer data and object ID attribs no packed normals or anything just yet use in MeshToolscompile join that takes a list of MeshData assumes the same primitive and combines them together for simplicity picking attributes of the first mesh or concat what about mesh slicing Make STLless alternatives of MeshTools wo deprecating the originals yet kbdin progresskbd Change flipNormals tipsify to operate on array views instead Deprecate combineIndexArrays in favor of integer removeDuplicates duplicate Texture coordinate support in the cube primitive one with a single texture for all faces one with a center strip and two ears up and down one packing six faces Finish merge mip level selection Adapt Assimp Ogex TinyGltf importers I hope I have a branch with these Extend format support in DDS Make a BC H converter plugin using something from Make a DDS converter that can contain the BC H data Zerocopy import for gltf so we can operate on the data inplace just a MVP glb only as I need it for the dataset fixups Perface attribute import in StanfordImporter object ID in particular Needs an integer version of MeshToolsremoveDuplicates A noncrappy TextureToolsatlas I have some links somewhere dont remember where with binary search that aims to fit into the smallest rectangle plus trying a few sorting strategies picking the one that fits best dont need an incremental version yet its again just for the dataset fixups meshdrawshader shaderdrawmesh also the xfb and MeshView version deprecate the original Stretch goals Minimal instancing in Phong should also make it work with pervertex object IDs Port physics examples to use instancing D MeshVisualizer shader which can also take texture coordinates of a D mesh and visualize the UV layout Requested by hsdk Currently the forked upstream FindOpenAL only works with bundled OpenAL Soft binaries but not with sources EDIT And also allow DLL copying like with FindSDL and FindGLFW mosra is there any or plan for adding acceleration data structure such as Kdtree and Octree They are extremely useful mosra I think Signed Distance Field SDF primitives are very useful in graphics so it is great if magnum has them I have implemented some classes for SDF and used them here The code is here and here If you can adopt my work its great Otherwise if you like I can rework it and submit a MR sometime later It would be nice to have utility functions on SceneGraphObject to find attached features by type similar to eg Unitys components c objectfeatures list of AbstractFeatures objectfeatureDrawable Drawable or nullptr objectfeaturesDrawable list of Drawable objectfeaturesInChildrenDrawable objectfeaturesInParentsDrawable Im noticing that png files with alpha values dont have the setColor alpha values applied when using Flat D shader ex setColor f f f f still displays the image Im currently using StbImageImporter for image importing Other Peculiarities png images with transparent backgrounds have their transparent colours displayed as hard colours ex black or white instead of transparent Class implementation class
