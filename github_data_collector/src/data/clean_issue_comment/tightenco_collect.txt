As far as i can see the Symfony VarDumper Dependency is just used once in a helpers method Is it essential A simple global non namespaced helper function with a pretty unspecific name like dump command often has the potential to cause conflicts with other utility methods Would be of great help if a native solution could be used Not really a Php guy are there any critical reasons why the symfony dump is prefered over something like this dievardumpvar Thank you for the project Hey I am getting this error when I try to run composer update Problem tightencocollect v requires symfonyvardumper no matchin g package found I think it should be or instead of or I am missing something Thanks References Hi Here a conflict with the Arrayable interface I have a Laravel Collection with several Tightenco collection inside When using toArray on the main Laravel Collection it doesnt touch the Tightenco ones Its because of the Illuminate Contracts Support Arrayable and Tightenco Collect Contracts Support Arrayable Interfaces Because of these sort of bugs packages that use Tightencocollect cant be used with Laravel anymore Hi again Im sorry to be the one who open all theses issues but as Im working a lot with collect and Laravel for now Im seeing all the problems Again a problem due to the namespace change and so the composer replace but not the fault of composer this time I have a regression in my project because of a Tightenco Collect Support Collectionmake In fact you can reproduce easily the problem in a Laravel project php items Userall Tightenco Collect Support Collectionmakeitems The function that converts items is this one php protected function getArrayableItemsitems if isarrayitems return items elseif items instanceof self return itemsall elseif items instanceof Arrayable return itemstoArray elseif items instanceof Jsonable return jsondecodeitemstoJson true elseif items instanceof JsonSerializable return itemsjsonSerialize elseif items instanceof Traversable return iteratortoarrayitems return array items Previously when collect was replaced by Laravel Collections the return value was php return itemsall because thisand items was from the same class Now because they are from different classes the value will be php return itemstoArray which is not the same at all and breaks totally my package and my project I dont have right now a simple solution but I definitely think that changing the package namespace was much more complicated than we thought Maybe you or adamwathan as he uses it too in his packages and so will have the same problems should discuss with Taylor about a more global solution extract definitely the collections from Laravel for example Thanks for your work Ill hope we will find a solution to keep using this cool package
