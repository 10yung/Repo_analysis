Hi Currently Im using the ZoomImageView to crop images I add a grid view on top then when Im ready to finalize the crop Ill use zoomImageViewdrawcanvas My ZoomImageView has a to ratio in terms of width and height and is contained within a ConstraintLayout as so comotaliastudioszoomZoomImageView androidididzoomimageview androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheight dp androidvisibilityinvisible applayoutconstraintDimensionRatio applayoutconstraintEndtoEndOfparent applayoutconstraintStarttoStartOfparent applayoutconstraintToptoTopOfparent apptransformationcenterCrop apptransformationGravityauto appalignmentcenter appoverScrollHorizontaltrue appoverScrollVerticaltrue appoverPinchabletrue apphorizontalPanEnabledtrue appverticalPanEnabledtrue appzoomEnabledtrue appflingEnabledtrue appscrollEnabledtrue apponeFingerScrollEnabledtrue apptwoFingersScrollEnabledtrue appthreeFingersScrollEnabledtrue appminZoom appminZoomTypezoom appmaxZoom appmaxZoomTypezoom appanimationDuration My flow I currently have is User takes photo with the camera that is the sensor resolution Lets say for example x We put that picture into an ImageView with a scaleType of center crop User goes into crop mode where we hide the original ImageView and set the image bitmap on the ZoomImageView For some reason when setting the image on the ZoomImageView it doesnt pan to the center Itll pan to the top or bottom but never the center regardless of what gravity or alignment I set Currently the only way I can get it to center when initially setting the bitmap is to first call zoomImageViewsetImageBitmapbitmap then set the pan to zoomImageViewpanX and zoomImageViewpanY This seems to work when the width and height of the content are bigger than the containerzoomImageView however when either the width or height of the content is smaller than the container the panx and pany both end up being so this solution doesnt work Am I doing something wrong here Any help would be greatly appreciated Hello i want to use ZoomLayout with two PDFView inside it to be able to zoom the two PDFs together After loading the two PDFs programmatically they does not even appear in the

your work and your support Have a great day Im using the following code to determine the screen position of a ZoomLayout children Rect viewRect new Rect if OriginatingViewGetGlobalVisibleRectviewRect var location new int OriginatingViewGetLocationOnScreenlocation viewRectOffsetTolocation location originatingViewRect viewRect However GetGlobalVisibleRect doesnt return the right screen coordinates if children are not marked as clickable PS GetLocationOnScreen is necessary for when the ZoomLayout is nested within a DialogFragment as GetGlobalVisibleRect returns the coordinates within the dialog which is not always full screen Hi I am Mattia the main developer and maintainer here and I have enabled the GitHub Sponsor button on this repository which will let you support the library development by sponsoring my open source work through GitHub itself In the last years I have spent countless unpaid hours on this and other projects designing and developing tools that solve real problems for everyone to use I am very happy to know that companies of all sizes benefit from my work everyday GitHub is now offering you the opportunity to thank back with a sponsorship For individuals it could be a small amount For companies that are powered by my tools it could be a fairly small percentage of their revenue In any case your support will be greatly appreciated and for bigger amounts you get things like private support hours or something else if you prefer I will experiment leaving this as a pinned issue for a while at least since its where people are most likely to see it Sorry if this bothers you and thank you all for your help I have a zoomlayout in a fragment and everything works fine on a regular device but on tablet the layout is slightly bigger than it should the zoom value is not when i call zoomto on buttonpress it goes to the correct amount but i cant seem to do this as the screen is loading so it always starts out zoomed in slightly Using ZoomLayout within a CoordinatorLayout eg a disappearing toolbar gives very strange results incorrect height the coordinator doesnt get scroll events passed somehow the touch events are off by a multitude of dps I am trying to get the x and y points to add a button at those points eventrawX scaledPanX realZoomtoInt eventrawY scaledPanY realZoomtoInt Is what i am doing to get the coordinates when zoomed in but the x value seems to off Everytime the button is added slighltly to the right of where I press The y coordiante is fine Is this the correct way to get these values Hey everyone first of all Thank you for this great API But im struggling with the layouts by using them in a nested way Is there an easy way to solve that problem Im currently using the ZoomLayout within a SwipeRefreshLayout and cant scrollup within the ZoomLayout without triggering the refresh method
