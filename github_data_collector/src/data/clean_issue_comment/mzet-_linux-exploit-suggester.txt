Add switches for distro name distro version and arch to use along with kernel switch Since this commit b b bfc e ad c c e e d b with the refactored code there is no difference using gshort with checksec This patch readd some of the functionality When tmp is not writable but wwwtmp is I downloaded linuxexploitsuggester to wwwtmp and ran it bash bash lessh lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory CONTINUE Available information Kernel version REDACTED Architecture x Distribution RHEL Distribution version Additional checks CONFIG sysctl entries custom Bash commands performed Package listing from current OS Searching among kernel space exploits user space exploits Possible Exploits lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory lessh line cannot create temp file for heredocument No such file or directory CONTINUE However I ran and without problem lessh Script needs Bash in version or newer Aborting It says LES supports only bash and I was running it on bash so I understand But on you said To avoid these kind of errors Ive added bash version checking on scripts startup is needed for associative arrays operator was added in so we should be good now So finally is not supported I suppose that the line should look like this pkgVersionecho pkg grep E i o e p cut d f sed s g sed sp g or pkgVersionecho pkg grep E i o e p cut d f sed s g sed sp g Since the ntfs g AR package is not detected otherwise However the package mysqlserver is still not detected But if we replace Reqs pkgmysqlservermariadbserverver with Reqs pkgmysqlservermariadbserver I have come across a similar shell script that s also designed to find exploits although it uses an online database to find exploits It may be worth copying some of the code from it so linuxexploitsuggester can also use the online database
