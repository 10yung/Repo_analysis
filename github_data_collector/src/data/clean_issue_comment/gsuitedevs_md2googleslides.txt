can disable automated security fix PRs for this repo from the Security Alerts page details Due to oauth review requirements need to stop using the embedded client ID and instruct users to create their own GCP project I LOVE this It increases my productivity significantly However it would be so much better if I could specify where the generates slides are saved on my drive Or even if I generate one time and move it if I can push changes to the new location Are there any technical hurdles that Im unaware of Id be happy to contribute code but want to make sure Im not trying to build something youve already considered and decided against see fixes Lets say I have a local image file called mycodedoesntworkjpg alongside my markdown slide and I simply add it to the slide like this markdown Title mycodedoesntworkjpg When I executed the converter error message popped out as follows Unable to generate slides Error ENOENT no such file or directory open c c git others notsopersonalnotes Stretch slides mycodedoesntworkjpg After some hacking I was able to pinpoint the cause to this line of code I used consolelog to print the parsedUrlpathname and the result was cgitothersnotsopersonalnotesStretchslidesmycodedoesntworkjpg Then it was passed to fscreateReadStreampath and thats where the error came from I can hack it to resolve my issue by using fscreateReadStreampathsubstring but obviously its not an ideal solution and I have no idea whether it will affect macos linux or not Any ideas I got everything working but the styles from highlightjs It isnt a path issue as Ive tested for that but whatever theme I choose it still just uploads the same way white background with black text even if I change the default theme to something else I dont see any errors anywhere it just seems to check for the style file and then ignore it Any ideas I tried to install on MacOSX Mojave F but got this error message mylaptop sharuzzamanahmatraslan npm
