euclidint pointpos minsegmentlength missing value where TRUEFALSE needed The documentation of the nudge options does not specify the units of these values It would help new users to clarify this They are probably in the same units as the data values for these axes But they might ve been relative units for the plotted axis eg would nudge the position by half of the axis length or even absolute units for the plot like the units for many of the other options Summary In my chart I can either use subsetting in the nudgex argument to geomlabelrepel like this nudgex subsetdatameans F nuc F nuc or I can use facetwrap to break out my plot into two panels by one of the group factors But I cant do both when I keep both the nudgex and the facetwrap in the call to ggplot things crash Minimal code example Here is the code that does not work because it contains both the facetwrap and the nudge elements If I leave either of them out I at least get a plot but itd be great to use both of them r

more options to direction to limit the direction I mean to a positive or negative value in x or y direction Maybe something like diractionx or directionright to repel to the right I was trying to repel text label on a labels in error bars and I would like the lower bound to be shifted to the left and the upper bound to be shifted to the right The xlim option didnt work for me because the I am using facet and xlim can only specify a common value for all the facets Summary When the legend is too large and ggrepel is used the following obtuse error text is produced Error in gridCallCconvert x

geomsftext for labeling sf objects cf Are you interested in implementing the repel version of these Labelling sf objects is a very common task so Im sure many people will find geomsflabelrepel useful If you feel ggrepel is not the right place for them they will probably be implemented in ggforce Minimal code example Proof of Concept is here Suggestions Note that this can be addressed after geomsflabel and geomsftext are implemented in ggplot So please stay tuned on tidyverseggplot I will do my best to finish it as soon as possible Version information NA Summary When setting hjust to a value outside range in cases it would push text over the plotting area edge text overlaps point The problem can be reproduced only at certain plotting area sizes rather small ones in most cases Anyway

below The big circle will cover part of the label But if increase pointpadding the small circles label will be too far away Is there any work around for this Thanks This is possible out of scope for ggrepel but its often nice to be able to label just the unusual points ie those points that are in a lowdensity region of the plot ie an alternative to geomjitter
