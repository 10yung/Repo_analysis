Closes For konform version it is must have at least characters not must be at least characters by default UserProfileage ifPresent minimum maximum Why it is neccesary to have ifPresent Just apply validation rules ony if value is not null in any case For example a login field can be a phone or and email For example I want to validate an email field I want to validate it against a regexp pattern and only it is a valid email I want to check if it is already takenpersisted in database SwaggerOpenAPI schema contains classobject definition and validation rules It will be great if this library will provide this information in order to be able to integrate it for full schema generation from code For example Spring or Micronaut can generate endpoints schema and integrate class definitions from this library Adds functionality described in Tests are included Inspired by this reddit comment Instead of writing minimum maximum the user could instead use inRange between betweenExclusive Currently a ValidationResultT can be used to get errors for a specific field kotlin result UserProfilefullName Is there any way to get a map of all errors for a given validation not a separate list for every field
