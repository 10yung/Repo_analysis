We multibytes users want to treat UTF as is like YajlRuby FYI Yajlruby doesnt quote UTF strings This patch quotes not UCS UTF but only UCS UTF Thanks Hi my CPU usage goes up when I pass big HTML to comtwitterJsonjsonquote do U have any clue about this issue Currently the scalajson wont process mutable map correctly in Scala branch Maybe you want to add few lines to support them just like my branch Hey there If I want to depend on this from a scala project whats the best way to do it Is it published in a repository anywhere or do I need to build and push to a local repository The build system Im using scalas simplebuildtool seems to look for dependencies in a default local ivy repository at ivy I tried ant package and ant push to publish here but didnt do what I wanted the latter fails with unknown resolver push Anyway some basic instructions in the README would be great especially for us rubyists looking into scala whore still getting used to the java toolchain Cheers muchly
