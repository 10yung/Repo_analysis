Carthage cant find the built framework Hi I must confess Im not totally convinced that the problem you are aiming to solve is a problem in the first place Surely if your tableView model is large then you should just refactor it to make it manageable again Still this is an interesting idea and I want to take a deeper look at what you guys are doing and maybe provide some feedback if youre interested I noticed the frame rate dropping on the simulator iPhone X and I am curious about that Ill get back to you if I find anything interesting I have noticed an issue with memory If you look here you can see that not all the memory is deallocated when popping the DestinationViewController img width altscreen shot at src If you pause execution on the root controller after popping the DestinationViewController you can see a bunch of stuff is still in memory img width altscreen shot at src Ill keep looking around to see why the frame rate drops the first time the DestinationViewController loads Ive read through the code I dont understand how to use this in my project Can you provide a step by step how to use section in the readme
