This is fairly close to working but it has visual artifacts and the font looks a bit blurred to me but maybe not for everyone Interestingly they disappear after opening the cmdline so after typing The line thats causing this reset of the artifacts is here see But I have no idea why calling showall on a gtkFixed removes the artifacts Any ideas The artifacts appear to be coming from a lack of subpixel positioning in GNvim but I could be wrong Note that when I ceil or floor the width value of the CellMetrics the artifacts disappear but the cursor is no longer positioned correctly All this still doesnt explain the reset when opening the cmdline though cc vhakulinen lastpartizan This application s sGUIsUI doesn t seem to be translatable yet Built from git with master at e fc d e f f bbdd b c e cc I have the FZF plugin enabled which attempts to preview the file as well When I attempt to preview a zip file thats MB large it crashes with memory allocation of bytes failedfish gnvim terminated by signal SIGABRT Abort Looks like it tries to allocate uint Let me know if you need more info Screenshot Ive been seeing more panics lately which happened once in a while but there is a specific workload that Ive been able to get them consistently In particular thread main panicked at attempt to subtract with overflow srcuigridrowrs Unfortunately I cant share the exact process as its related to my work Ill see if I can get a repro soon This happens when Cu or Cd into a region that might have special characters This is the backtrace On some platforms you can execute VimL set guifont to bring up a font requester dialog and interactively pick your font Screenshot Could GNvim implement that font requester option for set guifont Invoking set columnswhatever sometimes causes GNvim to crash I cant determine exactly what factor determines whether or not it crashes thread main panicked at called Resultunwrap on an Err value Error domain WebKitJavascriptError code message SyntaxError Can t create duplicate variable width srclibcoreresultrs stack backtrace stdsysunixbacktracetracingimpunwindbacktrace at srclibstdsysunixbacktracetracinggccsrs stdsyscommonbacktraceprint at srclibstdsyscommonbacktracers stdpanickingdefaulthookclosure at srclibstdsyscommonbacktracers at srclibstdpanickingrs stdpanickingdefaulthook at srclibstdpanickingrs stdpanickingrustpanicwithhook at srclibstdpanickingrs stdpanickingcontinuepanicfmt at srclibstdpanickingrs rustbeginunwind at srclibstdpanickingrs corepanickingpanicfmt at srclibcorepanickingrs coreresultunwrapfailed allocboxedBoxF as coreopsfunctionFnOnceAcallonce O as webkit gtkautowebviewWebViewExtrunjavascriptrunjavascripttrampoline unknown unknown gtaskreturnnewerror unknown unknown unknown unknown unknown unknown unknown unknown unknown ZN WTF RunLoop performWorkEv unknown gmaincontextdispatch unknown gmaincontextiteration gapplicationrun O as gioapplicationApplicationExtManualrun gnvimmain stdrtlangstartclosure stdpanickingtrydocall at srclibstdrtrs at srclibstdpanickingrs rustmaybecatchpanic at srclibpanicunwindlibrs stdrtlangstartinternal at srclibstdpanickingrs at srclibstdpanicrs at srclibstdrtrs main libcstartmain start After updating to pango command menu is invisible im using disableextcmdline with gnvims cmdline its okay Screenshot from After scrolling with mouse scroll fonts become blurred Screenshot from neovimgtk also has similar problems and there is some details about why pango deprecated Freetype and using Harfbuzz instead
