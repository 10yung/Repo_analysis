This OutputFormat outputs a Text struct that can be used in a SwiftUI view It ignores the font as you normally would apply the font with a font modifier in SwiftUI Either we should convert the themes font to a SwiftUIFont and and use that or leave it to the user to style fonts separately from highlighting syntax colours I favour the later as it fits better with the model of SwiftUI and leaves SwiftUITextOutputFormat to be only concerned with constructing the highlighted text but this might be confusing as it ignores the themes font However the attributed text string is different to the font and they could be considered separate and treated separately as SwiftUi pushes us in that direction and an additional font modifier would override any theme font anyway Maybe this should really be a view modifier swift Having a comment with a just a whitespace and a digit in a first line fails to highlight correctly It treats as normal text and digit as a number component Will work on a fix when I have time unless someone wants to take care of it Ive added support for selecting themes during image generation PR should be merge before To select a theme use t parameter SplashImageGen func helloworld String Int MyImagepng t sunset
