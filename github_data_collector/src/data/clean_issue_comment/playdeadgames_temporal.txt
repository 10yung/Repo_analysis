There is a problem with motion gameObject when it has scale vector It seems that in such situation VelocityBufferTag doesnt work correctly Mesh is blurred Does anyone know how to fix that issue Currently this tool does not support dynamic resolution Ive hacked it in see attached file but this is very probably not correctly Thought Id share it anyways perhaps someone can fix it properly TemporalReprojectiontxt Im guessing this isnt on the table at all for the developers but since they incredibly added single pass stereo support I had to ask Its amazing that they added single pass VR support even though they didnt have to but does anyone know how to mitigate the streaking which appears in VR Hi EDIT On file VelocityBuffershader While trying to understand the algorithm I noticed on line the multicompile statement and the following defines TILESIZE TILESIZE TILESIZE But when they are used they are spelled differently line and onwards TILESIZE TILESIZE TILESIZE Note the underscores between TILE and SIZE Does that mean you always use a tile size of on those shaders Is that what shipped with the game BEGIN EDIT I ask this because on file VelocityBuffercs line neighborMaxSupport is initialized like this public NeighborMaxSupport neighborMaxSupport NeighborMaxSupportTileSize So apparently it was supposed to be TILESIZE by default END EDIT EDIT Apparently this pass is not even being used because of neighborMaxGen being false so maybe this issue is not important Best regards Daniel Why not make this project available for free on Unity Asset Store This could potentially give more visibility to the temporal AA so more testers and potential contributors to this open source project Hello people if you ever read this thank you Its amazing its top notch and Unitytecs are unable to come even close with their current implementation ill stick to this for as long as its possible love you Is this effect already using unity native motion vector or still using custom one
