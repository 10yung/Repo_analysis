First off thank you for the work Anyways I was wondering why are there apps that are not very well known what they actually do examples Joyose comxiaomijoyose Hybrid Accessory commiuihybridaccessory UniPlay Services commilinkservice There are some that might make sense what they do but actually we still dont know Catchlog combspcatchlog Translation services which doesnt ask for any permissions few from kingsoft xmcloud youdao Yellow Pages heard it breaks stuff like contacts no source though commiuiyellowpage PAI androidautoinstallsconfigXiaomidevicecodename There are a few more how ever I am genuinely interested why they are thrown in there when the app is supposed to provide stuff that are proven as much one could to not break anything but at the same time I havent found a thread on most of the above Thank you If window is maximized not all elements are stretching to fill space Most useful simple to use tool Can a facility be added so as other adb adb shell command can be run from tool ie many user faces issue of google back up They need to run commands like adb shell bmgr run bmgr backupnow all bmgr backupnow appdata bmgr list transports bmgr enabled bmgr enable true etc etc I do not suggest to provide all above and other user helpful commands as preconfigured but if at least a facility to initiate ADB Shell may be provide to get device prompt To add space by uninstalling app also ensuring privacy by clearing all data can you add following method while removing any app First force stop clear catch clear all data then uninstall app Also please if we can export the list for all tabs of the tool as separate text files for keeping record of apps uninstalled disabled which can be useful in case of situation when tool can not be used and manual change is needed to be done Best Regards I saw the previous issue and I know you dont want to add all possible apps to the default list but here are some additional ones that I tested can be safely removed and are all Xiaomi bloat Gallerycommiuigallery WMServicecommiuiwmsvc Weathercommiuiweather NextPaycommiuinextpay MiSoundcommiuimisound MiPlayClientcomxiaomimiplayclient miconnectservicecomxiaomimiconnectservice XiaomiAccountcomxiaomiaccount Gallery is the Xiaomi photo gallery which is useless once you install Google Photos WMService is some kind of analytics thing Weather is useless if you remove their default widget and dont use the Weather app NextPay MiSound and MiPlayClient dont seem to have icons in the Global rom and removing them doesnt seem to have had any bad effects The miconnectservice I honestly dont know but removing it hasnt caused any issues And XiaomiAccount is unnecessary once the phone has been setup and removing it completely kills the Xiami account section in Settings Out of all of these I think the Gallery is the most useful for most users as its an extra unremovable useless home screen icon if youre using Google Photos The others I removed because I want as little Xiaomi tracking and services installed as possible If you can include these in the default app list that would be great if not no worries
