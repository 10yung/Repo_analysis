Ive upgraded Akka dependencies to version and fixed the only test file that didnt compile right away Hi I was experimenting with OldestAutoDowning strategy and stumbled upon a behavior when multiple nodes get into unreachable state at the same time or within a stableafter window In that case OldestAutoDowning will down one node only the events for other nodes will not get processed and things are stuck in Leader can currently not perform its duties state forever INFO acClusterakkasomecluster Cluster Node akkatcpsomecluster Leader can currently not perform its duties reachability status akkatcpsomecluster akkatcpsomecluster Unreachable Unreachable akkatcpsomecluster akkatcpsomecluster Unreachable Unreachable member status akkatcpsomecluster Up seentrue akkatcpsomecluster Up seenfalse akkatcpsomecluster Up seenfalse These are the settings akkaclusterdowningproviderclass tanukkiakkaclusterautodownOldestAutoDowning customdowning stableafter s oldestautodowning oldestmemberrole master downifalone false Seems to me in this case CustomAutoDownBasedownPendingUnreachableMembers will never get called in that case as its called from OldestAutoDownBaseonMemberRemoved only and somehow that will not happen How to reproduce start node with master role start two other nodes not having master role kill the two nodes one gets downed the other one not Leader can currently not perform its duties state forever Is this a bug or a feature Thx Trying to use OldestAutoDown strategy and when self shutdown takes more than seconds cluster member doesnt terminate Wish I could configure that parameter some way Ideally the akka dependency should be optional so that whoever uses the library doesnt have to use the same akka version as the one declared in this project
