Im unable to run versions higher than on my machine while other machines are fine Same happens with unstable releases newer than beta and it doesnt matter whether Im running prebuilt binaries or building from source As the result its impossible to run actual version without upgrading my processors Therefore I consider this issue as critical one Parity Ethereum version and higher Operating
