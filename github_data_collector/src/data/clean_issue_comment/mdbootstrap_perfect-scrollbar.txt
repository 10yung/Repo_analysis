Im trying to use PS on a table with s of dynamically generated records For some reason when one of the table controls is clicked and the bs modal pops the mouse wheel is still bound to the scroll bar and I am able to scroll beneath the modal dialog Things I have tried explicity adding modalopen class to the table destroying the the scroll bar causes it to lose its place binding and focusing to another element All I want is to detach it from the mousewheel Thanks Make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue thank you x Check FAQ and Caveats x Search if theres already one

perfectscrollbar where you can have a initial starting point NOT scrollTo or scrollTop where it animates the scrolling I mean if i have have divs and i want to load the page and scroll bar at point ths div instead of scrolling to and from there it scrolls up and down I played around with classpsraily and classpsrailx but no luck Make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue

pink JS new PerfectScrollbarselectps HTML div classselectps idselectps Content div However theres a bunch of whitespace below the content when scrolling down img width altScreen Shot at PM src Its not critical to my work I just discovered it when making an example for another issue Im experiencing I think specific to reactperfectscrollbar Thank you for this project Let me know if I can provide more information or if you have ideas that I can investigate for a PR I am working on a project and there I have used perfect scrollbar all works fine until I have converted my project to support rtl mode The Scrollbar works perfectly when used with or without suppressScrollX true in ltr mode but when comes to rtl mode it works perfectly without suppressScrollX true when once I set this parameter it shift my content to the left When I inspected I saw that the scroll is automatically increasing the number from left I am using suppressScrollX true to remove horizontal scrollbar as preferred in Here is my example code DOCTYPE html html head titletitle link relstylesheet typetextcss hrefperfectscrollbarcss style html direction rtl container position relative width px height px style head body div idcontainer img src div script typetextjavascript srcperfectscrollbarminjsscript script typetextjavascript const ps new PerfectScrollbarcontainer suppressScrollX true script body html Download working example with issue Make sure these boxes are checked before submitting your issue thank you Check FAQ and Caveats Search if theres already one reported in Issues x Prepare a JSFiddle reproducing the issue issue JSFiddle Provide a page or source code where the issue can be checked heres my fiddle great project indeed question at page load how do I scroll to the end of scrollbar when there is lot of content question how do I handle the scroll at beginning event I mean suppose user wants to load history of chat so he scrolls at beginning and then ajax content is loaded and then scrollbar updates its position so that user can scroll up further thanks NJ When I dynamically change the height of the main container to which the perfect scrollbar is already applied the following occurs Perfect scrollbar correctly detects new height of content Perfect scrollbar correctly updates the new scrollbar height Click hold the scrollbar and drag to move the new content correctly However when rotating the mouse wheel the Perfect scrollbar incorrectly uses the number of steps according to the initial initialization of the scrollbar ie the height that was at the beginning Hi there I have an issue with the ps scroll in a site I built Whenever the user hovers over an iframe for instance a youtube embed the scroll doesnt work anymore You can view this issue here I placed elements over the biggest part of the video to sort of fix this but for instance when you hover over the progress bar in the video where the divs are not over the embed the scroll doesnt work anymore Now the parent of the scrollable element has a transform on it Is that maybe the reason this happens Best Tom Id love to be able to have a fixed or max height for the rail in the same way there is a max height for the thumb Is this already built in or would it have to be a new feature Is there a way to achieve the purpose of the css overscrollbehavior contain when using Perfect Scrollbar I dont want the scroll to propagate beyond the container using Perfect Scrollbar Im opening this to partially solve Ive had a look through the source code and creating a setting that can universally extend the default class names is absolutely too much of a hassle since it would require passing around the user setting merged with cls into all the places where its used It was however quite straightforward to support a single custom class for the container element which basically allows users to replace ps with a class of their choosing This would mean any styles included in the default CSS file will stop working but Ive added a clear warning for that in the READMEmd file and hopefully someone else might come up with a way to export an SCSSLESS mixin that will allow people to regenerate the CSS without too much hassle Regarding the pull request per se please note that I am only including the changes related to the task itself I would leave the task of updating the version and rebuilding the dist folder to you when you decide to merge this I was not able however to work directly on your master branch because of a lot of outdated dependencies basically prettier was screaming at me from the first run of npm test I had to update the dependencies on my local environment in order to be able to work and test the feature I did not however include the changes I made to update the dependencies I think that you as the maintainer should do this You can have a look at my updatedeps branch here If youre ok with that we can open another PR and merge that before this one
