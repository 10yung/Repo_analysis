 Hello guys I updated this repository to alpine and consul to I am trying to set my bind interface through CONSULBINDINTERFACE and it is pulling the correct IP for the interface but it is still giving me an error fakeuserfakeserver fakedir docker run it rm nethost e CONSULBINDINTERFACEeth consul consul agent client ui retryjoinserver uslocal retryjoinserver uslocal retryjoinserver uslocal datadirtmpconsul Found address for interface eth setting bind option Starting Consul agent Error starting agent Failed to get advertise address Multiple private IPs found Please configure one When I run it and fill in the bind address manually it works fakeuserfakeserver fakedir docker run it rm nethost consul consul agent ui client bind retryjoinserver uslocal retryjoinserver uslocal retryjoinserver uslocal datadirtmpconsul Starting Consul agent Starting Consul agent RPC Consul agent running Version v Node name server localus Datacenter dc Server false bootstrap false Client Addr HTTP HTTPS DNS RPC Cluster Addr LAN WAN Gossip encrypt false RPCTLS false TLSIncoming false Atlas disabled Im not sure why its not working as its getting the right bind address to pass to bind Any specific documentation on how to configure the dockerconsul to enable security In the Legacy branch the dockerfiles used to expose the consul ports This has been removed in the current Dockerfiles Was there motivation for this or was it simply an oversight I maintain a test suite that spins up ephemeral Consul containers to test API calls against and its easier to map ports when they are exposed so if this is simply an oversight Ill open a PR to add them back To be specific How does consul support scalability for example providing the services info via the round robin Unable to elect leader even after all nodes join the quorum Starting one server node with bootstrapexpect other nodes join the cluster ie node and node and complete the quorum But the leader election does not start it always gives the above error Please suggest the possible solutions Thank you I m using the latest version from I have cloned and tagged locally the image consulserver from your repository dockerconsul agent and server All the cluster and membership core functionalities work like a charm however I m struggling to see the UI in action OEL consulserver mfarache docker run name nodeUIserver p p p udp consulserver bind client dcdc Whenever I access to localhost ui I get a error Reason seems to be related with this JS stack trace eferenceError consulHost is not defined at Classmodel applicationminjs at apply applicationminjs at ClasssuperWrapper as model applicationminjs at Classdeserialize applicationminjs at ObjectrunSharedModelHook applicationminjs at ObjectgetModel applicationminjs at applicationminjs at tryCatch applicationminjs at invokeCallback applicationminjs at publish applicationminjs In old distributions there were a UI directory in the image and browsing old code I noticed that consulHost was defined in the static html file Now with the consulserver image the static code is packed as part of the consul binary I wonder which value or how can I configure so the UI is available hopefully adding some parameter on startup Or is it possible that the old consulHost variable within the html file is still not initialized Curl is great for http checks but netcat would be great for generally checking tcp sockets After the start of the service the consulwath connection service is rejectedI dont know how to solve it dockercomposeyml sms build environment MICROREGISTRYADDRESSconsul volumes logssmslogs etcenvstringsconfetcenvstringsconf links consul consul command server bootstrap rejoin image progriumconsullatest server log Creating smsconsul Creating smssms Attaching to smsconsul smssms consul WARNING Bootstrap mode enabled Do not enable unless necessary consul WARNING It is highly recommended to set GOMAXPROCS higher than sms Listening on consul Starting raft data migration sms Broker Listening on consul Starting Consul agent sms Registering node sms E AC consul Starting Consul agent RPC consul Consul agent running consul Node name dd da a consul Datacenter dc consul Server true bootstrap true consul Client Addr HTTP HTTPS DNS RPC consul Cluster Addr LAN WAN consul Gossip encrypt false RPCTLS false TLSIncoming false consul Atlas disabled consul consul Log data will now stream in as it occurs consul consul INFO serf EventMemberJoin dd da a consul INFO serf EventMemberJoin dd da a dc consul INFO raft Node at Follower entering Follower state consul INFO consul adding server dd da a Addr DC dc consul INFO consul adding server dd da a dc Addr DC dc consul ERR agent failed to sync remote state No cluster leader sms consulwatch Watch type services errored Get dial tcp getsockopt connection refused retry in s
