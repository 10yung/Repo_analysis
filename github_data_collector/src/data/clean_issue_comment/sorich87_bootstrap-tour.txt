Security Alerts page details I just copied and pasted the Setup your tour code sample and there are no next or prev buttons at all Everything is included properly Everything else seems to work fine except this little error I dont know if this is a bug or a problem that only i face Im surprised no one has mentioned this already or if they have I was unable to find it Anyhow has anyone stored tour state in a database before If so how is this possible I know there will be requirements on the backend but I am more interested in knowing how to set it up on the frontend Any help or advice is greatly appreciated Thank you Im posting this because the same questionissue keeps being raised and people are creating well intentioned but not secure solutions to it Very simply if you are using Bootstrap Tour with the current versions of BS or BS see below the PrevNextetc buttons and other elements will not appear in your tour popover The reason is the introduction of the Bootstrap Sanitizer This sanitizer strips content from popovers to prevent security vulnerabilities like XSS attacks The obvious solution many people have chosen is to turn off the sanitizer globally or change the global Bootstrap sanitizer whitelist or disable the sanitizer for the Tour popovers To be clear do not do this unless you are confident you understand the implications and the risksways in which an XSS attack could be introduced into your sitecode Making global changes to the BS sanitizer could introduce security vulnerabilities into other rd party plugins youre using If you want to fix this missing button problem yourself you must add the correct DOM elements to the specific Tours popover whitelist not globally Alternatively you can use my fork of Tour that solves this problem You can see my fork here You can read the detail of this sanitizer issue here BS note Bootstrap Tour is not BS compatible My fork is fully BS compatible and fixes a number of other issues In BS v tooltips and popovers sanitize HTML by default thus removing navigation buttons from the tour Using bootstrap the popovernagivation div is always empty This is due to bootstrap it removes all button tags from the popover content It is possible to enable the button by adding sanitize false after htmltrue when the popover is initialized elementpopover Thanks for this library Regards Thierry Im having such a hard time with the redirection option Can you post more example on the docs please steps path homebooks orphan true path homebooks redirect function documentlocationhref homebookdetailbook path RegExp home
