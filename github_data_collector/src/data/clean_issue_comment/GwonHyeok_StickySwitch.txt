 Hi thanks for this awesome switch My app supports SDK versions up to version and I use SVG icons for the sticky switch So Ive tested my app in a virtual device with SDK version and the app crahses by inflating the layout with following exception exceptiontxt It seems that the sticky switch doesnt support SVGs in older versions If I use PNG icons the app doesnt crash Hi thanks for developing such a great library Is there possible to define a mode where switching leftright is only possible with swyping to the directions and not responding to the clicks Hi GwonHyeok I just imported this project into my Android Studio and run the same in Nogut OS switch button not working can you please check Hi How to use it into a toolbar as a menu please I would like to create a view like this one Thanks Hello I am using your library to my project and it is displayed perfectly inside a RelativeLayout But when I move RelativeLayout inside a NestedScrollView the view is gone I think you should use static variables instead of enums this will take around bytes public static enum Things THING THING Or you can have two static int which will take bytes public static final int THING public static final int THING
