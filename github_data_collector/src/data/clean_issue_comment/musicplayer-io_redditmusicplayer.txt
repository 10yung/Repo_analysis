numerous times First batch of tracks loads but when pressing Load More all that happens is that spinning circle animation appears It does not load more tracks regardless of how long I wait Why does player use as an icon for next track instead of I believe that first one is more widely used as fast forward button while later one usually represnets the skip to next track Even emoticons named fast forward fastforward and next track button nexttrackbutton reflect that In my oopinion it would be good to change current button icons for the ones that better indicate their function Bumps lodash from

dont seem to autoplay they just stop the player until I manually go and hit play again and then a second time I see the soundcloud player flash and then start playing Like this one Has anyone tried implementing a Spotify button in case the songs are on Spotify I would love to implement if youd like It would be good to have the option to automatically skip tracks that have votes below a certain threshold The main use case would be because occasionally tracks are posted in the wrong subreddits the moderators wont necessarily remove those posts but the community will down vote them so they have upvote But also if I wanted to just listen to high quality tracks then I might want to choose to skip everything below upvotes for example This file is linked to from the README but it doesnt exist
