If I understand correctly Houston still uses the binary protocol instead of HTTP Apple announced it will stop supporting this protocol as of November Are there any plans for updating Houston to using the HTTP based APNs provider API Hey all The new iOS requires some new headers in the APNS so the pushes will work apnspushtype apnspriority Otherwise the pushes wont work for iOS os hey guys wondering what you are doing about the ios update for apnspush type header Im not sure why this is happening but Im not getting any response back just nil and no error message This stackoverflow answer has a good explanation of this issue In the houston docs it says To send a silent push notification set sound to an empty string Instead we can set the apnspriority to Send the push message at a time that takes into account power considerations for the device Notifications with this priority might be grouped and delivered in bursts They are throttled and in some cases are not delivered The default is priory which is disallowed for silent push Notifications with this priority must trigger an alert sound or badge on the target device Which is why its believed you need to send a sound to get silent push working From my testing using an empty sound string causes a vibration of the app screen shot at am I was able to send push successfully to device using command line But it suddenly stopped working without any other changes as you can see in screenshot attached is there any limitation that we can send only some number of notification during a time period or anything else It happened to me several times sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt work Not sure the push isnt sent or isnt arriving or what I created a UNNotificationServiceExtension The push arrived on one of the tries but stopped working after one success I removed the mutablecontent flag and the push started to be delivered again as expected require houston token df a e d c d c d af d d c df d f fca pem pathtopushcertpem pw APN HoustonClientdevelopment APNcertificate Filereadpem Create a notification that alerts a message to the user plays a sound and sets the badge on the app notification HoustonNotificationnewdevice token notificationalert sdakjfl Notifications can also change the badge count have a custom sound have a category identifier indicate available Newsstand content or pass along arbitrary data notificationbadge notificationsound sosumiaiff notificationcategory INVITECATEGORY notificationcontentavailable true notificationmutablecontent true notificationcustomdata foo bar And sent Thats all it takes APNpushnotification puts Error notificationerror if notificationerror Firstly thanks for the great library It helped me a lot Last week I had struggled with the push for days The iOS guys gave me new iOS certificates and ask me to update current certificates on server Everything worked fine except that iOS app didnt receive the push The notificationerror was empty I investigated and figured out that the iOS certificate was a multitopics one which contains bundle ids for both staging and production environments Unfortunately houston doesnt support specifying apnstopic header so I asked iOS guy to give a singletopic certificate and it worked like a charm I wonder if we should allow specifying bundle id so that library can work with multitopics certificates Thanks As of iOS you have the option to pass an title I cant see that this is supported by Houston
