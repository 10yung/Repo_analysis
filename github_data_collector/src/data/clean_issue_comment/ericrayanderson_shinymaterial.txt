sentence ERROR cannot open the connection to This is related to the default way to replace the default CSS in Hello I am having trouble having updatematerialradiobutton trigger reactive outputs appR regular shiny works ok The default radio button is Normal App launches and it updates to Uniform and the reactive output changes appR shinymaterial similar functionality doesnt work The default radio button is No cost estimate The observeEvent updates the radio button choice to Cost per animal But the reactive output doesnt change until I click on the Cost Estimates drawer and then click on COST PARAMETERS button the choice is selected so the update worked but the reactive output doesnt get rendered reactive section is not called See code snippets down below I would appreciate any thoughts

Thank you so much for putting this package together I am finding that it loads a lot faster than shinydashboard for me The project I am working on right now includes leaflet and I noticed that when I open the side navbar the map controls and attribution were showing up in front of everything It also occurred with the selectizeInput dropdown menu Here is a link to an image that should give you an idea of what I am talking about Image Link I felt pretty stupid trying to figure out what was going on and finally came across the zindex attribute It turns out that leaflettop leafletbottom defaults to which pushes it in front of everything at all times I dont know if other people are having this issue but I just wanted to bring it to your attention as a potential pain point for people I added this code to my shiny application to resolve everything r tagsheadHTMLstyle leaflettop leafletbottom zindex style Here is a link to an image showing that it corrected Image Link Corrected I apologize

login tabBut after login when I switch to the other tabs the components like textInput buttons appear to be inherited from materialpage even though they arent surrounded by materialpage in that tab and hence the view appears to be distortedCan u look into it Hi thanks for the hard work to implement material design for shiny Im trying to apply a custom theme derived via the SASS definition of materialize v I think I should place the CSS and JavaScript files in corresponding folders under www but what is the recommended way to apply the theme instead of the builtin version of materialize CSSJavaScript Is there a theme apply function somewhere to replace the builtin theme Thanks Best Johannes We need to programatically select a side nav tab We tried to adapt the example from bilbaoba s

Any help on this would be much appreciated Thank you I did ask this on SO too but had no response Is there any plan to implement the same functionality of selectizeInput using selectizejs in ShinyMaterial Selectizejs selectizeInput provides a much more flexible interface compared to the basic select input Hi Eric Just a minor patch for the function updatematerialbutton I forgot to inverse the boolean enable The property for the js code is disabled and its different from the R function enable Thanks
