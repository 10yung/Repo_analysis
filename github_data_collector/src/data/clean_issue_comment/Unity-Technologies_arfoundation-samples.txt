 This tutorial only discusses using Cloud Anchors with ARFoundation on Android Does anyone know if it will also work with iOS Thanks Whatever happened to ARKit remote I want to Instantiate the D model of a human after the user detected But after that I dont want my D model to move with the user I want my model to stay there only where the user was detected Can some can tell me how can I achieve that Hello Sir I am trying to rescan the image marker again without losing the ground plane detection or resetting the ar session can you please tell me how to do this Regards Shubham Hello Sir Ive been trying to spawn different prefabs for differents images in ARFoundation but unable to do Could you please tell me how should i do that We are making a project with image tracking and we were using these versions of the packages comunityxrarcore comunityxrarfoundation comunityxrarkit The FocusMode on the ARCameraManager is set to Auto Experienced this issue On the Pixel XL phone the camera is not focusing at all and behaves as Fixed focus instead The default focus is quite far from the camera so the objects close to the camera are always blurry Pointing the camera at nearfar objects does not change anything the focus is still fixed At the same time everything works perfectly on our other test phone Xiaomi MI Tried setting the focus mode to Auto manually in Update as suggested on Unity Forums Did not work Tried the versions of the packages with the same results works as intended on Xiaomi MI no focus at all on Pixel XL Started rolling back the packages trying to find the combination that would work on both test phones Along the way ran into other known issues Camera not turning on after reloading the AR scenes Tracking events removed or limited not being sent correctly when the tracked image is lost resulting in tracked object prefab staying on forever and never being removed Discovered that these packages are working both on Xiaomi MI and Pixel XL no issues mentioned above no focus issues on Pixel XL comunityxrarcore preview comunityxrarfoundation comunityxrarkit Has anyone experienced this before Any advice on getting the focus working with the latest versions of the packages on Pixel XL Unity Unity f ARFoundation preview ARCoreXRPlugin Preview Device MI The check code is as follows public class MyComponent IEnumerator Start if ARSessionstate ARSessionStateNone ARSessionstateARSessionStateCheckingAvailability yield return ARSessionCheckAvailability if ARSessionstate ARSessionStateUnsupported DebugLogUnsupported Start some fallback experience for unsupported devices else DebugLogSupported Start the AR session Ive trying to create two RenderTextures one for PositionMap and one for ColorMap to use in VFX Graph from ARKits Human Depth Image Human Stencil Image Camera Background Image More or less implementing what keijiro did here but for ARKit Ideally I would end up with PositionMap RenderTexture that maps all the human stencil pixels to the screencamera with x y depth and can work on different orientations and aspect ratios ColorMap RenderTexture that maps all human stencil pixels from the camera background It has a lot of moving parts that Im not very familiar with and Im not sure whats the right approach would be Any ideas or steps that I should take would be appreciated I am able to build and run my app on iphone but it does not track object and tried sample objects also AR Foundation preview ARKit XR plugin preview AR Subsystems preview Xcode Unity f After dynamically adding a tracked image using ScheduleAddImageJob to a MutableRuntimeReferenceImageLibrary is there a way to remove that image from the library so that it is no longer tracked The docs say You should never Destroy a trackable component or its GameObject directly For trackables that support manual removal its manager will provide a method to remove it For example to remove an anchor you would call RemoveAnchor on the ARAnchorManager Is there something like a RemoveImage for a MutableRuntimeReferenceImageLibrary
