The actual call is closest Looking at the docs it seems the last time that line was update was years ago Just want to update to eliminate confusion for others coming to the repo for the first time Use existing Bundler To try passing the build in CI this PR tries to run tests with the provided bundle command instead of trying to install one Result This stops the error condition that some of the CI matrix elements could not start building Drop sudo false Travis directive In addition This PR removes the nolongerused Travis setting sudo false See more at the Travis blog gemfiles Drop testunit duplicates pick version of sqlite In gemfiles there as a duplication now removed rails gemfile asked for a sqlite which was not provided This PR changes the build badges to SVG for sharper readability PS Also drops Gemnasium badge that service has been discontinued Is it possible to retrieve information about which municipality the given address belongs to Thanks Instead of the lat and lng columns having to be directly accessible on the table using chain notation eg Locationlat is there any current support or would it be useful to someone other than me to have the ability to specify accessing the lat lng data from a nested attribute json for example Something like Houselocation lat is what Im looking for This request addresses the following two problems PostGIS was not supported so the adaptor for Postgres was simply duplicated with a new name Theres definitely better integration that can be achieved with native PostGIS methods but Im not experienced enough to do that Fixed a deprecation warning ahead of Rails String interpolation is going to become unsupported soon so the safer placeholder substitution was used instead Currently trying to make a PR to deal with Postgresql failures due to Arel SQL not providing an alias to distance and thus returning no values otherwise Ill just go and use the geocoder gem instead Is it possible to adopt Docker as a better solution for testing against multiple databases This way anyone can more easily contribute without needing to install on their host OS the various databases and versions of those databases Further it would be good to then amend the READMEmd to cover off on this I have some data stored on a Redshift cluster I wasnt able to use the tool using that tool so Ive integrated the adapter and the gem to support the connection
