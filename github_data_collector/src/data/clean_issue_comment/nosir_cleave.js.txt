Hello Found strange component behavior when using Cleavejs date input and datePattern is bound to state I have a dynamic calendar with Cleavejs input Depending on my tree selections calendar show days or months and Im changing datePattern value in state expecting that Cleave input will see changes by react vision components should be dynamic dependent on state changes Here is JsFiddle expamle Eg with whole options object bound to state As you can see placeholder is working dynamically but datePattern not Valid to Cleavejs versions from to Im trying to write a number which has to look like this There is a numeralDecimarMark option but I cant find a numeralThousandsMark option Is there a way to do it Cutting text CtrlX from an ordinary readonly input element does not remove the text With Cleave however selecting the entire content of a readonly input element and pressing CtrlX removes the text Please check the readonly property of the element before calling thisonInput in function onCut onCut function e if CleaveUtilcheckFullSelectionthiselementvalue return thiscopyClipboardDatae if thiselementreadonly thisonInput When phone true it is possible to use only one delimiter to format like that But it is not possible to define delimiters array to format phone number like that So this code is not working phone true phoneRegionCode RU prefix blocks delimiters Possible to adjust According to documentation I have been trying to integrate cleavejs using TypeScript img width altScreenshot src But I am ended up with following issue Import assignment cannot be used when targeting ECMAScript modules Consider using import as ns from mod import a from mod import d from mod or another module format instead I tried with all possible StackOverflow solutions for that but could not solve it So I came back from typescleavejs and tried with accessing Cleave module default function Even though I am passing native element to Cleave first parameter but it is undefined import Cleave from cleavejs import cleavejsdistaddonscleavephonei njs ngAfterViewInit let domElement thisphoneNumbernativeElement as HTMLElement consolelogdomElement domElement the element is there let cleave CleavedomElement phone true phoneRegionCode BR What can be the issue on above code Or it would be highly appreciated if there is working solution for integrating cleavejs in Angular Any chance of getting a feature where the formatting would be applied also from the change event I would like this to work js elementvalue ABCD elementdispatchEventnew CustomEventchange bubbles true The phone formatter for region GB is broken These are the errors that appear in my console cleavephonegbjs Uncaught SyntaxError Invalid regular expression Unterminated character class at RegExp anonymous at cleavephonegbjs at cleavephonegbjs anonymous cleavephonegbjs anonymous cleavephonegbjs cleaveminjs Uncaught Error cleavejs Please include phonetypeformattercountryjs lib at initPhoneFormatter cleaveminjs at init cleaveminjs at new i cleaveminjs at HTMLDocumentanonymous summary If I include phonetypeformattergbjs I still receive cleavephonegbjs Uncaught SyntaxError Invalid regular expression Unterminated character class at RegExp anonymous at cleavephonegbjs at cleavephonegbjs I tried switching to a couple of other regions and those work fine The error is reproducible even on the demo site just select region code GB and the numbers wont get formatted Add an instance method modify on class Cleave to allow for changing of properties on the object after it is first created I am trying to mask a US SSN by using prefix It strips the actual value Screen Shot at PM The last version that works is which indicates caused the bug Hi I wanted to know if it was possible to choose the type of content in each block letters numbers or both In the same principle as the delimiters AZ AZ Thanks
