Hi John When trying to produce variable interaction plots with plotgginteraction I cannot get the order of the faceting to match the minimal depth rank order with the set I am interested in being produced in alphabetical order instead I looked at several other plot methods for the package and found that variable is often set to a factor after a gather step I tested if this could fix the issue by adding ggdtavariable factorggdtavariable levelsuniqueggdtavariable after line which worked This doesnt exclude the high possibility that I am simply doing something wrong but I thought I would send through the code Thanks for the great package Hi Just a quick question What pct stand for in calcrocrfsrc When using ggsurvival with the by parameter and then plotting using plotggsurvival the colors and the legends are not correct assigned to the groups To be precise the error seams to be in kaplanR line ff Hi The Survival vignette is really looking good with lots of great plots but Im having problems reproducing many of the examples For example in the begging you mention that you prefer years to days in the pbc data set Yet there is no code how you convert it Doing a naive pbcyears pbcdays I fail in the next part using the ggsurvival function example Next there is no code for the very nice EDA plots in the vignette I also could not get the D example in Appendix to work This line partialtime docallrbindlapplypartialpbctime ggpartial always produces errors I always get errors when there is a theme part in plot There were some updates to randomForestSRC and ggplot recently that may cause a lot of these problems I dont have a good minimal working example or anything but Im going to try my best to describe whats going on After calling ggsurvival with either type kaplan or type nelson and supplying a factor for by survfit with strata on by is called The default is nagroup FALSE so it stratifies only on the other levels of the factor A little further down in the code we have this bit ifisnullby tmsplits whichcFALSEsapply nrowtbl functionindtbltime ind tbltime ind lbls uniquedata by tblgroups lbls forind in lengthtmsplits tblgroups tmsplits ind nrowtbl lbls ind Unique also returns NA as an option but NA was not included as a stratum level so if you have a situation where NA occurs before at least one of your levels it will take its place and youll drop a factor level you potentially cared about I solved it myself by editing in nagroup TRUE to the call to strata in the kaplan and nelson functions because I wanted that information anyway but I guess this might be something encountered by others as well Right now it only does a single class but overlaying multiple classes on each ROC curve is possible An alternative of multiple panels The package and the vignette codes are working perfectly except stlabs involved codes plotggmd lblsstlabs Error in plotggminimaldepthggmd lbls stlabs object stlabs not found Convert S method functions to use UseNext instead of UseMethod method dispatch This should fix issues with arguments and prepare the way for extending to random forest packages beyond randomForestSRC Should also tighten up the whole OO design so that functions that look like S methods really are S methods v release indicates I need to refactor function names to remove dot separators because of clashes with S method names Example functions combineggpartial does not really extend combinedefault plotggminimalvimp should be an argument based alternative to plotggminimaldepth plotggminimalvimp should be an argument based alternative to plotggminimaldepth thereby avoiding S method namings when not applicable
