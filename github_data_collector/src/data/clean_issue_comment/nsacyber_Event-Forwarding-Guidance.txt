I emailed helpintelligencecareersgov for more specific contact information Nov th but have heard nothing back yet I have connectivity between sources and collector and have had events come in for test subscriptions My questionconcern is how to most simply organize individual subscriptions given the fact that event IDs are only unique to sources and not logs For example is it the case that the particular event IDs recommended to be tracked in the Excel spreadsheet are unique for each log or would I have to separate each subscription by event source to be sure I was not getting different events one I care about and others I dont want to forward from the same log that happened to have the same event ID Addresses issue I apologize if this is not the proper avenue but it was the only one I could recognize Is it listed anywhere what the baseline auditadvanced audit policy settingsGPOs that need to be in place in order for all these event IDs to exist in the first place ex Microsoft Recommended baseline or secure audit policy settings or perhaps audit policy settings specific to this repo Cliff CISSP At least on Windows Server the name of the ETW Provider is MicrosoftWindowsCertificateServicesClientLifecycleSystem with GUID BC E A D A E CA C C B In it is MicrosoftWindowsCertificateServicesClientLifecycleSystem for the EventSource Event with ID from System log has incorrect source in section Software and Service Installation of Recommended Events to Collect document Correct source for this event is Service Control Manager Provider Name Service Control Manager Guid d a d e e d f EventSourceName Service Control Manager EventID Also I create pull request to modify RecommendedEventsjson file Change EventSource for Event wit ID A service was installed in the system to correct value This PR may be more substantial than desired and so you choose to decline this but thats fine Im only submitting these PRs in case theyre of interest upstream The commit history should be fairly clear but in short theres zero functional changes Instead the sample WEC subscriptions have had their formatting substantially overhauled to be IMO far more readable and maintainable Theres particular emphasis on the embedded XPath queries which now have consistent formatting with splitting over multiple lines and appropriate indentation This makes parsing and editing them far easier not to mention spotting errors which may not necessarily be syntactic as in PR In addition Ive renamed the subscription files to have more accurate verbose file names I dont see why they need to be short and removed all the samples subscriptions Im unclear what their purpose is and a diff between them and the NT subscriptions shows only very minor changes The NT samples appear to be newer and the changes dont suggest theyre for supporting downlevel OSs so in the absence of a compelling reason to keep them theyve been removed Comments welcome
