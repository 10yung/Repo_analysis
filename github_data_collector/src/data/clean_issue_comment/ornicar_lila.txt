Enjoy Mod message presets are currently hardcoded in English If they were translatable it would increase the number of people who can understand the mod messages they receive Turns out the higlhfu ggwptygtg chat preset buttons are not translated If they were it would allow people using different languages to communicate with each other in a nice and polite way It would really make my day and i know a lot more people would appreaciate this option too since i am not a dev i have no clue if this is possible or how difficult it might be to implement Thanks for reading Granach If a team systematically schedules future team battles they are listed in the wrong order in the team page Intuitively you would expect that the most recent event is at the top and as you go down the list you see events further away in time However the ordering is the opposite of this and if there are many events scheduled the most recent ones including the ongoing one are shifted out of visiblity So you can join events weeks from now but not aware of events starting within a few days a few hours or even the team battle in progress While private tournaments usually dont need action from moderators there have been some big private tournaments recently with massreported chats The chats of private tournaments are currently only visible to people in the tournament Those reports seemed correct but we could not time out the offenders because we couldnt get into the tournament chat Based on uptime does not appear to be near a restart It is contrary to the spirit of a team battle that during team battle games the team of the opponent is not shown Next to the opponent name show some abbreviation of the team name with the color coding used in the tourney Or at least color code the players name according to their team I dont know how to make a date input and fix the layout I find the UX within the Stripe patron flow to be inconsistent Id like to improve upon that but before I put any time into it I thought I would bring it here and see what others thought first When you first get to the Patron page this is the version you see Screenshot of Patron interface I believe this page has the best design between all of them For example the success page you end up on after a successful payment looks like Screenshot of Patron interface ignoring the content which changes based on what you did this page isnt very compelling If you donate a one time payment your patron page will now look like this Screenshot of Patron interface While this looks good its not immediately obvious that the text in the green has switched out to say that youre a patron I suspect many people miss this on their first glance In addition the No ads no subscriptions but open source and passion message is gone If youre back on this page I feel like this message is still important If you donate a lifetime payment amount your patron page will now look like this Screenshot of Patron interface Again the primary lifetime message has replaced the original adspassion message This time the lifetime button changes colour which is a nice touch but is inconsistent with the monthly and onetime payment pages If you donate a monthly amount your patron page will by default look like this Screenshot of Patron interface This is completely different from the other pages While it is better than the thank you page in terms of overall design details I feel it is not as nice as the original page Additionally it will list the payments from your current subscription here but none of your oneoff payments or lifetime payments or payments from your previous monthly subscriptions are listed which is confusing and in some ways disheartening If you had been making a number of oneoff payments and then were able to afford a monthly payment and switched it feels like lichess has forgotten about your previous payments If you click the view other lichess patrons or make an additional donation now then you end up back on the original page Screenshot of Patron interface this time around though the message in the green is back to the adspassion one no indication of a monthly payment and the tools in the middle also give you no indication of what your monthly payment is now There are also some other UX changes suggested in other tickets like which I also agree with I also feel that we should be showing back to each patron their entire history of payments if possible While I personally know that lichess appreciates every payment from every person no matter how frequent and no matter the amount it would great it this UI reflected this sentiment in a consistent manner Utlimately Id like to see these changes Consistent design for each page Consistent messaging about what you are supporting regardless of what your status is Complete history of your patron activity Clear and understandable way to change your current status to something else Consistent and clear messaging about our appreciation for all of our patrons I have some ideas kicking around in my head but wont bother putting them here until I better understand whether this is important for me to spend my time on or not
