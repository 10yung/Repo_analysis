Related to discussion in Hello I installed OSMC on a raspberry pi w But my OTG adapter has problems and I had to do all the configuration through the Kore app through the wifi network registered in the installation process Now I need to take this device to another home where it will be used and I need to put the wifi network there but I have no keyboard broken OTG and would like to take the raspberry with the registered wifi network Is there any file in the SD Card folders that I can include the information if I access it through my linux computer provision for card names tidied up audio sink names OSMC for Linux has silently been pulled from OSMC webpage Will it come back samnazarko We have a script that monitors new PINN OS releases that runs every day and notifies us of changes Are you aware that whenever you make a new OSMC release we get notified for days that the release date has changed then its reverted then its updated then reverted again For example here are the last notifications Sunday th Nov osjson Release Date Change OSMCPi Monday th November osjson Release Date Change OSMCPi osjson Release Date Change OSMCPi Tuesday th November osjson Release Date Change OSMCPi Im guessing maybe one of your mirrors is not getting updated in a timely manner The notifications are not a problem for us but it does indicate that some of your users might not always be getting the latest release I keep getting this even when running as admin on my admin account Help MacOS sudo DownloadsqthostinstallerappContentsMacOSqthostinstaller user Sun Oct OSMC Installer

with the DLNA more especially witht the Set as watched feature It does not work with DLNA Is it normal please I would expect that when I watch an episode it is being marked as watched even if it is DLNA Regards F Added humanizing refresh rates for GUI resolution and whitelists Also added a few new settings And a little code cleanup Hi Finally installed a dpapposmc I had to make some changes in order to make it play nicely with my retrosmcemulationstationretropie installation besides it I changed the following in file etcpulseclientconf makes pactl work defaultserver varrunpulsenative In file etcpulsedaemonconf fixes audio emulationstation buffer underruns source defaultfragments defaultfragmentsizemsec in file etcpulsesystempa loadmodule modulecliprotocolunix This enables the use of pacmd command Example osmcosmc sudo su rootosmchomeosmc export PULSERUNTIMEPATHvarrunpulse rootosmchomeosmc pacmd Welcome to PulseAudio Use help for usage information C However youre advised against doing this due to security reasons Just like youre advised against running pulseaudio systemwide but this is not really a problem in singleuser htpc scenarios I also changed the following settings in etcpulsedaemonconf highpriority yes nicelevel exitidletime flatvolumes no defaultsamplerate resamplemethod speexfloat defaultsamplerate to as that is default of emulationstation and changd the resamplemethod Now I can play audio via bluetooth on osmc and play star wars rogue squadron on my rpi b at the same time yay k s complains if these are not available
