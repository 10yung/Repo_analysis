 Alacritty delta All light themes are broken Somehow minuscolorxx does not set to xx but adds xx minuscolor shows minus diffs with no color Are there any plans to support sidebyside viewing Do this when the mjs javascript file extension is recognized in bat see cc devsnek When committing eg a patchfile in a git repository that has a line which contains only delta fails with the following error as it expects such a line to contain keywords for the diff thread deltateststestdiffindiff panicked at byte index is out of bounds of srclibcorestrmodrs note run with RUSTBACKTRACE environment variable to display a backtrace This patch changes the diffing behavior to ensure that lines containing only wont be parsed Git recently added colormoved support to colour moved code Would it be possible to add support for that in delta See for an explanation since its the same issue It appears that delta has some trouble finding the end of a hunk diff a b x y z a b z y x Submodule xyz contains untracked content Is displayed roughly as a x y z a b z y x ubmodule xyz contains untracked content Note how Submodules first character gets removed by delta Using delta It would be awesome if the file name function chunk header that delta displays before each file function chunk would be fixed pinned to the top of the screen and just the file content would scroll When scrolling into the next file its file name header would scroll up until it takes the place of the previous files header at which point it would be fixed pinned to the top of the screen and so on That way it would always be obvious which file and inside that file which function I am looking at I think it could simplify larger reviews quite a bit There is a sisterfeaturerequest for bat sharkdpbat and nushell nushellnushell Maybe you can find a solution for this together with the bat and the nushell devs If files are renamed and modified delta will output the renaming twice For instance given the following git diff output diff git aoners btwors similarity index rename from oners rename to twors index fc ba f c aoners btwors Examples These are changes one two then renamed oners twors will show up twice This PR assess that by resetting the file names on each FileMeta state entry
