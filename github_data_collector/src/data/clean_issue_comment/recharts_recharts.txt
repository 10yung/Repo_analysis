happening It shows the correct value of the first stacked bar but it shows the sum of the first value and the value of the second stack in the second one The same with the third one it shows the sum

repository and believe that this is not a duplicate What problem does this feature solve Is there a way to distribute the xAxis labels evenly and also have a fixed label at first and last position What does the proposed API look like This query is to find out whether there is an already existing way to evenly space out the xAxis labels as well as have omnipresent labels at first and last index Going by the docs I dont see any option to achieve them together without manually writing custom label formatter block But still worth checking if it can be done without having to put that manual effort because if I try writing a custom block I will probably have to take care of a lot of things in responsive modes Rather I would prefer the xAxis element API to give me another options like spaceeven along with the existing option ie intervalpreserveStartEnd generated by recchartsissuehelper DO NOT REMOVE Putting any children for example a LabelList inside a Line component or even just Line divdiv Line throws the error reactdomdevelopmentjs bb Warning Functions are not valid as a React child This may happen if you return a Component instead of Component from render Or maybe you meant to call this function rather than return it Ive been looking through the code and found a few things out If I dig around in the library code in nodemodulesrechartses and remove adaptEventHandlersthisprops from line inside the render method of shapeCurve this error goes away If I look inside renderByOrder in utilsReactUtils I cant see any special handling of children of elements to be rendered and similarly chartgenerateCategoricalChart seems to have a map of types it can render as children but seems to have no specification for any children The API specifically states this is how for example to do LabelLists and I see no other way of doing this Im not a typescript expert and this codebase is rather complex so Im not sure Ive hit upon exactly the right cause but I hope this gives enough info for you to reproduce This is a small gist of the sort of thing I was working on Just as an fyi putting the children into the Line does work I can put a LabelList inside it and it renders its just that I get this very annoying react error on the console that clogs it up and clogs up tests too If you need any more info please do let me know x I have searched the

The synchronized chart position should be based on the value of the Xaxis not the data item index What is actually happening The synchronized chart position is based on the data item index Environment
