Hello is there a variable that outputs the build date I wish to use it in the footer last updated info Thank you During the creation of several documents in asciidoc Im pretty sure this might also happen in markdown Ive been forced to create field templates for the body of some pages essentially adding html content I want to particular parts of the body This tends to end in a set of templates that should be used to create the content usin a models field This seems common practice in asciidoc and markdown It would be great if it were possible to configure field templates and have that field popup prefilled with its template content Could you please comment your thoughts on this It would be great to get idsanchors to headers for deeplinking More specifically assume youve got a markdown content like this in contentexamplecontentslr body Example page sub paragraph some details additional sub paragraph some details Then it would be great to generate html like this h idexamplepageExample pageh h idsubparagraph sub paragraph h h idsomedetailssome detailsh h idadditionalsubparagraphadditional sub paragraphh h idsomedetials some detailsh This allows very easily allows doing deeplinks to every header for example Some markdown engines like githubs readme renderer do this automatically eg Issues Resolved Fixes Description of Changes x Wrote at least oneline docstrings for any new functions x Added unit tests covering the changes if testable Included a screenshot or animation if affecting the UI see Licecap Link to corresponding documentation pull request for getlektorcom Actual relative URLs that omit unnecessary folder traversing Example articles brownies link to articles browniesimagegallery Previous output articles browniesimagegallery Ouput with this PR imagegallery Note Resources in the same directory are linked without in front With the only exception if the link target is the same blog link to blog will result in link to blogajpg will result in ajpg Tiny URLs for all Can we have relative URLs that do not always go to the lowest folder and then back up again For example if I browse the following page articles brownies which has a subpage I would like to link to articles browniesimagegallery The resulting relative url will be articles browniesimagegallery instead of just imagegallery Also linking to any other resource may be shorter eg same folder chocolatecake Hi how can I specify files that always have to be rebuild I generate a manifestappcache very similar to the Sitemap Guide However in order for the cache to properly update I need to regenerate the file so that now is evaluated again Currently this will be triggered once I change that file or anything that changes the site structure But not if I change my stylecss for example CACHE MANIFEST Date build nowYmd HMS set xx for asset in sitegetpadassetrootchildren if asset this recursive if assetclassname Directory xxappendasset or pass endif loopassetchildren endfor xxappendsiteget or pass for page in sitequery thisalt if page this recursive xxappendpage or pass set img pageattachmentsimagessortattributerecordlabelfirst if img xxappendimgthumbnail crop or pass endif looppagechildren endfor for item in xx itemurlreplace endfor NETWORK Hi there given the following model fieldsname label Name type string fieldsdate label Added type date fieldstime label Duration type integer addonlabel min And using alternates de and en Id like to keep the following file structure contentslr date time contentsdelr name Die Antwort contentsdelr name The answer In short Id like to have fields that should be translatable and others that are not Eg properties that are valid regardless of alternates However every time I edit the English or German alternate in the editor all field will be stored into that file Not only does this create duplicate entries of the same data but editing those fields later on is a pain too Eg once I change something in the overlay or alternate I will not be able to change back to the Primary content Even if I delete that field it is not deleted but rather set to an empty string instead This is an additional bug or feature request to be able to reset field to a nonset value instead of an empty value This can only be fixed via manual content file editing which defies the purpose of the CMS editor I have a page composed of flow blocks and one of these blocks is an image block where the user can pick one of the attached image files The model looks like this ini block name Image buttonlabel IMG fieldsimage label Image type select source recordattachmentsimagesorderbyname width This works but for the user it is a bit uncomfortable since the list shows only the file names often timestamps sequential numbers etc Is there some way I could modify the admin interface to also show a preview of the image next to the file name Maybe injecting a small JavaScript like into the admin interface HTML Issues Resolved Fixes Related Issues Links Description of Changes x added delete argline option x added exclude argline options x added tests for delete x added tests for exclude The buildpublish step as performed from the GUI dialog can be a long running task For my site this can take minutes if a full rebuild is required This obviously shouldnt be a sync API call as forcing the user to have a browser page open for minutes while a HTTP request completes is insane Even for smaller sites it makes much more sense to have this as an async call to say buildpublishstart which starts a background task and then another buildpublishstatus which reports the status of the buildpublish I also think as shown in the example above that there should be a single API endpoint for this rather than the two as it is at the moment This would allow someone to click publish and then shutdown their machine and go and have coffee whilst the background task builds the site and publishes it Im not overly sure what the best way of achieving this is Ive created a simple version of it working in my fork of lektor if you want to have a look at that but Id be interested in comments on what we thing the best way of doing this is With the current admin API being a single event bus and not supporting multiple sessions we dont need anything fancy like rediscelery I think In my early version it doesnt report the current status too which is a shame I couldnt figure out how to do that with click Thoughts nixjdm runfalk
