Add an option to confirm reblogs Initially I wanted to put it much further the pipeline but to get animations work right I had to work around SparkButton a little bit The advantage is that its implemented in just one place now It tries to mimick Masto UI but not very closely I tried to fix it but not like proposed in because it would require additional layouts so I tried to just fit the Image The only problem is notifications screen where we have this damn bar We need to offset top correctly and we need to fix the bar height for that but idk how it would work with text scaling Screenshot related Sometimes I use this app with my bluetooth keyboard When I toot by CtrlEnter tusky sends the same two activities and these have different IDs On the toot linked in that pull request it also posted twice apparently When I post via web browser the number of the toots is one Tusky Version Android Version Android Device Sony Xperia XZ Mastodon instance if applicable x I searched or browsed the repo s other issues to ensure this is not a duplicate Steps to reproduce Enable Dont keep activities in the developer settings and bring the main activity in the background and foreground again or recreate it in an other way Jumping to the top by clicking the selected tab will no longer work When the device is offline and the user clicks on a profile the Mute option in the options menu is a bit broken Mute s and Are you sure you want to block all of null details summaryScreenshotssummary Screenshot Screenshot details Tusky Version Android Version Android Device Fairphone x I searched or browsed the repo s other issues to ensure this is not a duplicate Its related to I believe None Easy to reproduce start composing a toot upload an image delete it and then compose it again After that hide media button will overlap the CW button as show below Not critical since you can just press that mixed button and it will fix itself but still a bug Tusky Version a Nightly Android Version Android Device Oneplus x I searched or browsed the repo s other issues to ensure this is not a duplicate None Because on the profile screen there is the tabs bar in landscape the button is flattened and almost unreadable at least with my screen size Screenshot Tusky To reproduce just put your telephone in landscape disable networkenable airplane mode and try to open your profile or somebody else s and scroll to the bottom I think the error message should make a better use of the available horizontal space mockup Screenshot Tuskymockup Tusky Version ff a Android Version Android Device One Plus x I searched or browsed the repo s other issues to ensure this is not a duplicate This is a teaser for my proposal to not use XMLs for settings but use Kotlins expressiveness to add a tiny DSL My main motivation is that we use damn strings around the project to getupdate preference I think later we should add a higherlevel welltyped prefs abstraction but this is kinda different story and it would still have duplication with XML if we left it Another benefit is that we dont need to do clumsy find the pref and update it dance If you are wondering if there is a project which does that already than yes there is one but it replaces androidxpreference completely Its a much bigger library with kinda different purpose and the DSL is like lines or so Let me know what you think about it cc Tak
