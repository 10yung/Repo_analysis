 Read the configuration from the file for CLI Example swimat c swimatjson swimat config configswimatjson by default the tool will use swimatjson if exist config example json areParametersAligned true areSemicolonsRemoved true Motivation CLI tool cant read UserDefault settings that were set up via App Sometimes need settings per project with ignoring local settings for automation through the build phase Can you indent switch cases like the xcode when you select it in Text editing preferences On alternative can be a option in Swimat settings I tried editing your code with some success and a little bug with the break keyword after the break it will add another indent to the next case var checkInCase false if indentinSwitch if isNextword case checkInCase true indentcount indentinCase true else if isNextword default isNextword unknown isNextword break indentextra Another suggestion its the break be at the same level as the case but this is just a opinion Same issue here on macOS Xcode

was hoping to have my code remain consistent and correct my braces if Ive forgotten and put them on the next line which I have a habit of doing in other languages Im disappointed that Swimat doesnt correctly move braces on the previous line Is this something that could be considered Using Swimat Version with XCode The following is a Swimat output when not using a trailing closure swift ObservablecombineLatestselfstepName selfstepDuration resultSelector name duration Bool in return namecount duration bindto selfisAddStepAllowed disposedby selfdisposeBag Swimat correctly indents it and keeps indentation consistent which is great However if you were to replace resultSelector with a trailing closure Id expect an output to look similar to this swift ObservablecombineLatestselfstepName selfstepDuration name duration Bool in return namecount duration bindto selfisAddStepAllowed disposedby selfdisposeBag But what actually happens is Swimat formatting it to this swift ObservablecombineLatestselfstepName selfstepDuration name duration Bool in return namecount duration notice how this block is less indented bindto selfisAddStepAllowed disposedby selfdisposeBag Can we save the position of text cursor when we formatting code Feature request Make it possible to define a maximum line length and automatically wrap lines which are too long or combine short enough lines similar to what clangformat does for objectivec and c code Swift has a new library for parsing source code called libSyntax I think we should use it for source code parsing since it should be much more durable to style variations How can make Swimat to remove blank lines from my code Hey it there any way to make format on save If yes it would be good to put this info to readme as there are more people like me who searching for this feature Anyway good pice of soft
