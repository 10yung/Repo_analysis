 I get this caught ERROR READ error during COMPILEFILE Package QLOTUTIL does not exist Line Column FilePosition Stream SBINTFORMTRACKINGSTREAM for file homequicklispquicklispcontrollerdistbuildcacheclnotebookddee b e ce b c abe cc fclnotebook gitsrcmodellisp E AA Full log is here Maybe this is due to a recent change in but I dont see immediately what it might be Sometimes I want to do a searchreplace presumably on a word across all the cells in a notebook not just the current one Figure out a way to do this smoothly in the frontend When we change a cell mode it stops registering the transposecell binding possibly all global bindings This might be a bug in the transition code or it might be something wrong with transpose itself Currently parenscript cells with unmatched parens end up getting evaluated as object rather than being flagged with an error This causes problems when the programmer assumes a cell evaluated properly Check for balanced parens before doing the thing It should be possible to do an export action from a history state and not just the current state of a notebook Default celltype needs to be settable per notebook most of the time commonlispcode makes sense but Ive worked on a number of notebooks already where commonlispparenscript would have been simpler and caused fewer errors Now that we have the idea of focused cells we really should just unify focusCell and showEditor so that they both do their thing on focused cells The binary is pretty out of date at this point But introducing qlot seems to have broken the buildapp binary building process We should either fix it or use this as an excuse to get ceramic or something else running to generate appropriate binaries For instance macroexpansion as Ctrle really only makes sense in Common Lisp code cells parenscript cells at the very least need different behavior for the same binding if not its removal entirely Once we add markdown and javascript language cells theres no point in having that binding associated in the relevant editors
