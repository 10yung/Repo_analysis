Hey Im using this like so describe routetablemyroutetable do it should exist it should haveroute targetnat mynat end This works on the first run however if I run my tests again it fails because there are two matching NAT gateways one deleted and one available If I wait mins until AWS purges the deleted NAT from the results my tests pass again How can I work around this so that it only matches a NAT if it hasnt been deleted I could lookup the nat ID and use it but Id rather avoid that extra step if possible Thanks Darryl This tries to reduce the gem dependencies to only what is being used Replaced ssm parameters describe API call with getparameter call to fix pagination issue Fixed specs and changed a bit behavior of the spec for ssm It has a few values less now because of the differences in APIs However it also has value now So we can test against it if it is not encrypted Similar to below case describe lambdamylambdafunctionname do it should exist end I would like to know if it supports a test case say describe layermylambdalayername do Make the eip entry in the type reference table functional by changing the anchor to eip When using the ecsservice resource described here when the cluster is not default it will fail eg describe ecsservicemyecsservice do it should exist end fails with AwsECSErrorsClusterNotFoundException Cluster not found Where the cluster is not default you need to pass the cluster name eg for cluster named nondefault describe ecsservicemyecsservice cluster notdefault do it should exist end Could the docs in the link be updated accordingly At the moment there is no spec support for AWS Transit Gateway so those cannot be verified It would be nice if support was added for it AWS Reference doc Based on the output of aws s api getbucketlifecycleconfiguration it looks to me like this documentation needs to be updated to match that output object Rules Status Enabled NoncurrentVersionExpiration NoncurrentDays Filter Prefix data Expiration Days AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload DaysAfterInitiation ID ExpireData Days At the moment there is no spec support for Route Resolver so those cannot be verified It would be nice if support was added for it AWS Reference doc I am trying to write a spec for DynamoDB table with multiple global secondary indexes Im unable to get the value of any index except the first and last one using the first and last methods describe dynamodbtableGroupResource do it should exist its globalsecondaryindexesfirstindexname should eq ResourceIDindex end How can I fetch the second and third values of the array globalsecondaryindexes Ive tried using globalsecondaryindexesfetch globalsecondaryindexes but both give errors
