The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

Security Alerts page details Ive resolved one syntactic error and made change in readmd React will print these warnings when you use unstated inside strict mode Screenshot from Removing the createReactContext polyfill seems to fix the issue Summary Rewritten in typescript to better to support typescript scenarios Add unstated HOC Use official react context API require react Change version to alpha Hi jamiebuilds Great work it is a lot of fun to use your library I just published a HOC for Unstated This is something that we wanted to opensource for a while and now its finally made public We enjoy using UnstatedProps in our apps It gives access to your Unstated containers from the component props Here is the related tweet What do you think of adding a mention to the docs Submitting this PR with the related adjustment p aligncenter img width src altunstatedprops usage demo p add Chinese Readme document Unstated is small and nice Adding a Chinese document will make more frontend engineers use it I struggled to find out that Objectassign is used in unstated Chrome debugger for Android gives little information about what happened so I think maybe this better be added in readme This fixes the same issue that was addressed by PR Update Flow But this version of the fix does not require upgrading any dependencies besides flowbin I am submitting a new PR because seems not to have been finished for less than containers Requires TypeScript or later Update flow and flow types to address latest flow changes described here I had to also update prettier otherwise prettier formatting was making code invalid
