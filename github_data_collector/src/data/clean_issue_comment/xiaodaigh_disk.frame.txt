 The following code fails r librarydplyr librarydiskframe setupdiskframe aggregateexpressions listn quoten iris asdiskframe groupbySpecies summariseaggregateexpressions It throws the error There must be at least one summarization function in aggregateexpressions Could you enable diskframe to recognize that the unquoted list aggregateexpressions does in fact contain at least one summarization function Thanks r librarydiskframe a dataframeid sample replaceTRUE values runif adf asdiskframea nchunks adfsharded adf mutaterandchunk sample n replaceTRUE create a new column to sharding into subshards shardshardby cid randchunk adfwithbloomfilter adfsharded makebloomfilterid adfwithbloomfilter bflikelyinchunksid adfwithbloomfilter usebloomfilterid collect a dataframeid sampleletters replaceTRUE values runif adf asdiskframea nchunks adfsharded adf mutaterandchunk sample n replaceTRUE create a new column to sharding into subshards shardshardby cid randchunk shardshardby cid df adfsharded makebloomfilterid df bflikelyinchunksid a df usebloomfilterid a collect x Assess xor filters Notes The paper is quite confusing It takes much longer to create a filter Write tutorial on bloomfilter Proper indexing Both issues seem related to this enhancement I have a similar problem it that it would be nice to be able to effectively have index columns that can spread across multimple chunks I my case I have some large datasets where subshards would be useful as my groups are too big to practicaly fit in a single chunk I also have coordinates that it would to be nice to be able to perform a quick check of which chunks the values im trying to look up are in as well as exploiting fsts random access feature to just read out sections of interest based on their indices Originally posted by RichardJActon in If cant be higher list down the reasons to track Consider donating some funds to SFC
