 Why The doesnt work with the new SassC version Rails Resolve Resolve What happened Using the Tilt scss as the scsstemplate Insight Currently the new sasscrails version doesnt rely on Tilt anymore it relies on SprocketsSassProcessor its another dependency so our gem doesnt work anymore On the previous sassrails version the SassTemplate is inherited from the TiltTemplate Proof Of Work Before img

version Rails I have noticed that livingstyleguide is updated to Once I have build the application without the livingstyleguide gem all seems fine And I when I have updated my Gemfile to install version again all seems fine Looks like a issue with using Hey there wave made the change from sass to sassc however it also adds an implicit dependency to sasscrails here If you update from to and dont have sasscrails installed your app will break with NameError uninitialized constant SassCRails Since sasscrails doesnt work out of the box for one of the apps Im working on Ill downgrade LSG to for now until I have time to investigate further Have a great day all around Writing CSS with css scss in a htmllsg file using crlf line endings results in plain text being rendered to the html and importing a lsg partial that uses that notation results in SprocketsFileNotFound couldnt find file appassetsstylesheetsstyleguide This is only really an issue for Windows users and we have Microsoft to thank for that Replacing all newlines n in COMMANDSREGEXP with r n seems to fix it but theres probably a better solution Hello first of all I really enjoy this style guide generator very well thought out and easy to work I am running into an issue where my style guide is getting rendered twice directly on top of each other Ive posted what I think is the most relevant bits of code any ideas as to why this would be happening would be very helpful Please note that im using for the triple backtick in my files styleguidehtmllsg sass applicationsass title Style Guide import lsg buttonlsg

Rails code that I am trying to emulate is render shareduserboxhorizontal user Userallfirst free true I attempted to implement this in living style guide by doing use viewsshareduserboxhorizontalhtmlerb user Userallfirst free true But this no matter what directory or what view I try to point that to I always get a No such file or directory error This occurs even if I remove the variables at the end since Im pretty sure I have to refactor that syntax somewhat The next version of sprockets v currently in beta has removed their dependency on Tilt which is how livingstyleguide integrates in Sprockets x will support both the new API and Tilt to make the transition easy x will drop the Tilt interface and make source map support possible LivingStyleGuideDocument inherits from Tilt ruby require tilt require erb require digest require pathname class LivingStyleGuideDocument TiltTemplate Does anyone have any insight into how we can support sprockets v Here is documentation on the processor interface that Ive started to read Im trying to use livingstyleguide in a Middleman project installed as described in the But as soon as I
