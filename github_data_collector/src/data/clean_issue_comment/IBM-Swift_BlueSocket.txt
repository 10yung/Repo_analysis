socket server and local socket client So i have created server which has signature OptionalSignature family inet type stream protocol tcp address OptionalSocketSocketAddressipv Csockaddrin sin len sin family sin port sin flowinfo sin addr Cin addru addr Cin addrUnnamedunionu addr sin scopeid hostname Optional port path nil bound true secure false it start listening on port After some time it received client connection and it accept the connection client signature is Signature family inet type stream protocol tcp address OptionalSocketSocketAddressipv Csockaddrin sin len sin family sin port sin flowinfo sin addr Cin addru addr Cin addrUnnamedunionu addr sin scopeid hostname Optional port path nil bound false secure false Now when i start reading the datastring i received nothing we have implemented the same architecture on android which is working fine My reading code is func addNewConnectionsocket Socket selfconnectedSockets socketsocketfd socket try socketsetReadTimeoutvalue try socketsetWriteTimeoutvalue let queue DispatchQueueglobalqos default DispatchQueuemainasyncAfterdeadline DispatchTimenow execute printsending message do let reply Server from response let written try socketwritefrom reply printsent to client is written catch let error printerror in replying for connection error and errorlocalizedDescription func readNewData printreading once again var readData

decoding response return break printdata string read in socket are response catch let error printerror reading data in socket error and errorlocalizedDescription timereventHandler readNewData timerresume am i doing anything wrong here or my implementation itself is wrong please help First of all Thanks for writing a library that works with an FTP server and is easy to use I created a new app in Xcode with Swift and the latest version of BlueSocket installed via CocoaPod to test it and Ive come across a problem I can open a normal and a data socket to the FTP server and log in using cmdsocketwritefrom USER username r n just fine you can find a list of ftp codes here but try cmdSocketwritefrom LIST r n let answer try dataSocketreadStringtrue print answer which should list the files and folders at the root only prints the very first one Its working with a different server eg speedtesttele net is free to use for testing so it looks like my server is too slow andor the library is too fast and possibly not waiting until the server is done Is there a way to set some kind of timeout for that eg if you dont get a result for the third time stop reading instead of stopping after the first try I want to connect to stunnel server on windows by using this BlueSSLService client But I get an error when I create Socket with SSLService Delegate and connect to stunnel This is my function for creating client tls socket func createStealthSocket Socket var myConfig SSLServiceConfigurationwithChainFilePath selfcert withPassword wjfeoqlalf usingSelfSignedCerts true clientAllowsSelfSignedCertificates true myConfigcipherSuite ALL do let socket try Socketcreatefamily inet socketdelegate try SSLServiceusingConfiguration myConfig try socketconnectto selftunnelHost port Int selftunnelPort return socket catch let error guard error is SocketError else printUnexpected error return nil return nil When i run this function i get a normal return value without error But if i capture a network packet with wireshark i get an encrypted alert Below is the log taken from wireshark err I tried TCP using simulator and try sending string to my NIO server but in my server it wont go inside my function channelRead It would be very convenient to have the BlueSocket EchoServer from the README Complete Example available as a separate repository I m aware that maintaining a separate repository can be a bit of a pain but in the end this would make getting started with BlueSocket a great deal easier The example uses unowned self in an asynchronous queue This is a bad idea for reasons outlined here When does deinit get called Im using BlueSocket on a Mac running as a server and on a iPhone as a client The server runs some apple scripts when the client sends some keywords I noticed that I get memory leaks every time scripts are being executed I noticed that deinit is never called Any advice is much appreciated I cant find the way to bind to a specific interfaceIP using the UDP socket I tried with something similar to try socketlistenon selfport maxBacklogSize SocketSOCKETDEFAULTMAXBACKLOG allowPortReuse false node my IP address let bytes address try socketreadDatagraminto data But that way I dont receive any data What am I doing wrong
