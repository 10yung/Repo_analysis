 Operating system and version macOS Catalina nvm debug output as no nvm command becomes available its hard to answer this one nvm ls output as no nvm command becomes available its hard to answer this one How did you install nvm install script in readme What steps did you perform just executed the script in the readme What happened it couldnt find any file to put nvm environment variables because no zshrc file was there after a clean Catalina installation What did you expect to happen I was expecting nvm to check as last resort for if SHELL binzsh then and eventually create by itself the HOMEzshrc file with those entries Is there anything in any of your profile files that modifies the PATH Nope When NVMDIR is a link nvm mistakenly returns the error nvm is not compatible with the npm config prefix option currently set to datajenkinsmiscnvmversionsnodev Run npm config delete prefix or nvm use deleteprefix v to unset it With this fix nvm will check correctly that the prefix is inside the NVMDIR Operating system and version Ubuntu How did you install nvm install script in readme curl What steps did you perform Install Update Script What happened curl Failed to connect to rawgithubusercontentcom port Connection refused Currently the nvmsh script does not handle directories that are symbolic links This is a common problem on servers that use symbolic links to persistent drives For example an admin might want to install nvm into optlocalnode but the real location without the symlinks is files optlocalnodenvm This results in export NVMDIRoptlocalnodenvm NVMDIRnvmsh nvm is not compatible with the npm config prefix option currently set to files optlocalnodenvmversionsnodev Run npm config delete prefix or nvm use deleteprefix v silent to unset it Assuming the admin knows this issue and uses the real directory there is no problem export NVMDIRfiles optlocalnodenvm NVMDIRnvmsh The small change I am providing will get the real directory to avoid the problem with symbolic links I dont know if cd P is available on all Linux systems but I have tested in MacOS RedHat AWS AMI and Debian Thank you for being interested in nvm Please help us by filling out the

npms command aliases I would like a way to use the same kinds of shortened syntax with nvm For example npm i npm install npm rm npm uninstall etc It seems odd to me that nvm doesnt consistently use long or shortform verbs for commands in the documentation For example nvm ls instead of nvm list nvm uninstall instead of nvm rm nvm rm doesnt even work How can I get better command consistency with nvm Id be happy to consider working on PR for this but I dont know where to start This line results in the following output NA version NA NA is not yet installed You need to run nvm install NA to install it before using it A more helpful message would be something like No version parameter set Set it by alpine tmp nvm install Downloading and installing node v Downloading wget unrecognized
