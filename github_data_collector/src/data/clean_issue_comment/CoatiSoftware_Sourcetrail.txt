I was wondering if there is a different output other than the graph Im want to take the graph analysis and see it as an XML Json is it possible Sourcetrail should parse a provided XSD file and visualize the definitions and dependencies found ubuntu NVIDIASMI Driver Version CUDA Version Sourcetrail Linux bittargz dhzg uagfvoptsourcetrail Sourcetrail Sourcetrail symbol lookup error optsourcetrailliblibGLso undefined symbol glapitlsCurrent how to fix it thanks a lot Overview graph performance improvement Method PersistenceStoragegetGraphForAll calls sqlliteIndexStorage two times During gathering of node IDs When adding nodes to graph within PersistenceStorageaddNodesToGraph Unfortunately during each of these calls all nodes are retrieved from database I rewritten this function Merging logic from getGraphForAll and addNodesToGraph we can avoid second sql enumeration This operation gave me possibility to introduce additional optimizations eg deletion of redundant checks and avoiding mfileNodeIndexed enumeration Improvement in cycles is aprox Perf after load project on debug build database linux before improvement Screenshot After improvement Screenshot There is a possible removal of redundancy with if msymbolDefinitionKindssize and a little bit performance to gain with answer to question Is there a way that this condition is evaluated as false It seems that during the compile and Installation Sourcetrail needs to read Qt DIR variable from environment However this point is not cleared in guide linuxpackagecmake its relate to this issue Hello Actually trying to use the info stored in the sqlite database I can see that several pieces are missing Definition kind names Source location type names Node type name Edge type name Component access type name All that information are hardcoded in the C source files would be nice if we could have that info in the database Also several queries that are hardcoded in the C files could be stored in the database as views to allow working directly with the database easier Cheers Maven settings is pointing to the correct file Maven is working properly Java installed on the machine is OpenJDK Runtime Environment build postUbuntu ubuntu tried several different projects and the result is always the same indexed files when choosing maven project On the other hand creating the project as an empty java project partially works obviously with many errors as it does not find dependencies Any hint Thanks in advance Simple patch for issue Works fine for me when i open projects Saves some time Support for javascript and Typescript is necessary
