I have this code can you explain why this doesnt show any result var c documentgetElementByIdc var ctx cgetContext d Create gradient var grd ctxcreateLinearGradient grdaddColorStop red grdaddColorStop white Fill with gradient ctxfillStyle grd ctxfillRect webassembly let wam loadWASM thenmodule wam module catcherr consolelogError in fetching module err then windowonload var pixels ctxgetImageData consolelogpixels var xx pixelsdatasetwamgoodMorningpixelsdata var xx wamgoodMorningpixelsdata consolelogxx pixelsdatasetxx See Let me know if interesting Im glad to help but my knowledge of javascript is limited The repo is great but there some code inside I dont understand There is a global variable Module However the glue code is like a black box how do i know what wasm exposed Yes I could get some exposed fn using WebAssemblyModuleexportsimports but in this glue code I should need to do this by Moduleccall so how can get information from glue code like wam grayScale function pixelData const len pixelDatalength const mem malloclen get the memory of wasm HEAPU setpixelData mem transfer the pixelData grayScalemem len trigger the grayScale fun const filtered HEAPU subarraymem mem len get the resulted data freemem release memory return filtered return buffer where could I find some explanation of the above code like HEAPU or free I feel a little confused I have seen a nice video which was talking about performance of webassembly but running your example the javascript is playing with similar speed but on the graph it has been shown that the wasm is is faster than javascript my green line is showing and my blue line is showing Would be great to add some simple examples to the repo Feel free to close if this is not something youre interested in compileWASMsh permission fixed
