Hi Im having the following working python code snippet in an an application things works fine however I wanted to convert into Ruby using rbNaCL and am having an issue sk naclsigningSigningKeygenerateencodenaclencodingBase Encoder pk skverifykeytocurve publickeyencodeencodernaclencodingBase Encoder send pk to user BOB where they encrypt data with pk and BoB private key then Alice recieves encrypted message with nonce and a public key that is base encoded LDuRaopE MSgoJpswcSlXZsqqxaqv LeDTgc QbWQoQ then Alice decrypts using the following working code userPubk naclsigningVerifyKeyLDuRaopE MSgoJpswcSlXZsqqxaqv LeDTgc QbWQoQ encodernaclencodingBase Encoder box Box sktocurve privatekey userPubktocurve publickey decrypted boxdecryptciphertext nonce I want to achieve same thing with Ruby I successfully did it in golang However I can not seem to be able to convert a key to curve publickey Heres a code snippet from the decryption phase privateKey RbNaClPrivateKeygenerate decryption phase userPublicKey Base strictdecode LDuRaopE MSgoJpswcSlXZsqqxaqv LeDTgc QbWQoQ pk RbNaClPublicKeynewuserPublicKey userPublicKeyObj RbNaClVerifyKeynewpk decrypted JSONloadRbNaClBoxnewpk privateKeydecryptnonce cipherText my Issue is I can not seem to convert the public key into curve so the decrypt method fails is there any way to achieve this ie converting a RbNaClSignaturesEd VerifyKey c b a Object into RbNaClBoxesCurve XSalsa Poly PublicKey c b a
