Hello I am finding that the credentials database is overwritten with the default global values whenever reload the R studio console deleting my updates to any users Is this a common problem and a solution Many Thanks Kirsten Excellent package thank you Within my Shiny app Im using the googleAuthR package to authenticate to Google for API pulls When I wrap the app with shinymanager I am brought back to the shinymanager login page after authenticating with Google Then the Google auth does not transfer back into the session Any help here would be appreciated Great package I would just like to recommend one more option admin page export table This can be handy if I want ot deploy a new version of shiny app on shinyappio If I dont export table I will lose all users Additionally it would be probably better to save data on separate MySQL database so that user info is separated from app container Logout button UI is automatically generated when using secureapp However when using authui it seems like we need to add logout UI manually Though we can create logout UI using fabbutton it seems like the loggingout logic is not automatically added and we need to write our own server code for logging out observeEventsessioninputlogout sessionreload Is there a builtin or better way to to log out when using authui Thanks Custom logout exampleadapted from example in authui r libraryshiny libraryshinymanager dataframe with credentials info credentials dataframe user cfanny victor password cazerty stringsAsFactors FALSE app ui fluidPage authentication module authuiid auth fabbutton actionButton inputId logout label NULL tooltip Logout icon iconsignout server functioninput output session authentication module auth callModule module authserver id auth checkcredentials checkcredentialscredentials outputresauth renderPrint reactiveValuesToListauth observeEventsessioninputlogout sessionreload shinyAppui server First thanks for this fantastic package its almost magical I have a small documentationrelated suggestion The README on the front page demonstrates creating an encrypted sqlite credential store but it stops short of demonstrating how shinymanager expects the app developer to incorporate the encrypted database into the app I think Ive pieced it together from the help documentation in dbcrypted but that documentation also doesnt feature a full app It would be great for the documentation to recommend an easy path and demo the full use case Great package Do you have plans to add user signup capability as well Would be great if users could sign up and are allowed to sign in once they verify their email or an admin flags them as approved
