Some eventlogs and data pulled the PID and PPID are shown either in binary or hex both version should be included in objects for flexibility This script pulls the list of domains queried from the Windows Event Log DNS Client By default the list is then compared to the top domains This is my first time submitting a PowerShell script I apologize for the terrible code The top domains are included as a compressed string I chose this because its easy to transport in the code but I can provide as a separate file if that would be better Also currently the code doesnt take into account country codes eg googlecouk would be a false positive Gets a files encoding type
