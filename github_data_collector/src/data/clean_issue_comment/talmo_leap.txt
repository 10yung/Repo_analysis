Dear all we are using LEAP to track single points in videos of moving animals and have encountered the issue of large jumps of tracked coordinates using the LEAP standard setup in nearby time frames easily spotted by eye The trajectory see attachment for an example large jumps occur in the left part of the picture was obtained from a different training video Are there any experiences with such a problem We thought about retraining the network for every video or simply training longer Thanks a lot for your help Best Wilhelm largejumps i tried to convert my own video to hdf but i think its not the same structure as the boxh the boxh has keys box ell and framesIdx box is the frame framesIdx is the number of frame but i wonder what the ell is By the way must i use the hdf can i just use the videosif i must use hdf how to convert my videos to the hdf which is similar as your hdf file Hi Talmo We are having trouble initializing the training See error below I h readframestysonh box Found

ModuleNotFoundError No module named keras The python path has been set to python which is what we though was the most likely culprit but it does not seem to fix it We are analyzing the Tyson demo video just finished labeling and onto training Thanks Hi Talmo Recently my lab is using DLC to obtain trajectory data of mice in the cage in order to investigate the interaction between pregnant mice and pups All the data are stored in the csv form so can be imported by matlab I am just wondering if there is anyway that I can input the data I already got to LEAP module to achieve unsupervised classified behavioural classification do you have any advice Many thanks Mingran Hello I need help in using LEAP for COWS After converting the video to the hdf file I need to visualize the image as RGB but I cow am visualizing in yellow color Hi Talmo Ive recently started to encounter a new problem with LEAP When I run labeljoints and do fast training the outcome is the following python C Users
