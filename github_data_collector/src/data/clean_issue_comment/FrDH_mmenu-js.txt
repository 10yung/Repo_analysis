I just inherited this site to maintain wwwapoconz and the menu works fine except on iOS iPhones where opening the menu causes the tab to crash This behavior is the same on safari and chrome on the iPhone I think it might be to do with the amount of CSS Transforms but havent been able to resolve it by modifying the style sheets Any help would be appreciated Im currently using the mmenu WP plugin in a Bootstrap site where the navbar has the class stickytop and Im also adding a transition all s easeout for some animation fx when scrolling But the navbar gets really jumpy on menu openclose with this CSS transition on it Removing this fixes it but I rather keep the smooth CSS transition Any tips Thanks PS Let me know if youd like to see an example the site is currently in dev so no public URL I had some challenges integrating mmenu which I wanted at all costs and angular translation using the pascalprecht module The iconbar is created dynamically any angular translation or variables directives are not compiled by angular for example a href SitemapphplngLANG i class fas fasitemap ia The submenu title bar shows the translation directive and not the translated content for example MENUITEM where the main menu will be translated as expected I solved point eventually with a workaround ammnavbartitlespaneachfunction var text this text this html text translate and both points are solved by inserting a compile statement after menu creation var elem angularelementnavmmmenu var injector eleminjector scope elemscope scopeapplyfunction injectorinvoke compilefunctioncompile compileelemscope Issue the only way to work around is the compile after menu creation Issue is another point and has to do with the content of the DOM element in this case MENUITEM translate being copied to the span at creation time which removes the angular notation with brackets resulting in MENUITEM But maybe someone has a better solution to this Fred I see and use bind to call a function on close var api mymenudata mmenu apibind closefinish function consolelog Finished closing panel yet i can not seem to get it to unbind or be replaced looked everywhere and could not find a solution please advice thanks bill a Hi I am immensely grateful for your work Im from Russia Im sorry for the mistakes The requests of seospecialists are senseless and merciless The essence of the problem They want the parent section to have a link in the source code but there is no transition on it as if there was a span That is by clicking go to the subsection eg menuul All in order to open a section in a new tab when rightclicking And hover I found an example Im use jquery My code I tried to repeat the example but the openPanel function throws an error How to fix it If this problem is would resolved Im going to simulate a click on the arrow when I click on the link What do you think Thanks for the help With mmenu open AND the list of menu items is long enough for the menu to scroll if you touch on a menu item for example dead center horizontally hold and drag to the left the main body content of the web page will slide over with your drag the overlay stays in place Tested on iOS Safari and Chrome This does not happen if the list of menu items is not long enough to scroll This happens on the main mmenu home page as well as in our website using v Hello Maybe there is already solution I searched in issues currentfinished but no luck Is there way on nd lvl or submenu opened on right to be added button which will bring menu on start point without closing see pic below Thanks in advance Plugin ROCKs I have a page with mmenu on the left a topbar and a cssgrid beneath that The topbar is set to width When minimizing mmenu the topbar does not reflow properly When the page loads the right end of the bar is rendered off the viewport with exactly the width of mmenu Chromium renders the bar correct on load but after closing and opening mmenu it isnt stretched across anymore but is short by exactly the width of mmenu This means that when mmenu is minimized not all elements on the page reflow properly Here screenshots of the Chromium problem On load bugmmenureflow After minimizing mmenu bugmmenureflow And the same for Firefox On load I pasted the horizontal scrollbar in to show the overflow bugmmenureflow After minimizing mmenu note also the missing icon on the right bugmmenureflow What can be the issue I have three level menu with first two level sliding but the thrid level is a vertical submenu and opens under the level but In Mmenu when I try to expand the level submenu it slides from right to left Please provide a fix Adding dynamic content to angular project will not reinit panels Tried initPanel and initPanels both Will you please provide any link to do so
