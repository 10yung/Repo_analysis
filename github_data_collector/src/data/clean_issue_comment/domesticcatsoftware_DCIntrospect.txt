Works on Xcode x Due to alleged errors with the valueForKey method such as Too many arguments to function call expected have around this line XCode refuses to compile this under iOS SDK targeting iOS after installing DCIntrospect with cocoapods Any ideas Im not sure if this is an issue with the library or my XCode installation but my builds have been failing recently due to the DEBUGGER instruction on line of DCIntrospectm I receive duplicate errors which say Instruction requires Not bit mode returns a DCIntrospectm Line Expanded from macro DEBUGGER from the following else if string isEqualToStringkDCIntrospectKeysEnterGDB UIView view selfcurrentView viewtag viewtag suppress the xcode warning about an unused variable NSLogDCIntrospect access current view using local view variable DEBUGGER return NO In some cases if classes were traversed in a particular order the classs superclass would already have had valueForKey swizzled In that case originalValueForKey would be set to UITextInputTraitsvalueForKey This leads to an infinite loop in UITextInputTraitsvalueForKey The fix is to traverse the classs heritage until a suitable valueForKey implementation is found To make it easier to read debug logs add this category and make it so that when you tap on a view it displays the tag name along with the class name Also the debug output should display these tags eg myview setNametagMy main view when you tap on it DCIntrospect should display UIView My main view on the top status bar Without this you would only see UIView which is not helpful when you have many views and subviews Category code interface UIView NameTags NSString nametag voidsetNametagNSString theNametag NSString objectIdentifier end implementation UIView NameTags NSString nametag return NSString objcgetAssociatedObjectself selectornametag Nametag setter voidsetNametagNSString theNametag objcsetAssociatedObjectself selectornametag theNametag OBJCASSOCIATIONRETAINNONATOMIC Return Class description hex memory address NSString objectIdentifier return NSString stringWithFormat x x selfclassdescription int self end
