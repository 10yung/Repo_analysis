Hello Thank you for cool library I faced with problem if I add shimmercliptochildrentrue shimmer produce black line instead of white line if shimmercliptochildrenfalse all is ok and I have white line My shimmer code comfacebookshimmerShimmerFrameLayout androidididshimmerviewcontainer androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheight dp androidbackgroundcolorwhite appshimmercliptochildrentrue appshimmerautostarttrue appshimmerbasealpha appshimmercoloredfalse appshimmerdirectionlefttoright appshimmerhighlightalpha appshimmertilt img width altScreenshot at src What I do wrong ps I use version Build gradle classpath comandroidtoolsbuildgradle Shimmer version EDITED On build gradle version the ShimmerFrameLayout v show error cannot find class It would be great if the sample app had the ability to tweak the various properties of the shimmer dynamically and interactively There should be an additional preset called Custom that will show a bunch of controls for each of the possible options for the shimmer object Once a value is changed the shimmer should be updated so you could see the new effect
