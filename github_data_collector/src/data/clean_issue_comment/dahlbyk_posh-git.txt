all projects that my login has access to or that my group has access to Fixes PID and WINPID mismatch was introduced in the recent cygwin release see Related This targets the master branch It creates the module in an out folder by copying the content of the src folder into it first and then merging the ps files into the main psm files that are dot sourced by looking for the pattern PSScriptRoot ScriptNameps and replacing it with the content and wrapping it into a region block The result is stored in a folder with the name being the version so that one can just add to to the PSModulePath env variable if one wanted to This cuts the import time roughly in half for a pure import from a started up PS from to ms on my machine or reduced the import time by when the import happens in the PROFILE dont know why the benefit is smaller in this case but probably because the import is generally slow in the Profile due to PS being busy at the start Ive adapted the test logic to use the built module

Support for Azure CLI Includes Support for SubCommand Expansion TargetSource Branch expansion ParameterValue expansion Updates VSTS CLI Support Fills in gaps for missing commands Feature parity with AZ branchparameter expansion Both AZVSTS can be installed at the same time with different aliases Added Tests for all cases The VSTS CLI has been deprecated and replaced with the Azure CLI az repos The aliases that are added via usegitaliases are the same as the Vsts ones pr being the primary one Would need to add a new known alias to support both Vsts and az Additionally some of the subcommands have changed many of them are pluralization reviewer vs reviewers but some options have been removed and a few added Any chance the module will be updated to officially support the aliases added by the Azure CLI Ive updated my local copy of the module and would gladly submit a PR if youd like
