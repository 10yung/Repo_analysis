 Im getting JUCEmodulesjucegraphicscolourjucePixelFormatsh error cannot bind packed field jucePixelARGBthisjucePixelARGBanonymousjucePixelARGBunnamed unioncomps to juceuint aka unsigned char forcedinline uint getAlpha noexcept return comps indexA compiling with GCC Id like to build an headless Raspberry PI Helm machine I was happy to find that theres an headless option but unfortunately heres the output rootdebian helm headless Failed to connect to the X Server Is this even possible Thanks in advance PS Installed Helmx from the Deb package I have just been writing a TouchOSC front end to use in conjunction with Sonic Pi to select Helm Patches I noticed that three of the SFX factory presets contents do not match up with their names SF whistle has contents for Brass Soft Stutter SF Whistle has contents for Whistle SF Whistle has contents for Whistle There doesnt actually appear to be a whistle eg here is the beginning content of Whistle helm license Patch c by SF This patch is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution International License You should have received a copy of the license along with this work If not see synthversion patchname BrassSoftStutter foldername Keys author SF and for Whistle helm license Patch c by SF This patch is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution International License You should have received a copy of the license along with this work If not see synthversion patchname Whistle foldername SFX author SF I wondered why my selector which uses midi cc signals to select patches wasnt working properly until I looked at these contents IT works fine for everything else I was using the names index of the patches in the folder to generate the midi cc data to send EDIT looks like selecting patches via midi control uses the internal name of the patch to display whereas selcting from the in built browser uses the filename The patches sound the same whichever way you select Hello Wondering if you could clarify how Helm uses the LV TimePosition In MusE I pass a full complement of all LV TimePosition properties including bar beat barBeat frame unit samplerate etc I even correct the info for latency so that it is in sync with the audio output But as time goes on if there is even one tempo change in the song the sequencer loses sync Same result in QTractor Im guessing but it seems that Helm might use the current frame and tempo to determine current bar and beat which I think would be incorrect if a tempo change had occurred before a given frame had been reached Does that sound correct Is there anything that we can change host side to correct this Thanks Tim If the app could also remember the volume from last time it was opened that would be neat too I love this program but every time I open it Im annoyed by the loud default synth Hello there are two helms around the amazing synth and a Kubernetes package manager This creates a conflict in distro package managers which has been solved by some packagers only in terms of package names eg helm and helmsynth or helm and kuberneteshelm not binaries so installing one of the two helms overwrites the other I think that its unlikely that both are installed on the same machine since they belong to two completely different fields however it would be nice to make life easier for distro maintainers if they did not conflict Since its much harder to ask a Foundation ran by huge corporations Google CoreOS Mesosphere Red Hat Twitter Huawei Intel Cisco IBM Docker Univa and VMware according to Wikipedia and a huge userbase to rename their binaries maybe this helm could have an executable called usrbinhelmsynth instead of usrbinhelm to make life easier for packagers Otherwise packagers should do it themselves but they might not be aware that another helm exists so they should all be contacted individually This pr backports to make helm compile with gcc again Fixes Adding stuff like build dependencies etc i would like to try helm but compiler said Bildschirmfoto von If you have configured your host to display plugin parameters and you change a preset via the Helm UI the presets in the host do not update However onoff parameters do seem to be propagated Observed in the Juce Audio Plugin Host and Ableton img width althelmableton src img width althelmjuce src Im using AVLinux based on Debian kernel rt avl bit JACK version jackdmp version tmpdir devshm protocol and Helm Standalone v I want to route audio through Calf Studio Gear so I switch Helms Audio device type to JACK and choose Calf Studio Gear as output The appropriate plugin inputs show up under Active output channels but clicking them does nothing From here I try connecting from Calf itself Its Available JACK Audio Outputs include Helmout Helmout and Helmout sometimes higher numbers too but upon selecting any of them Helm segfaults without explanation
