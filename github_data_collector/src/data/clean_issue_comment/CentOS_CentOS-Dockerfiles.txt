Hi Team while creating a docker image using this code snippet in my Dockerfile the image creation fails at command RUN sshkeygen t rsa f etcsshsshhostrsakey N binsh sshkeygen command not found The command binsh c sshkeygen t rsa f etcsshsshhostrsakey N returned a nonzero code Ive run the docker pull command to get the centos with mariadb image however when I run the command to create a container from that image the container dosent seems to work First the issue was related to the port being on use since I already had mysql installed and it was using that port however after setting it to inactive the issue with the port being on use dismissed But now I do not now the reason when I create a container following the page example docker run namemariadb d p e MYSQLROOTPASSWORDpassword yournamemariadb The container that it creates gets Exited Immediately even if afterwards I run a docker start It gets Exited within seconds I am getting this error while running build docker build rm t kiranhttpd ovl Error while doing RPMdb copyup Errno Permission denied varlibrpmdbenvlock You need to be root to perform this command today i find one issue docker version docker run ulimit nofile i use the image CentOSDockerfilessystemdcentos i find in this container whatever i do or ulimit nofile to run this docker this docker when i ssh into it it still show ulimit n this container docker shim is nofile from host machine this container init pid process show This init process does not get the parameters from father process dockershim always keep may i know this office images whether fix the nofile to even dockershim can not give the parameter to it thanks Systemd defines that it expects SIGRTMIN for graceful shutdown ref bug docker container port is CentOSDockerfiles Bind I am sorry to open this up like this but this hasnt been updated since and still doesnt support IPv May I ask for when an update Also does this support dlz wmariadbmysql support Thank you The centossystemd image on docker hub only has the tag latest right now This will make things exciting when Centos is released I suggest adopting centossystemd latest and centossystemd tags now so that when CentOS is released there isnt any major pain for consumers of the image
