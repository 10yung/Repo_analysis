 First it appears nothing has happened at all lately Will this repo be updated again Secondly using this in a Swift project I get loads of errors on using any image property of an imageView backgroundImageViewimage UIImagenamed someImageName cannot assign to property image is a method This means I can no longer use this library bc it breaks code in many many files Apple has an internal class also called PDFView As its not defined which class should be used the linker gives a warning about that To avoid that PDFView has been renamed to NTBPDFView If more warnings are enable in Xcode these warnings are shown Implicit conversion turns floatingpoint number into integer float to sizet aka unsigned long Implicit conversion loses floatingpoint precision double to CGFloat aka float This commit fixes these by adding explicit typecasts The method UIImage image in the UIViewImage category causes an error in Swift projects The error message is getter for image with ObjectiveC selector image conflicts with method image from superclass UIView with the same ObjectiveC selector Assignments to the image property of UIImageView in Swift with image will also get Cannot assign to property self is immutable error This pull request attempts to fix those errors Converted a PDF to UIImage and than saved that image to savedPhotos album When i am previewing that photo normally it is coming right but after tapping on photo photo is getting blank but if i am using any other image it behaves accurately Please update asap with fix iOS Version As subject please update the published cocoa pods version so that it includes fixes for the bit warnings
