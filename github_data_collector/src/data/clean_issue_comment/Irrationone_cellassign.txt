bHello TensorFlow I think it has something to do with Tensorflow detection I am running cellassign on a dataset I tried to use your method on a dataset with cells marker genes and cell types in theory I have more marker genes too It has been running for a whole day without signs of finishing so I stopped the process in case I am doing something wrong I got the following warning W

acceptance bioconductor submission we should aim to have the following usability enhancements Allow multiple ways of passing the marker matrix ie let the user pass the named list and have cellassign call markerlisttomat with nice errors if something fails If the SCE doesnt match the number of marker genes can we try to do something intelligent with subsetting Ie work out if the rownames look like ensmebl IDs or symbols and try and subset the sce based on rowDatasceSymbol or rowDatasceID If SCE already has size factors use them if s isnt provided and should we change s to sizefactors anyway bad name all of the above should throw a message to the user warning them of what the software is up to and that results arent guaranteed I saw some tags relating to bioccheck and just wanted to check in on the status of Cellassign being submitted to BIoconductor Thanks Something like r train function top everything list combined docallcbind everything block repseqalongeverything vapplyeverything ncol FUNVALUE L labels unlistlapplyeverything FUNfunctionx xlabel assumes we have a labels field Toy examples with very few cells cause Irlba issues hence the try clust NULL tryclust

directionup blockblock clusterlabels markers lapplyde FUNfunctionx headrownamesx top cellassignmarkerlisttomatmarkers The aim would be to autogenerate a decent markergeneinfo from one or more reference data sets in This would enable people to use cellassign as an endtoend classification tool ie train and test without mandatory human intervention Right now people have to read through the vignette put together a DE analysis etc Not too hard for battlehardened bioinformaticians but still annoying to do Of course people can still fiddle with the marker lists if they want to but if they dont train is there I havent tested this beyond checking that it runs so YMMV I originally wrote that if an SCE isnt provided and a user provides a count matrix then effectively it should be cell by gene ie r t counts sce as input out of a pedantic need that dim should be samples cells However this is probably over confusing and we should change it to just gene by cell ie countssce equiv Accept seurat data types as input using the Convert function in seurat Note that Seurat should only be a suggests rather than depends to avoid depending on too many libraries If s is NULL we can check sizeFactorssce before computing them ourselves but should have warning as often people dont know what sits there
