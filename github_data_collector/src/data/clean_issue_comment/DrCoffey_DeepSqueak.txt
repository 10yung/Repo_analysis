Hi all Is it possible to get total number of calls per recording and per time point For example I recorded mice for min and I would like to get the total number of calls as well as number of call in min min min etc Thanks Gidi When running Unsupervised Clustering with files I get the following errors during file loading Output argument ClusteringData and maybe others not assigned during call to

know in what order DS loads the files If you can tell me that I can send you the offending detection file After detecting calls with a trained network and editing some of the boxes with saving the file inbetween I run it through a classification network However for the classification to work the mat needs to be loaded in which fails This sometimes happens to me and I do not know why this occurs When I try just loading the mat file into Matlab by drag and drop this gives me also an error message saying cannot load file X This is the error message that pops up Error using load Cannot read file

file Cheers Isa I get a warning stating Upper range above sampling frequency and then a ton of lines of Lowering threshold I assume the first means that my audio file doesnt have calls that reach the maximum frequency set but I am wondering what the lowering threshold means img width altLT src Hi Im using the b Matlab version on Windows I have been using the LongRatCallNetworkV to detect mostly successfully over the last couple of weeks The only time Ive gotten an error was when there werent any calls actually present in the wav file which makes sense However for the last couple of files I have been getting an error when trying to use the Long RatCallNetworkV for detection even though there definitely are calls present in the file Basically the mat detection file is created but I am unable to load it I have tried using the Short RatCallNetworkV which does work however it also detects a lot of noise and double or tripple counts the calls since they are longer I have been using the same set of parameters for all previous detections and it has worked fine There shouldnt be a difference in the file itself so the error is a bit odd Im attaching screenshots here dsscrnshot the parameters used dsscrnshot the error after trying to load the calls dsscrnshot and the code Perhaps this issue has already been raised but my programming skills arent very advanced so I wasnt sure

Russell I am running into a bit of a problem with long kHz rat calls The detector tends to only detect portions of the long calls and it is not usually possible to manually correct this because the view is zoomed so that the ends of the call are usually cut off I think this must be because the long calls tend to have small breaks in the sound but I would like to count them as one call unless they are separated by at least ms like in Wright et al I would also like to do this for short calls as sometimes the detector bins calls which are temporally quite separate together and sometimes splits up what I would count as a single call Is there a way to do this I have used your detectors as well as training my own and I seem to always have the same outcome Thanks for all your help Raven Hi Ive been trying to retrain the existing mouse call network to detect pup calls since the original network is missing more than half of the calls in my files compared to manual counting I tried to retrain the network with around minute audio files but it it seems like its still missing a large chunk of the calls Is there any way to modify the sensitivity to allow the network to recognize the calls that are missing Or do I need to feed more files into the network in order for it to recognize these calls that its missing Thanks and have a good weekend Trish Hi when I train a supervised classifier to discriminate between two different call types I eventually get a confusion matrix showing how many of the calls were correctly and how many very incorrectly classified Is there a way that I can look at the misclassified calls and see whether they share some similar features to get a feeling which calls are confusing the classifier Thank you Isa Dear Kevin and Russell I have been trying to train the existing all short calls network with the manually isolated ultrasonic vocalizations of mice However I am encountering the following error when I try the training option Error
