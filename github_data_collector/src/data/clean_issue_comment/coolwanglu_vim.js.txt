Im not sure what the status of the project is but if its permanently unmaintained or abandoned please please please archive the repository on GitHub Hope all is well you did a really bad ass job I tried to compiled the vimjs but got stuck at checking for tgetent in ltinfo no checking for tgetent in lncurses no checking for tgetent in ltermlib no checking for tgetent in ltermcap no checking for tgetent in lcurses no no terminal library found checking for tgetent configure error NOT FOUND You need to install a terminal library for example ncurses Or specify the name of the library with withtlib ERRORrootConfigure step failed with nonzero return code Command line configure enableguiweb withfeaturessmall disableselinux disablexsmp disablexsmpinteract disableluainterp disablemzschemeinterp disableperlinterp disablepythoninterp disablepython interp disabletclinterp disablerubyinterp disablecscope disableworkshop disablenetbeans disablesniff disablemultibyte disablehangulinput disablexim disablefontset disablegtk check disablegnomecheck disablemotifcheck disableathenacheck disablenextawcheck disablecarboncheck disablegtktest disablelargefile disableacl disablegpm disablesysmouse disablenls withmodifiedbyLu Wang withcompiledbyLu Wang at srcvimjs Havent changed anything in the buildsh Any idea how to pass this tgetent thing Program crashes when typing e in normal mode cry Thanks for every distributor bring so great app Now I expect a interesting using journey Thanks to everyone But why vim is hot web is hot js is hot node is hot However why does vimjs developing is so cold I am so puzzled with this Would someone thinks like what I thought Would someone discusses on this issue It is disabled by default Fix to end of line HOME END CTRLF forward and CTRLB backward on Chrome Also tested on Firefox and IE Consistently use Oz optimization across all stages of compilation configure make and link Remove handled if Add exported functions to emterpreted version Dependencies on Ubuntu are emscripten dependencies and for vim libncursesdev libxtdev and cproto PS It can be a bit hard to track down what is missing because make proto will just omit definitions that require more headers rather than fail so compile will fail later with the missing definitions You can run eg bash cd src gcc E DPROTO DFEATSMALL DFEATGUIWEB uic on the file in question to check for error messages regarding headers While running configure there is a problem that emcc calls clang instead of gcc and then doesnt pick up ncurses system library which makes the configure fail so before configure do bash cd EMDIR mv emcc emccorig ln s emcc gcc Then after configure finishes and before building bash cd EMDIR mv emcc emcclink mv emccorig emcc There may be a better way to do this using an environment variable but I didnt find it As seen in the screenshot wherever the cursor goes it leaves behind boxes around the characters This is on chromium bit x scrot seems it is only way to support keyin chinese is canvas overlay input how did you think or did you any plan to support chinese is this a bug Esc not works
