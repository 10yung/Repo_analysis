Hi I started updating the website to handle It appears that using an up to date gem for githubpages solved the issue I may continue to update things rails version README etc for instance if find some time etc Thanks for this gem Hi all Apologies in advance for the inexperience that may be reflected in this question Id really like to get railserd to work but Im getting a strange output Environment Ruby Sinatra ActiveRecord MySQL The database is running in a Docker service on my local machine Output Im generating a model erdpdf that has one element in it titled ActiveRecordSchemaMigrations with one property version string Output with bundle exec erd Loading application in Generating entityrelationship diagram for models Diagram saved to erdpdf Trace with rake Invoke erd firsttime Invoke environment firsttime Execute environment Execute erd Procedure Added the railserd gem and reran bundle install bundle exec erd I also saw instructions regarding Sinatra and created a rake task that calls RailsERDDiagramGraphvizcreate then ran bundle exec rake erd Both methods produce the same singleelement model there are about files in models I hope you can tell from the symptoms what could be going wrongplease let me know if there is anything else useful I can share DEPRECATION WARNING Moduleparent has been renamed to moduleparent parent is deprecated and will be removed in Rails Rails deprecated Moduleparent and friends in railsrails replacing them with a moduleprefix naming scheme This checks to see if moduleparent is defined using it if its available Hi Im trying to generate my ERD diagram I have a Rails app The pdf is generate but the result is not what I expected img width altCaptura de Pantalla a las src Even though I can generate erddot and there is content Thank you

railserds API doc on rubydocinfo then clicked View on GitHub links but the all lead me to on GitHub Unfortunately as Im not familiar with yard I could not find out the root cause yard rubydocinfo or usage of yard in this project A model Foo has a length validator on field bar with a Proc as maximum value ruby class Foo ApplicationRecord validates bar length maximum foo foomaxlengthallowed end Running bundle exec erd would fail with message ArgumentError bad value for range pointing to ruby def associationsrangeassociations absolutemax The minimum of the range is the maximum value of each association minimum If there is none it is zero by definition The reasoning is that from all associations if only one has a required minimum then this side of the relationship has a cardinality of at least one min associationsmap assoc associationminimumassoc max The maximum of the range is the maximum value of each association maximum If there is none it is equal to the absolute maximum If only one association has a high cardinality on this side the relationship itself has the same maximum cardinality max associationsmap assoc associationmaximumassoc max absolutemax minmax end In this case max would equal the Proc object representing the line foo foomaxlengthallowed A quick and dirty solution would be to modify associationmaximum to something like ruby def associationmaximumassociation maximum associationcollection N lengthvalidators associationvalidatorslength association result lengthvalidatorsmap v voptions maximum compactmin or maximum resultrespondtocall maximum result end The same applies to minimum parameter Why Related Issue Related PR Cause When I added require false option in Gemfile and added requirement in generated libautogeneratediagramrake file I encountered errors as followings Dont know how to build task erd See the list of available tasks with rails tasks I think loading is only tasksrake file as followings It doesnt include raileerdtasksrake file So RakeTask erd is not loaded What did I do RenameReplace railserdtasksrake to taskserdrake Fix template for adding requirement Fix README for adding require false option When dividing reflected associations into relationships there is some incorrect handling in determining the direction of the Relationship Specifically the code is relying on belongsto to determine if an ActiveRecordAssociationReflection is a reverse association But this is incorrect only a BelongsToReflection has belongsto true but a ThroughReflection can have a sourcereflection which is a BelongsToReflection and is therefore a reverse association Thus these can end up incorrectly in the forwardassociations Therefore when the code sets the source and destination based on the first of forwardassociations it can get it wrong if it picks up that ThroughReflection cardinality and mutual will also be directly affected by this and indirectshould really be based on associations not just forwardassociations Example ruby class A ActiveRecordBase hasmany bs end class B ActiveRecordBase belongsto a hasmany cs end class C ActiveRecordBase belongsto b hasone a through b end The AC relationship will have their sole association in forwardassociations and incorrectly identify the orientation of the relationship Relevant source partitionassociations is generally based on belongsto The README provides an example erdconfig stating that the values given are the defaults However the linked documentation that explains these properties and values provides different default values for several of the properties attributes filename and indirect for example and omits several others markup sort prependprimary cluster and splines
