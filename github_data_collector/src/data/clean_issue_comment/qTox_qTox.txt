Correct me if im wrong please but is there no way to save the formatting when you save logs When you rightclick and save a log none of the formats ive been able to guess at has saved the various text formatting italics bold etc Is there a way to safe the formatting or is that more of a future feature In the same vein is the only way to italic and bolt using and Flathub builds fail if appdata file

notification sound even if the window is active A checkbox allowing this behavior would be most appreciated I only get a notification sound if the window does not have focus I see that others have already requested a separate setting in your configuration for where this sound goes to avoid having it go to the headphones and the ability to change the default sound Both of those are also important This is a first try at displaying the user name in the tray menu Updating the name only happens when restarting the client and truncating too long ones is not there yet Commits follow our git commit guidelines Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend Theres a lot of janky ChatLog behaviour since the functionality to remove messages from the ChatLog was added a few months ago Its definitely a good idea to remove messages from the ChatLog when it becomes too big for memory and performance reasons but there are some architectural problems GenericChatForm holds the multiple GUI elements eg search chat edit and ChatLog But GenericChatForm still handles a bunch of message layout logic IMO this should all be handled only inside of ChatLog Both GenericChatForm and ChatLog hold a cache of rendered messages Theres no reason to duplicate this any more since SessionChatLog stores unrendered messages that can be loaded if the ChatLog is scrolls ChatLog has different message removal behaviour for friends and groups if history is available which is no longer required because of SessionChatLog Message removal from ChatLog should always be possible SessionChatLog should expose a list of all messages and ChatLog should just know about the list of rendered messages and the subset of those rendered messages that are visible ChatLog currently renders any message added to the bottom below all other messages which means if youre scrolled up receiving a new message will incorrectly append it onto your partial view If instead ChatLog correctly didnt render the message that was outside of its view GenericChatForm would still cache that message and think it was rendered since it has split responsibility and duplicated state We have options going forward for fixing ChatLog Minimal fix to unblock v release change a few lines in ChatLog to restore old scroll behaviour and no longer remove lines form ChatLog which would be another couple lines would work This would unfortunately mean wed lose chat line eviction behaviour for v but would fix the scroll to bottom issue fix search with scroll issues and fix adding messages while scrolled up causing a gap in chat I have this implemented locally Fix scroll and message gap As well as fixing scroll like above add to ChatLog knowledge of what messages are in render range change logic in ChatLog that removes messages from top or bottom of ChatLog to instead remove messages based on where the current visible messages are ie dont remove messages from top of ChatLog just because a message was added to the bottom because of the user is scrolled up messages at top of ChatLog might be what is in view ChatLog should remove messages that are furthest away from the visible messages Change GenericChatForm to not cache messages that ChatLog doesnt want to render because theyre out of range For a complete fix GeneircChatForm and ChatLog need a refactor All rendered message handling logic should be in ChatLog only ChatLog shouldnt care if the chat has history and ChatLog should be aware of its targetted render range If a message is updated outside of that render range it should not add it eg new message received when were scrolled up GenericChatForm handling wouldnt need to be added for when ChatLog rejects messages since GenericChatForm would no longer be caching messages I feel like option would almost definitely introduce a new slew of bugs since ChatForm is so fragile I dont want to do a large refactor in that area when its holding back release Doing that on master once release is out would be great option allows us to keep the message eviction performance benefit Adding to ChatLog knowledge of its intended render range is a little complicated and updating GenericChatForm to not cache messages that ChatLog doesnt want to render is a bit complicated too since currently GenericChatForm caches the message before ChatLog is given it This wouldnt be too hard but Im still worried that new bugs would be introduced option is simple and losing the performance benefit of message eviction from ChatLog isnt a regression from last release IMO we should only reinclude the performance benefits when the multiple architectural problems causing bugs are worked out sudden what do you think Im leaning towards option but think option would be reasonable
