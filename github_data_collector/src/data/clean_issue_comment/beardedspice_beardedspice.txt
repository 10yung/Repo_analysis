I tried installing beardedspice on Catalina I uninstalled it shortly after and now my media keys behave very strange The Music app opens when I press play but cannot be controlled by the media keys Im able to stop a Udemy video in Safari when Safari is selected but I cannot play forward or backward I removed beardedspice by dragging it into the trash a second time I used AppCleaner and a third time I used a uninstall script I found using google Nothing worked Hi Itd be so great if the native Apple Podcast app could get support Thisd then cover all the apps I use Spotify Youtube Soundcloud Podcast Thank you so much Please add support for DaftCloud seems like a good SoundCloud controller Thanks Hi Thx for this awesome app Any chance there can be support for the jriver media center much thanks z Would be great if controlling jellyfish was possible Followed beareded spice appears to see the sirius xm tab but cant seem to control it in anyway What am I doing wrong latest version of bearded spice I think the title is self explanatory But I think it would be great to add an option to pause any playback when you manually lock your mac with any of the lock shortcuts I just updated to MacOS Catalina and Bearded Spice is not working for the Music app formerly Itunes Muy guess is that the change in name messed it up because it is still working in Spotify Your software is amazing I hope it will be working with ItunesMusic again soon The Audible plugin does not work anymore By inspecting the plugin i found the following problems the format does only match on audiblecomcloudplayer the url in germany is audibledewebplayer this will not match the selectors are broken use adblPlayButton adblPauseButton to select play pause button selectors for art chapter timecur and timeRem are broken i would recommend to use documentgetElementById with adblcloudBook cpTopchapterdisplay adblMediaBarTimeSpent and adblMediaBarTimeLeft As these are only the things i used to fix it myself i dont know if these are universal Can you please add support for YouTube music app the unofficial or for the musicyoutubecom website
