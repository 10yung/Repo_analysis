Hello We are trying flowgger for forwarding logs from remote site to our central Graylog server Everything on our infrastructure is with timezone CEST Flowgger seems to force the timestamp of the GELF to UTC Is there a way to configure and change this behavior Thanks in advance Flowgger seems to be a nice tool Would you be open to accepting a PR to support a Lua parsing This way some more custom log formats can be added without having to recompile or add into source Found this while writing tests As for the encoders should support the ability to add or replace without duplicating tags and fields LTSV is not only not overriding it but get duplicated as the encoding is done by appending data to a String left someinfofoo tsomeinfobar thostexampleorg ttime tmessageA short message tfullmessageBacktrace here with more tlevel tappnameappname tprocid tmsgidmsgid right someinfobar thostexampleorg ttime tmessageA short message tfullmessageBacktrace here with more tlevel tappnameappname tprocid tmsgidmsgid srcflowggerencoderltsvencoderrs Some work already done in For better log processing performance log pass through would be an interesting thing to explore Hello I think it could be very useful to enhance Kafka output with a kind of timer option and associate it with the actual kafkacoalesce parameter kafkacoalesce kafkaflushinterval s If one of theses conditions is met commit the batch to Kafka Thanks Especially with file input it may be desirable to merge the logs from multiple sources each with their own decoder Hi would netflowipfix be an input of interest Awesome code thanks a lot May you please consider to expose some metrics Such as uptime number of active sessions message received sent droped charset or bad format
