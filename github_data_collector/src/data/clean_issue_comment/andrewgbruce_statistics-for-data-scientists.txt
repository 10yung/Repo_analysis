 As recommended in the book I downloaded from GitHub R source file and when I execute them I get the following error message while downloading the data from Google drive Error in curlcurlfetchdiskurl xpath handle handle Failed to open file C Users amitk OneDrive Documents statisticsfordatascientists data statecsv I tried to find the solution for this error message but didnt get any luck This is a humble request to kindly share the datasets so that I can practise the same Where are the png files used in the program located Ive also see that this PR mentioned by other issues in and in your prepdatasetsr you load the data file statepopulationscsv and murderratecsv statepop readcsvUsersandrewbruce bookstatepopulationscsv murderrate readcsvUsersandrewbruce bookmurderratecsv but in your downloaddatar you didnt download the data file statepopulationscsv and murderratecsv Just encountered an error when executing the downloaddatar script and modified it so that it creates the required data subdirectory upon first execution I saw that this was also mentioned by other users in I am working through the example of session times in Chapter Permutation Test Example Web Stickiness I have assumed that the data to which this example refers is that located in the file webpagedatacsv For pages A and B respectively it seems that the time is listed in the table as minutes because the correct result for meanb meana is obtained after converting to seconds However if this is correct then Figure is not Figure appears to show Time as minutes rather than as minutes ie seconds Which is correct Thanks The downloaddatar script assumes the presence of a data directory as in statisticsfordatascientistsdata The user could create this manually or add a line to the script to do so The book uses a couple of datasets for coding examples When will they become available here Where will I be able to access the code samples and example datasets of the book
