 I was looking at some of the tutorials at and was very interested to see that vuejs is reactive Reactivity is of course one of Shinys killer features I started looking around to see if anyone had tried to link vuejs and R or fiery hrbrmstrs fiery example provides a nice illustration of using fiery but it would be great to see how to connect that to a basic user frontend eg using vuejs timelyportfolio has some interesting work on embedding vuejs in R but I havent seen anything that uses R serverside and vuejs on the client side If anyone has an example of using R fiery with vuejs Id be very interested to see it In general I think some simple examples using fiery to show how to generate plots and tables in a browser would make this very promising tool much more accessible It seems as though fieryroutrreqres based apps dont currently have a mechanism for reporting trace stacks of errors which makes debugging complex applications difficult Heres a minimal example of the information reported in a request error BTW any idea why the error is being reported twice r libraryfiery libraryroutr app Firenew route Routenew routeaddhandlerget functionrequest response keys responsetype html responsestatus L responsebody h All your AI are belong to ush a FALSE router RouteStacknew routeraddrouteroute main appattachrouter appigniteshowcase TRUE r Fire started at error nonnumeric argument to binary operator error nonnumeric argument to binary operator With shiny if you run an app that is saved to disk it reports the line at which the error occurs would it be possible to add something similar to the fieryroutrreqres stack r libraryshiny ui fluidPage plotOutputp server functioninput output outputp renderPlot a qplot shinyAppui server r runApptestappshinyR r Listening on Warning Error in nonnumeric argument to binary operator renderPlot testappshinyR func drawPlot reactiveplotObj drawReactive origRenderFunc outputp runApp This package is great Thanks very much for your excellent work Im confused for passing value from outside into Fiery The example may be like this curl The output depends on the input val I want to get v Thank you very much for your help Trying to write an authentication plugin to use with fiery and and routr but I cannot figure how to block the process if a condition is not met eg return an error directly from the plugin A very minimal example would be something like this r Basic R ClassBasic public list initialize function name Basic onattach functionserver serveronbeforerequest functionrequest if requestheadersAuth foo continue else return error response basic Basicnew route Routenew routeaddhandlerpost functionrequest response keys responsestatus L responsebody request handled TRUE router RouteStacknew routeraddrouteroute approuter app Firenew appattachbasic appattachrouter appigniteblock TRUE How should I do that Recognise the fireplace DESCRIPTION entry that defines an expression returning a Fire object Add firestarter function to start package based servers At the moment the event cycle should be a zerooperation unless handlers have been attached Still I need to look into the efficiency of the cycle as well as the event flushing mechanism to make sure it is as performant as possible
