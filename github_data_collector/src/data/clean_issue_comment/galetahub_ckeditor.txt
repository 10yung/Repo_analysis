This is so weird when Im editing in a ckeditor window and I go to source if I hit controlf to open a search box and start typing text to search the tab crashes Can anyone else try and replicate this or help debug it Im not getting an error in the browser console just a warning that the page has disconnected Ive never really seen anything like this Because of some very specific handling of images in my system I need CKEditor when clicking on image and browsing the server to use my own controller to handle our custom logic setting a configparentcontroller in initializer didnt work please advice after resizing ckeditor content of text area disappeared and text area not working trying to get emoji plugin working which requires autocomplete plugin which requires textwatcher all three of these plugins seem to want a function called CKEDITORtoolsthrottle I guess its not anywhere in this repo That seems odd The emojis are not flowing at new TextWatcher pluginjstFB E Uncaught ReferenceError CKEDITOR is not defined Expected result Ckeditor should work properly I updated to the latest version of ckeditor and configured accordingly Actual result Uncaught ReferenceError CKEDITOR is not defined I am getting this error on the console Other details Browser Chrome OS Ubuntu LTS CKEditor version There is a section in README Install additional plugins You should download necessary plugins with all dependencies and extract them in appassetsjavascriptsckeditorplugins After that you can include your plugins in appassetsjavascriptsckeditorconfigjs in this way javascript CKEDITOReditorConfig function config configextraPlugins eqneditorautosave But in case of v where CDN scripts are used there is no at least visible for me possibility to add additional plugins manually For example I want codemirror addon And because of inconsistency of versions there is no matching codemirror script in CDN for ckeditor v x So how can I use it and other similar addons in v gem This change breaks the view attachments is not an AR model or enumerable class and as such causes an empty file list to be rendered It is a paginator which is why the scoped method worked as it returns an AR model Please correct picturesindexhtmlerb is still correct and functioning See comments This is a duplicate of Bug which was closed by the author but the Bug is real and still in the current stable release The Column Name type not sure if type as well is reserved for polymorphic associations thats why Rails is complaining sometimes Maybe the bug only appears when you actually use polymorphic associations on other models Please rename at least the following column type And it would probably better to rename datacontenttype unless it is used for a polymorphic associations which I could not test because it crashes before any data can be saved in that column See Or
