PR do Adds support for all spinners when using windows terminal Note If using jupyter notebook spawned from windows terminal when all characters display correctly If using jupyter notebook not spawned from WT then the characters display fallbacks dispite not needing them HaloNotebook could just patch the issupported call to ignore it but that would not work as well for LogSymbols Checklist x Your

close them when PR is merged Eg Fixes Fixes People to notify Please mention relevant people here I propose to inject the spinner instance as an optional parameter to functions decorated by halo This was my use case python HalotextDoing work spinnerdots colorred def initializegitspinnerNone This argument is optional and can also be omitted try mycomplicatedfunction except Exception spinnerfailFailed raise spinnersucceedSucceeded I know that this is possible to use a context manager but this does require deeper nesting and is not that neat imo Please let me know if you consider this a valid use case Description This PR adds functionality to declare the optional keyword argument as a parameter to obtain a reference to the spinner object This does not break anything and is completely optional Checklist x Your branch is uptodate with the base branch x Youve included at least one test if this is a new feature x All tests are passing Further considerations It is also possible to inject the spinner instance as a positional argument but this could not be made optional Not sure if this is a bug or if I am doing something wrong But the spinner shows up for each
