To illustrate lets say I want to match Foo Bar and Baz specifically and any text that isnt one of those I want it to be captured with a wildcard token So given Foo Bar Baz This is a cow the Lexer would return FooBarBazWildcard where wildcard would hold This is a cow So given Bar Baz Foo This is a fish the Lexer would return FooBarBazWildcard where wildcard would hold This is a fish Ive got a set of tokens that seem to match everything correctly including I think the wildcard They look like this matchFoo createToken name matchWildcard pattern Foo matchBar createToken name matchBar pattern Bar matchBaz createToken name matchBaz pattern Baz matchWildcard createToken name matchWildcard pattern azAZ The issue Im having is with the parsing rule Im trying a rule that looks like this RULEnotation ATLEASTONE OR ALT CONSUMEmatchFoo ALT CONSUMEmatchBar ALT CONSUMEmatchBaz ALT CONSUMEmatchWildcard I think this should require at least one token but also consume all tokens regardless of the order in which they appear The problem is Im getting the following error Error name NotAllInputParsedException message Redundant input expecting EOF but found This is a fish token Object resyncedTokens context Object I searched the docs chat channel and issue history but havent been able to unpack why Im getting the error or how to fix it Im sure Im failing to grasp something here
