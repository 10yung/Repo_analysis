PR is similar to with the updated set of dependencies Using the Go modules allows to build the project without having to install additional tools godep it also makes unnecessary to have a large copy of dependencies code in the vendor subdirectory The Go modules also allow the project to be checked out and built in any directory independent of the GOPATH tree Can confd exit when a watch is lost on an etcdv backend I have a yaml file format like sshd pubkeys user key key user key Then I would like to use confd template to generate a config file based on it Looks like confd doesnt like the formate I tried the following template range gets sshdpubkeys end But it returned nothing Could someone take a look Thank you support for nacos as backend Nacos Dynamic Naming and Configuration Service it provider by alibabainc see the website for more about nacos Redis connection rediscli s varrunredissock And my configuration is stored in database So I try confd onetime backend redis node varrunredissock But return the fatal confd FATAL dial tcp address varrunredissock missing port in address Of course I also configured the confd config file and try again Is it my method wrong OR Does confd not support selection database in redis unix connection There are some open PRs that havent been addressed and many issues here and there This is a new backend that uses the filesystem as a KV store It adds a new config option maxfilesize to limit the size of files it will read to avoid unbounded reads This defaults to KB which may still be too high The value of the key is the content of the file with leading and trailing whitespace removed Although not implemented this probably should have a prefix value so that keys like myappdatabaseurl could be relative to the prefix eg Prefix srvconfig Key myappdatabaseurl Actual File Path srvconfigmyappdatabaseurl fixing Currently if you set DYNAMODBLOCAL dynamodb will point to localhost canr point it to something else ie using links or even a different port
