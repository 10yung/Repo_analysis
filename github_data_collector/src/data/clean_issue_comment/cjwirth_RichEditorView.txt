occurs on iOS When a problem occurs the input cursor moves to the original position and further move to the top of the editor view Occasionally some characters may inputed in strange places Hi Team We are using this pod long years back Now we need to give support this pod in UIKItforMac also so we need the WKWebview code When we can get the update Hello cjwirth Keyboard cursor appears only one time

within here If you have anymore YoomamaFTW and Ill look into it Please post it within THIS thread This thread is dedicated to Swift and for updating RichEditorView Hi guys Im not sure if cjwirth is going to be updating this ever again For Swift support use cbesss link I copied all of cbesss code rather than pod install because you will need to change and add a few bits of code To download just download the zip and unzip it to find the packages code in RichEditorView This is as of so happy thanksgiving to all the Americans Anyways I recommend you create two groupsfolders Resources and RichEditorView Afterwards copy the classes into the RichEditorView folder and copy the editor files ie the JS and HTML files into the Resources folder For the icons I IMPORTed those into my Assetsxcassets keyword is import by rightclicking in Xcode Next we need to change the following lines of code Start with RichEditorViewswift The variable DefaultInnerLineHeight should be not This code should fix the VERTICAL scrolling issue The horizontal scrolling issue is coming up We should add tap gestures As a property put this in the objcMember class private let tapRecognizer UITapGestureRecognizer objc private func viewWasTapped if webViewisFirstResponder let point tapRecognizerlocationin webView focusat point In the function setup add this to the bottom tapRecognizeraddTargetself action selectorviewWasTapped tapRecognizerdelegate self addGestureRecognizertapRecognizer Great Now lets go to your Resources folder In stylecss replace the code with the following charset UTF root colorscheme light dark html height body minheight overflow auto font applesystembody body h p ul ol margin div display block position static editor webkituserselect auto important webkittaphighlightcolor rgba editorfocus outline px solid transparent media preferscolorscheme dark body editor placeholder placeholder after content attrplaceholder position absolute top px color cccccc editor minheight height overflow auto display block fontsize pt Props to hansemannn for this code Additionally this code fixes the bug with word wrapping or the horizontal scrolling In richeditorjs youll need to change the most crucial thing RE Instead of RE being a const it should be a var like this var RE This is the reason why none of the JS works properly the WKWebBridge thing cant find a variable RE because there was no variable RE it was a constant Dont worry about LICENSING The nature of it is so that you dont redistribute it under your own name However if its just for commercial use you can just list it under a file giving credits to CJWirth Good luck Again heres the link to cbesss repo
