Hi and thanks for the work done on this repo Ive taken the liberty of updating and expanding one of the scripts in order to extract a bit more information from the files Ive also added a bunch of flags to control the output it can now return the authors as it was before the files and the list of authors ordered by number of commits the files ordered by total number of commits the files ordered by total number of commits with the list of authors ordered by number of commits while still be able to filter the files by extension I have not much experience in Ruby but it did make sense to me to reduce the number of requirements for this simple script Let me know if theres anything youd like to have it outputted differently or updatedrefactored in a different way M Add a function to report the number of unique authors per file Add the number of authors and the filetype to the CSV output This changes the number and order of items in the CSV which may break existing tools that consume this
