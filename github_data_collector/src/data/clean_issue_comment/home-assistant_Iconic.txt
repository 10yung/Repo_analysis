Hi I download this library code from cocoapods and got an issue trying to build app The compiler is unable to check that this switch is exhaustive in reasonable time Probably need to add default value Hey dzenbot I am currently working on second project where I want to use Iconic but we have a small issue As Pods in our experience increase build time we decided to move to Carthage instead Here comes the problem Iconic is only available through Pods and it does not seems right to use Pods together with Carthage We also use SwiftGen on this project and it has this nice command line interface so it can be used in build phase run script Is there any plan to implement CLI and then distribute Iconic with brew Would be killer feature for us I was thinking of adding a cache layer to keep a reference of generated image instances This could be helpful specially when the same icon with color and scale are requested multiple times Just putting this out there to see what users think This is low priority for now At first I was thinking of a NSCache wrapper but then discovered the power of LRU caches and seems more appropriate I would hate having to add yet another dependency to this library so maybe creating our own LRU cache implementation makes sense Wouldnt know where to start tho so any help is greatly appreciated
