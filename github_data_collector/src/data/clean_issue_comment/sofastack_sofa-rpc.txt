bug Java class located out of the Sources root add content root When the SOFARPC demo was downloaded from here and was opened in IDEA the error indicated as Java class located out of the Sources root occurred as shown in the screenshot below Althrough it was solved by adding content root in modules in project setting I wonder the reason leading to this error and whether there is a possible way to avoid it Please be advised to add the note to remaind the user of the right way to open or import the demo project dependency groupIdcomalipaysofagroupId artifactIdsofarpcallartifactId version version dependency allpomxml examplepomxml pom pom In the quick start here it was mentioned to update the version of the dependency below dependency groupIdcomalipaysofagroupId artifactIdsofarpcallartifactId versionthe latest version version dependency But in the demo provided in this page this dependency was included in allpomxml and examplepomxml but not in the pomxml under sofarpcmaster package There might be confusions for new users like me when i was trying to locate this dependency and figure out the differences between these three pomxml Pls evaluate the necessity to add a note in the quick
