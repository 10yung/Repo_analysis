 Noty version Browser Chrome Firefox OS Windows Pro jsFiddle link if available hi is an option for change text direction for example see this image notytextdirection as you see the text is aligned to left but I want to align it to right but I have no option for this and also I test custom CSS but its not working notylayout direction rtl OR notybody direction rtl Sorry this is probably a pretty stupid question but i cant figure out how to setMaxVisible in mainjs before or after Vueuse in Appvuecreated none of that works so it has to be something i missed thanks for any answers Noty version beta Browser Google Chrome Version Official Build bit OS Windows home jsFiddle link if available Instead of showing the newly created noty with a show method call immediately after executing the creation statement I assign the new noty result to windown windown new Noty Then I call the show method in a button click button onclicknshowShow Itbutton However if I click the button another time nothing happens Since the noty object persists there should be a way to redisplay previously added messages So to workaround this I added two property assignments to the afterClose callback which when uncommented do allow the show method to redisplay an existing message It would be nice if this could be either documented an optional parameter added to show method ie reshow or a new method created ie reshow to make this easier The reason for this is on my webpage I want to show an button to redisplay Noty messages that have been shown and then hidden after timingout but Id rather not recreate the message especially when a message is created by the server and then displayed when the page first loaded because the page doesnt have easy access to the anonymous function that displayed the message By the way how can I change the documentready function Noty code that is placed in my html page by the php code on my server to documentready function windown new Noty so that I can make the windownshow method call I discussed above Fix typo in Patreon headline Noty version beta Browser Safari OS macOS High Sierra I have noty installed via npm This is my appscss Noty alert import notysrcnotyscss import notysrcthemesmintscss This is my bootstrapjs windowNoty requirenoty This is where am using it In a vuejs component created new Noty layout top theme defaultTheme text Order received type success show Noty version X Browser Chrome OS Windows jsFiddle link if available In case you want to add a Solarized theme Thank you It seems as though the callback for onClick is not valid in TypeScript and it is throwing an error at compile time I would really love to use the onClick if possible
