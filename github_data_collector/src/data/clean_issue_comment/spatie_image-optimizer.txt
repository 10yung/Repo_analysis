This should be fixed Fixes I have a package that is utilizing imageoptimizer and I want to detect if the optimizers are present on the system On my local machine Ive installed all of them but binaryPath is an empty string I had assumed that if that path was empty they were not present Maybe thats incorrect Do I need to do something more to point imageoptimizer to those binaries In this case the libs are installed with brew as mentioned in the documentation
