there are so many problems I tried to compile the program successfully but when i run the samples many has errors such as can not load gltf corrupted suddennly so i think you should do more work to make it stable There are so much terms here bgfx mud two etc What I need is to be able to pop up an OS window which has two buttons with a hotkey And close that window with a second press of the same hotkey Where can I find a tutorial of how to create such example with Visual Studio I tried to compile two as described in READMEmd but i got those compiler errors im on Debian console BgfxSystemcpp

Ill try a quick investigation crisper font rendering in particular would go a long way in the examples To compile example character I had to modify the file name for the character model the trivial patch is attached after the text After doing that I get the following output instead of the expected animated character Built from the latest master fc af using VS on Windows Pro bit with GeForce GTX graphics card driver version k monitor examplefilenamefixzip Example materials throws an unhandled exception from nvoglv dll when I try to run it Built from the latest master fc afc using VS on

build scripts usesmudnoise in mudlua defines this include directory That is part of mudnoise which is part of mudmud So camera needs to depend on mudmud So in scriptsmudexamplelua I added mudmud to
