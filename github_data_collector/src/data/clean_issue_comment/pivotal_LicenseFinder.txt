I have a Mac OS system which has python and python commands both of which are Python but no python command When I try to run License Finder it tries to run the nonexistent python and crashes bundle

with unknown version Apparently licensefinder tries to find the appropriate license for the eslint version Right Is this a correct behaviour IMHO this is not useful What should I do with this information Do I have to check now all eslint versions matching the semver term in order to decide if this depedency can be approved Thank you for your help licensefinder LicenseFinderNPM is active Dependencies that need approval eslint unknown When using this codebase against a gomod GO MODULESbacked codebase that doesnt have code vendored no license data for dependencies is returned as the

ruby gem install licensefinder on a docker image python that does NOT contain python licensefinder report pythonversion It seems that the issue lies here where there is pip hardcoded with comment The Dockerfile now installs both versions so using the image is safe In our case we cant use official licensefinder Dockerfile but we install it manually into our docker image based on python which contains only Python Workaround The following workaround works sudo ln sf which pip usrlocalbinpip However it would be nice to do any of the following Mention the workaround or the strict requirement of pip in the readme for now until the issue is solved Fix the issue highlighed by pdelagrave in TODO Refactor PackageManagerinstalled to pass in the options Hardcode the check not for pip but for pip this way it will not fail for neither pip nor pip Change the default python version to as Python is EOL in a month mentioning this in the readme of course Best I attempted to use licensefinder against the python based Bandit project It seems licensefinder doesnt handle conditional dependencies such as colorama platformsystemWindows BSD License clause Im running on a macOS platform which pip will effectively ignore that requirement of colorama because Im not on Windows Seems licensefinder should do the same brownea bandit browne usrlocallibrubygems binlicensefinder LicenseFinderPip is active
