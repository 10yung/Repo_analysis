Hi would you mind adding keyword shortcut support for options I seem to be having some problems to run it It wont render the buttons on the options This might be related to me using Jupyter lab instead of regular notebooks Im running Jupiter lab Python img width altScreen Shot at src The nonlocal keyword is only available in Python For this reason its usage has been replaced with referring to entries of a dictionary defined in the outer scope Adds a back button in case you misslabel something and displays the currently selected label in blue instead of gray Hello there I was wondering can images be tagged for more than one option in a hierarchical fashion Does it do bounding boxes
