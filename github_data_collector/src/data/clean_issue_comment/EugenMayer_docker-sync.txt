Hi I cannot build dockersync with ubuntu instruction on arch Is there a guide somewhere that I can look up as with ubuntu instructions I am getting the following error File tmpunison srcsystemml line Error The implementation tmpunison srcsystemml does not match the interface systemcmi Values do not match val link followbool string string unit is not included in val link fspath fspath unit File tmpunison srcsystemsystemintfml line characters Expected declaration File tmpunison srcsystemsystemgenericml line characters Actual declaration make MakefileOCaml systemcmx Error make Makefile text Error OS Arch Linux Error When docker sync is started in the background which is default since e c af f c ee rsync logs by deault to dockersyncdaemonlog in the local directory enabled in d e b babcfed af c cd If the local directory or file is synced this information is logged to that log file which causes the log file to be synced itself which causes another write to the log file and so on This ends up in a sync loop which consumes remarkable CPU resources depending on the size of the log file which is always appended This can be avoided by excluding that log file from syncing in the config file in syncexcludes but it might make sense to exclude it already by default or mention it in the default config Related and Docker Driver d m Sync strategy rsync OS OSX ErrorFeature RequestionDocs

DockerDesktop Version your dockersyncyml OS OSX VersionLinux Windows Pro Build ErrorFeature RequestionDocs Feature Request Docker Driver d m Sync strategy nativeosx your dockersyncyml yaml version Version of dockersync not dockercompose options composefilepath dockercomposeyml configdockerdockercomposeelasticsearchyml configdockerdockercomposekibanayml composedevfilepath configdockerdockercomposesyncbackendyml configdockerdockercomposesyncfrontendyml Our project uses composefilepath as a way for developers to optionally enable dockercompose configs In this above example the developer has opted not to run kibana This works well for that purpose The problem is that dockercompose is now hampered as it cannot interact with the elasticsearch container Running dockercompose ps will not show the elasticsearch container as its not contained in the default dockercomposeyml The workaround is to manually specify all compose files currently enabled eg dockercompose f dockercomposeyml f configdockerdockercomposeelasticsearchyml ps This gets tedious and defeats the simplicity of using composefilepath Possible solutions Wrap dockersyncstack as an indirect interface to dockercompose Running dockersyncstack ps would be expanded to dockercompose with all f files specified in composefilepath A simpler option would be offer a dockersyncstack CLI option to print out all composefilepath This approach would allow a bash alias to format the returned list and pass the options to dockercompose Then at least the list is programmatically driven
