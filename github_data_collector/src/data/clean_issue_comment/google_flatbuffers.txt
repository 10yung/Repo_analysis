Fixes the following Previous code assumed that the fields vector would not end in a deprecated field leading to several points where invalid code could be generated eg missing a trailing parenbracket Previous code assumed that there would be at least one nondeprecated field if there were any fields leading to invalid code generation Previous code did not handle inf or nan default constants properly Fixes No support currently or I missing something It will still be possible to read buffers with this type but the elements will be treated as FBTKEY and will be read as nullterminated string Trying to build a vector of strings as typed will throw an exception More information on Also fix another bug on strings where long strings were not properly aligned Hi there please review it thanks Version C Language Java OS CentOS There is a bug in the Java export missing vtablestart and vtablesize variable type int automatically generated by the FlatBuffers compiler do not modify package orgyottalabs import javanio import javalang import javautil import comgoogleflatbuffers SuppressWarningsunused public final class MapLastTime extends Table public static MapLastTime getRootAsMapLastTimeByteBuffer bb return getRootAsMapLastTimebb new MapLastTime public static MapLastTime getRootAsMapLastTimeByteBuffer bb MapLastTime obj bborderByteOrderLITTLEENDIAN return objassignbbgetIntbbposition bbposition bb public void initint i ByteBuffer bb bbpos i bb bb vtablestart bbpos bbgetIntbbpos vtablesize bbgetShortvtablestart The last row should be public void initint i ByteBuffer bb bbpos i bb bb int vtablestart bbpos bbgetIntbbpos int vtablesize bbgetShortvtablestart I believe its simple to fix it Hi Similar to jsonparser option in flatcc do we have a way to generate finalized buffer from protobuf data Can you please let us know inputs on this Hi I am using C interface of flatbuffers and using jsonparser option to generate json parser routines When I give my json data as input the parser is failing with many errors When I take my json data into any of the online json validators validation is successful But the jsonparser code is failing the parsing Failure For a field like below newIE ubyte we are giving the data as newIE abcdef However parser is failing saying that array is expected Failure For any enum that does not have a value the parsing is failing saying that initialization is not possible I am using the latest code of flatbuffers Can you please let us know if there are any new versions of flatcc jsonparser that fixes this Appreciate your inputs regarding this It seems the sizeprefixed root accessors arent taking into account the size prefix Im not sure if this is the right fix but Also this change adds parentheses after new object expressions for Typescript generated code ie new MyGameExampleMonster instead of new MyGameExampleMonster The main idea of flatbuffers is to get rid of temporary data structures in serialization process But what about treasure and weaps Is there a way to write data directly onebyone instead of creating this temporary arrays Im more or less close to the tip of the tree Im generating Typescript code and attempting to import the generated code into a web appllication If I generate with nofbimports I get errors along the lines of homemaxsrcfrontendgeneratedSchemageneratedts TypeScript error in homemaxsrcfrontendgeneratedSchemageneratedts Cannot find namespace flatbuffers TS export namespace orgapachearrowflatbuf export class Null bb flatbuffersByteBuffernull null bbposnumber If I skip the nofbimports option I get a bunch of code I cant seem to include perhaps because the JavaScript library is targeting NodeJS and Im targeting ES Anyone here using generated TypeScript code in a browser successfully I found this but Im getting the error above
