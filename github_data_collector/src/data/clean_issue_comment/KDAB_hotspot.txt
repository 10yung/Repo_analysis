Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe When profiling templateheavy code the symbol names are almost always clipped by the flame graph boxes It makes it difficult to identify the hotspots at a glance and one has to hover over each box to identify the function The View Prettify Symbols feature only seems to work with standard library classes Describe the solution youd like I would like a prettify feature that collapses the template parameter list of my own classes to Ideally the depth of the collapsing would be configurable Describe alternatives youve considered I checked for perf record options that could do this but couldnt find any Additional context None Mozilla reported that they store their sodbg in a compressed format ie sodbggz Apparently hotspotelfutils ignores these file during lookup It would be ideal if we would include these files and decompress them transparently as needed Your application is perfect in x arch but in embedded it has a issue to used Can you develop analytics based on perfscript Follow the steps of your document analysis to analyze the embedded perfdata most of the time hotspot didnt work And many Android app can use simpleperf to get perf script its hard to use hotspot to analysis android app Did anyone try to build hotspot on Mac The use case is to create a perf report on a remote machine and later use hotspot on Mac to have a better gui experience Ive tried and stucked with the dependencies elfutils I suppose it is It wants gcc with thread support but the one I installed using Homebrew does not support it I wonder if anyone managed to solve this problem or found a workaround Many HPC admins are moving to spack as a package manager It would be really awesome to have a spackage for hotspot and heaptrack couldnt find an issue tracker Id like to be able to right click on a function and have something that says open editor That should do a shell and execute a command which passes the file name of the function to an editor command For bonus points make the editor configurable with some kind of format string that allows me to insert the line number of the function For example I want to be able to run codelite filename l linenumber so that it switches to my IDE opens the file and jumps to the right function thanks Describe the bug apparently the appimage breaks on systems that dont ship with Qt or higher To Reproduce try to run the appimage on an older ubuntu lts to check Expected behavior it should work I need to debug power consumption issues on armv device with Yocto Linux It looks like Hotspot is perfect tool for the job except that I cannot find any way to recordpresent battery voltage orand discharge rate currentnow Is it possible to record battery voltage or current as presented in battery syfs directory and then display it on a timechart graph show a warning on the summary page when we encounter accurate samples these can have broken backtraces see when dwarf unwinding overflows the stack copy we should try to stitch the backtrace to a previous morecomplete stack
