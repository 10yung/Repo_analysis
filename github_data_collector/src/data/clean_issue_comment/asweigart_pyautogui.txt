This PR has code for making Windows generate numpad button presses This would have to be specified in a different way from the regular pyautoguipress function calls An interesting idea The locateOnScreen function takes a region argument where you can have the function search just a subregion of the screen instead of the entire screen Itd be nice if there was a simple way to search say just the tophalf or the left half of the screen without having to calculate the region coordinates yourself This idea comes from when I import pywinauto it always shows error Please help me Thanks in advance Capture Pre On a Belgian AZERTY keyboard keys like are nonshift keys Problem In import pyautogui In pyautoguiwrite In would be the result with a shift key pressed Expected in Cause initpys isShiftCharacter checks if the characters are in a hardcoded string return characterisupper or character in Solution Starting from the original keys I havent checked keys that arent in the string this would be a better set of Shiftenabled keys for Belgian AZERTY Allthough it would be cleaner if we could somehow test the current keyboard layout and set the string of shiftcharacters that way The screenshot docs contain the phrase The arguments can either be a Can be a what Im using locateOnScreen function in while loop to verify for the presence of image When image is not present this function is taking seconds Need a way to optimize this as Im trying to use this to calculate time taken to load particular page A single module can run by filling in the relative path but The whole project will report an error pyautoguilocateCenterOnScreenrtemplate RunMorepng grayscaleTrue OSError Failed to read template RunMorepng because file is missing has improper permissions or is an unsupported or invalid format You need to change the image to an absolute path pyautoguilocateCenterOnScreenrC Users CT Desktop Test template RunMorepng grayscaleTrue I am using python and pyautogui version It is working fine everywhere else but when I have a IE browser open it locates images successfully and I am able to print the locations to set it but then I use the click function it does nothing But then doesnt treat it as an error I have tested without using images to click for example a random location on the screen like so pyautoguiclick and it does nothing but when I minimise the browser and run the program I see that it performs the click I am not sure what is going on There is a bug when using the click method which results in clicking times By looking at the code base there is a condition which calls the multiclick function Bellow is the implementation of multiclick function
