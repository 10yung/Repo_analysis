Xcode introduces a new extension system which enables developers to finally be able to build and distribute Xcode extensions The drawback is that at the present time this breaks the system weve had in place until now meaning XCActionBar along with all other plugins will stop working Given how sparse the documentation is it isnt clear whether most of XCActionBars functionally can be ported over to the new system I suspect it is not at least not just yet In the meantime while not pretty there is a workaround which will allow Xcode to still load all your plugins Please see alcatrazAlcatraz for more information Trim Trailing Whitespace is removing all blank lines rather than just trailing whitespace characters Im using Xcode Like in appcode you press the keys and xcode goes from className to classNameSpec or classNameTests I will be glad to do it myself but do not know how to start this one Preconditions is installed alongside with XCActionBar Steps to reproduce Activate XCActionBar Make search for Podfile Select CreateEdit Podfile item which actually is submenu under Product CocoaPods Expected corresponding menu action is performed Podfile is opened if exists Actual Xcode crashes see Problem Report attached From the documentation Use the NSWindow makeFirstResponder method not this method to make an object the first responder Never invoke this method directly I dont think this method call was ever needed as in the XCActionBarWindowControllers windowDidBecomeKey method correctly calls selfwindow makeFirstResponderselfsearchField anyway NSCopying class types that also have a mutable subclass variant for example NSString NSArray should always be specified as copy This helps avoid situations where the value of a property could change without the setter being invoked ie the object gets mutated Hi Im using plugin that add vim motion to xcode But with this plugin action view appear but coursor not focused in the actionBar view Nor automatically nor by mouse Im not sure is it problem XCActionBar or Xvim So I will add similar issue to Xvim project also rotatinglight Please dont merge yet rotatinglight As per the discussion in this is a quick refresh of the UI Screen shot of UI changes This PR is a WIP so feedback is appreciated Its also missing some spacing separators icons and font treatments Using the Add breakpoint command when current line is activated does remove the breakpoint so possibly the action can just be renamed Example the builtin snippet ObjectiveC init Method would be really nice if I could just enter init and match that action
