The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

repo from the Security Alerts page details React has moved the mixins content to this link instead Should we update it to the new one instead I didnt see a mention of Flux Utils which seems like one of the least boilerplate implementations of Flux and provided by facebook You allude to this kind of solution in Using a helper but dismiss it because may decide to switch to another Flux provider That rationale is quite bizarre I think of applications will not be and should not be switching Flux providers Would like to hear your opinion on using FluxUtils ReduceStore with Containers Use StringfromCharCode for special characters bad divJohn Doediv nope divJohn middot Doediv good divJohn StringfromCharCode Doediv better divJohn StringfromCharCode Doediv Unicode i dataiconStringfromCharCode xf f or if you have it as a string for some reason i dataiconStringfromCharCodeparseIntf f Ive created a gist that shows how DI could be solved for cases using only React features Do you think this could be also a valid approach This wont work with isomorphic apps as youll have to initialize getAppLocale while bootstrapping the app either on server eg in express Apps reqlocale as on client using windownavigator
