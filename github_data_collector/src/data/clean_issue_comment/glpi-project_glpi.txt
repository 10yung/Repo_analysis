practical than previous version For example in GLPI The same in GLPI The check box the pen icon to edit the task in different lines separated and it was far easier to have those icons on the same line Describe the bug A ticket is deleted who was linked in a item of the knowbase and it appears in the item as and is unable to delete Pages URL myIPglpifrontknowbaseitemformphpidmyidoftheknowbaseitem To reproduce I think the ticket was deleted OR the ticket was fusionned with another To delete it I updated by SQL UPDATE glpiknowbaseitemsitems SET itemsid AValidTicket WHERE glpiknowbaseitemsitemsid myidoftheknowbaseitem It should be possible to delete this inconsistency or have automatic deletion of this record when deletingfusionning ticket Screenshots Debug is Your GLPI setup you can find it in Setup General menu System tab GLPI Sometimes its necessary to just have the day without the time in the notification Its my own tag but perhaps something like taskbeginnotime would be better Q A
