before submitting Performance issue x Feature request x Documentation issue or request Other Please describe codepre Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above Please add documentationfeatures to allow for Dynamic entities to work for NONMUSIC slots and thus catalogs It seems that Amazon has not provided the info andor capabilities for this to work after lots of investigation the issue is that Dynamic entities requires you to first create a catalog for the target slot Docs state To use dynamic entities ensure that your skill has a static catalog with defined slot types and slot names Then when you actually try to create a catalog you must choose a type from the following list AMAZONMusicAlbum AMAZONMusicGroup AMAZONGenre AMAZONMusicPlaylist AMAZONMusicRecording AMAZONBroadcastChannel If your slot is not music related youre out of luck So maybe you think you can just pick an arbitrary type and go from there but then you find that they have restrictions on what the catagory entities can look like which of course will all be music specific This Dynamic entities feature is such a common use case that I cannot believe how poorly documented and difficult it is My app contains a simple dynamic list of items for each of my users They can edit that list Then I want alexa to ask them to pick one of the items on their list So of course the slot value listitem expects them to say one of those items and then match it to the correctclosest one So I should be able to respond with a dynamic entitly list of their current list Unfortuneatly this simple and common task has proven to be nearly impossible Id appreciate any guidance and I hope Amazon publishes MUCH clearer documentation for the steps of how to achieve this

escaping rich text for constructing strings to pass into AlexaRichTextContentHelperwithPrimaryText Expected Behavior Something like escapeRichTexta b which would return a amp b It would implement the

nonlaunch intent Expected Behavior If youre describing a bug tell us what should happen If youre suggesting a changeimprovement tell us how it should work What I really want is User Alexa ask Board Game Bot to teach me Catan Alexa Catan is played by Where the game type eg Catan can use entity resolution and be resolved against a list that is loaded at runtime eg to resolve to Settles of Catan

tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior Include full errors uncaught exceptions stack traces and relevant logs If service responses are relevant please include any If suggesting a changeimprovement explain the difference from current behavior The only way I have seen to get the dynamic entities loaded in is from the following interaction User Alexa open Board Game Bot Alexa Welcome To learn the rules of a game say teach me the rules of any game User Teach me the rules of Chess Alexa Chess is played by Where saying open Board Game Bot triggers the launch intent that updates the game type entities Possible Solution Not required but suggest a fixreason for the bug or ideas how to implement the addition or change For the ideal use case Id want an interaction similar to what IFTTT uses where I can provide an endpoint to return a list of options at runtime specific to a user For the good enough use case Perhaps load in the entities when the dialogState STARTED then use addDelegateDirectivecurrentIntent to transition to the next dialog phase Steps to Reproduce for bugs Provide a selfcontained concise snippet of code For more complex issues provide a repo with the

CLI works very fine with CodeCommit Repositorys eg ask new url Would be very fine if someone could fix this issue Kind Regards Stefan
