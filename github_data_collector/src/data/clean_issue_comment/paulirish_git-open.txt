Docs say Visual Studio Team Services are supported but since thats not an available product anymore thats no longer really accurate I never used VSTS and maybe the MSprovided URL redirection is still working for repos cloned with a visualstudiocom URL The Azure DevOps URLs will definitely need some special handling see below If an incorrect URL is opened please provide the following so we can write a test Example clone url https ssh gitsshdevazurecomv thomastaylor friendswithboatsfriendswithboats Example branch name testing Expected web URL For base git repo For a branch The path and a params are optional I included them as theyre inserted when navigating to a branch in the Azure DevOps web interface but works fine similar to how VSTSTFS are currently handled For an issue issue Maybe this would work currently if the remote is set for https but SSH remote definitely doesnt work I tried to get it sorted with git config global open devazurecom but the v in the SSH url and the lack of a git token kept that from working Hello First thank for your work This utility command is really useful and is exactly what I was thinking about I want to suggest to open the master branch if the current branch doesnt have a connected remote branch For example I am doing some stuff on the BRANCH branch which doesnt have remote upstream So if I type git open master branch will open instead of error in the browser because the current branch doesnt exist in the remote repo Bumps lodash from to details summaryCommitssummary ddfd b Bump to v b fce Rebuild lodash and docs be d Bump to v a fe

commit instead of the current commit Coauthoredby Jayashree jayashreekammugmailcom We are using your tool for a long period of time We are interested to contribute to the tool While we are going through the code we think we found an unused code exec devnull we are redirecting the outstream and errstream to null but we are not printing anything after this line So we think we can remove this line What do you think I tried this on WSL and was pleasantly surprised to find it works I was expecting it to fail complaining about being unable to open Chrome or make a GUI call However it seems to change the console to use Raster fonts any ideas on what might be doing this If an incorrect URL is opened please provide the following so we can write a test Example clone url Example branch name Expected web URL The documentation claims that single letter flags c i and p should work but on my GNU bash version release x appledarwin they do not because they do not seem to be implemented I have only tested this branch on this one machine but the change seems fairly clear Omit remoterepo if we just have one remote repo git open remoterepo branchname Add a flag to open CICD tool URL git open cx Based on the contents of the repo we could identify the CI URLs However there are a lot of limitations For travis circleci etc we could identify the URL easily but for selfhosted CICD tools like GoCD Jenkins it will be difficult Adding this idea here so that someone could come up with a better way to do it Let me know if this feature makes sense
