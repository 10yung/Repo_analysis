behavior After updating the iron will go to a v only mode after or power cycles when using the DNOX QC adapter supplied from Bangood in the TS More kit Problem does not appear to be something being set in the iron as it does not affect my AILAVI QC boost module which has normal v operation after updating What is the expected behavior The iron will use v with this adapter as before the update If the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem Steps to reproduce Update to v Bring iron to temp using DNOX adapter Unplug repeat step I found that plugging the iron into a standard v A supply and back into the DNOX will also trigger this v only mode Video of problem if hard to reproduce What is the motivation use case for changing the behavior Maintain compatibility with the supplied adapter What are you running On the idle screen you can hold the settings button and it will show you the firmware version Firmware

PNG files over JPG Sorry I lost the template by accidentally clearing it And GitHub is being really nice and saving my blank draft for me so I cant restore it This is a sort of mix of a bug report in that it doesnt limit and feature request in that I think it should I got a little too enthusiastic upon reading the description for this latest firmware and downloaded and flashed too quickly without paying attention In so doing I accidentally flashed a TS firmware onto my TS Luckily this is not a fatal thing but since the display comes on and shows stuff it almost seems like it worked ok which could potentially confuse the issue in diagnosing it Some sort of super simple checking mechanism either in the flash itself or on startup maybe a configuration option that says is TS or is TS producing an error if the wrong one is set producing an error onscreen and not attempting to continue incorrectly It seems distinctly possible that using the wrong firmware might if not now then perhaps later potentially be able to damage the device Perhaps especially if going the other way around is also possible Obviously this is user error and not high priority but perhaps something to consider at least Please edit this template and fill out all the information you can where relevant Failure to provide essential information can delay the response you receive Im submitting a x Bug

temp and if programmed to F it displays F temperature appears correctly when display is in Celsius What is the expected behavior Display the correct temperature If the current behavior is a bug please

device method I tried it with the original firmware and this On Windows I get no storage device in DFU mode just only in normal mode where you can change the config On my Mac I see the storage device and I can copy the firmware but it just renames the file with a ERR My DFU version is and my current firmware is the the stock Are there any other ways to get this firmware in this device I got a STM Discovery and AFAIK it has a STM Link can i flash it directly with this If yes how A problem I stumbled upon I had trouble updating my TS I always got a ERR file Reason was I am using Copy Handler Copying the file with normal windows copy worked the iron updated and I got a RDY file Perhaps you want to edit that in Readme install notes Please edit this template and fill out all the information

if possible a minimal demo of the problem Steps to reproduce load firmware v on TS set idle screen to detailed view idle screen Video of problem if hard to reproduce What is the motivation use case for changing the behavior When the voltage ends in anything other than a zero eg it shows the decimal digit but when the voltage is a whole number it ends with the decimal point and no trailing zero

working without problems but since the latest and the firmware before that it will not switch to V but stay at V and also it will be switched off after some seconds of idle Also the following zero will not be shown on the volt display but the dot And if you dont have the tip inserted there is no error message but a temp of shown What are you running On the idle screen you can hold the settings

is the current behavior Currently a value will roll over with no indication eg the Boost temperature will go requiring the user to memorize the max and scroll though all of the values again The Pressandhold functionality will also just breeze past this max at full speed What is the expected behavior It would be helpful to mark the highest value before it rolls over Again with the Boost going That way the user will immediately know This is the highest value it cant go higher than this and doesnt have to scroll through them again Bolding italicizing inverting the colours adding brackets something that is possible to implement while clearly indicating a difference Additionally the Pressandhold should stop at the maximum value Another possibility is to pause for a second then roll over pause on the lowest value for a second then continue
