Just tried to convert an mp file and the resulting gif made two loops I dont see a setting for number of loops but it loops twice I tried Drop To Gif today to create gifs out of a few movs that are about mb each I drop one gif on top and nothing happens The mov starts playing in the window but a gif is never outputted I tried looking in Consoleapp for any obvious errors and I see a lot of logging but nothing so useful img width altScreen Shot at src On macOS Mojave the app seems to disassociate objects of kind Folder with their preview icon Though they will have a preview icon folders will have just a thumbnail of a blank page The slider for max dimensions is too limiting it would be great to be able to have a larger range I made a screen recording resolution but when Drop To Gif turns it into a px GIF the bottom line is gray Argh I have used this to simply convert my mb mp to gif but cant get an export then dropped the video over and over into the app and my disk space increased like crazy Then I removed the app with CleanMyMac Now I downloaded it again and when I tried to open it it says can t be found what should I do Please add a license so that more people will be able to consume youre project Preferably MIT Im seeing an issue where processes are not not ended after each conversion Anyone else experiencing this When I try to make a gif out of a video file mov Drop to GIF crashes Im using the most uptodate version running macOS Sierra giphy Just installed the latest version I do not see the animations as seen in the demo GIFs When I drag a video file into the application I get a system toast that says Animating then it continues to loop the video indefinitely After setting the watch folder and dragging videos into it nothing happens Am I missing something Or some kind of permissions
