In v When I run scriptplay the music script successfully runs but something happens during the web script however I am able to run scriptweb start manually and it works below is the SEGFAULT error I am receiving playvendorgemsruby gemskgio libkgioextbundle BUG Segmentation fault ruby p revision x darwin Stacktrace shit scriptweb line Abort trap bundle exec unicorn D c configunicornrb Let me know if the rest of the stacktrace might be of use it is really long and I didnt want to bore anyone This adds in the ability to queue SoundCloud URLs SoundCloud support was added to MPD sometime at or around x along with a lot of other goodies For that reason Im pulling out the Holman Gist and properly brew installing the official formula There are a few quirks to queuing that I think are attributed to the underlying rubympd library And of course additional quirks because most of this code assumes an actual file path Rather than use TagLib well call out to the SoundCloud API to fetch information I could add a couple of new database tables to minimize the calls to support this I guess I dont know whos interested in the ping holman thedaniel maddox dreww seem like good candidates Happy to talk offline for the rationale etc Ive noticed that org members that were not publicizing their membership were SOL They get this error You dont seem to be in correct GitHub Organization The problem goes away once they hit Publicize membership button for themselves on the org members page So thats the good news we have the workaround I believe that a more appropriate way to check membership is GET orgsorgmembersuser as described in Organization Members API Then youd display the day the music stopped error if response status is other than I am running Play off v branch FYI Maybe mention the MYSQLPASSWORD bit in the readme If you run through once then add it the blank password has already been written to the playyml file This is v Perhaps we could barf a little more output when installing things via brew I thought something had frozen on the bootstrap so thinking maybe we could resurface these lines in the brew output to show progress Installing mpd dependency ffmpeg Installing mpd Meow Caveat Im treading in deep waters given my rudimentary Ruby knowledge so forgive me if this goes astray Also this error is in the context of the Cocoa client but I believe the issue may lie in the play app so bear with me Ive set up the v channels branch and am trying to use the downloaded Cocoa client Upon clicking the Get Your Play Token button my browser opens navigates to the Play app does the oauth dance with Github and Im taken back to a page that tells me Im not in the organization I am the owner of the organization listed in my playyml so theres some issue there Thats problem If I repeat this process when the browser navigates to Im presented with a This page does not exist error Thats problem Apparently my user is still created because I can revisit the Play app and I have a user account When I look at the settings for that account there is a generated auth token However attempting to use this token makes the Cocoa client shake angrily Now this could be a problem with the client and not the Play app itself but I wanted to tell the whole story Im willing to take a shot at fixing this but need some pointers as to where to begin to tackle it Just ran across this after updating homebrew and trying to install mpd Caveats As of mpd this formula no longer enables support for streaming output by default If you want streaming output you must now specify the withlibshout withlame withtwolame andor withflac options explicitly Use withlibshout withlame withflac for the pre behavior As of mpd this formula has renamed options as follows lastfm withlastfm libwrap withlibwrap unsupported in OSX enablesoundcloud withyajl Removes leftover parts of the old PlayQueue Fixes this and that and minor changes cool
