 Whats this PR for Just a link to an issue is fine Fix for zulip What this PR does In invite users screen added with the stream names to match how we display them elsewhere Sort the stream names in invite users screen Listed notifications stream along with other streams with a message recieves notifications for new streams instead of adding the invited user unconditionally Fixes Testing Plan Unit tests Screenshot Screenshot from Previous discussion can be found here at this topic Whats this PR for Just a link to an issue is fine Testing Plan How have you tested tested with managepy shell and toolstestall x Extend the MutedTopic model to record when the topic got muted Record when a Stream got muted Also be sure to make clear coherent commits Related issue Tim I stacked this on top of the three commits you had me review yesterday The goal here is to eventually kill off some of the crazy redraw logic similar to what Im doing with the PM list code but these simplifications should be helpful regardless Moves the login process for desktop app to browser since there was no way to verify the authencity of the auth process for a custom server and to prevent phishing attacks Desktop app PR here Testing Plan How have you tested Still working on it This is currently only to collaborate with others See for the context of this issue After working with the integration for a while I think it is missing two things Links in the webhook messages The most important one is that we need to add links to the actual taiga user story task etc in the message that is posted on zulip For example Kevin Grandemange closed user story December SDR In linux magazine should become Kevin Grandemange closed user story December SDR In linux magazine exampleorg Topics Another thing missing is the use of topics to separate unrelated user stories issues tasks Here I think there are different way to separate the topics We could have a topic per project in a Scrum Project we could also have a topic per sprint in the project Hello Everybody im trying to configure my AWX instance to send a message when a playbook start I follow this guide But every time that i launch a new Job i receive this error in my mailbox Traceback most recent call last File srvzulipvenvcache c f d b be d adebaa f c da zulippy venvlibpython sitepackagesdjangocorehandlersbasepy line in getresponse response wrappedcallbackrequest callbackargs callbackkwargs File srvzulipvenvcache c f d b be d adebaa f c da zulippy venvlibpython sitepackagesdjangoviewsdecoratorscsrfpy line in wrappedview return viewfuncargs kwargs File zerverlibrequestpy line in wrappedviewfunc return viewfuncrequest args kwargs File zerverdecoratorpy line in wrappedfuncarguments raise err File zerverdecoratorpy line in wrappedfuncarguments return viewfuncrequest userprofile args kwargs File zerverlibrequestpy line in wrappedviewfunc return viewfuncrequest args kwargs File zerverwebhooksansibletowerviewpy line in apiansibletowerwebhook body getbodypayload File zerverwebhooksansibletowerviewpy line in getbody if payload friendlyname Job KeyError friendlyname I have the latest release Can you help me Thanks Following the series ending with c d daff e ffcea d e f its clear to me that we could do better in structuring our discussion of how to use the development environment In particular I think the section of our Vagrant docs starting here should probably be merged into to provide a more coherent organization for our docs on how to use the development environment Some care may be required to avoid mangling the pieces specifically about Vagrant which probably shouldnt move but the parts about running provision and maintaining the environment definitely belong on the page about editrefresh workflows drrosa FYI Fixes issue This PR is in continuation with PR First commit is reviewed there
