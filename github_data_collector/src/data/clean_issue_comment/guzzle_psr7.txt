I noticed this function was added recently ish but was never documented like the other functions Left all the functions in like for my Guzzle PR but just made sure that the core code doesnt actually use tem Reported on It checks whether the field name contains space in the beginning or end and throws an exception when found There is no need to check the value as the class already normalizes it Q A Bug yes New Feature no Version Steps to reproduce Create a new Request object with a relative URL request new Requestget users Convert the object into its string representation rep strrequest Convert the string back to the object using parserequest restored parserequestrep Actual Behavior An Invalid request string error thrown apparently because of the pregmatch check in parserequest php if pregmatch S s azAZ data startline matches throw new InvalidArgumentExceptionInvalid request string Expected Behavior The parserequest parses and returns the request object successfully Hi all The PSR specification see PR as well as the RFC define a comma not comma with whitespace as separator We should probably update the following method Fixes TODO TestCoverage Headers that cannot carry multiple values need to be output as separate lines most annoying example is SetCookie so if the Response carries multiple values for it str will incorrectly add them comma separated to one SetCookie header Solution would be to check for such known bad headers and output them as separate lines Reopening to the right branch A proposal to use league uri package instead of the current Uri implementation My main goal for this is to get rid of PHPs parseurl issues with internationalized domain names see and guzzleguzzle Its a BC break but has not been released yet so IMO its good chance for a change like this
