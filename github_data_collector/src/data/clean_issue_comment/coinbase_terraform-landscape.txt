A number of issues boil down to the desire to implement customizations around how the resource diff is presented Linked are some issues below which were folding into this one master issue to track Its important that we not insert any of the logic in the default code path as there are some situations where certain formatting functionality may not be desired It would be ideal to have this be customizable on a perresource type basis This would likely mean the introduction of a configuration file of some sort and an ability to import custom formatters without needing to contribute to this project directly This ticket is open for anyone to take just wanted to consolidate open issues into one trackable place cmd terraform plan landscape cmd here it expects variable names but its stuck i guess the workaround is using var flags but thats a bit inconvenient The latest released version doesnt seem to work well with Terraform x Would be great to use that feature also to parse apply output into nice format Im using Atlantis to put my plans in GH PRs and it would be great if landscape could better support the diff language format Just a flag that would put the operators always at the start of the line Current diff Switched to workspace test awsecsservicewebapp taskdefinition redactedwebapp awsecstaskdefinitionwebappfamilymaxawsecstaskdefinitionwebapprevision
