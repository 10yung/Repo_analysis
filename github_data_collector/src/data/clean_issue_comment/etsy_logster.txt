 In parseline the JSON contents are parsed already inside the try statement and assigned to jsondata We can reuse the contents of the variable and voiding parsing the JSON a second time The current implementation of logsters cause logster to not to run again if the lock file exists even if a process does not hold a lock on that This approach is fine for filesystems that does not have working locking eg some NFS S FS etc For native local filesystems failing only if the lock cannot be obtained results in easier recovery from dead logsters Added Link to New Relic Insights Outpuy Can logster analyze iptables Count of certain IP port build total tables I have recently tested most of the log parsers and none of them seem to work The output just returns If any one is actively working on this project do let me know Can we add this option We do need raw data in graphite not calculated based on time duration If there is etc METRICCOUNT metricsomemetriccount value we need this value send to graphite The default format of the error log has changed from something like Thu May error to Thu May coreerror Note the new module info The ErrorLogLogster parser should be extended to understand this ie probably ignore the module and successfully extract the severity Hi there Not a bug but a feature request Would be convenient to have logger object available in parser classes for debugging purposes
