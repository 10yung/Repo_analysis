Looks like houghjosh isnt active for a few years so I created a new PR which closes This saved me from reconfiguring my windows today Keeping different status such as workstudy not only the last so that users can launch tmux and go to familiar status conveniently for example prefix Ctrls name work prefix Ctrls name study when i launch tmux if i want to go to workstudy status prefix Ctrlr name workstudy I know some complex bash scripts can do this workDoes tmuxresurrect support this now Thanks for creating and maintaining this plugin I have a Sessionvim file in a directory my tmux config file contains the line set g resurrectstrategyvim session Steps In the directory with the session file open a file using vi Actual Behaviour vi does not get called with the S flag whereas if had saved the tmuxsession with containing a vim command it does get called with the S flag Expected Behaviour vi to be resurrected with the S flag vi and vim commands get treated the same when resurrected Let me know if there is any other information you need There are clearly workarounds on my end just raising this in case it is indeed unexpected behaviour or if this is just me not understanding something properly In the past tmuxresurrect would drop me into the same window I was in at the time of saving the session For example given a layout like this I would still be on pane after attaching to the restored session Now however I am always on the first window in this case Is there a way to restore the previous behavior Could something be interfering Hi there First of all thanks for the great work tmuxresurrect has been a huge help and timesaver to me I noticed something odd which I am unsure if its supposed to be like that or if I am missing some kind of configuration to fix it In order to restore my windowspanes I start the terminal enter a new tmux session with tmux and run tmuxresurrect with ctrlb ctrlr It restores everything just fine but in the end there will always be that originally created tmuxwindow with name that I created in order to be able to restore the other windows in the first place Is there a way to have that autokilled after restoring my windowspanes The changes basically replace the use of paneindex by paneid This guarantees that the environment variable TMUXPANE is consistent across restores and allows to use it as index to get separate history files for different panes I have this on my bashrc to set the right history filename in tmux and to update it on every command HISTFILEHISTFILETMUXPANETMUXPANE xTMUXPANE x PROMPTCOMMANDPROMPTCOMMANDPROMPTCOMMAND nhistory a Main problem was restoring directory content of the very first pane but Ive included an alias for that When I found this plugin I quickly tried to enable the restoring of pane contents and went to docsrestoringpanecontentsmd Here it mentions that defaultcommand shouldnt contain or operators and you write that set g defaultcommand reattachtousernamespace l SHELL should be an acceptable alternative The problem with this is that set g defaultcommand reattachtousernamespace l SHELL can cause Tmux to crash before even starting I had that problem which means that when running tmux new it just exited immediately and the almost same problem is seen in tmux exits immediately after starting Perhaps change that recommendation or at the least write that this can cause problems After updating tmux to restoring ends up with a dead server and the following message server exited unexpectedly This is a very strange problem because it makes no sense and happens randomly eg one tmux session windows panes in windows and each panes total When I create my windows and panes everything is fine Saving also works but when I restore my session some of the panes and this happens randomly usually or but mostly different ones do not have a login session but just bash with the default prompt and none of my settings aliases PATH modifications When I kill the tmux server and restore again this could happen on other panes than it did the first time and the panes that had that issue before are fine This tells me that it is not inherently the panes fault or how bash is spawned Additional info Im using bash from Macports which is added to etcshells and Ive used chsh to switch the default shell for my user Although I have seen this behavior with the standard shell that comes with the OS as well I suspect that there is a race condition when opening a bunch of shells at the same time We either hit a lock that prevents another starting shell to read the proper profile or another side effect creeps up somewhere Has anyone seen this problem as well and is there a solution I noticed that your awesome plugin was not saving all my ssh sessions Although my use case was different than those in I added a comment there with my issue The following PR builds on what I originally posted there cheers
