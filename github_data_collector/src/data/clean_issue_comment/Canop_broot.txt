This still needs to be described In two words it should be a generalization of the fat whales hunt mode allowing other types of sort I just installed broot for the first time with cargo install broot on ubuntu linux using bash To Reproduce After invoking br I see a directory tree but navigation keys such as updown arrow and pg updown do nothing Expected behavior upon pressing down arrow or up arrow the selected line should move down or up accordingly Did not see a man page on github nor file broot in the downloaded zip file This is a draft shared for thoughts I welcome opinions of people who played enough with broot to have one Preambule I want to keep the immediate interactive search and keep allowing the current syntax pattern verbinvocation where pattern can be either fuzzy or a regex formal syntax New Goals allow colons or spaces in the pattern allowcombine other types of search in the future for example search on paths or file content instead of filenames Proposal The proposal is to introduce new compatible syntaxes searchverbseppatternsepverbinvocation where searchverb would be optional maybe not immediately implemented and would later be used to specify the way the pattern is used paths or file content for example sep would be made of special characters most of W chosen by the user so that its not in the pattern The second sep isnt necessary if theres no verbinvocation Examples of a fuzzy search for bla followed by a cp yes it didnt change its just a comparison point bla cp dest blacp dest Examples of a fuzzy search for bla followed by a cp blacp dest bla cp dest bla cp dest blacp dest nameblacp dest assuming name is the searchverb for applying patterns to file names A consequence of this syntax is that you can search for a pattern containing colons by just prefixing the pattern with two spaces and that you can search for a pattern contain spaces by just prefixing it with two colons This should fast feel natural enough Examples of a fuzzy search for bla followed by a cp bla cp dest bla cp dest bla cp dest bla cp dest namebla cp dest Note In order to make it clearer Ill probably implement syntax coloring of the input But interactive display should make it clear enough Drawbacks Search verbs and action verbs would share the same name space which implies some restrictions and could be confusing Alternatives In general it would be great of broot could detect which shellenvironment it is running and install a suitable launcher this issue in particular is for Powershell Launchers have already been suggested in other issues heres one take function br tempFile NewTemporaryFile try broot envBROOT if not broot broot broot broot outcmd tempFile args if LASTEXITCODE ne WriteError broot exited with code LASTEXITCODE return command GetContent tempFile if command broot returns extendedlength paths but not all PowerShellWindows versions might handle this so strip the InvokeExpression commandReplace finally RemoveItem force tempFile isDotSourced MyInvocationInvocationName eq or MyInvocationLine eq if not isDotSourced br args works as a script so if this gets saved as brps somewhere users can choose how they want to use it dotsource it or add path to file to the PATH or uses environment variable so users can set the path to the broot executable if broot isnt in the path for instance or when developing and switching between versions etc Defaults to broot instead of brootexe so that it automatically works on pwsh on linux as well tested on ubuntu Describe the bug When I quit broot the terminal is not cleared To Reproduce Here is my conf for enter and edit with export EDITORvim verbs invocation edit key enter shortcut e execution EDITOR file leavebroot false Launch broot open a file with enter it is opened in vim quit vim quit broot Expected behavior Broot is terminated successfully and the prompt is clean Screenshots If I dont open a file I hide all the upper part of broot If I open a file Configuration please complete the following information OS Debian bits Raspbian ARM and CentOS bits Version broot Relevant configuration items described in to reproduce Additional context Maybe my verb is not configured as it should be but I want broot to be still opened when I exit vim Describe the bug None of the shells I tried on Windows manage to produce output see screenshots below either the screen just stays blank cmd powershell or it shows a bunch of escape sequences color codes I think together with the actual filedirectory names cygwin msys shells broot is functional ie reacts to Esc etc just shows no output No such problem on Windows so its likely a known problem with how Rust talks to the terminal but adding this as an issue by means of documentation Also not sure if its worth fixing since Windows is pretty much EOL To Reproduce download broot release open cmdpowershell and run brootexe choose n when asked to install Screenshots Powershell Capture Cygwin Capture Configuration please complete the following information OS Windows Version My issue with broot is singular which is that I am trying to package up broot for use by users consuming packages from a rather obscure package manager but the users running broot will not have root access so this happens when running br br Broot should be launched using a shell function see for explanations The function is either missing old or badly installed Can I install it now Y n Y Removing homemaxnbklocalsharebrootlauncherbash Writing br shell function in homemaxnbklocalsharebrootlauncherbash Removing homemaxnbkconfigbrootlauncherbashbr Creating link from homemaxnbkconfigbrootlauncherbashbr to homemaxnbklocalsharebrootlauncherbash IO Error Permission denied os error Wrinkle I am able to predefine the br function for them and do as something that is installed alongside broot and sourced when the users enter the packagemanaged shell but broot still thinks its not installed properly presumably because the files dont exist in the correct place Is there something I can do to fix this on my end There seems to be the need for a list of recipes including some hotkey sets for example vi or emacs related some alternate openers some very special installations some skins some tricks or non obvious uses of broot etc Please share what in your opinion could be included in there Answer with either a recipe part of a recipe or a need for some specific one I notice this with I have two computers with ubuntu and terminator On one the doubleclic works on the other one there seems to be a problem computing the index Ill investigate this later In the meantime Id be interested in other user reports regarding this problem
