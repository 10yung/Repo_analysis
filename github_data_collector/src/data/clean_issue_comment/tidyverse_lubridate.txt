Im often creating intervals using an index timepoint a given duration as the respective endpoints I was wondering if it would make sense to include something like this r intwidth functionmid num units pad durationnum units intervalmid num mid num Im not all to certain about the name Maybe timepad or something When you have a length NA Period object with months or years and possibly others addition with Dates and POSIXct objects throw an error I would expect NA here r librarylubridate warnconflicts FALSE days daysNAreal days dayscNAreal months monthsNAreal months monthscNAreal years yearsNAreal years yearscNAreal x asDate y asPOSIXct UTC x days NA y days NA x days NA y days NA UTC x months Error in if allmos L missing value where TRUEFALSE needed y months Error in if allmos L missing value where TRUEFALSE needed x months NA y months NA UTC x years Error in if allmos L missing value where TRUEFALSE needed y years Error in if allmos L missing value where TRUEFALSE needed x years NA y years NA UTC supCreated on by the reprex package v sup In below example I expect to be parsed as but its parsed as r dfdataframedatec dplyrmutatedf date lubridateymddate truncated date date supCreated on by the reprex package v sup r sessionInfo R version Platform x w mingw x bit Running under Windows x build Matrix products default locale LCCOLLATEJapaneseJapan LCCTYPEJapaneseJapan LCMONETARYJapaneseJapan LCNUMERICC LCTIMEJapaneseJapan attached base packages stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base other attached packages reprex dplyr loaded via a namespace and not attached Rcpp rstudioapi knitr whisker magrittr tidyselect R rlang stringr tools xfun clipr htmltools yaml assertthat digest tibble crayon processx callr purrr ps fs glue evaluate rmarkdown stringi compiler pillar lubridate pkgconfig r librarylubridate warnconflicts F fmt Ymd HMOSz x secondfaststrptimex format fmt secondstrptimex format fmt tz UTC supCreated on by the reprex package v sup Originally reported in Functions that return NA for invalid input like or rather than raising an error and dont even print a warning feel dangerous to me I need to remember to check for NAs every time or I could create a hardtofind bug hadley Related See A nonfinite date plus eg seconds now yields an object of class Date r classasdateNA seconds Date It makes more sense if this yields an object of class POSIXct Fixes See Changing hour minute or second of date now yields POSIXlt r classasdate hours POSIXlt POSIXt POSIXct is the preferred class for datetimes though cf asdatetime Moreover POSIXlt does not allow for infinity leading to bugs like r asnumericasdatec Inf Inf asnumericasdatec Inf hours NA
