 Similar to and wondering if theres a way for before and after to return scope do nothing when the argument is nil similar to betweentimes betweentimesstarttime nil same as afterstarttime betweentimesnil endtime same as beforeendtime Current behavior is to default base and time range scopes to Timezonenow but would prefer that only apply to the time range scopes Current behavior ruby Eventafternil returns all events after the current time Desired behavior ruby Eventafternil returns all events Are there any reasons why the default scope macro wouldnt take any effect When i add the offset option to the query Im getting the right offset Postbyday offset hours But when I set it on the model level there is no offset class Post ActiveRecordBase bystarfield offset hours end
