The build works just fine on ubuntu but Im receiving this elusive rust error on sudo docker run Error Os code kind NotFound message No such file or directory This is a clean install on ubuntu instructions worked fine but the image did not start up i then ran manually and found this error The resulting internet searches for this error are not very helpful and this may be an easy fix Any ideas anyone Thanks I thought it might be helpful for newcomers for some of the packages required for building or installing this project to be enumerated Note that this is on Debian which doesnt seem to have podman in the repos so I substituted docker Also in the Makefile PWD did not seem to work so I substituted shell pwd Here are steps that build and deploy the project on current Debian install docker on Debian sudo aptget install y apttransporthttps cacertificates curl gnupg softwarepropertiescommon curl fsSL sudo aptkey add sudo aptkey fingerprint EBFCD sudo addaptrepository deb archamd lsbrelease cs stable sudo aptget update sudo aptget install y dockerce dockercecli containerdio install rust wget O rustupinit sudo sh rustupinit y install cargoweb sudo aptget install y pkgconfig libssldev sudo cargo install cargoweb build the project cd opt git clone cd webapprs sed si sPWDshell pwd Makefile sed si s CONTAINERRUNTIMECONTAINERRUNTIMEdocker Makefile modify app URL and docker conn as needed sed i s urlurl Configtoml sed i s hosthost Configtoml sed i s usernameusername webapp Configtoml sed i s passwordpassword abcd Configtoml sed i s databasedatabase webapp Configtoml make all deploy the web app sudo apt install y postgresqlclient cargo install dieselcli nodefaultfeatures features postgres sudo make deploy make runapp docker ps a Also note that the build should be done on a local filesystem so that it can be mapped as a volume in a container Id be glad to help put this in a project wiki page if needed When running make deploy I get the following error Status Downloaded newer image for ekiddrustmuslbuilderlatest Updating registry Updating git repository Updating git repository error failed to open homerustsrctargetreleasecargolock Caused by Permission denied os error make deploy Error My docker version is Version cemac Id imagine theres not much other helpful info I can give about my machine since it looks like this is an error inside the docker container but let me know if you need anything else Im running into an error trying to deploy this app on Windows C Users allen Projects webapprsmake deploy Compiling webapp v fileCUsersallenProjectswebapprs Finished release optimized targets in s Garbage collecting appwasm Processing appwasm Finished processing of appwasm The app was deployed to C Users allen Projects webapprs target deploy error could not find Cargotoml in homerustsrc or any parent directory make deploy Error C Users allen Projects webapprs Though while Im making this issue I can provide some extra notes on what I needed to get closer to building the app Make for Windows sed this came with Git Bash I believe Additional SDKs provided by Visual Studio specifically the Windows SDK and Universal CRT SDK to compile sassrs I understand that this might not be a big priority since Windows is somewhat of a secondclass citizen for webdev stuff but I think it would be really cool to see this work there too Thanks for making this by the way
