 What is the feature Add support for bar graphs which are similar to histograms but slightly different Examples for bar graphs image from or Optional Why this feature is useful and how people would use the feature Its similar to histograms but is more focused on categories and doesnt only work for continous data Motivation Since we got a bunch of backends now and some backend such as cairo piston etc actually actually have a dependency to thirdparty crates which might be frequently update This increase the maintain burden we need to keep each depdency such as cairo uptodated on cratesio otherwise it may cause some issue with the people who use the crate Especially for cairo since mostly people will import gtk and cairo directly from their code But the core code isnt required so many update so its better to make them sperate What to do We should relocate the code such as cairo backend and piston backend to separate crate and make this repo a workplace Refactor all the blockers FontTransform should be moved to text style FontDescboxsize should be removed since its broken with current anchor system Add trait BackendFont as the abstracted font impl thus backend is not relies on actual font implementation Decouple drawingbackend and make it a standalone crate RGBAColor TextStyle FontTransform FontStyle Default rasterizer drawingbackend Update the core crate to use the standalone plottersbackend crate Move PistionBackend and CairoBackend to its own crate Depdends on plottersbackend crate This is considered a breaking change and should ship with What is the feature Add methods to plotterschartMeshStyle for configuring the grid spacing Optional Why this feature is useful and how people would use the feature Basically itd be useful for making grids for timestamps controlling the bold grid for days and light grid for hours or bold grid for hours and light grid for minutes log scales being able to draw irregularly spaced bold and light grids Optional Additional Information Maybe a low level API that takes a function or iterator that controls the grid spacing is a good start I think because of this this isnt possible today but I suspect more places would need changing What is the feature Use of slice as a discrete coordinate We can do rust buildranged foo bar baz What is the feature Nested coordinate which means its a discrete coordinate but for each value it attached another nested coordinate system on that Optional Why this feature is useful and how people would use the feature While I make the PR for criterion this idea comes out Check out the following example for details Each of the tick mark has a nested coordinate system ranged from to Optional Additional Information Blockers This would be blocked by this issue Unless we have a reasonable abstraction on discrete coordinate this is tricky to accomplish What is the feature Now we just demonstrated its possible draw plots on console without actually changing the API in this example But it seems we still needs to tweak something and make it a builtin backend Why do you need the feature Plotting in console may be very interesting for someone who use SSH which doesnt have a easy to access the image What is the use case See above What is the feature Currently AreaSeries colors the area from PathLineSeries to baseline This is done with Polygon It would be nice to have two different colors for areas above and below Why do you need the feature This makes some graphs much nicer to read What is the use case Market microstructure visualization Screenshot from Additional Information Color buy volume GREENmix and sell volume REDmix We need some default global setting such as default styles for different things etc Hi what do you think about making the log base a parameter Cheers Andy I noticed that in some cases when chart is pretty small lets say secondary coord with relative height of main area height there is situation when no labels are showing up even if there is range of only and we have only and more different values When we have only value its showing correctly if more nothing ylabels
