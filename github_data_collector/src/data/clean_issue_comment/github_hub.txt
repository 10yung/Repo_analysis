The problem Im trying to solve describe the problem that you think hub might help you with Im constantly creating repos in my organization and really hate having to type out the entire repo name especially when they get fairly verbose I would really like to do something like pwd UsersmethisreallyreallylongreponamethatIdontwanttotype git create p org WPMedia How I imagine hub could expose this functionality eg hub mynewcommand someflags Unfortunately o is taken up for browse so well have to go with org instead It would be great if you could just change browse to b though although I understand that breaks backward compat Command attempted hub is aliased to git and used as git Not shown here for simplicity hub version buildoptions What happened hub shows its own version and gits version but does not pass buildoptions through hub version buildoptions git version hub version What is supposed to happen Git is supposed to show some useful debugging information git version buildoptions git version cpu x no commit associated with this build sizeoflong sizeofsizet Im trying to create a new repo in my organization where Im not the admin When I try hub create ORGNAMEREPONAME post initialization I get a message Error creating repository Forbidden HTTP You need admin access to the organization before adding a repository to it I have confirmed that I can create repos via the browser and I have two factor authentication The problem Im trying to solve hub release delete command expects a tag to delete a release However if a tag was deleted prior with a command like tag d tagname you will end up having untagged releases and I didnt figure out a way to list them or delete them through the hub command So to replicate you can do hub release create m test release testTag git tag d testTag git push origin refstagstestTag Now if you go on github you will see a draft release and if you click on it the link will be For a moment I hoped that i could use that untaggedd afdda f d ff as a tag but it didnt eat it How I imagine hub could expose this functionality I quickly peeked that the github api is using the releaseid instead of the tag to access a release not sure how hub is dealing with it but if it would do something similar that would be great The problem Im trying to solve Installing hub on an Ubuntu based Docker image is impossible since it is based on Snap Snap requires to run a local daemon snapd which is completely against the principles of Docker How I imagine hub could expose this functionality Just submit the Hub Debian package to Ubuntu andor provide a Debian package repository for Hub to enable installation via the classical aptget or similar tool This PR adds the ability to edit existing issues using the same interface as hub issue create There is a little duplication between creating and editing issues that could be removed Im not convinced that removing the duplication would increase clarity and readability The problem Im trying to solve describe the problem that you think hub might help you with Use SSO auth with hub bb command How I imagine hub could expose this functionality eg hub mynewcommand someflags We can use personal access tokens as a workaround there as well as we did with GH This is similar to but I wanted to know if we can support auth with BB for environments with SSO configured Thank you The problem Im trying to solve describe the problem that you think hub might help you with Ive started to use hub pr list to build a commandline dashboard Its great so far and now I want more Specifically itd be nice to know if the PR is Approved or if there are Changes requested It would also be nice to know the CI status but thats covered by How I imagine hub could expose this functionality eg hub mynewcommand someflags Im imagining another format string maybe R which resolves to Approved or Changes requested If anyones curious heres my command which shows title submitter
