I am working on this program recent days and I want to do some research on the graph slam When I add a robot and also add a sonser on it then I try to run slamtbgraphm it comes out a error which said In solveGraphQR line In solveGraph line In slamtbgraph line Warning The matrix is singularly working with precision Wrong use atan The input must be a real number Error q au line a atan ns Error q v line auAqUq q auq Error qpose vpose line v Vq q vqp Error computeError line Facerrz Zpq qpose vposepq Error computeResidual line Facfac e W computeErrorRobrobSensenLmklmkObssenlmkFrmframesFacfac Error solveGraphQR line res errmax computeResidualRobSenLmkObsFrmFac Error solveGraph line RobSenLmkObsFrmFac solveGraphQRRobSenLmkObsFrmFacOptsolver Error slamtbgraph line RobSenLmkObsFrmFac solveGraphRobSenLmkObsFrmFacOpt I want to know why this happenedThank you when I Run the main script slamtb some error occured in createLandmarksm line Lmklmkstatedsize OptmaplmkDSize but in userDatam line Optmap has no lmkDSize so is there a minor mistake thanks change pitch by this e atan R sqrtR R R R indices are not
