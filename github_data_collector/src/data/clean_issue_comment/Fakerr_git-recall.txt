Instead of getting help I get this message git recall help No manual entry for gitrecall See man undocumented for help when manual pages are not available git recall h and gitrecall help works though gitrecall git version on Ubuntu LTS change the coding style use spaces to indent and remove the end of the line blank add homegg endG key maps it might be a good idea to keep the standard gitlog bahavior and just pass arguments to git log instead of limiting the functionality and setting nonstandard default values like its done for d and a I can see the need for abbrevcommit and prettyformatGITFORMAT but otherwise it would be nice to make it behave like gitlog does with its git log options revision range path scheme If you insist on keeping the default behavior as it is right now it would at least be nice to be able to pass arguments to git log I think it would simplify the program a lot maybe you love this one and use that in this project Added an option llocal to show only commits that are ahead of originbranch For this I introduced the function setlogcommand to select a different command template as it makes little sense to filter author and date in combination with local at least by default The command is expected to show ALL commits ahead of the remote branch One thing I dont like is the error handling for the git log command COMMITSeval GITLOG devnull when using the local option and the branch originbranch does not exist yet as is the case if you just created the new branch and didnt push anything yet the error does not get caught and instead the did nothing during this period message is shown So error handling should be added but that goes beyond this PR Lets say I want to run on the root folder of all my git projects can it be done In rxvtunicode on FreeBSD using zsh and binsh git recall prints the commits but hitting jkUpDown just prints out the same commits once more No commit is marked like in the gif at any time Tab has a similar effect of partial reprint of the lines
