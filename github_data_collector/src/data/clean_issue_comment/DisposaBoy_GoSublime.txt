When typing in a manner that would normally cause the autocomplete to pop up there is intense lag that seems to last for around a quarter of a second with no autocomplete suggestions appearing A peek into the Sublime console shows messages that appear alongside the lag spikes margo agent log gocodego gocode didnt respond after ms taking ms margo agent log gocodego gocode didnt accept the request after ms margo agent log gocodego gocode didnt accept the request after ms margo agent log gocodego gocode eventually responded after s This behavior is observed no matter which package the autocomplete is running on It occurs on both the next branch and the normal development branch The local repo for githubcommdempskygocode is on commit b a the latest as of today which gocode shows that it is correctly located in GOPATHs bin directory which is also located in the path variable Windows bit Im not super familiar with Sublime Text plugins but some quick Googling pointed at UsersusernameLibraryApplication SupportSublime Text PackagesUser Im on OSX Apparently if you git clone into that directory menu items show up but dont work and margo never gets set up correctly After banging my head against the wall for a while I tried the same git clone up a directory in UsersusernameLibraryApplication SupportSublime Text Packages which immediately worked and as a cherry on top created a GoSublime subdirectory of UsersusernameLibraryApplication SupportSublime Text PackagesUser with the layout the rest of the docs implied This narrative is the long way of asking any reason not to explicit put the correct plugin parent directory into for each supported platform I switched to the development build of GoSublime and reinstalled it Now Im getting this error agent GoSublime

that are in vendor but not in GOPATH Running goimports from the terminal does not have this problem There is no way to pass argument to the goimports linter Previously this could be done with something like fmtcmd goimports srcdir dir local githubcomgzcfoo Now it seems that the Args are buried inside here In my case I use the local flag to sort the imports differently It would need to be configured perpackage If we have slice or array of struct there are two options of literal syntax Example A and B Example A go type Movie struct Title string Year int jsonreleased Color bool jsoncoloromitempty Actors string var movies Movie Title Casablanca Year Color false Actors stringHumphrey Bogart Ingrid Bergman Title Cool Hand Luke Year Color true Actors stringPaul Newman Title

morning I found the error message appear on the sublime status bar it says margosublime build failed press supersuperx to configure margo or check console for errors but after I checked the log file which saved under this location UsersusernameLibraryApplication SupportSublime Text PackagesUserGoSublimeosxx logtxt it didnt even updated since days ago Please anyone have any experienced like this before what would I suppose to do Thanks gs I was recently debugging a problem with goimports not working properly and found it wasnt working quite right when working with modules outside of the gopath specifically importing internal packages within your module I created a quick fix for this for anyone who has this problem as well I havent done a PR because I think the problem is actually in goimports code but I got it working and havent had the time to dig into goimports code Love gosublime Please consider supporting our collective Trying to install GoSublime now is a pita Isnt easier to just leave it in package control
