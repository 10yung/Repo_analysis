Hey just a quick suggestion Theres a repository that includes the google material icons but also has icons created by other artists Seeing that google rarely adds new icons would you be willing to include these as well It would help the community out a lot as its updated constantly and also the artists who created those icons would benefit as well Could be a simple checkbox and then itd move the icons to drawablenightldpi drawablenightmdpi drawablenightxhdpi drawablenightxxhdpi drawablenightxxxhdpi Have configurable default settings or set the default to dp and white with all DPIs checked Instead of a long dropdown list it would be really nice if the icons were displayed in a grid list with a search bar at the top Clicking an icon would select it and allow adding multiple icons at once The ability for a user preference to set their own default color size and dpi variants would be really great Another great feature would be to detect the icons already used set them as checked If an icon is unchecked it should remove that icon from the drawable folders Thanks again for this great plugin OS Deepin Current Overview icons link is which is Material Icons Guide Maybe it should be changed to Specifically the actionicreorder icon has defects Some of the icons show up as a block instead of the actual icon dp xxxhdpi and xhdpi for example several others have this issue as well The plugin steals focus from android studio Would like a minimize button or at least ability to click back to Android Studio The stacktrace input null javalangIllegalArgumentException input null at javaximageioImageIOreadImageIOjava at comkonifarmaterialicongeneratorMaterialDesignIconGenerateDialogcopyFileMaterialDesignIconGenerateDialogjava at comkonifarmaterialicongeneratorMaterialDesignIconGenerateDialogcreateIconMaterialDesignIconGenerateDialogjava at comkonifarmaterialicongeneratorMaterialDesignIconGenerateDialogcreateMaterialDesignIconGenerateDialogjava at comkonifarmaterialicongeneratorMaterialDesignIconGenerateDialogdoOKActionMaterialDesignIconGenerateDialogjava at comintellijopenapiuiDialogWrapperOkActiondoActionDialogWrapperjava at comintellijopenapiuiDialogWrapperDialogWrapperActionactionPerformedDialogWrapperjava at A padding is always set I would like to be able to remove it
