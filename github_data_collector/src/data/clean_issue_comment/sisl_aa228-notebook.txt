Right now in the grid world problem description it says We receive a cost of for bumping against the outer border of the grid but in the problem implementation it appears that a deterministic reward of is hard coded when an action towards the edge is taken from an edge state this is E rewardsaspsa Since if a wall is bumped the state remains the same it is certainly possible to implement what the problem description actually says with rewardsasp by checking whether the state remains the same This makes visualization difficult though A simpler alternative would be to say that a cost of is accrued when an action that corresponds to moving out of bounds is taken That way the true reward can be captured with rewardsa Can I change to a rewardsa formulation or do we want to work through the difficulties associated with the current rewardsasp description For some reason the latex wrapped strings dont show up for me I have temporarily removed them in banditsjl
