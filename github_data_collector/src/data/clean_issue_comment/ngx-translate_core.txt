Hello I need a help here when I used parameters inside routerLink its not move to the current browser language its keep me returned to the default what I shall do here routerLink notificationUrl Angular ngxtranslatecore ngxtranslatemessageformatcompiler We are using ngxtranslatemessageformatcompiler along with ngxtranslate to support translation of Date with accurate date format according to the current lang among other things So we have some cases where we give just Date parameters to the translate pipe The translate pipe works fine the first time it is triggered but when the value of one parameter changes the pipe does not update the value displayed anymore Heres an exemple html html div test translateparam div json json test This is a date myDate date short component javascript public param myDate new Date changenewDate Date thisparam myDate newDate As I said the date displayed in the html is not updated when the value of thisparam changes because the method change is called with a different Date Im pretty sure its because of the start of the transform method of TranslatePipe translatepipets javascript transformquery string args any any if query querylength return query if we ask another time for the same key return the last value if equalsquery thislastKey equalsargs thislastParams return thisvalue The problem is the equal fonction see here which returns true for different Date objects To force the pipe to see a difference between args and thislastParams I can modify the code like this component javascript public param myDate new Date myDateAsString new DatetoISOString changenewDate Date thisparam myDate newDate myDateAsString myDatetoISOString By doing this the equals function see a difference between both param values args and thislastParams because the comparison of the string values return false and now the pipe works as expected But this is an ugly workaround The equals function should return false for different Date objects in the first place I have a very weird problem in my app that uses ngxtranslate I am not sure if my error is caused by ngxtranslate but I am wondering if anyone has experienced anything similar In my app I have a questionnaire that is answered by many s of new users every week in different countries using different languages with ngxtranslate It works fine for most users but occasionally it will show the text from ngxtranslate files looking like it went through google translate or something A Swedish sentence will still be in Swedish but the language looks like its written by a year old It shows text that does not exist in my app It is still the same text as in the translation files but it looks like it has gone through a bad translation service I am unable to reproduce the problem myself but it keeps popping up for multiple users using different browser seen in IE Edge and Chrome Current behavior When in a lazy module a language is used that was not seen yet in the appmodule so not seen in thistranslateuse or thistranslatesetDefaultLang then the default language will be used when in the lazy module thistranslateuse for that new language is used How do you think that we should fix this To be honest I do not know What I do know is a bypass In appcomponentts just make sure that ngxtranslate saw all possible languages with something like thisassistsServicegetLanguagesforEachone thistranslatesetDefaultLangoneid Perhaps this bypass will help to find the problem Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions Im using ionic angular I do not know if both are required

Ionic project I doesnt work with firefox and chrome so I do not think the browser is in fault Hi Im trying to add translations to the new Angular app but Ive got strange behaviour with translate

translateMENUINTEGRATIONdiv There is no error in the console as if the translation doesnt work and the raw key is shown Im using ngxtranslatecore and Angular rc Here is some configuration info json

esModuleInterop true angularCompilerOptions fullTemplateTypeCheck true strictInjectionParameters true I want to write the ONE unit test for the whole project not for one specified component in order to check if there are any missing keys in my json file with all translations which I pass through translation pipe ANYWHERE in the project For example span FOO translate span If FOO key doesnt exist in json file then the test should fail and optionally somehow return the list of missing keys Is it possible to implement this feature in this way Or at least in other comparable ways Current behavior Example is the best to explain If I have this keyvalue pair NoRecordsWereFound No matching records were found for your search And Im not providing the records param in the HTML NoRecordsWereFound translate I see in the browser No matching records were found for your search Expected behavior I want to set a default value for records in case of not providing one lets say values so for previous example Ill get No matching values were found for your search What is the motivation use case for changing the behavior In case of missing the param value instead of doing ngIfs for having the value or for not having it know for sure that default value will be taken instead How do you think that we should implement this Maybe by using the name of the param as the default value for example NoRecordsWereFound No matching records were found for your search in the HTML will be simply when no params provided No matching records were found for your search My question in StackOverflow for

This issue occurs when I use TranslateMessageFormatCompiler from ngxtranslatemessageformatcompiler But author lephyrus said that his compiler couldnt affect compilation that way so probably its something with get method Also translations loaded by get doesnt react to language change if not loaded inside onLangChange Maybe Im using it in wrong way Minimal reproduction of the problem with
