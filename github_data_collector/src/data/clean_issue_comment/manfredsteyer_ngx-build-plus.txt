repo from the Security Alerts page details I am building an angular element and then using it as a web component via the following command ng build prod extrawebpackconfig webpackpartialjs statsjson outputHashingnone singlebundletrue However the styles are not being applied in the application it is running in When I inspect the js file that is generated I can see that the styles are being bundled Im sure Im missing something simple but Im not sure what it is Hi Team I have forked the sample in ngxbuildpluscli project I added routing in main project and was trying to consume from web component I built the code and received the above error on console after running the production build The code can be found here I have just added just has plain component with routing in the sample project and nothing else Hi manfredsteyer This is my app component file taken from cli branch sample import Component OnInit Input from angularcore declare let VERSION string Component template h

query is I am getting undefined for thiselem in both ngOnInit and onClick Is there any way to pass a configuration type object to a custom element Updated the formatting indentation of the code snippet to assist with readability At least make the default behaviour work Maybe its an option to remove the deprecated bundleStyles See my comment under the issue Old behavior Running the externals
