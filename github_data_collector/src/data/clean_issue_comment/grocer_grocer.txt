Im using this gem to send iOS notifications its working in development but not in production and there is no error Generated pem with private key as suggested in documentation In Ruby Fixnum is deprecated I get deprecation warnings now when using Grocer I believe switching any Fixnum instances to Integer is all that needs to be done to fix this Hi Ive been using Grocer in a production app for several years and I really appreciate it Today I was updating the app to ruby and rails and now my tests are failing Im initializing the grocer testing server just like in the sample code and Ive checked everything else I can think of Push notifications are still sending successfully when connecting to Apples APNs The result I get in rspec is a timeout failure because servernotificationspop just sits and waits with no events Is anyone else having this problem Hi Im trying to understand if this gem works with the last p apple certificate The problem is when i try to convert the p to pem or is the gem not ready for this Federico Apple announced a new provider API coming later in that is based on HTTP at about minutes The requestresponse cycle with standard http status codes means that issues like dont need elaborate ring buffer solutions There is also no need for a separate feedback service There will be no need to keep the existing APNS provider API as the new API applies to older devices The video mentions some other changes such as K payloads and character device tokens For HTTP in Ruby perhaps I found this class but cant find it using somewhere in the code The reason Im asking is Apple recommendation Note The Apple Push Notification service APNs provides feedback to your server which may require specific actions For example if APNs tells you that a push token is invalid remove that device and its registrations from your server This is what that class is responsible for tell me exactly what error was happened so I can decide should I destroy registration of device or not Please make this moment clear for me Am I missed something or there is a way to use this class somehow Ive started seeing segmentation faults during test runs of the Grocer server on our CI platform These do not appear locally and so far not on production either The CI and production platform are Ubuntu and the Ruby version is identical for all Is this a problem in Grocer or do I have to look elsewhere homerofrvmrubiesruby libruby opensslbufferingrb BUG Segmentation fault at x f d dcb ruby p revision x linux Control frame information c p s e CFUNC sysread c p s e METHOD homerofrvmrubiesruby libruby opensslbufferingrb c p s e METHOD homerofrvmrubiesruby libruby opensslbufferingrb c p s e METHOD homerofcachebundlerruby gemsgrocer libgrocernotificationreaderrb c p s e METHOD homerofcachebundlerruby gemsgrocer libgrocernotificationreaderrb c p s e BLOCK homerofcachebundlerruby gemsgrocer libgrocerserverrb FINISH c p s e TOP FINISH Ruby level backtrace information homerofcachebundlerruby gemsgrocer libgrocerserverrb in block levels in accept homerofcachebundlerruby gemsgrocer libgrocernotificationreaderrb in each homerofcachebundlerruby gemsgrocer libgrocernotificationreaderrb in readnotification homerofrvmrubiesruby libruby opensslbufferingrb in read homerofrvmrubiesruby libruby opensslbufferingrb in fillrbuff homerofrvmrubiesruby libruby opensslbufferingrb in sysread C level backtrace information homerofrvmrubiesruby liblibrubyso x c dc x f ec a dc vmdumpc homerofrvmrubiesruby liblibrubyso x x f ec f errorc homerofrvmrubiesruby liblibrubyso rbbug xb x f ec c errorc homerofrvmrubiesruby liblibrubyso x dde x f ec dde signalc libx linuxgnulibcso x c x f ebf bc arrayc x f d dcb We currently try to truncate the alert when exceeding the payload dimension but without actual numbers its kind of difficult Were left with options fork and expose payloadtoolarge and a new payloadsize which is encodedpayloadbytesize use send to access private methods I wanted to know if there was any reason for making these private If not then you can expect a PR promptly Thanks We have a worker that sends push notification for a given push ID The worker gets messages and sends PN according to the data The problem Sometimes the PN server responds with big delay It got stuck in a middle of sending PN maybe they limit number of APNS It can take about an hour or more and then the PN is sent successfully and the queue started polling messages again But in this time the worker cant push any message from the queue so we have a big delay also for the other devices Is there a timeout option to Grocerpusher Its not appears in documentation Any other idea how to handle this As of now I have no idea ifhow this excellent gem handles errors Documentation about exceptions return values etc would really be helpful
