I recently saw the package sysfonts It occurred to me that it will be a great addition to downloadinstall Google Fonts using the extrafont package Google Fonts seems to have an API Not too familiar with the API and howwhere sysfonts package download the fonts If possible I will be happy to look at this a little more and add some functions Will this be something of interest I made changes to add the AppDataLocalMicrosoftWindowsFonts folder This folder is used by Windows to install fonts without admin privileges I tested the changes and did not had any problems This merge addresses issue In Windows fonts can be installed without admin privileges but they will be installed under filepathSysgetenv LOCALAPPDATA Microsoft Windows Fonts This will be a nice enhancement to add this directory by default Im having a recurring problem where Im able to register and load a TrueType font but the resulting plot falls back to Arial without any error or warning appearing I first had this problem with Montserrat retrieved from google fonts The problem persisted for several days during which I Restarted my R session Removed and reinstalled the extrafontdb package before reimporting the fonts Restarted my computer and Inspected the font table and warnings Nothing appeared to fix the problem but when I went back a couple of days later Montserrat was suddenly working perfectly unfortunately I never worked out why Montserrat suddenly started working Now Ive acquired Gotham Bold and Gotham Black and Im having the same problem There are no warnings or errors when I fontimport and loadfonts it appears to register on all devices r fontimportsystemfileassets fonts package climatecomms prompt FALSE Scanning ttf files in CUsersrensaCodeclimatecommsinstassetsfonts Extracting afm files from

wchextrafont e e and extrafontdb on R on Windows Should I not be using the CRAN version of extrafontdb with the dev reelase of extrafont It would be wonderful to be able to change the font for point labels in ggplot eg using geomtext Rplot Hi Thanks for the great package I am using the extrafont in a shiny app In my local computer it works well in displaying the ggplot and plotly outputs and also downloading a report produced by rmarkdown in all formats HTMLPDFWord But when I deploy the shiny app in a ubuntu server and load the fonts there the font for outputs work well but the PDF report generated by rmarkdown cannot use the fonts Do you have any suggestion for this problem Embed fonts works but Im having a hard time setting the font size so I was hoping something like the options parameter for embedfonts would be useful but I cant find any documentation that describes how this might be used Sad for me When using the package almost everything works fine An exception is the following I cannot use the Cambria regular font because it never gets imported It seems to be an odd bug because it does detect and import the Cambria Bold Cambria Italic and Cambria Bold Italic fonts just not the regular I keep trying to call fontimport and getting C Windows Fonts cambriabttf CambriaBold already registered in fonts database Skipping C Windows Fonts cambriaittf CambriaItalic already registered in fonts database Skipping C Windows Fonts cambriazttf CambriaBoldItalic already registered in fonts database Skipping No mention whatsoever to cambriattf And when I navigate with Windows Explorer to C Windows Fonts it is there It seems that this library is no longer maintained still an issue so others can maybe solve this problem When downloading a ttf on Mac OS it is stored in LibraryFonts Confusingly extrafont does find the font when running fontimport After import it is also shown when running fonts However it still is not available for use It does work when moving the ttf file to LibraryFonts Apparently this is the folder extrafonts looks Make sure to remove the ttf file from LibraryFonts and rerun the importfont As described here I could not get Linux Libertine fonts to work without manually editing the fonttablecsv file to copy over the FontName to FamilyName It seems that extrafont relies on the Family name being unique which is of course not the case for fonts that belong to the same family
