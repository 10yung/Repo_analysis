Removes a hole in error codes introduced by removing H EARLYRESPONSE in Retry integrity protection specifies the AESGCM key and IV directly While that works fine for people using TLS stacks that provide direct access to AESGCM it does not for people using TLS stacks that only provides access to TLS AEAD API Previously we have been consistent in using HKDFExpandLabel in a specific way so that people could rely on the TLS stack generating AEAD contexts I think we can resolve the concern by simply changing the hardcoded AESGCM key and IV we specify in the TLS draft to a set of values that can be derived by using the TLS AEAD API Closes Fixes The presentation on low latency TCP options presents a way to convey max ack delay of ms us and ns I dont think we need to do ns in QUIC but its clear datacenter use cases will want us so I believe we should change from ms to us Notes that ack delays are right shifted by ackdelayexponent when transmitted in ACK frames Fixes Fixes Fixes Pleasantly the same formula weve used for grease values elsewhere in HTTP does not collide with any currentlyassigned error code so Ive just reused it Well need to be cautious about x though The same logic could be applied to transport error codes but theres not much point If youre intolerant of the way your peer closed the connection you might erroneously close the connection Editorialish A recommendation which reserves some error code space we havent used modifies the IANA instructions Doesnt mandate or prohibit anything new Fixes I decided to keep this pretty simple and leave the use or lack thereof unspecified since we already know theres variation there I was hoping to avoid creating conflicts with but it made more sense to pull the association references into the same paragraph which that PR also touches Sorry RyanAtGoogle Editorialish explicitly states a MAY that was previously implicit Fixes using mostly the text proposed in that issue
