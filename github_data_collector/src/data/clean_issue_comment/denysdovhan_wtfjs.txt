 the Chinese version The document still remains little translationese I was goofing around with JS weirdness today and I found this behaviour which took me some time to explain to myself Maybe it could be included in the file It started off with the basic type coercion which worked as expected js true true false true My initial assumption was that the value is cast to Boolean For this simple

the true explanation to the first snippet is js Numbertrue Numberfalse Meaning that truefalse is cast to and compared as Number I am able to translate this language Translation ready Notes didnt translate the text of links with no French translations so the user knows before clicking on the link that this content will be in English added a link in the READMEmd for the French translation but not in the READMEzhcnmd file as the Translations block seems to have been omitted I am able to translate this language yes I am able to translate this language Ill start working on it referencing
