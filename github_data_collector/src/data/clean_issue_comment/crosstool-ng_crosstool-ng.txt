SYSROOTusrlocalincludearmlinuxgnueabihf Although the GCC documentation states Cross compilers do not search either usrlocalinclude or its replacement I can confirm that the Linaro toolchains actually

tmptmpllJIY iWyQrpirootfsusrincludearmlinuxgnueabihf tmptmpllJIY iWyQrpirootfsusrinclude Im pretty sure that this can be achieved without manually patching GCC Linaro use their own tool named ABE for building toolchains ABE allowed me to create a script for building my own Linaro style toolchain by copying all of its build steps In this build script no patching is done and nevertheless SYSROOTusrlocalinclude is searched for headers I used an x workstation to build an ARM v GCC toolchain thats intended to run on a Raspberry Pi and produce binaries for the same RPi Crossnative build host target using a Canadian build The toolchain seems to work fine that is it produces a hello world binary that runs and prints hello world The problem is that it links to the old libstdc that comes with the Ubuntu installation instead of the newer version that crosstoolNG built Could you point me to the right documentation how to install the toolchain to the host system I tried manually copying the contents of some lib folders to usrlocallib and running ldconfig but there are many different folders with a binlibinclude structure and I couldnt get it to work Why are there so many different folders Why does a crossnative toolchain have a sysroot folder Ive scanned through the documentation and searched through the issues but I didnt find this mentioned anywhere For the current installation I just copied the entire xtools folder to the opt folder of the host and added the HOSTaarch rpi linuxgnuaarch rpi linuxgnubin folder to my path But this uses the wrong shared libraries

the future using a similar method The nano runtime libraries are specified by the nanospecs file and are often included in embedded toolchains eg GNU ARM Embedded for memoryconstrained target devices The following is a brief summary of the changes introduced by this PR Add nano variantspecific newlib configurations in configlibcnewlibin Keep all LIBCNEWLIB configs as is These configurations will be used to build the normal variant libcga Mirror all LIBCNEWLIB configs to LIBCNANONEWLIB configs These configurations will be used to build the nano variant libcgnanoa Modify newlib build script to build LIBC and LIBCNANO variants separately Build an additional libstdc with Os optimise for size and place it as libstdsupcnanoa the default libstdc is built with O Strip debug information from the built libraries Refer to the following issues for the rationale of supporting both normal nonnano and nano variants This PR supersedes which only renames the default runtime libraries to comply with nanospecs without actually building a separate nano variant Hello Im getting build errors when I try to build the cross compiler with glibc and binutils I am getting tmpccaxN sTs Error obstackGLIBC cant be versioned to common symbol obstackcompat error I did a quick google and it turns out that because of this commit which was merged in binutils is causing the problem I couldnt found any information if it has been fixed or not But maybe my search is wrong I also found out this issue and it made me think if a patch is already being provided and Im doing something worng Following are
