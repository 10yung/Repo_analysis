 Zplug is a zsh package manager This will save users the time of figuring out how to install the package and only have it run dircolors once per install update diff Nur dircolors wget o devnull qO wc l grep E dircolors awk print sort uniq D asc asc dmg dmg enc enc eps eps jsm jsm midi midi pod pod ps ps sig sig t t I am using the Windows Subsystem for Linux WSL I followed the setup instructions Here is my LSCOLORS But the correct colors do not show up for the file extension when I am viewing that are available where Windows is mounted The colors are displaying fine as long as I am not in the mnt folder or any of its subdirectories Any ideas what could be going wrong Here is the relevant portion of my bashrc UPDATE I think the issue is with the files being executable Could someone please explain what is going on here Thanks The install instructions say wget O HOMEdircolors echo eval dircolors b HOMEdircolors HOMEbashrc HOMEbashrc Which is correct it works But the instruction above them says to add eval dircolors b HOMELSCOLORS to the bashrc Which doesnt work unless of course you pair it with wget O HOMELSCOLORS The URL seems too long such that it is more than columns Manifestin Pipfile Pipfilelock requirementstxt maybe others Should be some kind of metadata but maybe not in the existing metadata group Edit This was originally about vcf and vcard extensions but it sprawled into something much more ambitious Id rather have an explicit close for every open fold marker Right now its pretty random where any fold is explicity closed or not Indentation of the comments is also pretty out of whack Sometimes a thing is indented sometimes not Probably the thing to do is just kill all the indendtation Idk I recognize that probably of people out there arent using these but I am so Ill get around to this eventually
