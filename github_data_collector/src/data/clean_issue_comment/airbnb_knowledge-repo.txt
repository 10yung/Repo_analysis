Hello I have set up knowledgerepo to share notebookThe website is in the POC stage where the website is up and running in a k container I am trying to set up authentication and went through the threads related to that Is there an example repositoryDocumentation you can refer me to where everything is up and running with the configuration set up or anyone to talk to who has already set it up Thanks My Current Setup postgres local server python knowledge repo My sequential workflow create a local repo krlocal adding a remote repo in krlocal git init git remote add origin Export

mssqlpyodbcusernamepasswordservernamedatabasetabledriverODBCDriver forSQLServer But I keep getting error saying sqlalchemyexcInterfaceError pyodbcInterfaceError IM u IM Microsoft ODBC Driver Manager Data source name not found and no default driver specified SQLDriverConnect From my investigation it should have been resolved when I appended driverODBCDriver forSQLServer to the connection URI but had no luck Has anyone connected SQL Server as the backend and if so can you please help Thank you I have created a Docker image for Knowledge Repo based on this issue Link to image on Docker Hub This is currently configured to work with Gitbacked knowledge repositories only The code for this is on my fork Tried to use this method to enforce consistency in usernames but it has a bug seems like in general this functionality is somewhat deprecated but as long as it is still around might as well raise the correct error Ive been trying out knowledgerepo and came across multiple problems that seems to have resulted from following the old documentation on knowledgereporeadthedocsio Looking through the issues it seems that several PRs modified the docs but the changes didnt propagate yet to the documentation website It might be a good idea to synchronize the two so that new users can have a lower entrance barrier to knowledgerepo Except for that thanks for creating this cool project open source If we end up using it Ill try to contribute back if we have something to contribute Fixes Description of the changeset We have modified the plain and rich mails to include more information For the rich email we have included a new template which shows a preview of the post along with its thumbnail and related data with a link to check the full article in the Knowledge Repo Preview of the
