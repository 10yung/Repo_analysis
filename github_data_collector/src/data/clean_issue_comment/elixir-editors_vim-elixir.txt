When opening any elixir or eelixir files with this package I incur a second load time for each file After some profiling Ive narrowed it down the the elixir syntax package specifically these lines currently starting at syntaxelixirvim LiveView Sigils surrounded with L syntax include HTML syntaxhtmlvim unlet bcurrentsyntax syntax region elixirLiveViewSigil matchgroupelixirSigilDelimiter keepend start L z end s z skip containsHTML fold Commenting these lines drops the load time to about half a second Versions Computer MacBook Air Retina inch macOS Mojave Version NeoVim NVIM v Build type Release LuaJIT Compilation usrlocalHomebrewLibraryHomebrewshimsmacsuperclang UFORTIFYSOURCE DFORTIFYSOURCE DNDEBUG DMINLOGLEVEL Wall Wextra pedantic Wnounusedparameter Wstrictprototypes stdgnu Wshadow Wconversion Wmissingprototypes Wimplicitfallthrough Wvla fstackprotectorstrong fdiagnosticscolorauto DINCLUDEGENERATEDDECLARATIONS DGNUSOURCE DNVIMMSGPACKHASFLOAT DNVIMUNIBIHASVARFROM Itmpneovim or rj neovim buildconfig Itmpneovim or rj neovim src Iusrlocalinclude Itmpneovim or rj neovim depsbuildinclude Iusrlocaloptgettextinclude IApplicationsXcodeappContentsDeveloperPlatformsMacOSXplatformDeveloperSDKsMacOSX sdkusrinclude Itmpneovim or rj neovim buildsrcnvimauto Itmpneovim or rj neovim buildinclude Compiled by brewMojavelocal Features acl iconv tui See help featurecompile system vimrc file VIMsysinitvim fallback for VIM usrlocalCellarneovim sharenvim Run checkhealth for more info Terminal iterm autoupdates usrlocalCaskroomiterm B From Elixir ErlangOTP erts source bit smp ds asyncthreads hipe dtrace Elixir compiled with ErlangOTP Fixes In eb df I used a regexp that was matching too many things I completely forgot that spaces are also printable characters This PR comes with a new version using d d to match those special characters This will Not match spaces so atoms will be matched correctly Match accented characters like Match least common characters like which are valid in an atom like Match some invalid characters Elixir actually accepts any UTF letter as atoms and Vim does not support Unicode modifiers AFAIK so using something like pL is not possible I went with the route of adding any nonASCII on top of words and s as it gave us more positive results and the falsepositives will raise errors when compiled so they are easily fixable I still cant decide by myself if we should add those falsepositives or not WDYT The other option would be to remove support for accents and other UTF characters and only highlight those atoms with w and matched chars nifoc jbodah please take at look at this Any inputs are welcome After applying eb df syntax highlighting appears to be mostly broken for me Example from mixexs img width altBildschirmfoto um src Im using the latest Neovim commit NVIM v g f e Please let me know if you need more information Tagging wsanches since he authored the commit If you write for example the following code case pattern do ok error end it is indented as case pattern do ok error end The coloration is also broken by this atom I think is the same but I didnt tested it Avoid method To avoid this bug we are currently using instead Description Function call highlight was added to elixir syntax highlight on Sublime Text and I thought that was a neat addition as it makes it easier to scan what are function vs variables in the code I propose we can also add this to our Vim syntax highlight Result Filing a bug Have you already tried updating vimelixir yes For indentationhighlighting bugs please use the following template Actual ex if do quote do IOputs hi end end Expected ex if do quote do IOputs hi end end Filing a bug Have you already tried updating vimelixir yes I have For indentationhighlighting bugs please use the following template Actual ex if do case do hi ho end yes else no end Expected ex if do case do hi ho end yes else no end We have vim and nvim in containers now we should be running the test suite against each implementation Create scripts that will orchestrate this for us ex def deleteconn id id do user Accountsgetuserid with ok User Accountsdeleteuseruser do sendrespconn nocontent end end when cursor move to endneovim appear E Invalid expression elixirStringDelimiterelixirStringidelixirStringDelimiterelixirArguments elixirOperatorelixirArguments id The CI setup has been fragile for a while and now seems busted on branches It would be worthwhile to reimplement CI from scratch
