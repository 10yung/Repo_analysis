just like the way DateFormatPipe does if value return I need a duration with detail I see in source code the pipe amDuration force humanize and lose all detail of duration object I suggest adding a new boolean parameter in this pipe for using or not the humanize method Another solution is to have a new pipe to transform transform duration into humanized duration Description of the Issue and Steps to Reproduce If I try to change two or three consecutive times regardless of the time that passes between each click the language momentupdateLocale the application remains frozen and the browser does not respond Ive also noticed that I can not get the amDateFormat format updated amTimeAgo does I tried to force the update of the change but I can not make it work correctly Initially it is all in modules but from the component homecomponent I get the same result since it could be due to an incorrect injection of dependencies or any other reason Ive been looking at issues and searching through google but I have not found anyone who happens to this Install this repository npm install npm start Did you search for duplicate issue No Ensure your issue is isolated to ngxmoment Issues involving third party tools will be closed unless submitted by the tools authormaintainer Environment windows Please answer the following questions Angular version next TypeScript version moment version Are you using momenttimezone No Are you using the angularcli Yes Using RollupWebpackSystemjsIonicsimilar No It could be great to add a way to import ngxmoment without locales and add the availability to import only the locales I want I recently upgraded from angular moment to ngxmoment I couldnt get ngxmoment to work following the documentation ngxmoment main indexjs defaultExtension js indexjs doesnt exist in the package so I got s Changing it to ngxmoment main bundlesngxmomentumdjs defaultExtension js did work Does your documentation need updating or am I doing something wrong Hi I want to display the time zone name for example PST How do I do that The Z gives me Thanks Hi I wonder if it is possible to change the formatting to be like this Just Now sec ago mins ago etc Thanks I can get the total number of hours and min from a future date as a whole but I need the difference in min to be based on the hour For example if its pm and Im testing against tomorrow it responds h and m Both are correct but what Im wanting h and m nextDate amDifference currentDate hoursh nextDate amDifference currentDate minutesm thisnextDate new Date thisnextDatesetDatethisnextDategetDate thisnextDatesetHours Did you search for duplicate issue Yes Both implementation of pipes FromUtcPipe and ParsePipe are not accepting format formats as parameters while moment instead provides the option fromutcpipets typescript import Pipe PipeTransform from angularcore import as moment from moment Pipe name amFromUtc export class FromUtcPipe implements PipeTransform transformvalue any args string any return momentutcvalue could return instead typescript import Pipe PipeTransform from angularcore import as moment from moment Pipe name amFromUtc export class FromUtcPipe implements PipeTransform transformvalue any formats stringstring args string any return momentutcvalue formats the same is true for the ParsePipe which only accepts a string format and not an array parsepipets typescript import Pipe PipeTransform from angularcore import as moment from moment under systemjs moment is actually exported as the default export so we account for that const momentConstructor value any momentMoment anymomentdefault moment Pipe name amParse export class ParsePipe implements PipeTransform transformvalue string format string momentMoment return momentvalue format while it could be typescript import Pipe PipeTransform from angularcore import as moment from moment under systemjs moment is actually exported as the default export so we account for that const momentConstructor value any momentMoment anymomentdefault moment Pipe name amParse export class ParsePipe implements PipeTransform transformvalue string formats stringstring momentMoment return momentvalue formats Using the following example Component selector app template Last updated myDate amCalendar Which should print from the readme Last updated Today at what I actually get Today at AM Any way to use hour format here
