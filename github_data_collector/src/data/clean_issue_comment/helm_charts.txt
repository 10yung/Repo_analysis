your changes Is this a new chart No What this PR does why we need it Updates the version of the kubeless function controller fixes invalid resource definitions due to kube api and updated CRD handling for helm compatibility Which issue this PR fixes None Special notes for your reviewer The description field on CRDs isnt valid any more and deployment resources live in the appsv api now They were all the changes I intended to make but after the e e tests failed I needed to include a change to support helm wrt the crds directory In helm CRDs in that dir no longer support templating This meant that the kubelessionamespace annotation had to be removed from the functionskubelessio CRD Because of this the function manager would no longer be able to read the target namespace from the CRD and would default to kubeless which may be wrong depending on where the chart was installed To fix this I added the KUBELESSNAMESPACE env var to each container to inform the controllers of the correct namespace

container using a common implementation this one is based on fluentds chart The values of these environment variables can be either defined directly namevalue or from secrets Verdaccio plugins such as awss storage and verdacciogithuboauthui accept environment variables as an easy way to pass configuration such as AWS or GitHub OAuth credentials This is very useful for example in GitOps allowing these secrets to be kept encrypted in the repository instead of in plain text etiennetremel Checklist Place an x no spaces in all applicable fields Please remove unrelated fields x DCO signed x Chart
