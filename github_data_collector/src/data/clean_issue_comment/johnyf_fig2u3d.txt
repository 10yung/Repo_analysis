Dear all I got stuck in the last step write u d file I am using Matlab a The following are the massage IDTFConvertersh input homesiweiDocumentsMATLABfluxesmyfigidtf output homesiweiDocumentsMATLABfluxesmyfigu d Exit code Error using idtf u d line IDTFConverter executable returned with error Error in fig u d line idtf u dfname Error in fig latex line fig u dax fname Error in fig pdf d line fig latexax filename media ormovie pdforxelatex Any solutions Thanks in advance Hi Thank you very much for this package but I had some problems to make it work on Matlab R b I run the script examplesm and it works fine with fig u d but not with fig pdf d I had the following error LaTeX Error The key media views par is unknown and is being ignored peakscontourlog Could you help me to resolve this issue Sandy This dependency can be found at Its location appears to be undocumented in the README Thanks to Nick Fry and others that have mentioned this at the FEX page Required at various places Fix surfaces with single color for all facesvertices that still have indexed color CData set which however is not used by Matlab due to specified single solid color Example create streamtube set FaceColor for streamtube object Matlab plots streamtube correctly in the set color but fig idtf still generates an index color stream tube cycling through the complete colormap without this fix Make a call like fig pdf dgca foobarfilename work too crashed before Add support for hggoups The code until now assumed that the parent of a graphics handle is an axes object This is not true for more complex graphics object hierarchies eg involving groups of handles by hggroups Thus traverse the graphics tree upwards in case the parent is not an axes until the axes is finally found Matlab handle graphics support tested with b Thank you very much for this wonderful package that allows me to insert interactive d plots in my presentations Nevertheless I had a lot of problems to make it work in Matlab R a and my success is only partial First I had a problem with the file meshnormalsm in fig idtfauxiliary It seems that this script does not produce generate the correct normals for mesh surfaces So it generates an error when normals is empty when it tries to normalize the normal vectors it complains about the operation between empty matrices Ive included a check for this condition that returns an empty normals without normalization And I had to manually comment some lines in other scripts that check the condition isnan for various handles two places fig idtfpreprocessu dprecontourgroupm and fig idtfpreprocessu dprequivergroupm With these corrections fig u d is able to generate the idtf file but then the system explodes when it calls to IDTFConverter I had the same error that was previously commented in another message If I edit manually the IDTF file and remove from the MESH resource everything related to NORMALS I set MODELNORMALCOUNT to and remove MESHFACENORMALLIST and MODELNORMALLIST I can run the IDTFConverter without any flaw and the u d file works great in latex and PDF I guess that the problem comes from the file meshnormals but I cannot find useful information about this function Any comment that can help me to correct this issue will be welcome Javier Due to the changed graphics API fig u d is not working with Matlab R b Please update this great product Hi thanks for this works very fine I just have problems with lines containing NaNs plot NaN fig u d gca test Throws Profile Scaling factor Debug level Position Quality Texture Coordinate Quality Normal Quality Diffuse Color Quality Specular Color Quality Geometry Default Quality Texture Quality Animation Quality Zero Area Faces Removal ENABLED Zero Area Face Tolerance Exclude Normals FALSE Export Option Flags ffff Texture size limit Exit code Grabbing through some code least exit code means IFXEFLOATNOTFOUND ConverterResulth in component x which is IFXRESULTCONVERTERS IFXResultComponentEngine That error is ommitted in FileScannercpp only IFXRESULT FileScannerScanFloat F pNumber I rebuilt IDTFConver Version u d from scratch but the same failure occures so I guess the idtf input file created from MATLAB scripts is malformed Do you have any ideas Kindly regards Andreas
