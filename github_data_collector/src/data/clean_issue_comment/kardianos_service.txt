 when I execute systemctl start xxx in terminal nothing print did I miss some config something like in servicesystemdlinuxgo Unit DescriptionDescription ConditionFileIsExecutablePathcmdEscape Service StartLimitInterval StartLimitBurst ExecStartPathcmdEscaperange Arguments cmdend if KillModeKillModeKillModeend if ChRootRootDirectoryChRootcmdend if WorkingDirectoryWorkingDirectoryWorkingDirectorycmdEscapeend if UserNameUserUserNameend if ReloadSignalExecReloadbinkill ReloadSignal MAINPIDend if PIDFilePIDFilePIDFilecmdend Restartalways RestartSec EnvironmentFileetcsysconfigName Install WantedBymultiusertarget I noticed that in when checking for Status of a service thats not installed it returns inactive instead Im running this on Ubuntu server and here is example output systemctl isactive asd inactive systemctl isactive asfdsafdsad inactive Both asd and asfdsafdsad are not valid services so they shouldnt be returning inactive Therefore its not possible to check whether a service is installed or not ie its not possible to get ErrNotInstalled Im not sure if theres a workaround at this time but Ill investigate Potentially we might have to fallback to checking whether such file exists in etcsystemdsystem if the response from systemd is inactive Without Specify binbash c to execute a commandin some distros such as Fedora systemd may not know how to do itand will except error and failed to start Most syslog systems do not log anything below notice level macOS etcaslconf Level notice file systemlog freebsd etcsyslogconf errkernwarningauthnoticemailcrit devconsole noticeauthprivnonekerndebuglprinfomailcritnewserr varlogmessages As a result on those platforms all logInfo are dumped unless the system configuration is changed Im thus proposing to set the syslog level of logInfo to notice Thoughts I have a program that uses lots of goroutines and I suspect that a rare panic is possible This program runs as a service on Windows and as far as I can tell that means you cannot access stderr to view the stacktrace when this happens Im not a Windows expert Ive been investigating how to try and capture one of these crashes Obviously the brute force approach would be to put recovers everywhere but this program is very complex and the crash is rare Is there a better way to track down the issue Ive got two ideas right now neither of which is ideal The first is to do something equivalent to dup to redirect stderr to a file and bypass the Windows service logs entirely The second is to make the service program a dumb wrapper that spawns the real program as a child process then reads its stderr and logs it I have created service using kardianos package service name is TestOne this was running under the SystemdFrom TestOne had run one child process called ProcessOne Now i am trying to kill TestOne from ProcessOne Is this possible If it is possible how can i do What is KillMode option to create service in SystemdFor better understanding refer the below URL Expectation Need to kill Parent process from child process Can we add support for systemd user services There is a pull request hanging which looks quite good For the root user I would however put the service file in usrlibsystemduser if optionUserService is set to true This would allow all users to use the service file
