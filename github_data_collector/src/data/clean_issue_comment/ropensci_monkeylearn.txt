maelle just was looking back at this and noticed a few things to update in the readme I believe GitHub integration is no longer supported updated the URL of instructions for setting Renviron variables used to be added custom as an option to plans we support Eg if data is we should handle the same as requires auth Havent looked into what this would entail yet Cf In the future we could Try to get the waiting time builtin in the error responses Hit an endpoint ifwhen it becomes available thatd return the rates associated to the API key memoise the result and then use it in the whole R session Ive also just realized that all our rate limiting efforts will fail if users open several R sessions and use monkeylearn in it but in that case were not responsible Import parameters from other functions
