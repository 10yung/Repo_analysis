Is the function slcamera of the camera module in slibvs of the simulink module selfdefined or comes with the toolbox Hello author I used Matlab robotics toolbox to make this GUI It is convenient for users who are accustomed to using GUI Can you merge this GUI into your project Needs to be a subclass of Navigation Needs to handle more cases currently just a subset full implementation is Is there any plan for porting this toolbox to Julia language Run method should accept control inputs that are constant for the duration Should support car graphic as per plotvehicle Can I define additional constraints on link variables such as q q pi Collision model is missing how can I define it Collision model in pHRIWARE is not updated for years Linkdouble converts link parameters to numeric double type dl ldouble is a Link object in which all the parameters are numeric double type Useful when you are using Pisympi to avoid round off errors eg in sinPi but later you want to pass the link object to a method eg ikine which only supports real numbers Will give an error if a symbolic variable is not convertible to double number See also SerialLinkdouble SerialLinkdouble converts SerialLink object parameters to numeric double type dr rdouble is a SerialLink object in which all the parameters are numeric double type Useful when you are using Pisympi to avoid round off errors eg in sinPi but later you want to pass the SerialLink object to a method eg ikine which only supports real numbers Will give an error if a symbolic variable is not convertible to double number See also Linkdouble Author Amin Yahyaabadi aminyahyaabadi gmailcom This fails tool transform fails to be handled properly by dhcommand L L L L dhDHFactor TzL Rzq TxL Rxq TyL Ryq pi r eval dhcommandmyrobot rtooltrotypitransl L rplot Hi I am trying to get the symbolic inverse kinematics for a RRR robot but i am getting some errors Below is the input L Revolutealpha a d qlim pi pi L Revolutealpha a d qlim pi pi L Revolutealpha a d qlim pi pi R SerialLink L L L sol Rikinesym And the output solving for joint subs sincos q for SC cant solve this equation k ans txcosq tysinq cosq cosq cosq sinq sinq tycosq txsinq sinq cosq sinq cosq sinq Error using SerialLinkikinesym line cant solve Error in closedform line sol Rikinesym What could be the cause of this error I am trying to generate a trajectory to move the manipulator
