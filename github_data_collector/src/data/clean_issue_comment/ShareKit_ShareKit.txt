Hello I was trying to recompile one of my project after a while I did a pod update an this installed the latest version of ShareKit and all the rest libraries Now Im not able to compile the project the error that I get is PodsFacebookiOSSDKsrcNetworkFBRequestm Expected method to read dictionary element not found on object of type idFBOpenGraphObject The error is coming from FacebookiOSSDK library that is obviously required by ShareKitFacebook Anyone else with the same problem FacebookiOSSDK seems to be a quite old version of the FB sdk Im using the following software Xcode Pod and this is how I include ShareKit in my project pod ShareKitFacebook pod ShareKitWhatsApp pod ShareKitTwitter Thanks for any help I will get Middiu The problem is that we use their deprecated sdk and it does not support Swift see We should refactor our sharer to use There are duplicates such as SHKSendDidFinish and SHKSendDidFailWithError Could be merged the same way as AuthDidFinish with result key inside Also success key in SHKAuthDidFinish is a magic string Should be declared somewhere Not a priority Refactor plain C functions to something more modern Probably NSString category Will be of use in Swift demo app no longer available It is a bug in their SDK they even fixed it but did not update their podspec We can not use bleeding edge of their repo in our podspec due to cocoapods limitation so we must stay on their podspec version Solution wait until they update podspec Evernote created new repository to store SDK link Im trying to share with SHKiOSFacebook shareItemitem Sharing itself works but it seems either Sharekit or Facebook is stripping the title property It seems to be removing everything but hash tags in the string FacebookiOSSDK has been deprecated in favor of FBSDKCoreKit FacebookiOSSDK and FBSDKCoreKit are conflicting in the same project So there is not impossible to use sharing via ShareKit and Facebook authorization via FBSDKCoreKit FBSDKLoginKit in one project It would be good to update ShareKit Thanks Please correct typo if possible Screenshot attached screen shot at pm
