Due to JUCE importing the font will increase the software size I think that try to directly call the system font when initializing the window and use precompiled headers to distinguish the files subSent from a href Ive known of the project for a while and I think that in terms of the easy to use navigation system and the polish interface Helios might be one of the best DAW on android for making a quick melody But I reckon it would be if user on mobile platforms can have a virtual keyboard VB for shortAnd I think I might have found one that doesnt felt clumsy to use So theres this app called Grantophone which is probably the most amazing pocket synth Ive tried cause I pretty much havent try anything else at all p So basically the idea is that the volume of each notes are control by the vertical position of the fingers on each keys closer to the midle louder the note and there no elevation of the blackeys either This both give the user more note range more controllable note Dynamics how do you call when peoples intentionally play loud or softer all the while being less awkward to play to me at least than a piano layout on a D phone screen And I think we can implement it in the daw like Untitled The user can access the VB via the tracks dropdown menu something like track name Open Keyboard The keys are highlighted to match the userdefined scale and the notes overview have been moved on to the timeline as it no longer needed for navigating around the project And similar to grandtophone the velocity it could be volume or filtergate depending no the plugin i think of each key is determined by how close user hit the vertical middle of said key This way the playing dynamics can be more expressive and reliable AND can be supported by more devices since it doesnt reqpuire D touch or other fancy hardware to function Another idea though a bit borderline featureCreep is that first key could become like a editable helddown buttons to add another layer of expressions like adding sustain or tremolo to the currently playing notes I might or might not be influenced by the Ondophone making this things that people might find difficult to pull off on a touch screen Untitled The Keyboard menu could contains options to change octaves customise the keyswitchthings and maybe the option to hide all the offscale notes in case the keys are too cramped Untitled Overall I think that it would increase the creative process of users a lot as they can quickly place notes in recordings or just to test out a melody of sorts EDITs Up the quality of pictures also just pretending that no one had read this and casually rewrite moreorless the whole thing So I just discovered this project and it feels like it could be really useful if I spent enough time with it but my muscle memory from a decade of using other programs is tripping me up pretty bad right now and I have a few questions Im using the current bit Windows master build Things I LOVE The circular chord tool I keep inserting random notes by mistake though The way you can use the arrow keys to nudge notes around Thats a really interesting concept and if there was a modifier key that let you edit length too itd be perfect The fact that its just a single EXE with no installer I wish more programs did this hats off to you Things that frustrate me Are there keyboard shortcuts for switching between the tools For example Sekaiju another somewhat minimalistic MIDI editor binds D to draw E to erase and S to select allowing for quick input correction of mistakes and shifting around of notes When I press space the playhead moves a few pixels and freezes for about a second before continuing on Can you toggle the quillnote insert behavior to change start position and not length I get how you might think this is better UI design but its just making my skin crawl Or alternately use a modifier key Why is there a paint roller button that changes which lines are highlighted Why is there a button for deleting notes when you can just use the delete key on your keyboard Are any of these buttons and functions documented OpenMPT has a really good wiki that has helped me countless times Hi awesome project I really would like to use Helio as a way to sequence external synths Is it possible to send the note and velocity data out a normal midi jack of an external sound card I found the MIDI Output in the settings of a loaded VST plugin but no way to configure the port etc Thank you J Software Version Helio Workstation v x Portable Export File MIDMIDI Issue Sound levels too low on export When exporting any song I input to MIDI or MID the output volume is far lower than when Im editing any song making it incredibly difficult to hear any songs when I choose to publish them after the export I can however export to WAV convert that and have no problem with the audio levels when playing them back Hi im experimenting with eg Kushview Element VST HOST only modular design a lot but it lacks of a Midi Sequencer It would be absolutely great if there comes a VST version of Helio workstation near future Any plans like that mfg Cris Add a window about the program This step allows users to identify project information host new contributors and even an error reporting button and a donation button Add a window to collect error information and send it to the team to correct the problem With the possibility to allow the user to comment on the problem from the same windowdialog Added support for dealing with audio files such as MP and support for dealing with quotes tools from known programs such as Audacity and Ardur And LMMS Alt only splits a note but doesnt allow to move parts
