Please consider merging This allows routable to be used with custom presentations if I want to use tabBarController as rootVeiwControllerWhat should I do please idinitWithRouterParamsNSDictionary params if self self initWithNibNamenil bundlenil selftitle Modal return self The above code in the Swift how to write In UIViewController controllerForRouterParamsRouterParams params method use performselector to excute will be lead memory leak viewController will not be excute dealloc method so I use nsInvocation replace the performselector In UIViewController controllerForRouterParamsRouterParams params method use performselector to excute will be lead memory leak viewController will not be excute dealloc method so I use nsInvocation replace the performselector hi man why not add a method just like mapNSString format toControllerNSString controllerClassName so that the user dont need to add import ControllerClassh ks All tests pass fine when run in iOS but in iOS the above tests fails on the assert XCTAssertTrue USERID isEqualToString Should have an empty ID It looks like USERID is coming through as an empty string I tried poking around but couldnt see why this would be happening I recently had the need to stack multiple modal navigation controller in my app Therefore I added a shouldDismissPresentedViewController property to the options to enable this functionality in my app Maybe someone else finds that functionality useful Hey Clay Nice stuff this is cool code Thanks for making it available How would you handle thinks like routing exceptions But that I dont mean thrown exceptions but rather something show the usersid mapped view controller in a modal EXCEPT if some condition holds then show it in some other way For example if something in a nav controller already showing in a modal asks to show the users controller in a modal maybe the users controller should just be pushed on the stack of the nav controller inside the existing modal instead of dismissing or presenting another modal Thoughts Id be happy to help with a PR but Im just curious as to your thoughts on this because this is such a nicelyarchitected piece of code Thanks
