Maybe I should write a macro I am running ihaskell in ein and the haskell kernel loads fine and ihaskell works fine but for some reason the autocompletion is not activated automatically is something broken or do i need to enable some settings i dont know if something like companymode needs to be setup or not if you could help me fix this thanks Problem description einjupyterserverstart Command

Wrong type argument einnotebook nil and I cannot save notebooks Does anyone have similar issue Hi I installed the latest release of ein and I get the following error when I try C ie undo Error ein Undo failure diagnostic nil nil nil nil nil t f f f I can provide more information if this is not enough Thanks Bilyan As described in the title Emacs freezes after calling einworksheettoggleslidetype while the cell has type markdown EIN version Emacs version When I open a notebook in EIN I cannot undo anything in the cells Instead I get the error message usererror No undo information in this buffer I have seen thats why I add the following A In the Warnings buffer I get Warning ein Disabling undo for setmarkcommand B I tried to set explicitly setq einworksheetenableundo t closed the notebook restarted the server reopened the notebook and added a new cell wit new content but no avail On Mx undo I still get usererror No undo information in this buffer C I tried to switch the cell type to markdown but that doesnt make any difference to the undo behaviour What can I do Is there a way to inform EIN of the current screen dpi so that it can keep plots the same size across different computers In Jupyter notebook inline matplotlib plots scale reasonably with changes in screen size and resolution my work computer has a large dpi screen while my Surface Pro has a little dpi screen yet plots are readable on either Jupyter notebook is reading the screen dpi and uses it to keep plots a more or less constant number of inches tall and wide But EIN seems to render inline plots at a fixed number of pixels plots look fine on the dpi screen and are unreadably small on the dpi screen Is there an EIN variable or customization I can set that controls the number of pixels covered by a plot or better yet is there an EIN setting for dpi so that EIN calculates the number of pixels iself I have configured Jupyter on my machine with teh name jupnode to be accessible from other machines eg I set cNotebookAppip Therefore jupyter notebook outputs on startup the full local domain of the server eg I NotebookApp However for some networkDNS reasons which I cannot change is on jupnode itself not accessible only and work So my question is How can I configure einjupyterserverstart running in Emacs on jupnode to start Jupyter but not to parse out the URL from the command output but use instead Hi Love EIN and thank you for all the efforts in making it a great tool Im currently having an issue with obein My current setup is Windows Emacs EIN and Anaconda The problem ipynb files default to using the data virtual environment but obein source blocks default to using Anaconda root environment Steps to reproduce open command line prompt activate data environment start Emacs from the cmd run Mx einrun in Emacs open an org file type the following NAME Python sanity check beginsrc einpython session localhost testipynb results raw drawer import sys sysexecutable endsrc get the following which is the default python path for Anaconda RESULTS Python sanity check results C Program Files x Microsoft Visual Studio Shared Anaconda pythonexe end Im able to run einrun in Emacs and editrun cells without a problem in a notebook That is the notebook will default to using the pythonexe in the data environment Steps to mitigate the problem Since the code above was actually saved in the testipynb the following manual fix mitigates the problem open the testipynb notebook click the kernel option on the top left corner of the testipynb buffer change kernel to python which is under the data environment go back to the source block in org file run Cc Cc again get the following RESULTS Python sanity check results C Users username AppData Local conda conda envs data pythonexe end Further Because Just specifying urlorport executes your source block in a single anonymous notebook I was not able to fix this source block NAME Python sanity check beginsrc einpython session localhost results raw drawer import sys sysexecutable endsrc RESULTS Python sanity check results C Program Files x Microsoft Visual Studio Shared Anaconda pythonexe end Thanks
