Im trying obtain account that I need to access in order to create my new business purchase a home and get all that owed and items I have either inherited things that I may purchaseand ir gifts that were give to me through a rd party Thank you Josh TED The Android Gradle plugin supports bundling proguard rules as part of the library so users wont need to do anything This is great because users dont need to worry about keeping their file up to date I saw you have updated androix support but it does not upload to jcenter can you finish this sdk WebViewAppLinkResolver google play webView SSLError See if you havent submitted it for a long time Would you like to ask if you will continue to update this library What happens when a task is running and activity or fragment is closed or paused continueWhile no longer creates long task dependency chain The state machine adds each continuation individually allowing garbage collection to collect the used tasks continueWhile no longer runs when the parent task is failed or cancelled and no longer swallows the error which allows the error to be caught by another continuation Add Chinese READMEmd This is more of a performance or memory leakresource management item but as far as I can tell the way continueWhile is written will effectively create a chain of tasks that will keep growing each iteration until the loop completes In a small loop this probably does not matter but in a long running or infinite loop this grows indefinitely until failure I believe this can be prevented by using a completion source to manage reporting loop completion and avoiding continueWithTask or related anything that chains the thens together The continuation could be rewritten as a Taskboolean returning method so returning false ends the loop the result of each iteration would use continueWith and proxy the error to the task completion source or dispatch the next iteration if result is good Below is my code dependencies compile comfacebookandroidfacebookandroidsdk compile comparseparseandroid compile comparseboltsboltstasks compile comparseboltsboltsapplinks private void appLevelLangfinal Context cntxt if db null db new DataBaseHelpercntxt try final ParseQueryParseObject query ParseQuerygetQueryappSupportedLanguages querysetLimit Date dbLastUpdatedDate dbgetLastUpdateDateOfTableappSupportedLanguages if dbLastUpdatedDate null querywhereGreaterThanupdatedAt dbLastUpdatedDate queryorderByAscendingupdatedAt queryfindInBackgroundnew FindCallbackParseObject Override public void doneListParseObject applvlLangList ParseException e if e null if applvlLangListsize String lastUpdatedDate ParseQueriesgetNSDateFormatterUpdateAtForParseformatapplvlLangListgetapplvlLangListsize getUpdatedAt for ParseObject p applvlLangList AppLevelLanguage appLevelLanguage new AppLevelLanguage appLevelLanguageobjectID pgetObjectId appLevelLanguagekey pgetStringkey appLevelLanguageupdatedAt lastUpdatedDate ArrayListString arrLangColNames ArrayListString ParseConfiggetCurrentConfiggetsupportedLanguages for String strLangCode arrLangColNames pgetStringstrLangCode appLevelLanguagelangHashMapputstrLangCode pgetStringstrLangCode dbinsertOrUpdateAppSupportedLanguageTableappLevelLanguage if applvlLangListsize querygetLimit appLevelLangcntxt else Logd AppSupportedLanguages is not equal to limit else LogdAppSupportedLanguages Error egetMessage catch Exception e eprintStackTrace This is my new ProjectThe above similar code is running my older project
