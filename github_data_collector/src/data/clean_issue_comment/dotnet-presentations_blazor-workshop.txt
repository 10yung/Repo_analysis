Creating configurePizza object doesnt require the last property to have a comma Following the section Ensuring authentication before placing an order I get these errors shown on console very briefly and i have already completed the tutorial Error parsing a meta elements content is not a valid keyvalue pair separator Please use instead At authenticate And a error with an x in a red circle Refused to load the image httpsapitwittercomfaviconico necause it violates the following Content Security Policy directive imgsrc httpsabstwimgcom httpstwimgcom data At authenticate It hapens when the line of code NavigationManagerNavi runs code CascadingParameter TaskAuthenticationState AuthenticationStateTask get set protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync var authState await AuthenticationStateTask if authStateUserIdentityIsAuthenticated The server wont accept orders from unauthenticated users so avoid an error by making them log in at this point NavigationManagerNavigateTousersigninredirectUricheckout true Leave PlaceOrder unchanged here If i coment the NavigationManagerNavi line the error doesnt show in console so must be something in that line but i dont know what The user controller class runs on the server so if there is some error there it shouldnt show up that way in the browser console Maybe it is something to do with this code inside the user controller at usersignin route await HttpContextChallengeAsync TwitterDefaultsAuthenticationScheme new AuthenticationProperties RedirectUri redirectUri This has nothing to do with Blazor its about aspnet core authorization but even so its in the demo so maybe worth to fix Or maybe its not a big deal because the application works fromthe from the Im following this workshop with net core from session doc This uses OnParametersSet instead of OnInitialized or OnInitializedAsync OnParametersSet is another component lifecycle method and it fires when the component is first instantiated and any time its parameters change value If the user clicks a link directly from myorders to myorders the framework will retain the OrderDetails instance and simply update its OrderId parameter in place As it happens we havent provided any links from one my orders screen to another so the scenario never occurs in this application but its still the right lifecycle method to use in case we change the navigation rules in the future but when I switch between pages as follows myorders myorders via inputing url in browser it seems that OrderDetails component will always reinitialized Is this doc outdated or do i something wrong Hello is due by January and is out since the beginning of December Could you plan to upgrade this blazorworkshop to a x version with NET Standard please Could you add some screen shots showing how to configure new keys from the Twitter developer console After order is delivered no need to keep calling api to get status I have built the solution in VS then run BlazingPizza Server Debug the console started ok And Edge has appeared with address but it gives an error This site can t provide a secure connectionlocalhost sent an invalid response Try running Windows Network Diagnostics ERRSSLPROTOCOLERROR How to fix it Im using Visual Studio Code and in the second preview document we are told to add the code for showing the dialog window ConfigurePizzaDialog but theres an error or tokenization issue that says this is an unexpected name and if its intended to be a component then add a using directive for its namespace Not sure what the namespace should be which is why Im using this to learn Blazor
