 Executing commands on the command line takes a couple of seconds more when ohmygit is enabled in a repository With ohmygit enables running time git st real m s user m s sys m s And without ohmygit on the same repo real m s user m s sys m s Also just hitting enter on the cmd line it takes about seconds for the prompt to release I tried in my mac terminal and iTerm and results were the same Any suggestions to fix this please Thank you I fear this repo has been abandoned and it looks like this issue has been addressed in some previous pull requests which have not been accepted or closed But the fix seems simple to me so Ill risk my time by offering it again My fix just involves doing a full reset and then setting only the foreground color before emitting the last character I havent run across any terminal emulators in any colorenabled modes where this doesnt work If Ive missed some cases where this wont work please share the specifics Hi Is it possible to implement it in git bash for windows Most of the characters show up fine and it looks good however the last character is missingmalformed ohmygit issue Also Im not sure what is up with the fancy f on the left Im on Ubuntu using the standard gnome terminal Git will complain if you call git config with local switch outside a git repo This check reverts back to default lookup which will end up being global if not inside a git repo the word standard misspelled in the README The bashprompt function was not preserving the return code between calls to it If other PROMPTCOMMAND executions were to rely on the return code say to change the value of a variable that would be substituted into the PS value to indicate the return code this would be broken causing such functions to break This change preserves the return code such that the subsequent prompt command executions can take advantage of the value of the prior executed commands return arialdomartini could you please help me set my ohmygit Error After installing ohmygit as per the link below My terminal always displays with below code can you suggest me what I am doing worng KwhiteFblack KwhiteFblack KwhiteFyellow KwhiteFred KwhiteFred KwhiteFred KwhiteFblack KwhiteFblack KwhiteFblack KwhiteFred KwhiteFblackKwhiteFred KredFwhite KredFblackKredFblack KredFblackmaster origin KredFblack kFred kf ohmygitissue Notes Fedora I had zsh and ohmyzsh installed prior and working fine and wanted to install ohmygit and use oppalanastylezshthem I came across something weird I am on MacOSX High Sierra with its plain bash and iTerm the weird thing is I log in I cd into a repo nothing happens then I manually source bashprofile and everything is working fine Ive added echos here and there and everything is sauced correctly at login but the prompt does not appear until I source a second time does not matter from which directory
