As mentioned hie is working well in neovim now Details are in this blog Vim and Haskell in marcolopescomarticlesVimandHaskellin Hence why not replace ghcmod Id like to disable the automatic removal of blank space at the ends of lines in my Haskell code so I can better control the resultant formatting of the Haddock generated documentation by forcing line breaks using two blank spaces at the end of a line Does anyone know which plugin is responsible for removing blank space at the end of lines when writing out the file So weird noob question When I just write Haskell code which file or line of code is responsible for indenting where clauses and guards for example Hey guys Im sorry to bother you but my Vim is now broken No other language is now recognised and many of my commands dont work anymore And the commands you state dont work either although most likely I dont event know how to use them its not documented Also installation took around h of my i processor at full power all the time looping over all possible lts versions only to fail at installing ghcmod in all of them and taking gb of my SSD I have no idea where And now I dont even find an option to uninstall and revert back to my previous vim Working on Ubuntu in the Windows Linux Subsystem for Windows last update as of today Using this issue as a brainstormingfeedback on caching the Haskell helper binaries Installing the helper binaries is currently the big wrinkle in the whole haskellvimnow install process and is tricky to get right with the current approach of using stack to dependency solve all of them in one fell swoop The helper binaries are also the most timeconsuming part of the whole install especially when we have to download different versions of GHC to build subsets of them Was thinking itd be nice to have CI build all the helper binaries for various OSes and upload them to github releases We could then get rid of the complicated brittle code in setuphaskellhs and replace it with a download and unzip of a zip file with all the needed binaries This would cut the install time down considerably it would probably only take minutes total instead of the minutes clean install now and would reduce complexity in the install Users may have concerns with installing a bunch of binaries from a zip but we could point them to the repospot where they are generated for further audit Something Im not sure of if we use Travis to build binaries on a Trusty box for example can those same linux binaries be run on the other Linux distributions haskellvimnow supports Ive been unsuccessfully trying to install vimstylishhaskell with regard to Customizing blobmasterREADMEmdcustomizing section Unfortunately it isnt obviously to me which of three mentioned file Ive to use So I sequentially used all three with the same content below call plugbeginvimpluginsextra Plug gitgithubcomnbouscalvimstylishhaskellgit call plugend It appears to me the vim behavior is the same by using vimrclocal or pluginsvim PlugInstall shows only vimstylishhaskell Already installed vimrclocalpre seems to be ignored at all PlugInstall shows all except vimstylishhaskell gitignore Already installed vimextradite Already installed vimprocvim Already installed tslimevim Already installed nerdtree Already installed hlintrefactorvim Already installed vimindentobject Already installed vimhaskellConcealPlus Already installed vimbbye Already installed vimcommentary Already installed vimfugitive Already installed tagbar Already installed vimmundo Already installed Align Already installed tabular Already installed ghcmodvim Already installed neomake Already installed vimairline Already installed vimbracketedpaste Already installed vimindentguides Already installed vimeasymotion Already installed wombat vim Already installed necoghc Already installed ctrlpvim Already installed vimtmuxnavigator Already installed vimhoogle Already installed supertab Already installed haskellvim Already installed Installing helper binaries stack resolver lts install ghcmod installghc verbosity warning Plan construction failed stack resolver lts install ghcmod installghc verbosity warning failed with error setuphaskellhs failed with error Aborting A coworker got me hooked on fzf Interested in a PR to replace ctrlp with fzf Another nice bit fzf can use ripgrep as the backing search tool for searching the contents of files and it is super fast Ive been exclusively using ripgreppowered fzf for code searching recently The y and p key sequences work from the MacVim GUI but not when I run vim from a tmux terminal Im finding that the bo key sequence does not close all other buffers It simply reports Already only one window
