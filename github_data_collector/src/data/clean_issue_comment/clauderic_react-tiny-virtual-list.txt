The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

Security Alerts page details Hi Ive investigated how virtuallization of Instagram works and saw that they are not using position absolute at the children not updating children positioning styles at all instead they changing paddingtop paddingbottom of the parent container SUPER COOOL WSdq kVC WDYT can we refactor this lib to something similar See This is the minimum change required for React compatibility The warning thrown by React for reference Warning componentWillReceiveProps has been renamed and is not recommended for use See for details Move data fetching code or side effects to componentDidUpdate If youre updating state whenever props change refactor your code to use memoization techniques or move it to static getDerivedStateFromProps Learn more at Rename componentWillReceiveProps to UNSAFEcomponentWillReceiveProps to suppress this warning in nonstrict mode In React x only the UNSAFE name will work To rename all deprecated lifecycles to their new names you can run npx reactcodemod renameunsafelifecycles in your project source folder I added an iframe as one of the rows in the list and set it to be sticky while the sticky works the iframe sits on top making its wrapper zindex instead of fixed it But when I start to fast scroll I can see the sticky container iframe showing through when its not rendering I also noticed if you use the lists scrollbar I dont see any gapsunrendered content but if i scroll fast with the trackpad i can see lots of gaps my row content is not complex just a few divs and text This is a request It would be good to separate core idea from react implementation so it can be used with other frameworks like vue etc but mostly important without any just plain dom As long as I see this lib is the most powerful and lightweight among other virtual list In my case I use the onScroll function to load new list items Using scrollToIndex the onScroll function is not called and it seems that the list is complete but it is not like this I tried to trigger the scroll event but it didnt work Is there a way to solve this problem Thanks I have this problem with my list actually this is my render funct div style height
