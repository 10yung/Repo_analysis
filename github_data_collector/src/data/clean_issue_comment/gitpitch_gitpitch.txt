It seems that hypertext links are not exported properly to powerpoint format It seems to be exported as formatted text without any link Note it works with PDF export It would be nice to have an ability to include another PITCHMEyaml in PITCHMEyaml Implementation Just use simple include key with path to another PITCHMEyaml For simplicity and consistency with other features the path is relative to the repository root include PITCHMEyaml Reasoning Some settings in PITCHMEyaml can be specific for presentations som other settings can be global For example there will be master PITCHMEyaml in the root of the repository where will be specified colors fonts code highlighting style custom CSS etc In general there would be global designtheme settings And there will be another PITCHMEyaml next to the presentation itself next to PITCHMEmd In this yaml file we can just include the master yaml and addupdate other setting For example yml include PITCHMEyaml Global settings for all my presentsations Every presentation has its own title title My Super Presentation I want different logos for different presentations or maybe I do not want any logo in some logo Things to consider Depth of including Again for simplicity I believe that it is enough to support just one level of include the same as including PITCHMEmd files So included PITCHMEyaml cannot contain include key In general I think that mostly the include will be at the begining of the file But i should be clear the behavior if the include is somewher in the middle Possibilities Force the include if present to be the first key in yaml Show error if it is not the case Allow include to be anywhere but always process it first So local settings will always override global settings even if they are before the include Allow include to be anywhere and process the files from top to bottom So process settings in local file then include global file and process that it may override already set settings Then process the rest of local file which will override any previous settings This is probably the expected behavior Ive got a custom font in an OTF file that I would really like to use in my gitpitch presentation Normally in a CSS file I would load it like this fontface fontfamily MyCustomFont src urlsomelocalpathtofontsMyCustomFontotfrawtrue fontweight bold or fontface fontfamily MyCustomFont src url fontweight bold for a local file and a file from a url respectively Now unfortunately neither of these option is currently possible For the local option the reason is probably that the gitpitch bundle that is compiled does not look for fonts but I might be wrong my underthehoodunderstanding is limited and the remote option the reason is a crossorigin error and a reliance on remote resources that is undesirable for local presentations As the latter reason is rather fundamental the way forward is probably to scan for local files and compile them with the rest I wanted to submit a feature request There was no specific template for it so I took these sample issue templates from one of my projects What thisll do is to let a user automatically select one of these option after clicking issue and it will give a prefilled text Similar to promenushidden but for speakerpresenter mode From my perspective after I perform a presentation I want to publish it for my audience But I dont want to share my speaker notes because these are more unpolished adhoc thoughts Currently there are two ways to handle this create two branches one witch speak notes and one without use modular markdown and have two separate markdown files with and without speak notes In both cases we need to duplicate our slides and remove speak notes in one branchmodule Additionally if we want to make further changes we must make them in both places so maintenance becomes tiresome With speakermodehidden I could just set it to true on my master branch and publish it From my experience I always use a desktop version to present my decks in case of problems with the internet so I can just set it to false locally Even if someone wants to use an online version for presenting he can still set it to true on another branchmodule without whole duplication In practice speakermodehidden property could just block opening speaker window for all users When I try to tab through the slide deck online eg it goes into the GitPitch menu even though its not open I have an issue with indentation of a numbered list I have this list ol false Item subitem subitem item olend This shows as Item subitem subitem item Tried different numbers of indentations and empty lines but still the numbering is wrong Id like to define and register a custom highlightjs language Hi thanks for building gitpitch am trying gitpitch out for the second time and especially the outcome I like a lot At this moment I am a lot of slower still though compared to working with pp etc But I hope that will change The reason for this post Is it possible to automatically create a reference list slides at the end of the presentations using biblatex like eg in Rmarkdownpandoc markdown Unrelated to that a question If I write a slide with several bulletpoints I noticed that in case I write too many the fontsize is not automatically scaled down like it would be in eg pp Is that normal or am I doing something wrong Generally this is a nice reminder of keeping it simple with only few points per slide but still What is the easiest way of setting a smaller fontsize for a whole slide I found size em example in an example slide but I guess this is meant to only use for a small sentence or keywords Thanks Feature request add TTS capability Text to speech would be useful in presentations Also it would be nice for visually impaired people
