the RoomLayoutTypes which is in the line in the matlabgetLSUNResm is missed where can I find it Will mixedprecision be able to accommodate the gb in gb since using fp essentially doubles the VRAM Where can I find the LSUN toolkit to further processfinetune my results corner locations on perspective images as stated here Im trying Matlab scripts but preprocessPanom requires panoedgetr Could you show how to run it properly preprocessPano panoaadmuaxyxouqic Error using load Unable to read file data panoedgetr vp panoaadmuaxyxouqicmat No such file or directory Error in preprocessPano line load data panoedgetr vp imname mat Instead of generating one room layout from one panorama Im wondering if LayoutNet can generate a complete floor plan from multiple panoramas Thank you JJ Is there any way to use this logic to make a d box from single RGB image of indoor room without panorama like of this image room Regards Hi thanks a lot for sharing your work I download your full approach model pretrained on the panoContext dataset and use it to predict on the test set of the panoContext dataset However I find that the results inferred by your pretrained model are and respectively while the results on the paper are and respectively I doubt wheter the pretrained model can obtain the results reported on the paper or whether I did something wrong Can u help me Thanks a lot Hi Thanks for sharing your work This is very interesting and has some great use cases With regard to the result is it possible to find the measurements of the actual room from the D reconstruction Or in other words how accurate is the d reconstruction in terms of wall width or length measurements to the actual room As shown below How to handle such memory issues My system has GB RAM Nvidia GTX M GB Core i th GEN screenshot from
