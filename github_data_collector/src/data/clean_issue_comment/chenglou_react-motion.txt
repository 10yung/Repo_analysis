The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

because modal component The time returned by performancenow which was used in componentDidMount and componentWillReceiveProps lifecycle functions to reset the animation can be greater than the timestamp of requestAnimationFrame raf callback Thus we got negative values for timeDelta By initializing and resetting prevTime with null instead and setting it to to the timestamp of the first requestAnimationFrame callback we can prevent negative values fixes nkbt I appreciate you have made a clear statement about how much time you can spend on this project but I would like to ask if you could make a release Hello After updating react and reactdom to v this warning appears reactdomdevelopmentjs Warning componentWillReceiveProps has been renamed and is not recommended for use See for details Move data fetching code or side effects to componentDidUpdate If youre updating state whenever props change refactor your code to use memoization techniques or move it to static getDerivedStateFromProps Learn more at Rename componentWillReceiveProps to UNSAFEcomponentWillReceiveProps to suppress this warning in nonstrict mode In React x only the UNSAFE name will work To rename all deprecated lifecycles to their new names you can run npx reactcodemod renameunsafelifecycles in your project source folder Please update the following components Motion According to the componentWillReceiveProps is now deprecated and will be removed from the API on the next major version
