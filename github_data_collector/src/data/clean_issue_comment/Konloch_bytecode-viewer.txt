Currently Bytecodeviewer show classes as splitted classes with symbol when it have large codes in it Its quite hard to analyze because you need to switch between them While this can be useful for smali it isnt useful for java app anyway Jadx can merge it automatically I would like to have that feature on Bytecodeviewer but rather have an option to merge into one manually Smali use different syntax parameter has been replaced with param We need to update smali decompiler Just got the following error Bytecode Viewer Version Preview Copy false Fat Jar true OS Windows Java javalangNullPointerException at thebytecodeclubbytecodeviewerBytecodeViewerresetRecentFilesMenuBytecodeViewerjava at thebytecodeclubbytecodeviewerBytecodeViewerBOOTBytecodeViewerjava at thebytecodeclubbytecodeviewerBytecodeViewermainBytecodeViewerjava Started happening with and continues to be an issue after updating to Ive been trying to run bytecode viewer on linux alpine but ran into some issues as it seems to require a graphic environment Tried both version and My first attempt direct execution java jar bcvjar help output Created by Konloch Bytecode Viewer FatJar true Exception in thread main javaawtHeadlessException No X DISPLAY variable was set but this program performed an operation which requires it at javaawtGraphicsEnvironmentcheckHeadlessGraphicsEnvironmentjava at javaawtWindowinitWindowjava at javaawtFrameinitFramejava at javaawtFrameinitFramejava at javaxswingJFrameinitJFramejava at thebytecodeclubbytecodeviewerapiExceptionUIinitExceptionUIjava at thebytecodeclubbytecodeviewerBytecodeViewermainBytecodeViewerjava Second attempt using the headless flag java jar Djavaawtheadlesstrue bcvjar help output Created by Konloch Bytecode Viewer FatJar true Exception in thread main javaawtHeadlessException at javaawtGraphicsEnvironmentcheckHeadlessGraphicsEnvironmentjava at javaawtWindowinitWindowjava at javaawtFrameinitFramejava at javaawtFrameinitFramejava at javaxswingJFrameinitJFramejava at thebytecodeclubbytecodeviewerapiExceptionUIinitExceptionUIjava at thebytecodeclubbytecodeviewerBytecodeViewermainBytecodeViewerjava Any ideas on how to workaround this Thanks A way to change code like you can change strings but this way to can slowly unobfusicate code Hi I opend a Jar made few changes and pressed on Compile The Compiler says that the compiling is done Then I pressed Save as jar and saved the file Now I opened the saved Jar into JDGUI for checking the Class Ive made the changes and as I see no changes effort Any Ideas why my code changes are not saved compiled into that new JAR I had a class open in Bytecode Viewer with Bytecode and Procyon views open This locked the files on disk on Windows which made it unable to recompile those files So there is somewhere a file handle leak that is not properly closed I just installed your tool and now found a big ugly BytecodeViewer in my home directory Please respect the XDG basedir specification instead Bytecode Viewer Version Preview Copy false Fat Jar true OS Windows Java javalangNullPointerException at thebytecodeclubbytecodeviewerBytecodeViewer runBytecodeViewerjava Bytecode Viewer Version Preview Copy false Fat Jar true OS Windows Java brutandrolibAndrolibException brutdirectoryDirectoryException Error copying file xml at brutandrolibAndrolibdecodeUnknownFilesAndrolibjava at brutandrolibApkDecoderdecodeApkDecoderjava at brutapktoolMaincmdDecodeMainjava at brutapktoolMainmainMainjava at thebytecodeclubbytecodeviewerutilAPKTooldecodeResourcesAPKTooljava at thebytecodeclubbytecodeviewerBytecodeViewer runBytecodeViewerjava Caused by brutdirectoryDirectoryException Error copying file xml at brutdirectoryDirUtilcopyToDirDirUtiljava at brutdirectoryAbstractDirectorycopyToDirAbstractDirectoryjava at brutandrolibAndrolibdecodeUnknownFilesAndrolibjava more Caused by javaioFileNotFoundException C Users testuser BytecodeViewer bcvtemp ubqBmVKCFHIgQcfikRtYhVTjvzEvjyFf Decoded Resources unknown xml Die Syntax f r den Dateinamen Verzeichnisnamen oder die Datentr gerbezeichnung ist falsch at javaioFileOutputStreamopen Native Method at javaioFileOutputStreamopenUnknown Source at javaioFileOutputStreaminitUnknown Source at javaioFileOutputStreaminitUnknown Source at brutdirectoryDirUtilcopyToDirDirUtiljava more APK can be downloaded here Bytecode Viewer Version Please send this to konlochgmailcom Bytecode Viewer Version javalangSecurityException BCV is awesome blockingfalse exec SystemLibraryFrameworksPythonframeworkVersions Python at thebytecodeclubbytecodeviewerSecurityMancheckExecSecurityManjava at javalangProcessBuilderstartProcessBuilderjava at thebytecodeclubbytecodeviewerdecompilersKrakatauDisassemblerdecompileClassNodeKrakatauDisassemblerjava at thebytecodeclubbytecodeviewerguiClassViewer doShitClassViewerjava at thebytecodeclubbytecodeviewerguiPaneUpdaterThreadrunPaneUpdaterThreadjava
