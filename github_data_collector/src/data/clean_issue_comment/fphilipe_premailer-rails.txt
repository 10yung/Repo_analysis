After extensive testing there should be no need to mess with the transfer encoding or the body encoding All we need to ensure is that the proper charset is configured in the ContentType header when assigning the body which needs to be the encoding of the string being set as the body Fixes By default premailer replaces HTML entites See This can sometimes change a message bodys encoding For example mdash is changed to and is no longer valid for bit transfer encoding The problem is premailerrails forces encoding and transferencoding to be that of the old body I think we should just remove lines and from This makes MailPart detect the right encoding and transfer encoding to use Note I saw this and I think the problem before was that we were setting transferencoding but not the encoding causing text to be mangled If we remove both I think it should work fine Also in our case since we dont want premailer to replace HTML entities we pass the outputencoding USASCII option as described here This turns nonASCII characters in the original body to HTMLencoded ones xxxx The resulting body is now valid for bit transfer encoding but premailerrails forces this to be quotedprintable the transfer encoding of the old body Removing the setting of encoding and transferencoding would fix both cases where the transformed body needs a more complex or simpler transfer encoding Heres the issue on our issue tracker for reference Hello Im using Webpacker on a new Rails project and I would like to use Premailer on my outbound emails Is there any current plan to support Webpacker Would you be open to PRs with a webpack strategy Currently there are directory traversal issues in the AssetPipelineLoader and FileSystemLoader Premailerrails will attempt to inline CSS from any local file This will only inline portions that are close enough to CSS to be returned but these strategies likely dont need to load files outside of predetermined paths Ex link relstylesheet typetextcss hrefassetsetcpasswd It seems that the AssetPipelineLoader could be restricted to valid asset paths for the application and the FileSystemLoader could be restricted to paths under public
