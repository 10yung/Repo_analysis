The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

code for my project specifically how to reuse your custom elements like basecard appsliders etc Im still relatively new to Angular code organization For example I tried to figure out how your basecard element finds its way into ChartsComponent and using that as an template for how to have basecard elements in my new pages It appears see diagram that this comes across via ThemeModule But when I clone all the files in charts and swap all chart names with say about to create a new About page I get nothing but errors like Template parse errors basecard is not a known element Do you have a stepbystep suggestion for how to create a new page that can leverage all your beautiful components matangdb diagram Issue type x bug feature request question about the decisions made in the repository Issue description When i built this project by command ng build for the test environmentthe result is normal and correctBut when i take the command ng build prod for the production environmentthe result always be wrongThe error Info is ERROR in Cant bind to htmlFor since it isnt a known property of ngcomponent If htmlFor is an Angular directive then add CommonModule to the NgModuleimports of this component To allow any property add NOERRORSSCHEMA to the NgModuleschemas of this component ERROR ngcomponentngcomponent I have downloaded the latest code and installed the dependencies i dont have any changement of the codebut i got the same error Related issues Fixes Changes proposed in this pull request Upgrade the angular versions to Bugfix in the file missing asterisk in package name added srcapppagespagesloginlogincomponentts import AuthService from services import AuthService from services Linting warnings removed Charts refactored due an errors in the console Bugfix in the upgrade of the corejs in the srcpolyfillsts file The imports have changed for corejs version for example import corejses array and import corejses array can now be provided simply by the following import corejsesarray Source This PR is for code review not for merging Related issues Changes proposed in this pull request Since lock files appeared in npm there is no valuable reason to use yarn anymore Expected behavior Upgrade angular version to Actual behavior Current version is xx Steps to reproduce the behavior Relevant code Expected behavior I should be able to select dropdown value smoothly in the form controls with just a single click Actual behavior We had to click the drop down twice to get the values listed Steps to reproduce the behavior Navigate to UI Forms Profile Info Location drop down and try to select a value I went and checked to verify if that was the case there as well But I dont see any issue there
