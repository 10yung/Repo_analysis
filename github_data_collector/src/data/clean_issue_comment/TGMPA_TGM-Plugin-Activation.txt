Downloaded theme is using tgmpa version I want to use same version in my personal plugin and because the theme one is loaded first the class TGMPluginActivation is declared from there I used Custom TGMPA Generator where I specified unique text domain and function prefix Name was generated from text domain My register hook is like this addaction tgmparegister pdregisterrequiredplugins function pdregisterrequiredplugins plugins array array name Hello Dolly slug hellodolly required false config array id plugindirector defaultpath menu pdtgmpainstallplugins parentslug pluginsphp capability manageoptions hasnotices true dismissable true dismissmsg isautomatic false message tgmpa plugins config And the issue is that the Hello Dolly plugin appeared in the theme plugin list So the parentslug in the plugins config is ignored and probably whole config is also ignored Hey guys i noticed in the activatesingleplugin function if a plugin requires update this function will still return true even if the plugin hasnt been activated Shouldnt this function return false if the plugin hasnt been activated due to any reason I would suggest return false in the thisdoespluginrequireupdate slug condition check After bulk installing all plugins I m redirected to a blank page It s the same with or without isautomatic activation enabled The plugins gets installed and actived though It s just a wrong redirection I m using version made with the custom TGMPA Generator php This file represents an example of the code that themes would use to register the required plugins It is expected that theme authors would copy and paste this code into their functionsphp file and amend to suit see for detailed documentation package TGMPluginActivation subpackage

from an arbitrary source one from a GitHub repository two from the org repo where one demonstrates the use of the iscallable argument The variables passed to the tgmpa function should be an array of plugin arrays optionally a configuration array If you are not changing anything in the configuration array you can remove the array and remove the variable from the function call tgmpa plugins In that case the TGMPA default settings will be used This function is hooked into tgmparegister which is fired on the WP init action on priority function viewsmallregisterrequiredplugins Array of plugin
