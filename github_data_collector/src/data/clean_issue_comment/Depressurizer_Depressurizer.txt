Dear Sir Thanks for all of your contributions to the project as Depressurizer was quite useful in the past and now half or more of its functions are obsolete thanks to Steam Valve integrated what once was only available via Depressurizer within their Internal Browser with the New UI so that Depressurizer is not needed anymore for the majority of the users especially novice as now Steam Client does it Better dont shoot the messenger for saying the truth Why One word as Dynamic Collections literally kills any need for Depressurizer as its lightning fast compared to all the shenanigans Depressurizer using with constant Needy application to ever manualy updating the SharedConfigvdf whereas new Steam Client does it OntheFly with unparalleled ease on users end making your baby now halfway defunct This is not a bad thing but a PRAISE to your application as Steam Valve recently also embedded half of functionality what Augmented Steam offers which is merely used now for ITAD Price checking as half of its functions are either implemented within Steam Servers or at test phase like So what now Simple as Time for a Change as its Adapt or Die situation at your hands for Depressurizer as Steam Library will also evolve taking more functionality from here By functionality Depressurizer already lost these Genre AutoCat Tags AutoCat Flags AutoCat at least half of it because they were Internal to Steam Data as Steam Client now does it AUTOmatically without the need for manual Depressurizer Update Cycles thanks to Dynamic Collections Whats left for Depressurizer is all Externalish to focus on functions like HowLong AutoCat User Score AutoCat Steam now uses Meta Score but expected to support User Scores as well Platform AutoCat even if its Internal Data Steam doesnt care again for now as VR has it Custom AutoCats such as Publishers Developers Curators and Language And thats why Depressurizer Future lies within those functions Steam will Never implement And even if Depressurizer now has SAME functions for now Steam Client has its time to remove or Update them so that theyll create Dynamic Collections instead of Scraping and doing manual labor for each entry which is totally Inferior to Dynamic Collections Humble suggestion is just to analyze current Steam Library actions over Sharedconfigvdf or other files involved to MiMic Dynamic Collections via Depressurizer Interface without actually scraping anything So instead of lost functionality remove such defunct code to Lighten the application more both in terms of Size and Speed and focus on Custom Filters where Depressurizer is still providing Unique Experience compared to Steam Client will ever will You can try to Resist but this wont change the inevitable as Steam actions made Discord take huge damage Enhanced Augmented Steam lessened Depressurizer being pushed away Why this plea Simple as long time not used your baby after spending weeks on manual updates to get nearing perfect arrangement on a thousands of games Steam library and now decided to reuse Depressurizer to make Final Changes to updated Library to see Depressurizer is what it always WAS with its bugs and so forth and it saddened me deeply As a Bug Report did you know that your Depressurizerv CANT import thousands of games data whereas Depressurizerv DID it without any complaints Sorry to say but when did such Downgrade began to happen even if Changelog says otherwise And even sadder to see both cant import data correctly so that even if Data is there within For Example Depressurizer CANT import Year AutoCat from whatever servers youre using as v got connected to a Akamai Node which Steam uses whereas v got connected to Elisa Oyj what Server for what purposes for same data with minutes apart of execution All because just wanted to use Year AutoCat for later bought games where thousands of games fallen into Unknown Text Again thanks for all of your hard work and contributions so far as this was an Abandoned Project that you Forked later merged took over with main as followed your progress through rSteam Even if above has lots of criticism its form of Tough Love as really dont want Depressurizer to become abandoned again in the light of Steam Library taking over your functionality Just suggesting to ADAPT so that Depressurizer can be better than ever focusing and improving whats left instead of trying to compete with Dynamic Collections Also even if Steam Client Library is a Web Script so that its Disabled with nobrowser switch unlike Old UI its Faster than Depressurizer supposed to be an Executable needing NET Framework Its still your choice but heed my warning Best Regards Windows Net installed Depressurizer latest Start the application and it throws a Fatal Error

the userdata folder starting Steam Beta will not show the new categories To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Close Steam Save profile Open Steam See error Desktop please complete the following information OS Windows The problem I have is that scraping my games will take forever because as of now scraping will crash with an exception after a few dozen games read known issue from what Ive read Wont it be possible that depressurizer has a database included Maybe there could be a possibility for users to submit their databases and then merge them Seems like a cool tool but unusable for me at the moment sadly Im not having any of the other issues people seem to be having with the beta My categories were not deleted However if any of them end with a and were generated using depressurizer I cant select them If I create a category in steam and end it with a it works fine Using depressurizer version I removed and edited some categories and export the config with steam closed then open steam and my edits do not appear to have been applied no change in collections area or on game pages Id guess they are storing the information differently now This closes This is a dirty implementation for including hardcoded nonreusable no tests etc I originally planned it as new functions or a new user option I see that the compression ratio is about which is huge Database writes are infrequent but it seems to occur at startup and perhaps multiple loops when a particular operation Thanks to Describe the bug Editing autocat from an old profile causes fatal error program will terminate To Reproduce EDIT AUTOCATS Select this autocat from the list Expected behavior Beeing able to at least view the autocat and fix the offending value Screenshots

and SSD loss Even with the fastest compression it still works well Describe the bug As title To Reproduce Start Depressurizer v whether or not to create a profile Wait you may manipulate other windows like Browser in maximized at the same time which may miss the Depressurizer windows Apply and fill the Steam web key Close and restart Depressurizer Clicking the Stop button in the download games list window when the key is asked Expected behavior NA Reenable thisShowIcon and ShowInTaskbar alleviates this problem but if you can show the main window and then load the profile LoadProfileSettingsProfileToLoad false in FormMainLoad it would be better If you can explain its utility and delay the filling of the key like option on profile it is friendly to newer users You are asked again about the key it is not saved it is troublesome It work though it does not continue This may be because ShowDialog in src Depressurizer CDlgUpdateProfilecs and it is called by LoadProfile
