homematthiasEntwicklungOpenHVmodshvbitsstarport png as length was a parameter during the array copying and had nothing to do with the input at all img width src This PR overhauls the Input tab in the settings menu with three goals in mind Make left vs right click control schemes discoverable and understandable This is IMO a key prerequisite for and was the main motivation of this work This is also why Ive added the dependency label and milestone assignment Fix the right click orders right click scrolling problem to unblock The two mouse scrolling types have been merged into one which now defaults to the Joystick mode which is mapped to middle mouse in the Modern scheme and right or optionally middle mouse in the Classic scheme I have also clarified the terminology for scroll vs pan vs zoom because it didnt make sense to have N instances where we used scroll to mean pan but then talk about using the scroll wheel to zoom Prepare for trackpad gestures This is really an extension of the second point the previous mess regarding mouse scrolling meant that there was no intuitive way to introduce the gesture support without adding even more scroll configuration options The tab is arranged with the settings that impact the control scheme description are aboveto the right The settings that dont are placed below I have reserved space to the right to add a Touch PadScreen Gestures checkbox enabling this would disable MMBRMB panning change the zoom description to Zoom the battlefield using a Pinch gesture and change the pan description to Pan the battlefield using a Scroll gesture I noticed after implementing the new layout that the DisplayAudioInputAdvanced tabs were all coincidentally the same height with an awkward amount of empty space along the bottom due to the Hotkeys tab These have now been straightened out Nearly every time I enter the lobby the first thing I do is to go to the music tab start a track then pause it This hack allows me to stop the background music I do this because often I have to sit in the lobby for long periods of time during which I want to be hearing chat beeps but not the background music Someone was asking about this on discord recently and I realized that players may not be aware of this hack An option could be added to mute the background music in lobbies and maybe also in the menu in general It gets weirder the higher the zoom level As noted in the color validator is not very restrictive and allows very similar colors both to the terrain and other players This PR takes the groundwork laid by and gives us some rewarding features to justify the hard slog The changes here should noticeably improve rendering quality on systems with more than DPI This also implements most of the remaining work towards The first few commits fix issues that become obvious at fractional scales and allows UI sprites icons color pickers to be cleanly rendered which should also help with The final two commits enable our new higher resolution UI artwork and finally removes the DisableWindowsDPIScaling workaround that made everything blurry for many Windows players This can be tested on Windows by running the game with different system DPI scales It can be tested on Linux by launching with fractional OPENRADISPLAYSCALE values eg Testing on macOS can show that we correctly switch between different sheets when moving the window between standard and Retina Displays Followup PRs will enable higher resolution badge artwork which needs to be coordinates with forum changes add the UI Scale option to the settings and enable automatic DPI detection on Linux The highly awaited sequel to exactly one year after the original I slightly increased the time between waves on the hardest difficulty making it beatable without requiring excessive effort I can easily beat it before the reinforcements arrive Additionally I decreased the waiting time for the reinforcements to minutes are just really long and most of the time youll have completed the mission already by that time The maximum wait time is now minutes Other changes include A display for when the next reinforcements arrive You can no longer sell the starport the one you have to guard at all costs and still win Code refactors
