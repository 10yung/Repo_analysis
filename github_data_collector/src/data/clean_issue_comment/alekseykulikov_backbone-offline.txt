 Backboneiobind is another popular js library that overwrites the sync method How do I use backboneoffline and backboneiobind together I have collections drivers id name address etc facility id name address etc delivery id driverid facilityid date etc if offline a I add a new driverbboffline creates a localid and sidnew b then create a new delivery using the driver created in athe deliverydriverid field will have the driverlocalid value How do I insure that on sync the driver is updated firstand then the deliverydriverid is updated with the driversid value once assigned Im using collections which persist in memory IE not recreated each time I use them However when I fetch a new model from the server the collection gets add events Flow seems to be call fetch get JSON from server save to Localstorage collection add event Then do something else and then call fetch again collection add event So you get another add event even though there is no new data If you call fetch a rd time you dont get another add event IE you get the event precisely twice Further information The model in step has a cid but it doesnt have an sid or internal guid The model in step does However at step the object in localstorage does have an sid So the following seems to be happening a download model from server b save to localstorage with new attributes c add model with server attributes Maybe it should add to collection with the same attributes that are saved to localstorage Happy to fix this myself Please direct me to the relevant functions in the source Best Dalip Hi there Ive got a collection thats got the thisstorage set with autoPush as per the instructions but when I save an individual model from that collection it sends a PUT without the id attribute It is looking for the sid which if I set manually before saving will successfully be appended to the PUT URL eg but the sent data doesnt include an id attribute only an sid eg somdatatrue updatedat datetime sid sidvalue Am I meant to be receiving id in the PUT thanks When using collectionstoragesyncpush call no API call is made to sync the data on the server When using someCollectionstoragesyncpush nothing happens no Ajax call is made Hello I saw that there was an ObjectId generator in the lib how one is supposed to pass the option to use it Thanks Updated parameters passed to ajax callback functions to work with latest backbonejs and query Creates duplicate records if id is string we are using id as uuid which returned as string for every fetch it creates a duplicate record In the model if default value for id assigned then it creates only one duplicate record defaults id null
