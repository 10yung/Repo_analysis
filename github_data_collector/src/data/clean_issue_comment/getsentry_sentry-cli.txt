The old version of the httpsproxyagent dependency depends on an old version of agentbase which causes breakage in other unrelated packages due to https patching Similar to Root issue This exposes code and debug IDs from difutil check and hides the difutil id command It also changes the JSON format for the difutil check command which is a backwards incompatible change For past several days Im trying to upload dsym files to our selfhosted sentry dSYMs folder is extracted from xcarchive Tried with uploaddsym and uploaddif and getting same result Note token domain name and app name are changed to APITOKEN MYDOMAIN and MYAPP We are using sentry v and sentrycli Command Im using is sentrycli authtoken APITOKEN url uploaddif org sentry project ios dSYMsMYAPPappdSYM And getting result Found debug information files Prepared debug information files for upload Uploaded missing debug information files error Some uploaded files are now missing on the server Please retry by running sentrycli uploaddif again If this problem persists please report a bug Add loglevel infodebug or export SENTRYLOGLEVEL infodebug to see more output Please attach the full debug log to all bug reports With

retry by running sentrycli uploaddif again If this problem persists please report a bug DEBUG client close no transport to shut down from sentry Git is decentralised so its usual to have several remote repositories Origin is usually the default remote repository but its not mandatory Sentrycli only allowed to use the remote repository origin when working with commits during a release It is now possible to set the remote name in the configuration file or as environment variable In sentryclirc defaultsvcsremote In env SENTRYVCSREMOTE If not provided defaults to origin so its backwardcompatible Steps to reproduce mkdir sentrycli cd sentrycli npm init npm install sentrycli save Error npm install sentrycli save npm ERR code ELIFECYCLE npm ERR errno npm ERR sentrycli install

Installing v works fine I stumbled upon this problem while installing exposentry which requires it Tested on Windows x Hey there Im trying to upload my bundle sourcemaps but I always end up with this

release like this sentrycli releases new RELEASEVERSION Then I upload the files like this sentrycli releases files RELEASEVERSION uploadsourcemaps buildpublic rewrite I read somewhere that the release name cant be too big so I tried with a short hash such as a e dc c c and I still get the same error I have both a appbundlejs and a appbundlejsmap in the buildpublic that get recognized by the cli according to the logs Analyzing sources Rewriting sources Adding source map references Uploading source maps for release a e dc c c The releases are created correctly the only thing is that the artifacts are never available Screenshot at I will be happy to provide any other info if needed Thanks in advance With sentrycli installed on ios the metro bundler tries to reach the bundle by expecting it to have a ios extension while for a lot of people there is none Metro bundler logs GET indexiosbundleplatformios devtrue HTTP sentrycli Error Unable to resolve module indexios from

An organization slug is required provide with org Then I run sentrycli releases list org myorgname and get error Found argument org which wasnt expected or isnt valid in this context The documents says it could be a relative path start with or absolute path with host and will used to replace host inside abspath was the key of uploaded source map not being used But this make things confused Files was uploaded to Sentry and looks like this
