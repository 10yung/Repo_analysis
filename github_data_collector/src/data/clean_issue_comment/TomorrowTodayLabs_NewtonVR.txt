 at AssetsNewtonVRNVRPlayercs NewtonVRNVRPlayerAwake at AssetsNewtonVRNVRPlayercs Tried to use it with Oculus Quest which uses the same OVR SDK but it was super frustrating There was no support in the editor I would expect to use FPS movement controls in the editor like in VRTK but youre just stuck with a floor level camera I tried to build the project and run it on the quest and also stuck at floor level on the Camera I moved the NVRPlayerHead game object up and that worked but nothing I tried enabled the hands or any kind of controller support let alone joystick movement I even tried dragging the sphere prefab in and nothing worked Also I would expect it to detect my height and use that properly or at least use the height of the prefab robot guy Remove massbased article link Link is dead Rearrange words to improve readability Items can be configured to be picked up at any point or when grabbed can rotate and position themselves to match a predefined orientation Items can be configured to retain their orientation when grabbed or rotate and position themselves to a predefined orientation option to dynamically let the controllers turn into physical objects option to dynamically turn the controllers into physical objects Ran into some null values when I try to clone the object that the player is currently holding this fixes the bug I encountered How can I test the example by using HTC VIVE instead of Oculus Hi Im developing a VR project in Unity and Im using the NVR asset After HTC pro firmware update and Unity update my whole project fell apart After i try to play my scene the fps drops to hell one and lower and often the whole unity freezes The same goes for earlier backups of the project Any other game or app for VR were running fine The weird thing is Unity used of GPU max at the time After some search I found out it was caused by NVR somehow and once i removed it from the project everything ran smoothly again I wonder if anyone had the same problem or if there is any fix available or at least coming up I would be glad to be able to use NVR instead of writing all the interactions for myself My setup Unity Intel Core i HQ RAM GB DDR GeForce GTX GB GDDR X SLI SSD GB Latest graphic drivers Im sure its not a HW related problem and fps shouldnt drop When im testing the game inside the unity editor there isnt an issue However when i build the game it seems like the script stops working and the raycast no longer shows up when i press the button to teleport Any help would be appreciated since im clueless When I was testing Newton VR on Unity f I figured out that The triggers and grips are working both fine but The NVRButtonXNVRButtonYNVRButtonANVRButtonB key are all mapped to the X key on Oculus touch controller and The real YAB keys can never be triggered Newton VR and packages both have this Plz fix it I cant seem to work out where there is an event or a bool that declares the HMD is tracking or has lost tracking Advice much appreciated Thanks Im having issues using custom hand models After setting the prefabs in the override hand models for Oculus SDK I dont know how to set the orientation of the hand models tried changing the orientation of the prefabs to no avail and everytime I press grab in playmode a second custom hand appears so I got two right hands while holding the grab button I tried to set up a collider as a child game object on trigger but suddenly I had three hands and the collider were not on trigger Is there any documentation or tutorial for setting up custom hands Edit The double hand model appears independently if its a custom model or not if I turn OFF Automatically Set Controller Transparency when I press the grab button for colliding with objects one hand behaves correctly as a collider while the other hand goes through the colliding object Edit If I leave Automatically Set Controller Transparency ON by default Im still getting double hands when using custom hands
