First of all Id like to say thanks to all the people who continue using the app and filing helpful reports You are appreciated and I want you to know it Context Its no secret that our release timeline could use some work Releases are few and far between about months between and and I do not like this Its also no secret that the projects original creator zeapo has had increasingly lesser time for the project and has handed over all daily maintenance to me and Skrilltrax To remedy this were taking some major steps that we hope will smooth out the release machinery allowing us to deploy fixes faster Whats changing Password Store is going to get a new package name and a new Play Store listing When is rolled out next week it will simultaneously go out to the new and old listings The old current listing will be updated to show that no new releases are going to happen along with a link to my listing The CI pipeline will soon include a snapshot deployment step that will be pushing a release build from master to a dedicated directory on my server I dont anticipate much friction in this migration other than a depressing amount of star reviews from disgruntled users who hate setting things up again Suggestions andor queries about this are welcome and can be posted in this thread PS Heres my discussion with zeapo about this migration to dispel any fears of this being some hostile takeover keybase chat Hi Im trying to clone a password store repository using ssh public key authentication from a hardened ssh server meaning cryptos that are considered unsafe are not supported However upon pulling from the server the app shows a dialog with a TransportException and the message Algorithm negotiation fail passwordstoresshexception Ive tried both the latest version from the FDroid store and latest commit b e built with Android Studio Both yield the same error message Ive also upgraded JGit to hoping that would solve it but sadly it doesnt The stack trace below seems to suggest that the key exchange between client and server didnt succeed thats what I conclude from receivekexinit anyway Could it be that Jsch does not support modern key exchange algorithms such as

that shows the letter of the alphabet that scrolling is at similar to what a lot of Android music apps have Heres an example I found from a quick internet search along with the link to the StackOverflow externalcontent duckduckgo com I updated Password Store to version and now synchronization of the repository is impossible I tried to wipe all data and reconfigured like it used to be with version with no joy When I try to configure the server via https the following error shows up An erro occurred during a Git operation Error occurred during the operation Message from jgit Invalid remote origin Caused by orgeclipsejgiterrorsNoRemoteRepositoryException not found When I try to configure the server using ssh the app says that I forgot to specify a username although it is set properly Please help me The app used to work like a charm but now it is useless MacOS Android Latest FDroid Syncing on a LAN via ssh to a local machine with a bare git repo Same setup but with iOS version works fine On Android cloning a local bare git repo fails with the following error Message from jgit sshsrxx orgeclipsejgittransportCredentialItemStingTypePasswordCausedbynull Implement Android Oreo Autofill ezgif b cdbea d Issue Hello I configured my SSH server to expect multiple authentication methods AuthenticationMethods publickeypassword When I select sshkey as the method the git pull fails with the following error img src width When I select usernamepassword as method the authentication just fails img src width jgit Docu Authentication code in PasswordStore Hello thanks for making the app One problem I had though was importing SSH keys After I selected the key I wanted to import and then tried to push after I registered the key in my git server it gave me an error saying that the key could not be found I then tried the key generation option which worked and I can push to the server I then attempted to select another key I generated using ConnectBot and this failed again I attempted to reselect the one that was generated from the Password store app and this failed again So I know it is something to do with the import process itself Im fine with using the key generation for now but I do hope that the import feature is made to work so I can use the same key for all my SSH stuff on that device When trying to pull from my computer Im getting Message from jgit sshmyuserserver orgeclipsejgittransportCredentialItemStringTypePassword Caused by null I tried deleting the repo and starting a new one Im cloning from a bare repo with the correct password to get into my computer When setting up the repo If we use the OpenKeychain auth it expects to find the ssh key and hence raises an exception Moreover it always asks for authorization for every action this should not be the right behaviour This was not handled in the original PR
