Hey Im trying to run GraphQL on net framework All examples are with dependency injection in net core I couldnt understand how to inject types query and schema in net framework I tried to do some things ContainerRegisterTypeIDocumentExecuter DocumentExecuterDocumentExecuter ContainerRegisterTypeISchema StoreSchemanew ContainerControlledLifetimeManager ContainerRegisterTypeISchema EasyStoreSchemanew ContainerControlledLifetimeManager ContainerRegisterTypeStoreQuery But nothing worked Do you have any suggestions examples how to use graphql in net framework tnx I am trying to decided which Graphql library to use to build a graphql api Can you please confirm if this library repo is being actively worked on maintained if I have a class such as public class Account public int SYSID get set public int AccountTypeSYSID get set public int ProfileSYSID get set public string AccountName get set public double StartingBalance get set public double CurrentBalance get set public Profile Profile usingvar ops new ProfileDbOpsDbConnection true returnopsGetBySYSIDProfileSYSID and try to run the query accountsysid accountTypeSYSID accountName startingBalance currentBalance dateCreated lastUpdate Profile SYSID firstName middleName lastNames you get the exception profile is not a field of type Account but profile is a field on account I have been using GraphQLNet and think its great but have run into a problem I was hoping you could help me with please In my GraphQL schema if I configure field with an argument of type SystemDouble defined by the following arguments class public class TestArgs public double Score get set and then execute a GraphQL query on the Tests list field to get all instances with the matching Score TestsScore Id Score I am getting some weird and wonderful floating point conversions when TestArgs is instantiated The Score property ends up with a value something like E Do you have any advice about this please What am I missing It does not support Net Core Hello I stuck with shema setting like this var per schemaAddTypepersonal EFDbContextpersonals perAddListFielddepartments EFDbContextdepartmentsSelecto new mycustom oxxx when I use postman to call these graphql I get an error Argument types do not match I know that when use GraphQLTypeBuilder to add field must be the same type But if I want this How I do Thank you Is there a way to use DateTime as an argument to a query For instance in adding a query for things in a given date range It looks like GraphQL itself doesnt even have a builtin Date scalar type so I dont even know if there is good client support Doesnt look like theres support for variables unless Im missing someting Couldnt find any unit tests that use them at least and it fails when I try doing them myself In the EF examples in EntityFrameworkExecutionTests for instance youre using contextSaveChanges inside your addMutate mutation meaning your mutation parameter in the schemaAddMutation signature can just be synchronous What if you want to use contextSaveChangesAsync though Or in my situation with CosmosDB what if your underlying data storage API only has async methods Seems like I can add async to the mutation and await the CosmosDB call but then I have to force blocking for Result The queryableGetter cant be marked as async as Async lambda expressions cannot be converted into expression trees Worth noting that using a method body wont fit anyway as it also cant be converted to an expression tree I get that the mutation has to happen and be waited on before the retrieval query can fire after but Im just wondering whether you can have overloads for AddMutation that support async I need an api key for authentication i cant seem to find the webclient where i can add the headers Any thoughts to put me on the right path
