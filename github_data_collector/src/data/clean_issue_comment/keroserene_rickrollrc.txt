 The argument Dplugdefault was stopping sound working removing it makes it work again Rather to my surprise it also worked with the rest of the arguments removed This seems odd given that it claims to be downloading a raw audio file but removing q showed that the audio data aplay was being fed is in fact a WAV file and downloading the file and checking it confirms this Hence refer to wav audio rather than raw audio and remove all commandline arguments to aplay Win Fixes When I run rollsh on Fedora the audio and video are out of sync because aplay plays the audio at half speed see code The rate should be increased from Hz to Hz Hey This is very fun but could it be made to work offline for cases where the user running may have restricted internet Added a slightly obfuscated version of the command to the readme It does exactly the same as the command above The link however is in hex Warning This was only tested on Linux On Linux the cached copies are stored in XDGCACHEHOME or its default cache according to the XDG specification On Mac the cache dir is LibraryCaches On Windows the cache dir remains tmp In all cases a new subfolder under the cache dir named astley is made and the files are stored there The integrity of the cached copies is verified using MD hashes Mac has md and Linux and Cygwin should have md sum as part of coreutils This catches the case where the file was only partially downloaded and if so it will refetch the file Resolves I did not have aplay on my system and the audio did not work Added a line to play the audio with paplay which is PulseAudios replacement for aplay and to actually prefer it over aplay since many modern Linux systems have PulseAudio as their sound system
