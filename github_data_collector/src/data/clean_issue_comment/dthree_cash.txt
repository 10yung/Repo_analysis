External commands were previously limited to Windows Theres no good reason for this so this adds support for Linux as well Fixes Test manually tried whoami and git status Test manually tried a notfound command verified output looks good cash Will not run a command outside of the included ones If I try to run for example npm it just shows the help menu Yet running echo works just fine because its built in When installing cashtouch sudo npm install cashtouch g force and running touch help I get this error Missing required argument Showing Help sage touch options files Options help output usage information a change only the access time c nocreate do not create any files d date STRING parse STRING and use it instead of current time m change only the modification time r reference FILE use this files times instead of current time time WORD change the specified time WORD is access atime or use equivalent to a WORD is modify or mtime equivalent to m and it shows the help that is not the disthelptouchjs file This error only affects touch from what I can tell When running cat help I get a Nodejs error This error appears on all cash programs and seems to be related to the parser Error node UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning undefined node UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning Unhandled promise rejection This error originated either by throwing inside of an async function without a catch block or by rejecting a promise which was not handled with catch To terminate the node process on unhandled promise rejection use the CLI flag unhandledrejectionsstrict see rejection id node DEP DeprecationWarning Unhandled promise rejections are deprecated In the future promise rejections that are not handled will terminate the Nodejs process with a nonzero exit code I see that Cash doesnt have this support added yet This should be added Ive not seen that much activity since a while ago paste with shift insert or another keys is possible This is an investigatory PR to study the introduction of a POSIX compliant shell code parser using bashparser I studied the cash workflow and I think the majority of changes in source code would concern Vorpal They could be implemented directly there in vorpal core or we could patch vorpal and implement it only for cash Hello Ive found that something like cash rm rf dist doesnt work while cash rm r f dist separately does work But the first syntax is correct and widespread in Linux Everything works fine but it gives me this issue when I try to pull from my git repository Permission denied please try again Permission denied please try again Permission denied publickeypassword fatal Could not read from remote repository Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists It doesnt give me this error when I exit out of cash how would I go about to fix this
