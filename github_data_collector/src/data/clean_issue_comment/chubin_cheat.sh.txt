So I do a good deal of networking research and I love cheatsh I have a tool that I use that I think could be nicely integrated into cheatsh RFCget lt return isNum isNum return curl Perhaps the usage syntax could be curl cheatshRFCNUMBER And that URL could simply resolve to I propose to extend the behavior of the program in the following ways Feature The search should also include multiple terms Feature When you search a phrase in the dotfiles using the new context option example x the search should include the comments associated Feature Variable interpolation in the output if variable is passed to curl Feature Shell variable interpolation in the output if the variable is declared and a new option example n is passed to the client chtsh Feature Any entry shoud have an ID Autoadded during the search phase so you can execute easily the command from client chtsh using a new option example r Example of dotfiles cat tar bash To create an uncompressed archive tar cvf pathtofootar pathtofoo To extract an uncompressed archive tar xvf pathtofootar cat tar bash To extract an archive Tag archive extract tar xf ARCHIVE To extract an archive verbose output Tag archive extract tar xvf ARCHIVE Example of search command Calls cheat from curl curl cheatshtarextractXARCHIVE myfiletar Or call cheat from chtsh Set variable for shell variable interpolation ARCHIVE myfiletar chtsh n x tar extract Expected output bash To extract an uncompressed archive ID tar xvf pathtofootar Extracts an archive Tag archive extract ID tar xf myfiletar Extracts an archive verbose output Tag archive extract ID tar xvf ARCHIVE Note Dynamic ID appears in the output The ID doesnt change if the search context tag and loading path remains the same Shell variable interpolarion is performed using variable defined previously Example of run command To recall and execute a cheat chtsh r Hi Igor I wonder if onelin r database of commands is worth inserting in chtsh Pro Already organized by OS Seems that the concepts covered are not yet addressed in chtsh and names dont collide Con Uses Python class definitions so migration might be more than simple formatting But Ive seen worse Thanks your weather command is lovely To reproduce issue visit Error no results This is what is shown curl cheatsh vimreturnoutsidefunction Unknown cheat sheet Please try to reformulate your query I would expect to see one of these stackoverflow posts What is weird is that if I rearrange the keywords it works And I get a response as expected Why does the first query return nothing but the second query return a result Addresses issue seems to be a shellspecific issue zsh for me when I reproduced it but escaping with works for both bash and zsh Seems like a cleaner solution than adding quotes around all curl commands in the READMEmd Hey there wave Having the environment variable CHTSHCONF I can change the location of my configuration But apparently the location of the history file is fix coded to my HOME directory I would love to keep my users home folder clean I could imagine to either add another variable like CHTSHHIST or what I would favor add a configuration option to specify the location Is there a way to display the date of an answer right next to other meta data like soq Age of an answer is to me as important as author and pseudourl This project is awesomely useful and productive but its a shame I often have to copypaste a SO id into a browser to check the date outside terminal thx Is there a setting for output pagination other than piping to less Greetings Im trying to configure self hosting The included Dockerfile references sharescriptsgetsheetssh which doesnt exist which causes the docker build to fail after some minutes with sh cant open sharescriptsgetsheetssh No such file or directory Am I missing something thanks in advance iomari Hi I really enjoyed your PerlCon talk I checked out cheatsh and it works great One thing I noticed is while your overview page indicates that cheatsh has support for Perl oneliners when I try to obtain information I never get any code back Instead cheatsh gives me a summary of some older problems users were having with Readline andor NativeCall mbook homedir curl chtshperl line mbook homedir curl chtshperl linelist less R Could you please add dnmfarrell David Farrells repository of Perl oneliners Thank you
