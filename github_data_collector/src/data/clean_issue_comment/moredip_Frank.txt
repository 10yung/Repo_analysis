please Regards Rohit We built a Frankified version of our app in a Test configuration not Debug configuration and after launching this TestFrankifiedapp the server connecting to Frank was not running and we cannot run tests with Cucumber The DebugFrankified version launches the server and runs Cucumber tests great We are trying to get Frank to run on our testconfiguration since our debug configuration makes calls to outside services and has dynamic data Is there a way to run Frank with a nonDebug build configuration Update the moredip repo README to indicate that it is not the official version and you should instead use Background Added waitfornothingvisibletobeanimating helper method which checks for views that are animating and are also FEXisVisible This resolves the issues with the UIRefreshControl Issue Just update xcode to after that unable to launch the simulator Details Frank Launch LAUNCHING APP sh line TraceBPT trap LibraryRubyGems gemssimlauncher
