Hi mitchelloharawild When using a switching model both stream and forecast parse the newdata in a way that is inconsistent with the already trained model Consider the following model r electr tsibbledatavicelec filter yearmonthTime yearmonth Mar mutateWorkDay wdayTime in Holiday elecfit electr model fasster fassterDemand WorkDay S trig poly Temperature ITemperature elecfit It is trained on the boolean switch WorkDay however if the newdata input is too short like in this case r elecupdate tsibbledatavicelec filter yearmonthTime yearmonth Apr head mutateWorkDay wdayTime in Holiday elecfitupd elecfit streamelecupdate elecfitupd then internal DLM states and X will have wrong dimensions as they dont account for unseen states say holidaysweekends when the data contains only weekdays Error in rbindobjectdlmX X number of columns of matrices must match see arg Calls Anonymous f streammdlts stream streamFASSTER rbind Just to try out the streaming functionality I fixed it by patching stream to always use longer newdata but then tailing Xestresiduals when needed Obviously this is extremely ugly Not sure how to fix it at the moment Am I missing something If you have any ideas to share Id love to try fixing it and submitting a PR Thanks x augment tidy glance Potential directions include loess and sampling techniques Automatic model specification should also be considered with this Ideally improving speed functionality and object structures Potential UI r FASSTERy poly G S trig G A only x z
