scrot requires o switch to be able to write into already existing temporary files note currenlty only works nicely when titlealignleft default could be modified to support centered and right alignment but not going to for the sake of keeping the patch as simple as possible Since you already have imagemagick you should have both convert and import You can easily use import in place of scrot with a line like import window root file devnull The devnull bit is there because import can also be used to click and drag to collect only a portion of the screen but with window root we are getting the entire current desktop Ive been using this myself since I didnt want to mess with scrot and it seems possibly slightly faster but probably a false impression Just so the next person does not start looking for it The patch smart borders for i is actually somewhat already in the main i package included you can use it via the option hideedgeborders noneverticalhorizontalbothsmart As described here So need to compile it your self Cheers Rebasing and xbmicon gcchigheropt patches to version Hello I dont expect anyone to work on this just wanted to point out than the latest i release breaks the specified patch It seems like this time it will require a fair amount of work to rebase it my attempt to compile i with the patch fails with the following errors i barsrcxcbc In function drawstatusline i barsrcxcbc error incompatible types when initializing type unsigned int using type colort i barsrcxcbc error statuslinectx undeclared first use in this function i barsrcxcbc note each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in i barsrcxcbc warning passing argument of xcbchangegc makes integer from pointer without a cast enabled by default usrincludexcbxprotoh note expected xcbgcontextt but argument is of type uint t i barsrcxcbc error incompatible types when initializing type unsigned int using type colort i barsrcxcbc error incompatible types when initializing type unsigned int using type colort i barsrcxcbc warning passing argument of xcbchangegc makes integer from pointer without a cast enabled by default usrincludexcbxprotoh note expected xcbgcontextt but argument is of type uint t i barsrcxcbc error statuslinepm undeclared first use in this function i barsrcxcbc warning passing argument of xcbimageput makes integer from pointer without a cast enabled by default usrincludexcbxcbimageh note expected xcbdrawablet but argument is of type uint t i barsrcxcbc warning passing argument of xcbimageput makes integer from pointer without a cast enabled by default usrincludexcbxcbimageh note expected xcbgcontextt but argument is of type uint t i barsrcxcbc In function drawbars i barsrcxcbc error block undeclared first use in this function i barsrcxcbc error request for member icon in something not a structure or union i barsrcxcbc error request for member icon in something not a structure or union i barsrcxcbc error request for member width in something not a structure or union i barsrcxcbc warning assignment makes integer from pointer without a cast enabled by default make i barsrcxcbo Error make Leaving directory tmpbuilddi wm make overridedhautobuild Error make Leaving directory tmpbuilddi wm make buildstamp Error Bests It is worth noting that the cwdexecpatch relies on the path being set and updated in the NETWMNAME property which has to be configured manually see for example BashCustomize title on ArchWiki Second note is that is used as a delimiter separating the path from other text eg terminal name As a result the patch does not work with paths containing the delimiter character Final note is for everybody who would think of different approach One could think that another approach is to find out the PID of the active window and resolve the procpidcwd symlink to get the path where new process should be spawned Unfortunately this does not work because the CWD of the terminal process parent remains constant and only the CWD of the shell process child changes
