The readme run example is incorrect Fixing the naming Looks like last commit was in Is this project still active Superseded by some other project If we look at the Node API we have def randomOutboundNodeSetnumResults Int rnd Random Seq Int def outboundNodes CSeq Int Note that one returns a CSeq and the other returns a Seq Should this be made consistent Hello Id like to experiment cassovary but I need a property graph in which properties would be used during traversals am I on the right track I may have not read the documentation mentioning this case if any so sorry if its a RTFM Thanks andy Similar to Would be fun to implement Giraph eg Pregel API on top of Cassovary once again testing scale up vs scale out Might be fun to try and implement the GraphX API on Cassovary Then we can compare scale up vs scale out We should rename Node to Vertex in the API Two main reasons Vertex makes you sound smarter If we want to start playing with partitioning we want to reserve Node for logicalphysical machine nodes so getNode and getVertex can be easily disambiguated Just like theres a Spark shell for interactively playing around we should write a Cassovary shell that support interactive manipulation of the graphs Ive started prototyping something in my clone under repl branch Better yet instead of the current server we should have a backend server process that loads a potentially large graph and multiple frontend shells can connect to it and access the graph We could use the same mechanism that Spark uses for serializing closures for execution on the backend Thoughts Refactor to not have a dependency on finaglestats Causes problems like in plus it is not a great idea to have metrics stats be done inside the core of the library Is there any update to the issue I have code which depends on comtwitter cassovarycore and when I try to compile it or do sbt update I get unresolved dependency comtwittercommonmetrics not found I think in the past retrying has worked but I just tried three times and all tries failed I also hit this bug a few months ago when I tried to help another PhD student use my code and I didnt know how to fix the problem then I think retries eventually worked Is there a workaround Which part of cassovary needs finaglestats and would make sense to move that out of cassovarycore Thanks
