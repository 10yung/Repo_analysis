 Is it possible to run vivid on MacOS I installed vivid with cargo copied filetypesyml to configvivid to avoid the Error Could not find filetypes database but then adding export LSCOLORSvivid generate molokai to zshrc did nothing which made me research a bit more and I found out that MacOS uses LSCOLORS and that it doesnt work the same as LSCOLORS so I guess this means that vivid wont run on MacOS but I thought I should ask A fallback to colors would be great for those of us who use a terminal with a set color scheme locally and rely on true color for unconfigured terminals or over ssh What if a themedesigner decides to colorize in a completely orthogonal way For example highlight everything which is Pythonrelated in a specific colorstyle Well it is possible to do this by highlighting programmingsourcepython and programmingtoolingpackagingpython and programmingtoolingcodestylepython with the same style but maybe it would be nice to be able to just have a single entry in the spirit of CSStags python Another option would be to allow wildcards programmingpython For example Explicitly use different colors for C hpp header files than for cpp source files Ideal CLI usage vivid generate snazzy Use default DB use snazzy theme vivid generate snazzy db myfiletypesyml vivid generate mythemeyml db myfiletypesyml Explicitly specify the path to a theme Themes should be searched in configvividthemes and usrsharevividthemes Would it help to use asstring and ashash etc methods in YAML parsing since italic text ANSI escape codes can cause problems on some terminal emulators tmux
