Making ExpandablePageLayout extend RelativeLayout was a mistake because it can be terrible at performance Now that v is around the corner with breaking changes it might be a good time to do this Provide an interop if possible to reduce migration effort The fix works for any amount of items above the content though with no support for items below It can be set using InboxRecyclerViewsetNested When the InboxRecyclerView is inside a NestedScrollView there are lots of issues such as the ExpandablePage expanding from farther down the list than wanted and the items all being pushed down and replaced with blanks Not sure if its inherent to the NestedScrollView but it wasnt happening with regular RecyclerView Listening to nested scrolling events would make it much easier to support scrollable child Views rather than asking users to manually do it by intercepting pulltocollapse gesture
