CircuitBreakerIsOpen is not read only so when call it before hystrixGo or hystrixDo maybe circuit status is changed some smell code in this function snippet as if circuitmetricsIsHealthytimeNow too many failures open the circuit circuitsetOpen return true hystrixConfigureCommandkey apiConfigHystrixConfig set config at init how to update at runtime Id like to start using the project but seems that the project is not being maintained for someone else Does anyone has information about that or if there is a fork that people are contributing to I have one of the requirement to execute some functionality like reconnect with backend system as soon as Circuit Open Tried to look at code to identify if there is any such functionality is available but unfortunately there is nothing like Callback on State Change Do you have any plan introduce callback on state Change other than the circuit state change logs I will be happy to raise a PR by adding Callback functionility Hi This value will be used to create graph with upper bond shows max concurrent configured vis the current concurrency This graph will be useful to monitorfine tune the allowed concurrency config Thanks for creating hystrixgo when I Register metric collectorI want to know the metric data in callback belongs to which name but Update func has no any more name info
