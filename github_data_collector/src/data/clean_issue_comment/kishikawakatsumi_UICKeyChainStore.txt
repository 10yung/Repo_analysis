Hi kishikawakatsumi I have added SPM support and tested importing and using it in an app everything is working fine on my side Referencing issue Hi All Is it possible to get this library to work on Mac using Mac Catalyst SecAddSharedWebCredential is unavailable on macCatalyst Thanks Im having this issue at moment compiler try build the pod UICKeyChainStore ld library not found for lgccs we already disable de post configuration for bitcode and validarchs settings What else can I try Hello SPM support for all Apple platforms has been announced and Xcode has a nice integration for it Please add SPM support for the project Thank you for your great work It happens in this method objectivec BOOLsetDataNSData data forKeyNSString key genericAttributeidgenericAttribute labelNSString label commentNSString comment errorNSError autoreleasing error objectivec if TARGETOSIOS if floorNSFoundationVersionNumber floor iOS query bridge strong idkSecUseAuthenticationUI bridge idkSecUseAuthenticationUIFail put it into available block warning if IPHONEOSVERSIONMINREQUIRED IPHONE For what Ive found its because both versions share the same build settings Product name what can I do about it Cocoapods beta Thank you Multiple commands produce UsersdocLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataProjectdmploethkfrsshdqgntaiiyrihlfBuildIntermediatesnoindexArchiveIntermediatesProjectIntermediateBuildFilesPathUninstalledProductsiphoneosUICKeyChainStoreframework Target UICKeyChainStoreiOS has create directory command with output UsersdocLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataProjectdmploethkfrsshdqgntaiiyrihlfBuildIntermediatesnoindexArchiveIntermediatesProjectIntermediateBuildFilesPathUninstalledProductsiphoneosUICKeyChainStoreframework Target UICKeyChainStoreiOS has create directory command with output UsersdocLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataProjectdmploethkfrsshdqgntaiiyrihlfBuildIntermediatesnoindexArchiveIntermediatesProjectIntermediateBuildFilesPathUninstalledProductsiphoneosUICKeyChainStoreframework I used to do all the developing for iOS but now was forced to migrate to iOS Immediately I encountered some erratic behavior The app uses links like appaction id and the id corresponds to TouchID protected keychain item When the app is run for the first time with such link it works like a charm but if it is not the app works spontaneously most often I just get different security errors without any usable description Everything worked perfectly on iOS I thought that it could be an issue with obsolete library but even after the update nothing changed It gets even more interesting since the app works as expected on but does not on Moreover if I quickly switch to another app the TouchID prompt may appear for that app TouchID for Safari but with my description but the result will be seen in my app should I switch to it That is so frustrating Any help will be much appreciated I try to get password from UICKeyChainStore This method NSData dataForKeyNSString key errorNSError autoreleasing error crash when SecItemCopyMatching Device Information iOS iPhone Plus Could you please include all the available options of SecAccessControlCreateFlags in the enumeration UICKeyChainStoreAuthenticationPolicy I am not able to use the kSecAccessControlTouchIDCurrentSet option flag in my application Is there any other obvious way that I am not seeing Thank you in advance When a Touch ID protected item is added after it has been removed the authentication dialog does not display Following the instructions for Adding of a Touch ID protected item should an Add operation always result in the system to display the authentication dialog Im seeing that ordinarily the system dialog will display However when an item is added after it has been removed the authentication dialog does not display Specifically I see the following when adding reading and removing an item Add Read Remove OK dialog shows for the Add and the Read Read Add Remove OK dialog shows for the Read and the Add Remove Add NG dialog not displayed for the Add Remove Add Add NG dialog is only displayed for the nd Add Add Add Read OK dialog is displayed for both Adds and the Read So it would seem that the first Add following the Remove of an item is not resulting in the dialog being displayed The value is however being written even though the dialog is not displayed Tested on iPhone s and iPhone Plus using version where all operations are using the same key kishikawakatsumi and Adds are using the value abcdef abcdef Its possible Im doing something wrong in testing but I havent been able to identify the cause yet so wanted to ask for clarification of expected behavior
