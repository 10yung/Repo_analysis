Winbtrfs shows perfectly to use within fully encrypted veracrypt devices However when trying to add further devices to a Winbtrfsformated veracrypt partition eg to have the benefits of a software raid it is not possible to choose from other virtual veracrypt devices which are mounted since Windows XP under Device VeracryptVolumeXXX May I please ask to allow for further devices selection like Device VeracryptVolumeXXX than the implemented Device HarddiskXXX PartitionYYY ARM build tested on Windows RT works normal ARM not tested yet Using on a tb btrfs hdd with compression and zstd enabled I noticed that the drive kept becoming write protected I tried setting compression to and explicity setting readonly to in the registry and restarting but that made no difference Seeing issue I booted back into linux and the drive was unable to be mounted The kernel messages after trying to mount were tree level mismatch failed to read block groups and openctree failed I then attempted ro run btrfs check and btrfs check repair on the filesystem and neither of those were able to start reporting child eb corrupted and freespaceextentkey failed Booting back into windows however the disk still mounts and it seems I am able to copy files off of it onto my windows disk Any ideas about how to fix the disk for linux and prevent this from occurring again It seems that I cannot pin two folders in the btrfs drive to quick access How to reproduce this choose one folder in the btrfs drive right click and choose pin to quick access choose another folder in the same drive and pin to quick access The second folder never appears Hello everyone I wanted to try out this driver so I created a virtual disk VHDX type expanding GB max size and added one partition to it primary GB size then formatted to BTRFS using mkbtrfsexe P which went well After that it is mounted I can copy in explorer and use it but from wsl I cannot create directories as it says mkdir cannot create directory mntea Inputoutput error everytime I use mkdir It works in explorer also I can use touch to create files Default mount options are E on mnte type drvfs rwnoatimeuid gid metadatacasedir and it also doesnt work with E on mnte type drvfs rwnoatimemetadatacasedir BUT when caseoff it works and it creates the directory The only problem with that is that I want to enable case sensitivity for all the sub folders too Is there anything I can do to make it work or is this a limitation of the driver Driver latest Windows Windows Pro Build WSL Ubuntu eoan latest installed from store then upgraded using doreleaseupgrade wslconf is what the README says options metadatacasedir Thank you for your help I am trying backing up the data and will attach more detailed logs When I try to upgrade from v to v on a Windows x VM ran via VMWare Workstation Player with a thumb drive formatted as BTRFS formatted with v of the btrfs driver installed plugged in it crashes I am attaching the minidump zip When I plug in a BTRFS formatted thumb drive formatted with v of the btrfs driver installed into my Windows x VM ran via VMWare Workstation Player with v of the btrfs driver installed it crashes the OS The mini dump is attached zip I am using Windows Version Build and after install driver I see it in device manager and regedit but I dont see a volume eg in explorer Thanks in advance for any help I am using Btrfs f r Win with Encfs file encryption and now I had the issue that some very deep folders could not be read This happened without mounted encryption so it was just that the folders were deep and long I can not tell the exact length though
