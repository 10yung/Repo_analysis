Im getting no notification when the socket loses connection This can be from either server side or the internal socket Im using the boilerplate stuff for now MARK Websocket func connectSocket var

Looks like a pretty significant changeset came in from but the README doc was not properly updated to indicate the new usage Im currently working through what I have to migrate and will submit a PR when I have time but thought opening an issue was a good start When importing Starscream version currently latest using SwiftPM I get the warning couldnt find pc file I tried version and master branch when using the warning does not appear Steps to reproduce create new iOS project File New Project iOS Single View App add SwiftPM dependency File Swift Packages Add Package Dependency select either exact version or branch master build In this use case its better because it doesnt produce intermediary arrays on every step And its more concise Tested by adding a completion handler to see if its being called but unfortunately it is not I swapped out to another library to check if my socket server might have been the issue but the other swift socket library worked fine however I would like to stick to using Starscream I connect to the websocket and then disconnect from it as its seen from serverside logs The delegate method is being called func websocketDidConnectsocket WebSocketClient webSocketwritestring myuserid And then it just disconnects And here is my code from viewDidLoad override func viewDidLoad superviewDidLoad webSocket WebSocketurl URLstring ws webSocketdelegate self webSocketconnect What can be the reason I dont see any logs in XCode console but on the serverside I just get a message about disconnection Hi guys First I want to thank you for developing Starscream its such a good library and it helped me a lot in my projects But recently I run into a problem I updated my Apple Watch to WatchOS my iPhone to iOS Xcode to MacOS still Ive created an Independent Apple Watch project where I test the communication between the Watch and a WebSocket server using Starscream wsechowebsocketorg It works perfectly on the Simulator but on real Apple Watch when I try to connect to the server I got these errors BackgroundWebSocketOnlyWatch WatchKit Extension nwconnectiongetconnectedsocket C Client called nwconnectiongetconnectedsocket on unconnected nwconnection BackgroundWebSocketOnlyWatch WatchKit Extension TCP Conn x d d f Failed error websocket is disconnected OptionalThe operation couldn t be completed Network is down Ill show you the code of my app

and real iPhone Is this a bug of WatchOS or is Starscream that needs an update Thanks in advance I encountered the crash here where pointer only contained two bytes and it was trying to read closeCode from outside the buffer This should fix it First of all thank you for this awesome library On to the issue Ive been using a rather bad wifi setup for a while and Ive noticed this issue a couple of times I dont know if this is an issue on Starscream or maybe on the underlying URLConnection Ive thought of building a watchdog that will disconnect and reconnect the socket if it doesnt receive data for X seconds but Im not sure thats the best approach Any thoughts
