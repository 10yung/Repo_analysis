I am having trouble while using your training code The error is not decreasing after a certain threshold Can you tell me how did you manage to train your model In your file modeltrainm you multiply the sigmas with an array of random numbers Since randn produces negative numbers such as the sigma will exceed in the image My question is that why do you multiply the sigmas with that array K randi labels imdbHRlabelsbatch labels dataaugmentationlabelsK sigmamax sigmas rand sizelabels sigmamax This line newarr bsxfuntimesrandnsizelabels reshapesigmas sizelabels inputs labels newarr I cant run the demo because vlsimplenntidy don t exist And it seems that some functions dont exist too please When I use the pytorch model I meet an error I want to denoise an image using a one of the pretrained models python testffdnetipolpy input inputpng noisesigma addnoise True I have Testing FFDNet model Parameters addnoise True input png suffix noisesigma dontsaveresults False nogpu False cuda True rgb False im shape Loading model Process finished with exit code I have no use to get anything but I have configured the libraries that need to be configured Then I debugged it and when I debugged this statement the project exited if args cuda statedict torchloadmodelfn deviceids model nnDataParallelnet deviceidsdeviceidscuda I want to know why I cant use the training modelcszn cszn hi guysthanks for your great jobit performs better than CBDnet dncnn in my datai want transplants this algorithm to embedded platform i have trouble in convert this training result pth to onnxcan you give me some advicelooking for you replaythanks a lot Thanks for your work But I have a question about how can numinputchannels in training step and in test step can you share training dataset about color imagesthanks Hi initially I would like to thank you for your very good work Then I have a question Ive images with more than one channel and the noise level is different in different channels How should be setted the noise level map Thanks for your help Hi cszn I was very impressed from your works including good peformance of DND set I heared that your sigmas are manually selected could you share me the applied sigmas for each images at the DND Thanks a lot
