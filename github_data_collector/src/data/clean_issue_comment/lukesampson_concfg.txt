concfg uses the following code to resolve roaming application data folder envUSERPROFILE AppData Roaming Microsoft Windows Start Menu etc However in some Enterprise environments the folder is redirected to a location outside the users profile folder eg on a network share or on a different drive I would suggest to resolve the path like this environment GetFolderPathapplicationdata Or if its the Start Menu folder you can query the path directly environment GetFolderPathStartMenu Output in my environment PS C environment GetFolderPathStartMenu D Users USERNAME AppData Roaming Microsoft Windows Start Menu PS C envUSERPROFILE AppData Roaming Microsoft Windows Start Menu C Users USERNAME AppData Roaming Microsoft Windows Start Menu Windows Terminal is in beta and theres no support for concfg When I set a theme it works fine when I launch powershell directly but not when I try to launch it through the new terminal theres no effect and the old white on blue theme is still there I would like to be able to choco install concfg Im using Ansible to configure our development boxes and it has builtin support for Chocolatey It could be similar to the poshgit package I used concfg import solarizeddark After that I cant use dir option eg diradw Im not sure what Im doing wrong but doing a git diff always seems to end up with grayscale text colors Id really like to see lines removed as red lines added as green and file information as yellow Is there a way to get concfg to do that When I use wget to download a file I get this style popup As you can see that yellow on teal is very difficult to read and quite straining on the eyes I am using the Back to the Code theme which has popupcolors darkmagentawhite My console properties confirm the configured popup style So whats causing that teal and yellow popup styling Can this be configured Win puts the intensity on the upper colors so that intenseboldlight are to the right here But concfg at least for solarized reverses that so that apps that ask for intense or bold get the opposite Is that an issue just with your solarized sample or is it reversed in all of concfg The PowerShell Gallery is the official public Microsoft repository for PowerShell modules It would be really cool if we could add this functionality to the gallery Let me know if you want help converting this to a module Cheers Trevor Sullivan
