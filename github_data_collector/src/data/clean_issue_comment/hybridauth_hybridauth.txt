used HybridEndpointprocess in the method that is calling when user authenticates Now I havent such method in v and any info about this in upgrade manuals While testing on localhost it is working but on development server it is not I am using atticmediaanvard package in Laravel for social login It shows ERRTOOMANYREDIRECTS error Hibridauth version x and LinkedIn Google This is a question Background I have hundreds of domains all running the same product too many to whitelist them all through facebook or google What Id like to do is set the callback for all of them to a common login relay server In order to do that I need a generic way to pass state through the authentication flow so I can tell the login relay server what site theyre trying to log in to Is this possible Alternatively I could call the relay server first and create a mapping from something like the state variable to a login target Then when the relay callback gets called I could look up the real site and forward the browser there Any input most welcome Bug feature or question when I swap out curl for guzzle and the user signs into Facebook the user profile will not return the email even though the email permission is granted by the user This does not happen with the curl set up nor for google on the guzzle set up Version and provider v Bug feature or question BUG Registering multiple adapters in the settings including debugmode and debugfile and then calling authenticateadaptar wont create the logger This is due to calling getProviderConfigadaptar which will only add adapter config and callback url that means any other setting like debugmode curloptions etc is ignored this behavior is especially confusing because it worked just fine in v Version and provider v mutliple providers in a settings file Reproduction Create hybridauth without any logger hauth new Hybridauth Hybridauthconfig Use hauthauthenticateprovider and notice that no log file is created etc Possible solution getProviderConfig needs to be improved to include other global settings like debugmode as well or document the issue that the user needs to create the logger instance himself technically documentation could also state that with multiple providers each provider has its own debug and curl options My workaround atm is to simply create the logger based on the config myself
