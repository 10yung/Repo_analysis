Hi I am not able to send push notification any more from Pusher Mac app It was showing Notification error APN invalid Token please give the solution for the issue In iOS it is required to set apnspushtype to background if we want to use silent push notifications otherwise notifications wont be delivered Is there a way to set that header iOS requires the apnspriority header to be set to when sending background contentavailable notifications If the header is left off it defaults to and the push fails So currently whenever you send a background notification with Pusher in iOS it fails Rather than having the app set this header automatically Id prefer to be able to add headers manually so that we can test with other APNS header types In file NWAppDelegatem at row is code case return NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSince but I think correct code should be case return NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow Seeing if anyone would be interested in adding dark mode support Quick Thank You noodlewerk thanks so much for offering this service Its help has been immeasurable in demonstrating quick validation for application handling especially for mutating payloads I noticed that Given Im in dark mode if I edit additional content outside of the default payload directly in the payload JSON it appears in black which is difficult to see given the dark mode background The workaround is to paste raw unformatted text from another editor which appears as white foreground text on existing background But if many other people are running into this problem Im happy to tackle if I get time this week Payload sizes now are k However pusher is hardcoded to bytes In addition if your payload is bytes pusher will just blast the payload into the allocated buffer for notification types and going past the end of the buffer Hi I wish I found this project sooner Thanks so much for making this I added a little Format button to format the payload for easier reading img width altscreenshot at src Merge if you like it Its my first ever contribution to a macOS app so it may be substandard although I tried looking carefully at how the other buttons were created Keep it up Hi everyone I saw in the issues of the project a request about the icon and thats why I have created this icon for Pusher App which I believe looks better than the current icon icon Have you ever had this problem when just connect then push it works well but after a while maybe h the connect is exist then push success but doesnt coming in deviceWhen Reconnect using pusher it works well Who can tell me why and what should my server colleagues do in JAVA Took me a bit too long to realize to actually check the AppDelegate for the constant to update Feel free to suggest improvements to the messages
