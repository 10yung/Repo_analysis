I tried to use noVNC from the master branch and run it in a subdirectory at But when I open this url the uijs script tries to download the file which obviously does not exist exists instead Is it a bug am I doing something wrong or subdirectory is not supported by design Limit mouse move events to one every mS Supports RA ne security type for compatibility with RealVNC servers This PR adds support for automatic copypasting So when you are focused on the canvas and paste text its pasted in the server and when you copy something in the server its automatically copied to your local keyboard Ive seen and But this takes a very different approach since it adds support for copypasting to noVNCs core And I think that its quite cleaner Ive tested it in Safari Firefox and Chrome Unfortunately the Clipboard API is only supported by Chrome and the paste event is broken see So it just does nothing in Safari and Firefox while in Chrome the copying of data works but not the pasting So for now this is not super useful but it should become better as browser support improves WDYT This PR is an initial step towards It separates the mouse event handling from the touch event handling A separate step could be to implement multiple Touch modules for different interaction styles aka convert touch events to mouse events in different ways For example one that would work for me would be something like Touch action Click event Single Tap Click Long press Rightclick contextmenu or click event Press and then drag Click and drag mousemove event Twofinger press and drag Pan Wheel event Twofinger pinch Zoom Not sure of the events here A library like hammerjs would make such implementations very easy Describe the bug If the remote desktop is larger than the browser window on macOS or ChromeOS you see some small scrollbars for a short period of time before they disappear for good To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Using any browser on macOS or ChromeOS open noVNC and a remote connection Ensure that the setting Clip to Window is disabled Ensure that the setting Scaling Mode is set to None Make the browser window smaller than the remote desktop Observe the invisible scrollbars Expected behavior I dont expect scrollbars to be available on platforms that use these types of scrollbars On iOS and Android the browsers typically behave the same way and on these platforms noVNC doesnt allow scrollbars and instead force clipping I think we should do the same on macOS and ChromeOS Client please complete the following information OS macOS or ChromeOS Browser Safari Chrome Firefox Browser version most recent versions available Server please complete the following information noVNC version master b c VNC server TigerVNC WebSocket proxy websockify Describe the bug While holding a click with one mouse button and simultaneously clicking with another mouse button will result in that the second mouse click never gets through To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Connect using noVNC Monitor mouse events using xev in a terminal on the remote Press the left mouse button but dont release it Click with the right mouse button Release the left mouse button Observe that the right click never got sent to the remote Expected behavior I expect all mouse clicks to get sent Client please complete the following information OS Fedora Browser Chrome

server TigerVNC WebSocket proxy websockify Additional context Im aware that this is exclusively a Chrome issuessince Chrome worked perfectly fine but Im filing in case it helps narrow down the problem This seems to happen if the canvas is not being directly visualizedeither running in a different tab or being set do display none Ive also tested on the latest release of noVNC and the issue persisted Firefox does not seem to have this problem Ive been able to also reproduce it on a Mac system PS Thanks a lot for the noVNC project Its awesome what you guys managed to do Ill appreciate any help or input into this issue Thank you for your time Hi I added the automatical copypaste function that is available through the navigatorclipboard API in some browsers eg Google Chrome as mentioned earlier
