 Shouldnt you be calculating the inverse covariance matrix for the Mahalanobis distance my enviroment mac os mojave updateCodebookcvVecunsigned char const CodeBook int int ex cpp segmentation fault cpp for n nnumChannels n high n p n cbBoundsn segmentation fault point if high n high n low n p n cbBoundsn if low n low n What am i supposed to do with args boardw boardh What numbers should i input here Python opencv ORB feature calculation function detectAndCompute is very timeconsuming PC on win system takes milliseconds Is there any room for optimization of this function readmemd shopping links need to be corrected Change occurences of http shoporeillycomproduct do to I have the corrected readmemd file and can push it when allowed to do so hope pass soon Compact matrix and vector types a Using the cvMat f and cvVec f objects respectively create a matrix and row vector b Can you multiply them together directly If not why not chage cvMat f into cvMatx f as we dont have Mat f in opencv the question of exercise is Find and open opencvcxcoreincludecxtypesh Read through and find the many conversion helper functions a Choose a negative floatingpoint number b Take its absolute value round it and then take its ceiling and floor c Generate some random numbers d Create a floatingpoint cvPoint f and convert it to an integer cvPoint Convert a cvPoint to a cvPoint f as cxtypesh is no longer used in opencv please change this question Exercises at end of Chapter hope pass
