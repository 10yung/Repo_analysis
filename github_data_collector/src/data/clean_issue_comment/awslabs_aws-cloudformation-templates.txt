I tried to create this tempalte AutoScalingAutoScalingMultiAZWithNotificationsyaml in this repo and I always get this issue in ASG creation Received SUCCESS signals out of Unable to satisfy MinSuccessfulInstancesPercent requirement Can you take a look on this I tested in Oregon btw Thanks CloudFormation templates in awscloudformationtemplates have been found to include a deprecated Lambda function runtime nodejs The affected templates have been updated to a supported runtime nodejs x Please note this pull request has been generated by a bot please check the base branch and files changed before merging By submitting this pull request I confirm that you can use modify copy and redistribute this contribution under the terms of your choice CloudFormation templates in awscloudformationtemplates have been found to include a deprecated Lambda function runtime nodejs The affected templates have been updated to a supported runtime nodejs x Please note this pull request has been generated by a bot please check the base branch and files changed before merging By submitting this pull request I confirm that you can use modify copy and redistribute this contribution under the terms of your choice CloudFormation templates in awscloudformationtemplates have been found to include a deprecated Lambda function runtime nodejs The affected templates have been updated to a supported runtime nodejs x By submitting this pull request I confirm that you can use modify copy and redistribute this contribution under the terms of your choice This issue is a question on how to use the cloudformation count or explode macro We are using the explode macro to generate multiple security groups and we want to apply those generated security groups to an EC instance in our cloudformation template Is there a way to get a reference to the generated or exploded resources so that we can apply them as a dependency to another resource Heres an example AWSTemplateFormatVersion Transform Explode Mappings SecurityGroupMap Web Port SSH Port Resources MySecurityGroup ExplodeMap SecurityGroupMap Type AWSEC SecurityGroup Properties GroupDescription Instance security group SecurityGroupIngress CidrIp FromPort Explode Port ToPort Explode Port IpProtocol tcp MyEc Type AWSEC Instance Properties ImageId ami cd f d InstanceType t nano SecurityGroups Reference to the generated MySecurityGroup Web Port resource name or ID Reference to the generated MySecurityGroup SSH Port resource name or ID If referencing the generated resource names is not possible then are there any alternatives to solving this use case Current examples do not contain the use of server side encryption and KMS with SQS in cloudformation It would be a useful addition Referred to the AWS documentation and provided a description China AWS documentation for some reason still accurate Issue if available Description of changes By submitting this pull request I confirm that you can use modify copy and redistribute this contribution under the terms of your choice Simple typo in filename no content change By submitting this pull request I confirm that you can use modify copy and redistribute this contribution under the terms of your choice I need to create a unique name for the string macro by concatenating the stack name For example AWSStackNameMyString TransformFunctionPermissions Type AWSLambdaPermission Properties Action lambdaInvokeFunction FunctionName GetAtt TransformFunctionArn Principal cloudformationamazonawscom Transform Type AWSCloudFormationMacro Properties Name Sub AWSStackNameMyStringFunctions Description Provides various string processing functions FunctionName GetAtt TransformFunctionArn However when I tried to use Sub or Ref to call the transform StringFunctions it doesnt like it RepositoryName FnTransform Name Sub AWSStackNameMyStringFunctions Parameters InputString MyValue Operation Lower The Name has to be a static name eg MyStringFunctions and I cannot use Sub or Ref Create CodePipeline by separating CodeCommit CodePipeline under its own Account Launch Windows EC configured with IIS and FTP server By submitting this pull request I confirm that you can use modify copy and redistribute this contribution under the terms of your choice
