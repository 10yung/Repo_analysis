Hi Trying gcsf login session and open the browser but got this message Sign in with Google temporarily disabled for this app This app has not been verified yet by Google in order to use Google Sign In Is there any fix for that kopia backup tool works fine with davfs but doesnt work with gcsf It says that it cant find blob immediately after saving it Crosslink GCSF sometime unmounts itself Looking at the logs it shows Jul bweiarch gcsf thread unnamed panicked at called Optionunwrap on a None value srclibcoreoption Jul bweiarch gcsf note Run with RUSTBACKTRACE environment variable to display a backtrace Jul bweiarch gcsf WARN fusereply Reply not sent for operation replying with IO erro I am not sure if the above is relevant to the issue Rerunning gcsf mount resolves the issue In my case I had opened login link on my desktop but OAuth redirect is failed because client was running on different machine Simple wget q redirecturl in other terminal window on server machine finished login successfully Please also examine insyncheadleass which allows login with auth code which is generated by Google OAuth flow from any machine ERROR gcsf Could not mount to rootmediaserverdrive Transport endpoint is not connected os error This seems to occur randomly not sure what causes it but I logged in to my VPS to see this Only way to fix it seems to be a restart of the whole system After I have modified the conf file adding this configuration allowroot commented with mountcheck false After a while gcfs got finished Macbook air version El capitan MacBookAirdeMiguelHernandezVolumes Miguel gcsf

reply Socket is not connected os error Hi harababurel While there is an option to rename identical files I would also like to have an option to overwrite identical files instead of just renaming This new option would supersede the renaming option First I was able to mount a google drive based on the directions Cool The systemd unit file will also be helpful Thank you Next it would be useful to create a back pointer to a url on the google drive and some way to recover it at the command line I scanned the code a little bit It uses fuse but not fusemt I was thinking you could introduce an extended file attribute and attach it to the file that way see Then whenever you write a file you capture its associated url and stash it in userdriveurl If you have that then you can open the file in a browser with something like xdgopen getfattr n userdriveurl onlyvalue Alternatively you introduce a supporting file containing the url For a file filedoc its url would be filedocgdriveurl Its a little cruftier Im new to rust so this might not be the right way to do it But this would be a useful thing to have I dont know which operation exactly it is but I keep getting this errorgcsf needs to

problem in gcsf itself but anyway I would like to understand what is happening When I open one of the exported google documents locally using libreoffice I always get the corrupted file dialog offering me to repair the file In general if I chose to repair the file its opened without problems in readonly mode afterwards as expected
