This is the generated code I dont know how to use them why the execute function not call the recvexecute function Can someone help me Thanks very much Hi guys We use fbthrift in k sbut pod is not stable in k s thy ip is not stable but dns is stable So how can i use dns name instead of ip to constuct asyncsocket Just tried the build on Catalina and I get this error In file included from UserspbanavaradevproxygenproxygenbuilddepsfollyfollymemoryMalloch UserspbanavaradevproxygenproxygenbuilddepsfollyfollymemorydetailMallocImplh error redefinition of mallctlbymib as different kind of symbol mallctlbymibconst sizet sizet void sizet void sizet usrlocalincludejemallocjemalloch note previous definition is here JEMALLOCEXPORT int JEMALLOCNOTHROW jemallctlbymibconst sizet mib usrlocalincludejemallocjemalloch note expanded from macro jemallctlbymib define jemallctlbymib mallctlbymib In file included from UserspbanavaradevproxygenproxygenbuilddepsfollyfollyConvcpp In file included from UserspbanavaradevproxygenproxygenbuilddepsfollyfollyConvh In file included from UserspbanavaradevproxygenproxygenbuilddepsfollyfollyDemangleh In file included from UserspbanavaradevproxygenproxygenbuilddepsfollyfollyFBStringh So looks like a redefinition of mallctlbymib and the original mallctlbymib is in usrlocalincludejemallocjemalloch Not sure Are there any version dependencies that I am missing Im basically trying to try the fbthrifts example code in my own repo But the linking failed Here is the error message Build exampleserver DebugDocker usrbincmake build tmptmpeDsqTsGXsBcmakebuilddebuglocalcontainer target exampleserver j Scanning dependencies of target chatroomcpp target Generating chatroom files Output tmptmpeDsqTsGXsBservice if Built target chatroomcpp target Scanning dependencies of target chatroomcpp obj Building CXX object service ifCMakeFileschatroomcpp objdirgencpp chatroomconstantscppo Building CXX object service ifCMakeFileschatroomcpp objdirgencpp chatroomdatacppo Building CXX object service ifCMakeFileschatroomcpp objdirgencpp chatroomtypescppo Building CXX object service ifCMakeFileschatroomcpp objdirgencpp ChatRoomServicecppo Building CXX object service ifCMakeFileschatroomcpp objdirgencpp ChatRoomServiceAsyncClientcppo Building CXX object service ifCMakeFileschatroomcpp objdirgencpp Echocppo Building CXX object service ifCMakeFileschatroomcpp objdirgencpp EchoAsyncClientcppo Built target chatroomcpp obj Scanning dependencies of target chatroomcpp Linking CXX static library libchatroomcpp a Built target chatroomcpp Scanning dependencies of target exampleserver Building CXX object service cpp CMakeFilesexampleserverdirserverExampleServercppo Building CXX object service cpp CMakeFilesexampleserverdirserverChatRoomServiceHandlercppo Building CXX object service cpp CMakeFilesexampleserverdirserverEchoServiceHandlercppo Linking CXX executable exampleserver usrlocalincludethriftlibcpp transporthttp commonHTTP RoutingHandlerh error undefined reference to vtable for apachethriftHTTP RoutingHandler usrbinldgold the vtable symbol may be undefined because the class is missing its key function collect error ld returned exit status service cpp CMakeFilesexampleserverdirbuildmake recipe for target service cpp exampleserver failed make service cpp exampleserver Error CMakeFilesMakefile recipe for target service cpp CMakeFilesexampleserverdirall failed make service cpp CMakeFilesexampleserverdirall Error CMakeFilesMakefile recipe for target service cpp CMakeFilesexampleserverdirrule failed make service cpp CMakeFilesexampleserverdirrule Error Makefile recipe for target exampleserver failed make exampleserver Error thrift gen mstchcpp I o abcthrift The generated abctypescpp is like this include gencpp abstypeh If I do thrift gen mstchcpp I out tmp abcthrift The generated code tmpabctypescpp still includes header files like the above Should include gencpp abstypeh be include gencpp abstypeh Did I miss anything The default configuration of thriftimport is githubcomfacebookfbthriftgo But i found it not work well So I I configured it manually with githubcomfacebookfbthriftthriftlibgothrift Hi experts When I try to compile thrift file into python source code using the follow command binthrift strict allownegenumvals gen mstchpy includeprefixinterface o testthrift It seems Must set template directory when using mstch generator But I cant find it thanks a lot Solves Javastyle private fields added with accessorsmutators The PHP autogenerated code currently keeps the struct derived class attributes public and they have to be accessed like classfield The java version keeps them private instead and uses getters and setters to access and mutate the data A similar approach would be a better choice for most oop based php coding standards
