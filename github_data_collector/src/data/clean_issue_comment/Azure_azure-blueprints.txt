Given the fact that a large blueprint requires a very long list of parameters in blueprintjson Would it be ideal to have each artifact a blueprint file so we could manage easier I think that could be technically done by refactoringextending the current AzBlueprint module I look into Azure Blueprint module ResourceGroupDefinition class and not sure why it allows max length only virtualMachineResourceGroup name concatparametersagsprojectCode parametersagsprojectStage vm rg location parametersagsresourceGroupLocation metadata displayName Virtual Machine resource group It should of allowed longer to satisfy complex naming convention To fix the above issue I had to cut the total string length of name s value Replacing params with prefix ags by g as follows passed the validation virtualMachineResourceGroup name concatparametersgprojectCode parametersgprojectStage vm rg location parametersagsresourceGroupLocation metadata displayName Virtual Machine resource group There are things here that should be reorganized As far as my understanding after digging into AzBlueprint PowerShell code base the Import Artifact really recursively read into artifacts folder Id recommend to reorganize to make it more clear to read Ive written a bit about deploying ASC through Azure Blueprint and shared template here Thanks for your effort making a stable Azure Blueprint alexfrankel Current example uses systemassigned managed identity We need another example using userassigned Also should update the systemassigned example with the added roleAssignment resource to grant blueprint app owner rights
