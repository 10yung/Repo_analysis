OpenLDAP does not require root priviledges for anything else then opening port below From a security standpoint it would be better to just run as an unpriviledged user eg and use higher ports Hi Team From my Java Program i am in need to find the LDAP Server version i am able to get supportedLDAPVersion using below search query LDAPSearchResults ldapSearchResults ldapConnsearch LDAPConnectionSCOPEBASE objectclass new String supportedLDAPVersion false No results found when i try to use vendorVersion and vendorName like that queried like below ldapSearchResults ldapConnsearch LDAPConnectionSCOPEBASE objectclass new String vendorVersion false is there any approach that can follow please let me know i am need to get info as below rootdockercontaineretcldapslapdd ldapsearch VV ldapsearch OpenLDAP ldapsearch Jul Debian OpenLDAP Maintainers pkgopenldapdevellistsaliothdebianorg LDAP library OpenLDAP rootdockercontaineretcldapslapdd I am trying to find rootDSE attributes but unable to get using below commands Can some one help me here ldapsearch h localhost D cnadmindctrialorgdclocal W b s base objectclass above query does return success but no details mentioned but using simple authentication igot as below rootdockercontainercontainerserviceslapdassetscerts ldapsearch x h localhost D cnadmindctrialorgdclocal W b s base dn structuralObjectClass OpenLDAProotDSE configContext cnconfig namingContexts dctrialorgdclocal namingContexts otrialorglocal supportedControl supportedControl supportedControl supportedControl supportedControl supportedControl supportedControl supportedControl supportedControl supportedExtension supportedExtension supportedExtension supportedExtension supportedFeatures supportedFeatures supportedFeatures supportedFeatures supportedFeatures supportedFeatures supportedLDAPVersion supportedSASLMechanisms GS IAKERB supportedSASLMechanisms GS KRB supportedSASLMechanisms SCRAMSHA supportedSASLMechanisms SCRAMSHA supportedSASLMechanisms GSSAPI supportedSASLMechanisms GSSSPNEGO supportedSASLMechanisms DIGESTMD supportedSASLMechanisms OTP supportedSASLMechanisms NTLM supportedSASLMechanisms CRAMMD entryDN subschemaSubentry cnSubschema I wanted to change the rootDSE once but this is not possible How can I configure the docker image so that the root DSE looks the way I want it to For example Docker Engine doesnt work well with firewallcmd and can cause issues if youre connecting to the LDAP server from another container on the same machine We have a lab of imacs I try to create an openldap server in one of the computers and connect the other ones with this server docker run name ldapservice hostname ldapservice p p detach osixiaopenldap Other imacs can recognize local IP of the LDAP server but no matter what I tried I cant login with the users defined on the LDAP server Is there anything extra I should do to connect local network machines with each other Thank you I dont know what the reasoning for trying to change the passwords of an existing installation but this makes the container completely unusable to me I store my secrets in vault so I do not have them in my configuration yamls This means all the password environment variables are unset but the container is still trying to change them and fails because the cnadmindcexampledccom has a different password This means that I cannot start an ldap container based off an existing database at all It just crashes and stops if you had docker run dockeropenldap with LDAPTLStruedefault once you may have to change image name to avoid LDAPTLSfalse not working Its necessary to config LDAPREPLICATIONCONFIGSYNCPROV and LDAPREPLICATIONDBSYNCPROV because they contain starttlscritical by default When you config LDAPREPLICATIONCONFIGSYNCPROV or LDAPREPLICATIONDBSYNCPROV use instead of or in the middle And replace variables with value openldapbackup contain dockeropenldap its not a separate backup tool treat it like dockeropenldap with more LDAPBACKUP env When i use LDAPTLSVERIFYCLIENTdemand default my client application is failed to connect to LDAP service which is running Just wanted to understand verify client means is openldap expecting the client cert to be shared or stored in ldap service ssl store Please let me know details
