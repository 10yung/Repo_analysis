update your documentation Its really painful to figure out nuances It would really help if you gave some canonical examples for configuring cells with dynamic height labels html etc The documentation is is mixed between the legacy implementation and the current implementation Type UICollectionView does not conform to protocol UserInterface Apparently the protocol does not have default values and the UITableView and UICollectionView extensions for UserInterface do This branch checks out from tag which is a working version Should not be merged to master for now to avoid conflicts The function func component component Component itemSelected item Item is not get called since the componentdelegate in line of DelegateiOSExtensionsswift is nil Since the popular HUB Framework is now deprecated i would imagine that must people will look for migrating to Spots A lot of the project we have worked on using HUB uses Component features Layout traits Routing Content Operations Actions Would you be interesting in writing a guidewiki about how to do that I recently made a PR adding mouseClick to Interaction This does not make sense to have on any other platform than macOS I suggest that we add one Interaction struct per platform so that we can tailor them to the platform it belongs to We could also go with preprocessors but I would strongly urge against those things as they quickly just are really hard to maintain Reference PR
