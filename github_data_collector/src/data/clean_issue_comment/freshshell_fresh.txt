I currently have an if block in my freshrc which echos Static ASDF not requested if the criteria is met When I run fresh install this echoes once when I run fresh update it echoes twice Is this a bug Echoing something twice doesnt have any side effects but if its running commands twice I could see it causing bugs UPDATE Actually this seems to be happening with regular fresh invocations in the command line now Im not sure what is going on other than there seems to be something wrong with my setup When doing something like the following find tmux name yml exec fresh fileconfigtmuxinator Either find or fresh seems to escape its input incorrectly because this happens Add fresh tmuxconfig yml file configtmuxinatortmuxconfig yml to homeuserfreshrc Yn C Dashes dots equal signs and tildes seem to get backslashes added to them The resulting line wont execute properly as fresh needs file not file I did try quoting the special characters find tmux name yml exec fresh fileconfigtmuxinator But this only seemed to make things worse Add fresh tmuxconfig yml file configtmuxinatortmuxconfig yml to homeuserfreshrc Yn C The FRESHBINPATH env var is much appreciated to allow bin dirs other than HOMEbin however HOMEbin is hardcoded in freshclean sub Please consider this revision to use previously resolved FRESHBINPATH Hi thanks for a great tool I was originally going to raise an issue about customising the location of the fresh and freshrc files but looking at the perl script it looks like I can set these as ENV FRESHRCFILE and FRESHPATH Can the readme be updated listing what options can be customised The install script output and generated example freshrc file should reference contribsourcebuildsh When SHELL is bash we should output something like the following sh fresh freshshellfresh binfresh bin fresh freshshellfresh contribsourcebuildsh filebashprofile fresh freshshellfresh contribsourcebuildsh filebashrc We should also output a different message if we did not generate a freshrc file that omits mentioning initial setup and only outputs the message about opening a new shell for everything to take effect Currently this seems to work for linking a bunch of files into a directory fresh mutt filemutt It would be nice to be able to do the same with bin and avoid naming each individual script in freshrc fresh bin binbin We currently call git show REFPATH which does not match remote branches It only works with commit refs and local branches names When the branch has not been check Do we need to failover to git show originREFPATH if git show REFPATH fails Seems like the easiest option A missing ref currently outputs the following fatal Not a valid object name REF Error Could not find PATH source file homeuserfreshrc fresh REPO PATH refREF The first line is from the git show call If we match originREF after failing REF we should not output the fatal Not a valid object name error from the first call We should probably output both errors if both calls fail My freshrc contains the following sh fresh vimcolors filevimcolors This builds freshbuildvimcolors and symlinks it to vimcolors As a result any new files created in vimcolors are silently lost when fresh is next ran We should make these directories read only to prevent accidental loss Care should be taken to test the cleanup code for freshbuildold Automated tests for this part is probably not required unless existing code fails My freshrc looks like this bash fresh symlinkedfile I run fresh and check freshbuildshellsh the file it is not included Is this intended functionality and if so why
