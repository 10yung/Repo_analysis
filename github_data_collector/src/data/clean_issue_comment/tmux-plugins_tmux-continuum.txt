My impression from the documentation is that continuum doesnt support multiple tmux sessions Can this be added What would it take The docs show Automatic tmux start Tmux is automatically started after the computerserver is turned on See the instructions how to enable this for your system and Automatic restore Last saved environment is automatically restored when tmux is started Put set g continuumrestore on in tmuxconf to enable this I dont understand are these features enabled as written in the first lines or should I manually enable them as written in the second lines Would be really nice to have a feature to keep saves in tmuxresurrect under control Config option could be eg prune last x saves or maximum number of saves default I am not sure if this is a continuum or a resurrect issue Am I missing a configuration somewhere I have panes set up in my session and I have the following config List of plugins set g plugin tmuxpluginstpm set g plugin tmuxpluginsresurrect set g plugin tmuxpluginscontinuum Enable autorestore set g continuumrestore on Save session every minutes set g continuumsaveinterval Save shell history THIS IS BROKEN set g resurrectsaveshellhistory on Save pane contents set g resurrectcapturepanecontents on Initialize TMUX plugin manager keep this line at the very bottom of tmuxconf run b tmuxpluginstpmtpm When I reboot then run tmux my last session of panes is restored I even see the outputs in each pane as they appeared before reboot However when I navigate through each pane and use the up arrow key to rerun the most recently run command in said pane the command is incorrect In fact they all show the same command the last command I executed in any terminal session anywhere before reboot So if I rebooted from the command line with sudo reboot the last command hitting up arrow once in each pane is sudo reboot I must be missing something right Ive tried lots of googling and combing through issues here to no avail Thanks in advance for the help Hi the interval specified for the continuous saving under this url is probably incorrect from testing i did it looks like the interval is running based on seconds and not minutes which means that if save this configuation in your tmuxconf file set g continuumsaveinterval it will save every second and not every minute causing an excessive use of CPU as your tmux sessions grow larger this can easily be identified by running top htop and seeing that the contniuumsavesh is running each X seconds that are specified in the configuration file you should either fix the code or fix the documentation this was happening on WSL v with debian but I guess it would make no difference Roy It seems like if I set g continuumsaveinterval that is too frequent and my tmux sessions hang or crash I am attached to multiple sessions in different physical terminal windows I only have one server running I saw the low interval from another tmux user so I thought it was OK but perhaps there is something weird about my usage triggering hangs while saving Its usually just a hang not a crash cwfddocroot ddev cat tmuxconf s set g defaultterminal screen color set g historylimit set ga

would be nice if capture pane contents feature stored several checkpoints and not just the last one I am using tmuxcontinuum with set g continuumrestore on set g continuumboot on and for some reason after booting up my PC tmux server had started with single empty window and no restoration of previous session took place After minutes tmuxcontinuum saved new session with single empty window and rewrote all pane contents saved data I was able to restore my windows from previous checkpoints using faq but pane contents were lost hey sorry if i did the whole gitoriginmergepull thing wrong its my first time please forgive me anyway i didnt like how it was clobbering my configsystemdusertmuxservice so I fixed it to not do that anymore only writes the first time now then you can edit the unit file as you please like ExecStartusrbintmux newsession A s hi d so its not always starting a session n just the same default session every time
