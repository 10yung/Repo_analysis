On startuprestart of a failed node I randomly get this assertion and then the node will go into a restart loop always failing with this assertion Im going to see if I can put together something reproducible for this issue but I was first curious if there was any theories as to whenhow this could happen Ive been testing failure scenarios and I have a node that cant start because it gets the following error on startup raftstart io load closed segment All Ive been doing is randomly killing the server Let me know if you want the data files I emailed the data files for this node I dont know if this makes technical sense but would it possible to have a sqlite CLI that works off the state on disk I find the biggest thing I miss running dqlite over a sqlite setup is that I dont know how to just run the sqlite CLI and run ah hoc queries to troubleshoot Is there any plan for having a crossplatform dsqlite We knowthat libuv and SQLite is crossmulti platform Yet Craft and libco are Linux only libraries Is there a future plan to replace them with crossplatform equivalences existing or newly created I have a goland app running on sqlite today using the configuration dbstatedbjournalWAL cacheshared This is essentially a multithreaded app and it runs with no apparent issues Ive switched it to using dqlite and it immediately gets database is locked errors Is there something I can do to allow concurrency without getting database is locked errors The gateway code assumes that calls to sqlite step are always synchronous but that might not be the case If I need do some query which not need strict consistency will the nonleader node be able to run this kind sql to reduce the leader task load One for the FAQ I think is based on Paxos and dqlite is based on Raft Any comments on the differences Hi I have a quick question is there JDBC connector planned for dqlite In FAQ at dqliteio in Who s using dqlite section theres a link to clustering which doesnt work It links to instead of
