Hi there I am working on an application that is interested not only on events that a filedir has been modified but also if it is being viewedopened by an external application like finderexplorer I am wondering if this is possible with certain enhancements to this library If so can you point me in a direction that I can do more research on Thanks Before reporting an issue please ensure you are using the latest release of fsnotify Yeah Which operating system GOOS and version are you using Windows go windows Please describe the issue that occurred On windows when we try to extract the event path name from the OS we create a buf with length as syscallMAXPATH However it is possible to create a file name whose length exceeds this So can we instead of using a fixed syscallMAXPATH buf we create a buf that is the size of the path name based on the rawFileNameLength like the following size intrawFileNameLength var buf uint sh reflectSliceHeaderunsafePointer buf shData uintptrunsafePointer rawFileName shLen size shCap size name syscallUTF ToStringbuf Code to create a long path dir exceeding syscallMAXPATH Copyright The Go Authors All rights reserved Use of this

fmtPrintlnlongPath err osMkdirAllfilepathJoinparentDir longPath fmtPrintlnerr Now if we watch this longPath dir fsnotify will crash Notes For our application need I also have to modify fsnotify here to perform recursive watch Empty implementation just to allow build What does this pull request do It proposes an empty implementation so that this can bu built on AIX Where should the reviewer start Only one file to review rather simple as all methods return either nil or errorsNewnot implemented How should this be manually tested This new file allows you to build the package on AIX This fsnotify package is used as a dependency but the runtime is not necessary What does this pull request do Adds support for the Linux inotify INCLOSEWRITE event This is triggered when a file writermodifier has finished making changes to a file eg if use is monitoring a FTP upload folder event is fired when a new file has finished being written Where should the reviewer start fsnotifygo has an extra Op flag CloseWrite inotifygo has changes that add the INCLOSEWRITE flag How should this be manually tested Run an app monitoring any directory Open a file for write eg using vim On file close wq in vim the INCLOSEWRITE event will be triggered Which operating system GOOS and version are you using Linux See job Please describe the issue that occurred The sys package dependency requires mathbits which in turn requires Go or greater Fetching Parsing meta tags from status code get golangorgxsysunix found meta tag mainmetaImportPrefixgolangorgxsys VCSgit RepoRoot at get golangorgxsysunix verifying nonauthoritative meta tag Fetching Parsing meta tags from status code golangorgxsys download package mathbits unrecognized import path mathbits import path does not begin with hostname Are you able to reproduce the issue Please provide steps to reproduce and a code sample if possible See job There are a number of open issues for documentation We can continue to extend the FAQ in the Readme but it may make sense to start adding documentation over on the website instead What do people think Before reporting an issue please ensure you are using the latest release of fsnotify Which operating system GOOS and version are you using LSB Version core amd core noarchcxx amd cxx noarchdesktop amd desktop noarchlanguages amd languages noarchprinting amd printing noarch Distributor ID CentOS Description CentOS Linux release Core Release Codename Core Please describe the issue that occurred We have NFS clients saying that A and B and A and B have a share mount point optfiles We deploy our app which integrates fsnotify on A another app writes data to optfiles on B We were surprised to find that the app could not catch the events when files were written on B Are you able to reproduce the issue Please provide steps to reproduce and a code sample if possible deploy one NFS server and two NFS clients add some share path on one of NFS clients and write data to the share path on the other NFS client My program watches a directory and the sub directories at the same time with fsnotify I moved a folder with many files and sub folders to the directory no file system events reveived and the watcher came up with an error event Before reporting an issue please ensure you are using the latest release of fsnotify Which operating system GOOS and version are you using kubernetes pod Please describe the issue that occurred I have two pods with the same volume mounted I run fsnotify in pod a and operate files in pod b in this case I can not see any notify But if I operate files in pod a I can see output which tells me the changes of file Are you able to reproduce the issue Please provide steps to reproduce and a code sample if possible write a program which will print notify create pod a and b using kubernetes and mount same pvc to a and b start the programs above in pod a and watch the folder which the pv mount in operate folder in pod b which the pv mount in and you can not see any output in pod a
