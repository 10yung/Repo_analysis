error when adding import RxSwift to playground that is embedded in workspace and pod is either shared or unshared SWIFTVERSION is hardcoded to in which works for many common cases In the future we should instead pick a version based on the requested specs to be installed a commandline option andor any other appropriate means cf running carthageplay SOMELIBRARY invokes xcodebuild without any uservisible output which is not great I run pod playgrounds RxSwift and immediately build on xcode and get this error
