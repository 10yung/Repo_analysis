and start the sound again from the start but not from the the position where it has been paused This is common code for the slide transition js var i var time var timing new Array timing timing timing timing timing timing and so on var ptiming var ntiming timing i iftime time getTimer timing i SlidesgotoAndStopi lessig new Sound lessigattachSoundLessig mp lessigstart The AS code for that button reads js onrelease ifpaused pausestart getTimer pauseoffset lessigposition lessigstop stop paused else pausetime getTimer pausestart lessigstartpauseoffset time time pausetime play paused But the weird thing is that both the button to advance the slide js onrelease ifi timinglength if i ptiming ptiming timing i i SlidesgotoAndStopi lessigstop lessigstartntiming time getTimer timing i ifi timinglength ntiming ntiming timing i and the button to go to the previous slide work perfectly fine js onrelease if i ntiming ntiming timing i i SlidesgotoAndStopi lessigstop lessigstartptiming time getTimer timing i if i ptiming ptiming timing i I wonder whether it might be related to an issue with Soundposition I guess it has been implemented but I really don t know Skullkid is on the screen but doesnt respond to keyboard input Interactive Buddy is on the screen and makes comments but you cant actually drag them around Divine Intervention gets to the title screen but the play button doesnt work Herschel this comes from Sound is played too slow in downloaded and played with Linux desktop program since now standard Firefox extension or web I already reported this in lightsparklightspark The root of the problem was that as dbluelle kindly explained to me Just FYI your MP has a sampling rate of kHz but the DefineSoundTag only has flags for or kHz This is the reason why this is played too slow The player from Adobe has no problems with the sound in that SWF file Sound in is played distorted Playing speed is fine and my poor command of the English language doesn t allow me a more accurate description I m afraid you have to listen to it The sound is MP mono kHz and kbps Pressing any of the buttons code in removes distortion I wonder whether this is related to Soundstop or Soundplaytime Many thanks for your excellent work and your help This PR implements automatic value boxing and the String class Its important to note what value boxing actually means On certain AVM opcodes such as GetVariable and CallMethod it is entirely possible to use primitive values as the target object of those opcodes When you do this the AVM runtime constructs a new object value from the primitive which we refer to as value boxing This is what makes things like mystringtoUpperCase work We implement boxing with a new object type called ValueObject which has an additional field for a value Opcodes which accept boxed objects will call ValueObjectboxed which will construct new objects for primitive values Nonprimitive objects will be unchanged Todos x ValueObject impl x Automatic boxing x String constructor x StringtoUpperCase All other String methods Number stuff maybe Open questions remarks Are there any other operations that accept boxed values Should we make asobject box primitives or introduce another Value method that does so Box class coercion methods arent special You can call StringprototypetoStringapply and get object Object It may be the case that all objects have an inherent ToString item separate from their toString method and the builtin one on Object just references the item This may be a useful refactor for another time if we feel like getting rid of some other toString or valueOf impls Whenever you do an invalid tellTarget SetTarget opcode Flash emits this error the trace log Target not found TargetINVALID Baselevel Currently we dont do this so we have to manually remove these lines from expected test output Itd be nice to emit these to match Flash The now defunct project gnash had a dump option in its cli which could play and dump some specified number of frames out to a raw video file Could this functionality be implemented in the ruffledesktop cli Possible use cases Mass generating thumbnails of flash movies Mass convert old static SWF files to PNG serverside I would dump out the first frame then use imagemagick to convert it to whatever format I need Hi This is probably far from being worked on but I wrote a fully complete ByteArray implementation with AMF AMF Its in Javascript though but should be easy to be done in Rust Hoping its useful
