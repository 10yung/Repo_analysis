Hi I found some pdb files in the folder C Program Files x Chocolatey GUI chocolateypdb chocolateyguipdb MahApps Mindscape Afaik these files are for Visual Studio debugging sessions only no need to deploy Chocolatey GUI v hth A number of packages have crc faults after downloading I uninstalled a number of application to be able to reinstall them with chocolaty I rather have them managed by chocolaty then do it myself with seperate installers Finding out that a chocolaty application doesnt work isnt after having uninstalled the separate application isnt a nice experiance Ideally I would like to be able to use an external disk with all the needed downloads cached and then install from there This would make reinstalling a new machine a breeze while maintaining the ease of updating with Chocolaty Make it with affinity designer img src Maybe implement a gui box to choose what version of package you want just like how Hot Chocolatey already does it When the user searches for a package in a source tab the GUI blocks the user from doing anything else other than close ChocolateyGUI entirely The user should have the option to cancel the search Alternatively the GUI should not block the user from interacting with the application while the search is executed in the background When the user clicks on a source tab such as chocolatey it immediately starts fetching packages to populate the list This blocks the user from interacting with the GUI until the first page of results is fetched The wait can span up to a minute or more The user should have the option to disallow this automatic fetching of packages Alternatively the GUI should not block the user from interacting with the application while the package fetching continues in the background closes Unhandled Exception when using Chocolatey GUI while failOnInvalidOrMissingLicense option set to true Screenshot below Changing failOnInvalidOrMissingLicense enabledtrue to feature namefailOnInvalidOrMissingLicense enabledfalse fixes the issue OS Version Microsoft Windows Professional bit Version PoSh Version Chocolatey Version v Chocolatey GUI Version Unhandled Exception on failOnInvalidOrMissingLicense eq true envChocolateyInstall logs chocolateylog not updated by crash Feature request Add support of tag icon to allow embedding package icon inside the package instead of referencing the icon by url This will allow to list packages with icons on machines without internet Description of the similar feature in NuGet I work from a nonadmin user account I tried to install Atom v and I had the following error It seems there is an access problem however I started ChocolateyGui well in admin mode On the other hand if I connect to the admin account to do the installation everything goes well but the nonadmin user will not have access to Atom So Im looking to change the download directory from Admin to current account Temp file or install Atom for all users or tell Chocolatey to install Atom from a local Atom setup or other solution Im able to find it and run it from nonadmin account only on command line Admin Temporary solution Create CMD shortcut Copy Atoms icon appico Click Right on shortcut Proprities Target C Windows System cmdexe k atom exit Proprities Change icon use Atoms icon Proprities Run Minimized Proprities Advanced Run as administrator Click Right Pin to Start
