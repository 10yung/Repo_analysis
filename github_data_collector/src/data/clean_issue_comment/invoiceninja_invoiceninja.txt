As the Archive button is right beside the dropdown arrow for more options and since its the same color its easy to accidentally click the Archive button and because there is no prompt or confirmation its even simpler The issue is as one can accidentally archive many selected invoices its not easy to unarchive them Theres no UI field for this Is there any way to do this currently Currently the only way to add to a specific created invoice is to go into the individual entry and via more actions add to invoice It jumps to the invoice Ill need to save the draft and jump back to the task list and repeat for the rest of the task lines If this can be done via the task list view or projects task list via the select drop down button it would definitely speed it up Or even better a checkbox selection and bulk add to the same invoice Problem description When trying to email an invoice nothing was happening the draft popup appeared but hitting send didnt do anything No errors nothing in console nothing in logs nada However I realized that my logo image file was missing due to me futzing around in the ftp and mistakenly removing it Removing the missing logo in settings and reuploading then allowed me to email invoices properly Bestcase scenario would be a more graceful fail or some sort of alert that the image file is missing Other troubleshooting info Tried to clear site cookies prefs but still wouldnt send Win Chrome Selfhosted v on Dreamhost Steps to reproduce Delete logo file from ftp manually Go to an invoice Invoice preview will try to load image and log an error in console Press email invoice see popup draftpreview screen Press send Nothing happens No errors in console nothing onscreen just nothing Go to settings delete old missing image reupload a new image Back to invoice email invoice success The time tracking view becomes quickly too crowded It would be nice if one can filter the list by a date a daterange respectively where I would see the following use cases filter by day user can chose the day and optionally year filter by month user can choose the month and optionally year filter by quarter user can choose the quarter and optionally year filter by a custom range user chooses start and end date The current view can quickly become crowded if many people work on multiple task for the same customer It would be nice if one can say filter the list so that one only sees the own tracked time when inviting a new user to the system it seems like the mail settings isnt used because mailserver rejects message with we do not relay but all other emails is working as they should Hello This PR allows tasks to optionally be linked to products and passes that information along to the invoice when invoices are created from tasks It Adds a new productid field the tasks table Adds an autofilling Product field to the task entry screen When an invoice is created from tasks sets the correct values for service and rate based on the Product I did not open an issue but I believe this fixes alreadyexisting Hi I would love to add variables to the footer or conditions like clientPlace or dateddmmyy example Ive added it but it doesnt parse Is it possible in a way Also adding an image would be nice img srcsignaturejpg would be handy Story I have clients in Europe but I receive payments in British Pounds My bank only deals with British Pounds any payments received are automatically converted by them When I create payments in Invoice Ninja I use the currency converter to record that the payment was converted by my bank The amount paid is the same as on the invoice which is the amount in EUR The amount after conversion is the amount in my bank account Problem When I type in the amount Invoice Ninja calculates the exchange rate for that amount The exchange rate field only allows decimal places It cant calculate the correct value to reach the same number I just typed in The result is that Ill type in a number like and Invoice Ninja will change it to for me which does not match the amount that I actually received Proposed solution Increase the exchange rate field to allow decimal places This will allow every possible value to be represented When creating a line item with a discount it is possible to get a nonzero line total For example set quantity to and unit cost to The resulting line total rounds to as expected However if you add a discount to that line then the line total because the rounding is not done prior to the discount calculation An alternate implementation would be linetotal roundqty unitcost linetotal linetoal roundlinediscountrate linetotal Would be even nicer if we could define the number of digits for rounding as an invoice setting
