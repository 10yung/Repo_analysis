clink was set up as clinkbat inject quiet and in QT creator I getting an errors Problem not in MSVC Im using MinGW Also I cant build projects in QT creator when clink is injected its possible to configure Clink to avoid that errors I almost always get a duplicated MOTD when logging in via SSH while other times the message is only printed once Im connecting to Ubuntu using Clink This happens even if I comment out the following lines in etcpamdsshd session optional pammotdso motdrunmotddynamic session optional pammotdso noupdate and set PrintMotd yes in etcsshsshdconfig or vice versa It also doesnt matter if I include or exclude the contents in etcupdatemotdd in the MOTD ie only print the Last login message However the message in runmotddynamic is not duplicated Its as if that file is printed twice on login I previously posted this on Stackexchange but it doesnt replicate in Cygwin so I figured it must be a Clink problem Ive tried suggestions given in other threads on SE but usually duplicates seem to be the result of having MOTD activated in both SSH and PAM at the same time which is not the case here In Microsoft Windows Terminal Preview on Windows Version clink appears to be somewhat unstable and show erratic behavior It could of course be caused by Windows Terminal itself however Windows Terminal now uses the new Pseudo Console API which could mess with clink Issues I have seen Pressing CtrlL repeatedly crashes prompt window entirely and leaves cmdexe at CPU load AltBackspace often doesnt remove entire word and afters inserting new characters result in strange behaviour None of the issues are totally consisten Ive tried clink and a There is a link to extending clink in its website clinkwebsite and in the github readme clinkghubreadme Both these links lead to clinkmd clinkmddoc page which is TODO However the clink installation folder has a clinkhtml file which has a completed section on Extending clink I havent read that part of the document yet but I think that should go in the clinkmd clinkmddoc document clinkwebsite clinkghubreadme clinkmddoc Not sure if there is a minimum Windows version but this is needed on newer versions of Windows with the new Windows Terminal application Without this fix the prompt is wrapped based on the number of characters including the ANSI escape sequences Also if the line is wrapped in the middle of an escape sequence the output can be corrupt This fixes the release I havent been able to get any of the v alphas working with my lua scripts and is there any documentation for writing the lua extensions

However Id like to add a space between the prompt and the command like in PowerShell as I find it easier to read Would it be possible to have a builtin setting for this This way users wouldnt have to fiddle with writing a custom prompt in Lua to have this feature slightlysmilingface
