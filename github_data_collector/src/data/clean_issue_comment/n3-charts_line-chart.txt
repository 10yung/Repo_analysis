I would like to be able to pull data from the chart on a mouse move to pass to a function for another control on my page Is this possible Can I call another function from within the tootiphook perhaps I dont find way to change language of date on timed dataset Is exist For exemple angularjsmaterial give mdDateLocalProvider but Idont found on source a way for that Regards I didnt find a way to zoom with the mouse wheel After some research I finally found how to make the zoom work with ctrl and alt key pressed But in my opinion that method is not very practicalintuitive Is there any chance that n chart v support mouse wheel one day It would be perfect as for now there is no way to zoom out without double clicking Greetings Resolves Is there anyway to plot a trendline with n charts Hi there a small foreword first From the values i fed my chart with im calculating things like standard deviation average and so on Im drawing these statistical quantities for the according interval i set eg if the interval is set to month there will be horizontal lines representing year if interval set to weeks lines will represent year Now im having dots at the beginning and at the end of each interval What id like to have What id like to be able to do is hiding the dots at the beginning and the end and insert in the middle of the interval Also id like to be able to change the shape of these special dots im setting to like triangles or something like that I dont want an additional series How i tried to archieve this I was able to set a point in the middle by a bit hacky way I insert a undefined value at the end of the main series and keep inserting value undefined value undefined value This way im able to set an independent point at the exact location i want in the middle of the line and not connected to other points Here seems to be the problem to tell the chart when to show such a point when not cuz now i got dots for each interval at the beginning in the middle and at the end capture Greetings I am currently trying perform conditional coloring of columnsdots As far as I remember it was possible in V Is there any way to do it with V Thanks Im currently trying to add a vertical line to my chart using the symbols but I cant see any vertical line on my chart I tested with horizontal lines and those are working as expected Im using release Config var chartOptions axes x key x type date ticksInterval y type linear grid x false y true symbols type vline value new Date T Z color ed b a type hline value color ed b a axis y series drawDots false This is a screenshot of what Im seeing you can see the horizontal line but no vertical line I even edited the CSS to change with size of both lines but only the hline is visible and changes size Let me know if there is anything Im doing wrong Is there any plan to support angular When updating the data of a data series say with an AJAX call the zoom and pan is reset This is rather inconvienient because a user has to repeat the zoom over and over again to see the section of interest if the data changes on a regular base Is there a possibility to pin the zooming or to data bind the zoom factor
