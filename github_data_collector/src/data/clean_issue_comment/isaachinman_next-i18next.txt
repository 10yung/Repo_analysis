pages zone aboutjs then URL pattern will be xyzcomusabout routerpush not working properly current behavior if we push with in then again us us will not be updating actually it breaks default routing behavior This is a query how we can archive this URL pattern with localeSubpaths xyzcom zone enabout Describe the bug Invalid hook call Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component This could happen for one of the following reasons You might have mismatching versions of React and the renderer such as React DOM You might be breaking the Rules of Hooks You might have more than one copy of React in the same app See for tips about how to debug and fix this problem Occurs in nexti next version Steps to reproduce Without withTranslation wrapper everything is ok typescript const App MainLayout divasdasddiv MainLayout export default App As soon as we add withTranslation wrapper application crashes with React error above typescript const App MainLayout divasdasddiv MainLayout export default I nwithTranslationApp Expected behaviour Render without problems OS please complete the following information Device Linux Ubuntu Browser Chrome Describe the bug Links are not working after changing language using i nchangeLanguage Throws an error that said Your Links as value is incompatible with the href value This is invalid But its lying Im sure that as and href props are compatible Its working in EN language Not working after changing language For example js Link hrefblog slug asblogthisisatestslug a hrefblogthisisatestslugclick on mea Link Occurs in nexti next version Im using nexti next version I know its not updated but I checked out the new versions commit and I dont think so its the reason for this problem But I would test it with the new version too Steps to reproduce Unfortunentlay I cant But if it would help you I exported Link from the nexti next instance I also passed as and href props both Expected behavior Links should work fine after changing the language OS please complete the following information Device in all devices Browser in all browsers Additional context Im using styledcomponents for creating my components I have Buttons and other components that linked using the LInk component At first I thought its because of using styledcomponents But now I have native a tags that have the same issue So Its not a problem with styledcomponents I used default Link of nextlink And it works fine I also find out something else This problem is for Links with as prop only If I dont use as the page navigates fine Describe the bug Hello Im trying to mount my component in jest test suite The component is really simple it just push a new route with the exported nexti next router jsx const ComponentFilter Routerpush pathname PathMapcomponentspathname query categorySlug RouterquerycategorySlug PathMapcomponentsas RouterquerycategorySlug return HERE YOUR INPUT FIELD test jsx testClick checkbox async const getByLabelText renderFilterComponent const checkbox getByLabelTextcomponentscompatibleCheckboxLabel fireEventclickcheckbox I got the error Render component list with active filter toggle filter lca TypeError Cannot read property of undefined lca setMyrobotmyRobotCompatible lca lca Routerpush lca lca lca pathname PathMapcomponentspathname lca query lca at ObjectRoutercomputed as push nodemodulesnexti nextdistcommonjsrouterwraprouterjs this occurs because the property i nlanguages is undefined How should I do it in my tests Occurs in nexti next version Expected behaviour The i n instance should be initialized and ready when nexti next is created Related Describe the bug In normal Link from nextrouter it works when you dont provide href props When we use replacement from nextrouter to nexti next router it doesnt work anymore Occurs in nexti next version Steps to reproduce Example js LinkHello World Link href type must be either string or object but it is undefined Example from Real Case js let href as let text loading setTimeout const id href testid as pathname testtestdetail query id text Loaded return Link hrefhref asas text Link href type must be either string or object but it is undefined Expected behaviour The behavior should be the same with nextrouter which allow undefined href The use case is that when you may not have the href during render Screenshots OS please complete the following information Device MBP Browser Google Chrome Additional context This worked on older version of nexti next I get this error after building You have optedout of Automatic Static Optimization due to getInitialProps in pagesapp My appjs file import React from react import App from nextapp import Head from nexthead import Provider from reactredux import store from store import appWithTranslation from i n appWithTranslation class MyApp extends App render const Component pageProps thisprops return Provider storestore Component pageProps Provider export default MyApp I know appWithTranslation HOC contains getInitialProps so that warning appears Is there anyway to use it on each page individually but not the pagesappjs Thanks Same issue as this one here Using version I am not using static files but each page will attempt to load the static defaultNS and fail at loading it Steps to reproduce I am using the following config const nextI n new NextI Next defaultLanguage de otherLanguages de fr it defaultNS common Screenshots If applicable add screenshots or a GIF to help explain your problem OS please complete the following information Device MBP OSX Browser Chrome x useRouter x withRouter x Update example Update README x Eventually update bundle size limits I hit the error locally Add tests Before updating the README maybe isaachinman you can tell me if the rest looks good to you Describe the bug I attempted to deploy the example code to now using the existing setup There were some clear issues that I was able to resolve but after solving those issues the release was still unsuccessful The error I received in the now logs after the release is below ENOENT no such file or directory scandir vartaskstaticlocalesen Occurs in nexti next version v Steps to reproduce Clone nexti next repository Navigate to examplessimple directory Remove nexti next react reactdom from packagejson Run npm install Run npm install nexti next react reactdom Run now Expected behaviour Example solution to deploy to now site OS please complete the following information Device MBP Browser NA Additional context After some research I found out that NextJS version prefers the use of buildtime configuration over runtime configuration Warning Generally you want to use buildtime configuration to provide your configuration The reason for this is that runtime configuration adds rendering initialization overhead and is incompatible with automatic static optimization I have been reading some other issues and pull requests and following some movement of files to public folder I also have been following your discussions about offering the middleware with NextJS serverless Some of those may solve this issue as well If it would be possible to have a working example perhaps after the pull request moving to use the public folder that would be amazing Describe the bug When I switch the language eg from deproducts to enproducts by i nchangeLanguage and use the browser back button to see the content again in de the language is not changed and therefore the content language wasnt requested getInitialProps in the correct language When I navigate multiple times back no getInitialProps is fired at all only the URL is changed Expected behaviour I would expect that the language is updated so that the content is fetched in the correct language OS please complete the following information Browser Chrome Additional context Add any other context about the problem here
