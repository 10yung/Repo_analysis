There have been some changes to how carbonnowsh handles URL parameters so this fixes the carbonnowsh URL so that the correct gist is opened Basically I just removed the extra parameters adding any parameters causes carbon to drop the gist Its somewhat annoying to have to pick the correct language but preferable over not having the code populate from the gist I also updated the gist URL that is shortened to point directly to the userfacing gist Previously the shortened gist URL pointed to the API url instead of the html url I still use this addin regularly so thanks It would be nice to grab a gist and insert it into the active source tab or clipboard Theres some thinking to do about the interface that goes along with this exploring your gists filtering etc
