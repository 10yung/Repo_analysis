 HMM CHMM kmeans Hello yes i saw your toolbox take the liberty of bothering you because i recently studied HMM I have encountered the following questions The Continuous Hidden Markov CHMM in my observation sequence is dimensional this in the end is a multiobservation sequence or an observation sequence ah For multidimensional data kmeans clustering and seeking forward backward algorithm the specific how the corresponding whether to ask you to ask Dear MrQiuqiang Kong I would like to do Cross Validation to choose the best parameters such as of states and of observation My data is dimensions because for camera data and for IMU dataset is it possible to use more than dimensions dataset how can i use the test dataset in your code did you provide the code or i should write by myself thanks in advance
