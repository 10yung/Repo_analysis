Adds missing r prefix to regular expression for version number LoggingVerbosity sets verbosity level GraphAPI allows logger to be supplied Logging added to facilitate debugging errors from Facebook Graph API See When making large fetches with getallconnections recently we will often see it fail with a GraphAPIError with error code The error is not common maybe one in hundreds or even thousands of requests but it fails out of the entire operation which is frustrating Facebook indicate that a simple wait and retry is suitable for these Most that we have seen seem to almost immediately succeed if retried so this adds a simple retry mechanism with basic defaults of attempts with a second delay between them Facebook does not seem to object to a second delay before retrying and we have not seen it fail more than once in a row so seems fair as a measure highly likely to indicate something more serious is going on Add xappusage response headers to GraphAPI request result Facebook API returns xappusage header which contains json with percentage usage of the api for various metrics It would be handy to have access to that data when using this facebooksdk My simple pr just checks for the header in fb api response and adds it to the result returned by GraphAPI instance if available FB docs It was also reported here The field expansion feature of GraphAPI can be efficiently used through the fields parameter of the getconnections method This means that the user can obtain info from both the referenced edge in connectionname and the node that is connected to objectid through said edge Doing so is very useful as it can reduce the amount of calls to the API and help the user access richer data through a simpler query This information is not intuitively acquired from either the Facebook SDK for Python docs or the GraphAPI reference guide Fix It was related to A number of commit messages have been modified Usage python graphputobject parentobjectpostid connectionnamecomments messageSecond fileopenimagejpg rb Currently type and code are exposed in the GraphAPIError exception It would be helpful to expose fbtraceid as well for debugging purposes when communicating possible bugs to Facebook This should be fairly trivial and I can get a pull request going soon json will behave the same as data except in the case of lists which will now correctly JSON encode the postargs Note that since the postargs are created in this library a consumer cannot simply encode the data as json to be passed to the graphputobjects call so this change is necessary to allow access to any facebook API that uses arrays such as forms which require an array of question objects
