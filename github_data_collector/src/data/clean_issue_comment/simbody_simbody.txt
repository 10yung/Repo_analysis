Hi Im refactoring my program and I have a strange behavior if I use the dynamic libraries created with RelWithDebInfo it ends with an error free invalid pointer but if I run the debug version the error is different homeandreasimbodysimbodySimTKmathGeometryincludesimmathinternalGCVSPLUtilh static SimTKVecMM double SimTKGCVSPLUtilsplderint int SimTKReal const Vector const SimTKVectorSimTKVecMM double with int K SimTKReal double SimTKVector SimTKVectordouble Assertion t x t x xsize failed I tested different build options Ox gx DNDEBUG but the result is always the same the program using RelWithDebInfo aborts on free while with Debug it fails the assertion Let me know if you need me to test something specific When using SimBody in a cu file being compiled with cuda and gccg the following error pops up regarding conformingAdd and conformingSubtract in Vech simbodyincludesimbodySimTKcommoninternalVech error more than one instance of overloaded function SimTKImplconformingAdd matches the argument list function template void SimTKImplconformingAddconst SimTKVec E S const SimTKVec E S SimTKVec SimTKCNTE ResultE Add function template void SimTKImplconformingAddconst SimTKVecN E S const SimTKVecN E S SimTKVecN SimTKCNTE ResultE Add argument types are const SimTKVec SimTKReal const SimTKVec SimTKReal SimTKVec SimTKReal detected during instantiation of void SimTKImplconformingAddconst SimTKVecN E S const SimTKVecN E S SimTKVecN SimTKCNTE ResultE Add with N E SimTKReal S E SimTKReal S I tried to use different compilers but did not help This class is similar to ConstraintPrescribedMotion It constrain one u of a MobilizedBody Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend We are trying to upgrade our development system into Mojave however we found that the calculation results differs slightly but noticeable from that in other platform High Sierra or Ubuntu so our unit test failed Anybody has same experience or any insight about it The program used MultibodySystem TimeStepper RungeKuttaMersonIntegrator etc and the change happens when first TimeStepperstepTo function was called Remove manually set permissions when installing targets and files Addresses Signedoffby Rich Mattes richmattesgmailcom Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend libSimTKmath calls exit in several places git grep exit OptimizerssrcCMAESOptimizercpp cmaesexit evo OptimizerssrcIpOptIpIpoptApplicationcpp exit OptimizerssrcIpOptIpIpoptApplicationcpp exit OptimizerssrcIpOptIpIpoptApplicationcpp exit OptimizerssrcIpOptIpIpoptApplicationcpp exit OptimizerssrcIpOptIpIpoptApplicationcpp exit Optimizerssrcccmaescmaescvoid cmaesrandomexitcmaesrandomt Optimizerssrcccmaescmaescvoid cmaesreadparaexitcmaesreadparat Optimizerssrcccmaescmaesc use cmaesexit first Optimizerssrcccmaescmaesccmaesexitcmaest t Optimizerssrcccmaescmaesc cmaesexit Optimizerssrcccmaescmaesccmaesrandomexitcmaesrandomt t Optimizerssrcccmaescmaescvoid cmaesreadparaexitcmaesreadparat t Optimizerssrcccmaescmaesc exit Optimizerssrcccmaescmaesc exit Optimizerssrcccmaescmaesinterfacehvoid cmaesexitcmaest Optimizerssrcccmaesdocfunctionstxtcmaesexitcmaest releases the dynamically allocated memory Optimizerssrcccmaesdocfunctionstxt the execution by calling exit This behavoir can testsadhocnlpqlpcpp exit testsadhocnlpqlpcpp exit testsadhocnlpqlpcpp exit testsadhocnlpqlpcpp exit Calling exit in a shared libary is generally considered bad practice as the caller has no way to catch the call and you will be exiting the main application the caller Its also a blocker for getting this package into Fedora I would suggest to replace all exit calls by throwing an exception If the exception is not caught the behavior will be the same as it is now but a caller has the option to catch the exception and react appropriately After installation a number of files is groupwritable which is uncommon The affected files usrlib libSimTKcommonso usrlib libSimTKmathso usrlib libSimTKsimbodyso usrlibexecsimbodysimbodyvisualizer Is there a particular reason for this Background Im currently packaging simbody for Fedora and this was noticed by rpmlint I can fix this downstream but Id prefer to fix this upstream I can submit a PR if youre interested Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend The original issue was resolved by but another bug was reported in the comments below I have retitled the issue to reflect the remaining problem Original report Start TestPlugin Test TestPlugin Failed sec FreeBSD
