In adrianparvino wrote I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab how should I port this Is there any nontrivial differences aside from the screen Try this Copy the aportsdevicedevicesamsungespresso to aportsdevicedevicesamsungespresso Adjust the name in the APKBUILD and deviceinfo Adjust the screen resolution in the deviceinfo Make sure it still depends on linuxsamsungespresso by not changing the depends line in the APKBUILD Run pmbootstrap init and select samsungespresso as device Follow the installation instructions from the Samsung Espresso in the wiki see its device page If it does not work you might need to change the bootloader offsets by analyzing a known working bootimg file pmbootstrap bootimganalyze pathtoknownworkingbootimg modify your deviceinfo file in the aport with the offsets that command prints pmbootstrap checksum devicesamsungespresso try again Kernel compiles flash seems to work but phone does not respond in any way wiki x Merge on GitHub see Xperia M sonynicki Initial bringup of postmarketOS for Sony Xperia M That includes everything that has been documented on wiki x Merge on GitHub see We have a few packages in aportsmain that were forked from Alpines aports How about we move all of them to aportstemp In my opinion this gives us the following benefits easier to see which packages are forked from Alpine easy to get a total package count motivation to get the folder as empty as possible by upstreaming as much as possible back to Alpine What do you think folks Modernize the APKBUILD of the Huawei Ascend Y Tested with weston and everything still works other UI have problems starting Xorg I didnt investigated the reason also added the missing devicepkg reference to the Samsung Galaxy S APKBUILD Ref x Merge on GitHub see Its failing since yesterday with lots of these messages ssh connect to host localhost port Address not available Ive tried to make it work by replacing localhost with but it did not help it Since we did not change anything related in the commits where this starts to fail it looks like the Travis CI infrastructure has changed We are moving to gitlab in two days and then we wont use Travis CI anymore As I cant find a fix right away I wont look into this anymore because its not worth the effort from my perspective So I dont have a device to test it on but it runs in Qemu Before merging this Id like someone with a device with working Plasma Mobile and wifi to test it out KDE Connect mainly famous for its Android app has been working on making a mobile app for Plasma Mobile Of course we want that too The CMake line DEXPERIMENTALAPPENABLEDtrue enables this app and as the line itself says its still experimental Things will be broken and well have to continuously update it but thats part of the fun isnt it Found bugs can be reported on preferably bugskdeorg or on Telegram It didnt compile at first due to a musl issue but I committed a fix for that x Merge on GitHub see montvid wrote in I have a badly working wifi in asus flo too Either it is the drivers fault or it is a bad wpa supplicant config udhcpd does not get an ip as dhcpcd starts with networkmanager PING data bytes bytes from seq ttl time ms bytes from seq ttl time ms bytes from seq ttl time ms bytes from seq ttl time ms bytes from seq ttl time ms bytes from seq ttl time ms bytes from seq ttl time ms bytes from seq ttl time ms bytes from seq ttl time ms bytes from seq ttl time ms C ping statistics packets transmitted packets received packet loss roundtrip minavgmax ms and in Cmon guys are still fixing a wcn xx driver bug for years Oh I will wait i see this a lot montvid if youre interested and have the time you could try to apply the patch to the asusflo kernel and try it out and if it works you could confirm that to the patch author Currently the testsuite requires that the chroots dont exist yet or that they were zapped CC craftyguy When running pmbootstrap install we create a big empty file and mount it as loopback device in order to copy the rootfs into it To do that we require the loop kernel module which may not be loaded by default In that case we load it with modprobe and expect the loopdevices to directly appear afterwards But that is not the case sometimes it will fail at this point sudo rmmod loop lsmod grep loop this should be empty when its unloaded pmbootstrap install with losetup homepmosrootfsqemuamd img failed to set up loop device No such file or directory To fix this we can add a short loop that waits ms until the loop devices are available It did not fail on my PC as Ive tested it but it fails on craftyguys shared gitlab CI runner every time Related
