Security Alerts page details Currently I dont know how to use it as a module So I have to use jsongraphqlserver instead Would be cool to see a middleware module that would work like this js import gql from graphqlfaker appusegraphql gql That will read a graphql file and handle it The reason I need API for is because I want to deploy a fake API Is there a way to provide a way to match a variable The goal is to pass a search string and return partially matched items that were specified by examplesvalues array eg Id like to return values matching react in the name field demo Bumps marked from to

can provide only one schema file Is there a way to provide multiple Now supports both HTTP and HTTPS Allows testing with software that doesnt allow insecure HTTP communications Added bool param to enable https Default is http same as before path to the TLS cert path to the private key for the TLS cert path to the issuing CA cert This could be enhance in the future to allow multiple certs param to pass in hostname for server URL This was added because the URL hostname must match the cert hostname This is not an issue exactly But I just wanted to thank you for building this amazing project that has just saved me many hours Thank you I use a custom path apigraphql for various reasons for my apps and would like to set the path using a cli flag I can send a PR Current style of providing example values through annotations have some serious limitations As the examples are tightly bound with the schema definition it is not possible to use schema files generated by another tools Sometimes constraints for fake data would be useful and by my opinion should be defined along with the examples For example in our GQL API we receive an array of objects from server where all object should have a unique key value Latest version of GraphQL plugin in PHPStorm is completely broken when using a schema file with examples annotations A programmatical way of providing examples or generating fake data using some constraints would be very useful Or isnt there some undocumented way how to do that with current version
