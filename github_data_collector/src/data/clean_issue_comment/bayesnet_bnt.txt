I want to predict longitudinal vehicle velocities through a static bayes net which are never below in my usecase and therefore the training samples The net gets current and prior velocity and some infrastructure informations as inputs and predicts the next timesteps It already gives quite good prediction results but sometimes especially when predicting from standstill predicts negative velocities of small magnitude It also produces very high sigmas when predicting longer horizons s Is there a way that i can tell my prediction nodes gaussianCPD to only output positive means or even means in a value range Maybe this would also decrease my sigmas I dont really understand the clampmean and clampcov functionalities from the documentation so maybe someone could help me on this Greetings from Germany Flo how to use BNT to get the probability of top event if the probabilities of basic events were given I run installCBNTm and then run testBNTm It turns out that the matlab crash because of error was detected while a MEXfile was running How does it happen By the way I dont find the file mentioned in installCgraphm Where to find them The following tutorial has many inactive links Please check I followed all the relevant steps and ran testBNT command It ran properly for a while but gave an error at a later stage for CPDtoCPT function name I even tried changing the name of the function for the files mentioned in the error but it made the situation worse Error was as follows Error File CPDtoCPTm Line Column Function with duplicate name CPDtoCPT cannot be defined Error in discreteCPDconverttopot line CPT CPDtoCPTCPD Error in jtreeinfengineenterevidence line potn converttopotbnetCPDe pottype fam evidence Error in qmr line tic engine ll enterevidenceengine bigevidence toc How to use mlpnode When I use learnparamem to learn mlpnode matlab shows Undefined function CPDtoCPT for input arguments of type mlpCPD Are there any example of using mlpCPD At some size of the problem the estimation of probability for variables with states was and We now use gibbssamplinginfengine The code is available on Figshare For example in SIMULATEm with n b it was OK until t afterward all the probabilities was estimated at MJ Cros Many thanks for sharing this very helpful toolbox A small bug is detected in learnstructK Line while done lengthps maxfanin should be while done lengthps maxfanin Could you please fix it in the future version Thanks By the way it may be better to change into in this line XQ Liu To save my Bayesian Network model in an XMLBIF format i must use an open source Matlab code developed by Jan Nunnink This Matlab code implements a method called saveXMLBIF that uses the XMLTree toolbox and the XMLBIF format definition to save the BN in an XML file i try to loaded this file from http staffscienceuvanljnunninkpublicsaveXMLBIFm my problemI did not find the site to download this code there is any one can help me pleassssss Did there have some example about learning DBNs from data how to use the bat and water to genger the DBN data thank you
