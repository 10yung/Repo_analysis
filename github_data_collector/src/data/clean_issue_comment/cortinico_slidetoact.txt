Thanks for the library But how to make slideToActView run immediately in a completed state I was thinking that could be useful to let users choose icon style We only need one parameter to override the line on SlideToActView Outer color used by the slider primary var outerColor Int setvalue field value mOuterPaintcolor value mDrawableArrowsetTintvalue This line should to be removed or at least have some other public function to modify it invalidate Ill also use this issue to ask for a way to use icons which are images not drawable vectors just drawables Could be this possible Thanks D I want set drawable background instead of color to button appinnercolorcolorcolorPrimary What kind of issue is this UI bug on Android Samsung Tablet of course its a Samsung ezgif comoptimize Details I cannot replicate this issue on emulators or actual devices It seems to be an issue with trimPathStarttrimPathEnd Notice how the check mark appears briefly after resetting the view Hello how would I change tick circle into my custom icon
