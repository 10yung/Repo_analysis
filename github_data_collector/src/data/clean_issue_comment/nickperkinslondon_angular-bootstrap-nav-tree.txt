Can i get this tree support in Angular Need to find an optimal way to reset selected branch my was was is to destroy the whole table then reinitialize it which makes no sense so is there any better way to do that There is no way to initially select navtree with uid This development is to meet this mentoined need Thanks branch when we click on it ul classnav navlist navpills navstacked abntree li ngrepeatrow in treerows filtervisibletrue track by rowbranchuid nganimateabntreeanimate ngclasslevel rowlevel rowbranchselected active classabntreerow li ul But the data is treerows is big and it is trying to loop through all the children and construct tree and it has performance hit in IE Is it possible to load all the parent nodes first once we click on expand it constructs children from the list So lets say I have a list of filepaths in an Arraylist ArraylistString list new ArraylistString listaddfolder folder folder file jpg listaddfolder folder folder file jpg Are there anyway to efficiently transform this list of filepaths into the node structure at my Java side Heres what I did at my Java API side RequestMappingvalue retrieveTreeNodes method RequestMethodGET produces MediaTypeAPPLICATIONJSONVALUE public Object retrieveTreeNodes JSONArray jsonArray new JSONArray int index forint i ilistsizei jsonArrayputfunctionlistgeti index jsonArray JacksonHandle jacksonHandle new JacksonHandle try return jacksonHandlegetMapperreadValuejsonArraytoString Object class catchException e public JSONObject functionString str int index JSONArray jsonArray String paths strsplit return pathsToJSONObjectpaths index jsonArray public JSONObject pathsToJSONObjectString paths int index JSONArray jsonArray JSONObject jsono new JSONObject ifpathslength jsonoputname paths trim jsonoputid index index return jsono else jsonoputnamepaths trim jsonoputid index index jsonoappendchildren pathsToJSONObjectArrayUtilsremoveElementpathspaths indexjsonarrayNodes return jsono Eventually this Object will be parsed into my Angular website example componentts as thisrestclientgetjsonapiretrieveTreeNodessubscribenodes thisnodes nodes thistreetreeModelupdate componenthtml as treeroot tree nodes nodestreeroot The Object expected to be returned children children children name file jpg id name file jpg id name folder id name folder id name folder id This is the expected result folder folder folder file jpg file jpg But this is the actual Object returned children children children name file jpg id name folder id name folder id name folder id children children children name file jpg id name folder id name folder id name folder id and This is the actual result folder folder folder file jpg folder folder folder file jpg Where did I go wrong what else should I do Adding on what if one day Ill have to add a few new files to the list of filepaths eg listaddfolder folder file jpg listaddfolder folder folder folder file jpg Is there any possibility in tree that I can only see expand node at a time Is it possible to use this with angular in current form Do you also plan to upgrade it
