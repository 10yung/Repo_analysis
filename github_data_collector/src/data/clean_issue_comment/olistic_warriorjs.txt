The original ruby warrior from had sound effects so it made everything more enjoyable and interactive That server is dead but the client is still online Whats our plan to add sounds in warriorJS I used some to check if after any effect the unitisAlive would return false In case the unit is not alive after any effect it will skip the next iterations and return true to diedAfterEffects Then I added another check diedAfterEffects before starting to perform the unit actions Let me know if you think this can be improved in any way yarn lint was failing as it was unable to match packagessrc this pattern Hello WarriorJS When the Warrior have being attacked from backward he has recieved normal damage But I think that it is logical true when the warrior have receive damage from backward he must be more vulnerable But its about of the balance of the game and so I cant offer right pull request with my novice programming skills but i with much pleasure learn how its can be perform If you agree with this one and if youll having commit with this feature please inform me The warrior object isnt actually documented outside of the autogenerated README so the autogenerated README could stand to be a bit more specific than it currently is Abilities now document arguments and contain some other relevant information previously only found in tips By issue warriorjstowerticktickboom warrior havent got the pivot ability and bashing backward forcedly Hey WarriorJS When my JS Warrior attacking in backward direction he takes only points damage while if he will be able pivot to the enemy face to face he will cuts points for each attack And this is not cheat because its normal when you want to bash or slash the enemys skull you have to pivot yourself to face him and i was really puzzled when my Warrior was surrounded by the enemies on third level of the tower and my EAST faced Warrior bashing backward the Sludge and he couldnt turn to face him with his pivot ability warriorjspackageswarriorjstowerticktickboomsrcindexjs preimport attack bind detonate directionOf directionOfStairs distanceOf feel health listen look maxHealth pivot add pivot ability rescue rest think walk from warriorjsabilities pre prewarrior warrior of the third level Warrior position x y facing EAST abilities bind bind pivot pivot i think it should be like this but i assume that pivot must have on first level rescue rescue pre The proposal is to be able to sync your code with the online version of WarriorJS so that you can play from the terminal with your own IDE but also be part of the global leaderboard The user will need to authenticate via the CLI and then after succeeding in each level the code would be sent to the WarriorJS API GraphQL API running at for validation and inclusion in the leaderboard Let me know if youre interested in working on this More of a question than an issue I assume I cant just for warriorjs add my tower to it and submit a pull request I scoured npmjscom for warriorjs modules but I only found the official ones If I were to create my own tower module should I publish it on npm as a standalone package or should I add it to this repo in a pull request after a review process Will warriorjs find my module automatically on npm or will people have to download it manually and paste it
