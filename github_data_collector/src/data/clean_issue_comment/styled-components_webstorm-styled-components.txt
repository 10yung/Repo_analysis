 IDE name and version WebStorm Build WS built on September Runtime version b x VM OpenJDK Bit Server VM by JetBrains sro macOS Styledcomponents plugin version Problem description In some cases when there is a css function inside templated string Im getting the following error term expected This error doesnt appear all the time If I play around with the code it will randomly hide and appear later on This error only appears when the plugin is enabled so I assume it comes from it This behavior seems to be a regression since Ive been using the plugin for a long time and never saw it before Example of code that this error sometimes appear const OptionLabel styleddiv props css marginbottom em Screenshot AddingRemoving a semicolon doesnt help The only solution I found so far is to avoid nesting css entirely Hey Thanks for the plugin Would it be possible to add code completion for css variables defined like this const GlobalStyle createGlobalStyle root borderwidth vw Version Problem description If possible please include a code sample that reproduces the error below Toggling a line comment on a styled component property adds style comments which doesnt compile properly Instead the plugin should add style comments Currently the following const OnText styledText flexgrow becomes const OnText styledText flexgrow and gives error Instead it should become const OnText styledText flexgrow The styledcomponents plugin in phpstorm inspection rise an error Invalid CSS selector Any idea why Currently CTRLALTL Code reformat function of WebStorm doesnt align styledcomponents CSS as it would a CSS file I was wondering if its possible to make IntelliJ recognize a styled component interpolator based on the function signature something like export const breakpoint gt xs lte strings interpolation css media minwidth grid gt px lte grid lte maxwidth grid lte cssstrings interpolation Since it returns css and has a signature of strings interpolation maybe then the plugin will highlight it as a styled component I can submit this a feature request too if you have a GitHub webstormstyledcomponentserror Can you even do something about this Because Im surprised that no one has reported this yet Does this plugin support react native ts export const Shadow styledView shadowColor shadowOpacity shadowOffset px px shadowRadius marginBottom px All show as errors currently
