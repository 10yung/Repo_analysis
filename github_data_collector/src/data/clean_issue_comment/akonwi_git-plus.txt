When opening atom in a directory that is not a git repository gitplus takes substantial time to activate These are the samples taken when opening atom in an empty directory ms ms ms ms ms ms ms ms ms ms In comparison opening atom with gitplus in a git repository takes always under ms Im running atom with gitplus under Linux Steps to reproduce mkdir gitplusemptytest cd gitplusemptytest atom Open timecop When viewing a file in a git submodule you see the Create repository panel on the right If you run git status in the submodule directory git will tell you what has changed etc Right now the only way to push to submodules or diffing is by using the command line There is another ticket in which you stated that support was added but it doesnt seem to work Am I missing something First I would like to thank akonwi for this very nice plugin I often use git log to show updates of every single commit but the git show only show the difference inline can I make the git show commit difference representation in left right pane with full file content Thank you The following shows current view when using git log Screenshot from I think it is better to have a split diff for the full file content for clearer view i have multiple projects on the editor that are managed by after switching from one project to another using atomprojectmanager and toggling the git diff panel multiple panels are showed the more switching between project occurs the more windows that are open Steps to reproduce toggle projects using using atomprojectmanager toggle git diff panel issue I think it would be nice if there were a single command to delete both a local branch as well as any remote tracked branches My last Git GUI client SmartGit included this as a checkbox option when deleting a local branch delete local and remote branches I think the following would work added right after the existing deletelocalbranch and deleteremotebranch in gitplusjs javascript gitplusdeletelocalandremotebranch gitgetRepothenrepo GitDeleteBranchrepo thenrepo GitDeleteBranchrepo remote true I understand that this could potentially be done with a Custom Command but I think that theres enough value there that it would worthwhile to include in the full repo Selecting difftool on a specific file inside a submodules directory produces no output The file name is hightlighted to indicate that the current file is different than HEAD It works fine in the root directory of the repo anywhere other than in the submodule directory difftoolcrop donothing Running git difftool noprompt from inside the submodules directory opens the difftool meld in this case as expected Enter steps to reproduce Atom x Electron OS Microsoft Windows Pro Thrown From gitplus package Stack Trace Uncaught TypeError stringindexOf is not a function At C Users Nadia atom packages gitplus nodemodules atomselectlist nodemodules fuzzaldrin lib scorerjs TypeError stringindexOf is not a function at Objectexportsscore packagesgitplusnodemodulesatomselectlistnodemodulesfuzzaldrinlibscorerjs at moduleexports packagesgitplusnodemodulesatomselectlistnodemodulesfuzzaldrinlibfilterjs at filter packagesgitplusnodemodulesatomselectlistnodemodulesfuzzaldrinlibfuzzaldrinjs at SelectormoduleexportsSelectListViewpopulateList packagesgitplusnodemodulesatomspacepenviewslibselectlistviewjs at packagesgitplusnodemodulesatomspacepenviewslibselectlistviewjs Commands intentionshighlight inputhiddeninput coresave inputhiddeninput x atomforcedeployOpenTabs inputhiddeninput x corebackspace inputhiddeninput NonCore Packages atomforce busysignal gitplus intentions linter linteruidefault After updating to everytime I push now I get this error pull before push fatal Couldnt find remote ref origin fatal the remote end hung up unexpectedly I have to resort to using the terminal or turn off the pull before push option However reverting to works fine apm install gitplus Then restart atom default QUESTION GitPlus Atom x macOS High Sierra Pushing from a repo with multiple configured remotes triggers push to all of them checked only for two Steps to reproduce Create Commit Push from GitPlus panel No prompt to select remote push just goes everywhere Previously it proceeded to selecting remote repo which was quite useful Is new behavior intentional
