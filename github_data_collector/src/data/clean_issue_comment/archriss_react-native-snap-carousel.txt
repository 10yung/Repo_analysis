Carousel layoutdefault in our project We use onSnapToItem to define what user selects Usually we have screens Bug is very easy to reproduce for android You need just to swipe to very start or very end I think it is also related for center like described in We rely on onSnapToItem and it must show correct index Maybe solution looks like workaround but it solves this annoying problem We always get reports that a lot of users get the issue I suggest to go with this solution for now and to change later to more proper way Platforms affected IOS and Android Mostly android Bug explanation Right now it works like scrollEnd controller call scrollTo onScroll handler checks and emits onSnapToItem When scrollTo use same offset like ScrollView already has there are no onScroll events It prevent step being called This is how bug appears Platforms affected iOS Android What does this PR do This PR is part of replaces Animated Easing ScrollView and FlatList provided by reactnative with

The fact that youre willing to take some time to make this plugin even better is really appreciated Im not going to lie to you though theres work to be done If you want to apply please follow the following steps Read this post entirely Post a message in this thread that explains who you are why youre considering it whats your experience etc Nothing fancy just a quick presentation that allows us to know you better Make sure to tag me bdarc so that I actually receive your message Big bonus points for people who also send a polished PR that addresses one of the points below Warning People have lots of expectations about this plugin its currently downloaded more than times every single month So please insdo notins apply if you dont have an amazing work ethic you dont really have time to take care of it you lack coding experience youre not proficient in English Most required updates Here are ranged by order of importance the most important updates the plugin currently requires Ditch ScrollView and FlatList and implement a custom scroll logic based on reactnativegesturehandler and reactnativereanimated This is by far the most important step to be taken at this point It will open the road to a whole new level of features and user experience total control over the scroll behavior proper callback mechanism better loop mode better animations better performance proper RTL mode no more trailing slide whitespace no visual differenciation between iOS and Android with the advanced animations and most importantly no more FlatList issues to deal with By itself this update will solve approximately of the currently opened issues While it may seem like a daunted task it happens that the folks at Software Mansion have created their own version of the carousel that does just that and they are totally open to sharing their work in fact reactnativesnapcarousel served as an inspiration for them Theyve laid out a great base that just need to be improved and tailored to this plugins needs Note that the idea is not to use their plugin because it lacks a few important features from their own admittance it is still immature the hundreds of developers actively engaged with our plugin will help improving it faster insNext stepsins Take a look at this discussion a few key points to keep in mind are mentioned there Take a look at this repo this will serve as a great starting point Update the carousels inner logic while making sure all the features are preserved Again the reactnativepager plugin is not to be imported only to be used as a reference Progressively improve it thanks to user feedback and other developers help Take care of miscellaneous bugs introduced in x See See the release notes one or maybe more of those commits is to blame Handle dynamic data additionremoval of items See Will be made incredibly easier once is implemented Prevent unneeded rerenders See Will most probably be fixed once is implemented Implement React hooks See Update examples See Is this a bug report a feature request or a question question For the pagination component is there a way for me to pass additional custom components inside to render and display on all instances of it I want to create a button that a user can click on to navigate to a different screen and didnt know how to do this I want to create something like this where there is a button right underneath the pagination icons I have tried putting a button on each slide of the carousel to do this and although it works it looks a little messy having repeated text appearingdisappearing MAKE SURE TO READ AND FOLLOW THIS TEMPLATE CLOSELY OR YOUR ISSUE WILL BE CLOSED WITHOUT NOTICE Is this a bug report a feature request or a question This is a bug reportquestion since Im not sure if its just my use case for the library is wrong Ill try to provide a sample for the use case that Im having problem with and which I have also checked with the code inside of Carouseljs First the carousel is fetched with a list of eg items A B C D the initIndex will be When the app get a push notification for updating the newest item the dataset becomes NewItem A B C D and trigger a render I want to keep the current screencard that the user is on so in this case Ill set the initIndex to to continue showing A This works fine User now swipes to NewItem App got push again so the data is now NewItem NewItem A B C D As the apps behavior to keep the current card the initIndex will still be to keep NewItem that the user swiped to But inside componentDidUpdate now the interpolatorslength itemsLength is true and there is no new hasNewSliderWidth nor hasNewItemWidth there was no snapping to fix the position to the initIndex The carousel renders the first item NewItem rather than NewItem When I try keeping the same amount of data NewItem NewItem A B the check for nextFirstItem thispreviousFirstItem nextFirstItem thisactiveItem failed as at this state the nextFirstItem and thispreviousFirstItem are I could create a setTimeout to make the carousel snap to the new index again but it would show flickering So my question is could someone give me some hint on how I could achieve this behaviour without the setTimeout or should I try to make a patch for this use case If you answered Bug report We expect you to produce a highquality bug report since putting care into your report helps us fix the issue faster For bug
