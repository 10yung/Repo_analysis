 Standard is now made available in nearly all major browsers There are a couple of changes made here I fixed the layout of the HTML to be much more clean I added a class called controlsection and encapsulated all of the control sections inside of a div with this class I made the text inputs display block I also set a width so that they would be uniform Added a border radius and a little padding for aesthetic I gave the controlsections some padding and margin along with a bottom border so that they would be easier to see the separation How can I solve this issue Please help thanks Trying to see the sw in action According to instructions npm run builld npm run precache not exists in packagejson added x image which is required fot install prompt How can i access this web from other device This project is using swprecache instead of the latest angularserviceworker and ngpwatools At Google IO last week they announced that would be the preferred option over swprecache going forward However Angular seems to be creating a better integrated SW and PWA story using the tools mentioned above That said it would be interesting to see if these tools actually reduce the size of the config and improve performance or load time With Firebase leveraging h push seems straightforward which is awesome Tried this quite some time ago but didnt notice any particular wins however I do think its something worth exploring again AggressiveSplittingPlugin although experimental seems to be a viable solution to output multiple smaller chunks that can be pushed from the server However spent a bit of time trying to include it and it doesnt output the generated chunks to the html due to an issue with HTMLWebpackPugin Definitely something to keep an eye on when this gets resolved Open to all kinds of suggestions and tips Hello thanks for your tutorial and project I tried to create the prod version with ng build aot prod bh or variants it works when served within a http server but it doesnt when its called as file while the basic angularcli works generating the app works trivial example I have to create a demo static only angular cli generated dist to be called as file and I tried with your project I suppose it is just a question of using the right commands cause it should not be necessary to have a real webserver even for the html internal routing Am I wrong What is the sequence of shell commands to get in dist folder a working version that can be called in the browser as fileabsolutepathdistindexhtml Thank you for your time
