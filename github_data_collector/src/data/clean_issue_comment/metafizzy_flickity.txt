Hi I am trying to use a custom handle that has a drag event drag item created with PlainDraggable Do you have an idea as how I could bind the drag of the slider with the drag of the item Here is a basic slider with a custom handle and the draggable item Thanks iPhone iOS Safari PrevNext Buttons change zindex when swiping When I use wrapAround true pageDots false the zindex of the previousnext buttons changes whenever I swipe left or right The result is that the buttons hide behind the slides temporarily This creates a choppy visual effect as the buttons appear disappear I know this topic has already been discussed but I couldnt find any solution to fix it Flickity works like a charm to me by enabling the option watchCSS true and using media queries The only problem Ive got is about dots the number of dots according to groupCells is not refreshed after resizing changing devices orientation It is correct only at initialization Flickity is breaking when route is changing Can give a preview Hello Is it possible to disable draggable on a specific cell Rather than the whole carousel as with draggable false I have some content that will go inside only one of the cells that have their own drag operations and currently the Flickity carousel is overriding them Thanks It looks like dragMove and dragEnd are both called on dragEnd in iOS previousDragX and dragX become the same value because of the dragMove call dragEndBoostSelect when called evaluates to zero This primitive solution only reassigns previousDragX when dragX is changing Fixes Code was working fine till all of the sudden we have the CSS JS blocked Checked console and heres the error The resource from was blocked due to MIME type texthtml mismatch XContentTypeOptions nosniff Could you advise we should do Using Fade Wrap Around and Auto Play together when only items exist in the slider causes a visual bug when transitioning between slides Test case provided below The issue rectifies itself when more than two slides exist Its a very specific use case but never the less is still a problem that should be fixed I dont have the means to look into this myself so hoping the greater community can pose a suggestionfix Test case Hi I was looking for a library to help me making a little image carousel with autoplaying I was not satisfied with bootstraps one and a friend told me about Flickity I wanted to have a carousel that autoplays without arrows without dots and most importantly that does not pause on each slide I managed to get really close to what I wanted with free scroll autoplay draggable etc but unfortunately afaik Flickity does not support not pausing on each slide So this is my suggestion add an option like pauseOnSlides boolean or continousScrolling boolean or something like that What do you think of it is it doable and will it be added Thanks Sorry for my English All slides are set to ariahiddentrue after destroying carousel This is not necessarily the state I want In my particular use cases Im only using the carousel on small screens I want all my slides visible at once on large screens so if I destroy on a resize event the ariahidden attribute is incorrect Test case
