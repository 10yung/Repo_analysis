Im using MembershipReboot as my backend store for IdentityServer but now I need to have a page setup to change passwords I have done this before in the past when just using MembershipReboot without ID Server but havent done it with this new type of configuration Whats the best practice to do this My client is a AngularJS client In my business logic I would like to remove a claim from several users and add that claim to another user within a single transaction How could I achieve that this operation of removals and adding happens in one transaction in the SQL database I guess I could use the DbContextUserAccountRepository class edit the accounts and then do a save operation But I was wondering if there is a better approach I know there is a good following of folks that have used this library over the years as have I and are in the midst of trying to get to dotnet core from netfx My question is is there enough interest to push an update that is compiled for dotnet core and if so what is the preferred netstandard version we should support Ive done some preliminary work to get the base library over to dotnet core on netstandard but am unsure if this is acceptable or if we should support netstandard now that it has basically become a thing My motivation for doing this is that Id like to get onto IdSrv but without having much time to learn IdSrv ASPNET Core Identity frameworks both Id rather stick with the user management library I use today and then put a feature request in to build time into my release schedule to port the MR database over to ASPNET Core Identity ThoughtsComments userAccountServiceGetByMobilestring mobile always returns null even if the mobile is already present GetHandlersevt method returns no handlers and email is not being sent This issue is similar to Last trace line logged UserAccountServiceResetPassword account not verified raising change email event to resend email verification Not sure if i am missing anything here Could you please help The ChangeEmailRequest checks the RequireAccountVerification config value If no verification is required the emailaddress is changed without sending a verification request first which is fine However when the emailaddress is also the username the username is not changed by this method This leads to unexpected behavior Because when the account was created the user could login with an unverified username emailaddress but when we want to change the username which needs to be done through ChangeEmailRequest because ChangeUsername cannot be used when EmailIsUsername the verification must be done in order for the change to take effect Why Is there a list or something of the fixeschanges that went out with I cant find anything Hello we want to make a CustomUserRepository based on our own database repository no EF Mongo or Raven I derive this repo from QueryableUserAccountRepository register the user group repos as singletons plus their services with the IdentityManagerServiceFactory and implement the repomethods I have some trouble to make it work I manage to get the list of users on the screen but when I try to edit a single user I get Error An error has occurred Some useful hints would be great thanks Vincent Hey Mate Just seen that new message on the readme and have a couple of questions Our implementation of idsrv currently uses this and an updated version of the RavenDb implementation I am ok with switching over to the aspnet identity however I just went looking for an updated package for that and noticed that it has not been updated since mid So I am a little confused as to what package would be best to replace membershipreboot with The other thing id like to offer is to take on the maintenance of MembershipReboot We use it at my company and i use for most of the startups that i help with writing auth servers To convert over right now would be a pain while i work through understanding what needs to be done for upgrading im happing to take on the maintenance Dale Is there any option to prevent user from Login after email is updated requireAccountVerification true prevents login for the first time not every time email is updated
