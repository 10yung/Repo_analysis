The saas gem has now been deprecated and users have been advised to switch to the saasc gem Unfortunately the saas gem is a dependency to csscss Any plans to use the saasc gem for this Running the

propertiesMIXINATTRIBUTES COMMENT ATTRIBUTE BLANKATTRIBUTE SPACE at line char Expected but got v at line char Hi I encountered the problem that the CSS parser includes comments in selector names Example CSS css A comment before a selector h some redundant selectors here Lets assume h contains redundancy and ends up in the JSON structure This JSON structure now contains a selector in the list called A comment before a selectorh while the correct selector is just h The same problem occurs when having a charset declaration just before a selector Thanks in advance I was just cleaning up an extension that was initially developed two years ago It spawns a server reads the output from csscss and displays it on the website in a beautified format The server will reload when the watched files change to always have the latest results Feel free to add csscssbeauty to the list of community extensions zmoazeni icijavon carsonmcdonald prsimp laserlemon viveksachdeva resolve resolve This could use some code review First time with ruby thanks to icijavon Tried to match the style you had in the files Im easy about changes so feel free to kill this in Code Review and Ill fix it up I could use some help finding out how to identify selectors that are nestedex media to have a accurate report Is any variable set to identify what nested area a selector is in Test instructions gem install bundle pull branch Install dependencies bundle install Run tests bundle exec rake test to test your own css file run bundle exec csscss mycssfile zmoazeni Thanks for the great tool Is there anything that does this If not I would be interested contributing this Example css file pizza fontsize px color ff display none pizza overflow auto padding em If i run csscss on the above file i would like to get something like rule sets with same selector pizza at Lines Code Snippet divmain width divmain background white Expected output These two rules should be merged to one Actual output Nothing Hi Im not completely sure if this is a bug or if Im not doing something correct OS OSX Yosemite tried on OSX Mavericks Ruby Version ruby p CSSCSS Version Installation steps Install brew brew install gem gem install csscss testcss body backgroundcolor red body backgroundcolor red Command csscss v testcss Expected Some indication that body has a duplicate tag Actuall nothing Also When I try this command csscss It just hangs It also hangs when I pull down the file and run it directly on that file When I kill the file I get this call stack from LibraryRubyGems gemscsscss libcsscssredundancyanalyzerrb

questions Pretty slick tool and Im excited to get it working Thanks Hayden Ive been using csscss for a little bit while refactoring a lot of plain css and I noticed it wasnt easy to see if changes made were reducing the total amount of redundancy So I added a counter to the end of the output so that a dev can quickly see if what they changed actually made an impact Im using a lot of CSS shortcodes and it doesnt seem right that something like margin px and margin px would be seen as having duplicates for marginleft and marginright Thoughts
