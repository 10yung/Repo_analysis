Hello everyone So Id like to clone my existing Raspbian only one OS to another SD with Noobs Multiboot Card Raspbian Card I run NOOBS select which OSes Id like to install Installing LibreELEC and Raspbian And then I would run rpiclone to overwrite Raspbian from Card to Card While keeping the boot menu and LibreELEC intact Is it possible with the standard options Thanks Hi I tried to clone a Rasberry Pi GB disk to a GB The boot directly did not clone correctly After the cloning ls boot doesnt show all the files and shows files with odd characters on the clone drive The boot use size is M and the partition is the root size is GB and the partition size is GB So this sd card should clone into the smaller sd card Is there an issue with using rpiclone on a Raspberry Pi Thanks Robert Please help The copy does not end it hangs Before cloned with Stretch without problems rpiclone f p M sda Booted disk mmcblk GB Destination disk sda GB Part Size FS Label Part Size FS Label boot M fat root G

systems can take a long time Syncing mounted partitions Mounting devsda on mntclone rsync mntclone withrootexcludes I had to kill the processes I removed my original SD card inserted a new one flashed with Raspbian Lite and then rebuilt the system all good so far Its been running for a few months so thought it was time to clone it and wanted to use rpiclone to clone it back to the original card I removed I put the original in a USB card reader inserted it into the Pi and it mounted the EXT partition as and totally refused to unmount it was already occupied by the resident SD card I had TWO root partitions and nothing would resolve the issue until I rebooted and reformatted the original card using a Windows PC before reinserting into the Pi All went fine after that rpiclone did its thing and Ive got my cloned card Any ideas why the original got mounted and will it happen again if pop the clone back in for an incremental update hello thanks fo providing this tool but all the cmd line parameters are killing me which would be a cmd or a sh script for fullautomatic clone from Raspbian SD to a SD in card reader no matter how many partitions are on the source SD unknown no matter if the destination SD is somehow smaller than the source given its still big enough for storing all files eg GB to GB or GB to GB feat new optimized partition sizes no matter if the destination SD is somehow bigger than the source eg GB to GB feat new optimized partition sizes no matter if the target SD is fresh formatted or already prepartitioned perhaps giving a warning if not empty it must be foolprove to never falsely accidentally swap source actual boot SD and destination SD in USB card reader without any need to check anything before checks are expected to be handled automatically by the cmdscript is there a way to clone a source sd card via multiple usb micro usb card readers to multiple destinations at one time like sudo rpmclone f p m sda sde etc I updated cpiclone to days ago no problem today I followed your line instruction to update to RPI said no the directory isny empty Im experienced enough to simply remove the original directory and continue on with the install Others may not be I checked to see if an override option is possible on git clone arrarently not unless I just missed it In my case before doing the install I did cd rm r rpiclone that wiped the original I then proceeded as per your instructions On a Raspberry Pi git clone cd rpiclone sudo cp rpiclone rpiclonesetup usrlocalsbin Hello I have multiple Raspberries running in my network I want to make a clone on weekly basis of each of them to my NAS I mounted the NAS into my Raspberry mntbackup and now my question Can I use rpiclone to make a weekly backup into the mounted location mntbackupimageddmmyyyyimg Thanks a lot for your help Hi I just downloaded rpiclone and tried it It fails always with a rsync error like rsync write failed on

mntcloneboot unmounting mntclone I now know this is due to the increased boot partition size of Buster RPICLONE was happily creating clones with variable ROOT partition sizes but always leaving the source BOOT partition alone and a STRETCH BOOT partition is too small for BUSTER Finally twigged that the first clone must be made using GPARTED It would be SO much better if RPIclone had an option to force resizing inc changing th BOOT partition as I ended up guessing for BUSTER BOOT and by the look of it got it right at around MB with a gap after as I said all a bit guesswork
