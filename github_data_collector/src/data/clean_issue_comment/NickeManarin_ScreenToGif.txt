When I add a progress bar and save with the encoder it very often but not always causes severe artifacts when played it never seems to happen without a progress bar Recording But the encoder doesnt have the same issue Recording I like the smaller file size of but its really annoying having to always check for this issue Ive uploaded the project file here in case that helps you reproduce it Cross platformness is something that was asked number of times here Now Net Framework is dead and NET Core is where all the things will happen Migrating to it would be great for both maintainabilaty and futre prospects on cross platformness For example v added WPF for Windows only currently This will make it much easier to achieve LinuxMac port in the future maybe WPF will become xplatform itself or it can be switched to something else like Avalon or whatever There is also option to use wine with WPF on linux So switching to net core provides a lot of more options and it must be done sooner or later anyway To reproduce Record something Edit Delete All Next Save the frame somewhere Repeat the process and attempt to overwrite the previous file with the option to do so checked PS Thanks for the awesome app I love the crisp UI and all the editing options I get I currently make a bunch of GIFs for our documentation that visualizes workflows and often times I need to add a border say a phone tablet or monitor something like this I would essentially like to throw my animated screen capture right into the screen of the image so it looks something like this I currently have a clunky workaround where I take my capture overlay it into the image record the capture again with the new border It would be nice if I could add a custom image border to my screen capture in the the project editor through the Border tool under the image tab Is this something the is currently possible and Im not in the right menu Dont know how to create a Question here Is it possible to record only if Pixel changes on Screen Is it possible to launch a record directly from command line Something like screentogif boxcorners duration s savefiletestgif Thanks Not a major issue its just annoying that applying a caption moves the scroll bar back to the start because most often the next thing I want to do is add another caption starting on the next frame In ScreenToGif option extra the gifskidll should have been M in size but the file I downloaded is only k The path of gifskidll dont contain chinesen its in D gif Gifski encoding is failing when using and The error report is as follows Error Report Im In China I download gifski in optionextra through VPN maybe there will be errors in this way so I want to ask if there is any place where I can download gifskidll directly because ffmpegexe is directly downloaded and then manually associated in screentogif Finally Thanks for your great software I use the cv h nvenc pixelformat yuv p preset default to start the NCENC output video the output is successful but the speed increase is not obvious and the CPU usage is still very high My graphics card is P after turning on the NVENC encoder which only takes I am not familiar with the ffmpeg command Can anyone help me
