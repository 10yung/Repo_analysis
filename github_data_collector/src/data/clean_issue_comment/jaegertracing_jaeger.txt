 Requirement what kind of business use case are you trying to solve set of fields are not supplied on the query service search response Service jaeger query API apttraces Current response data total limit offset Response struct Response part Fields total limit and offset are not supplied on the response part I am ready yo submit a PR if someone guide me to get these fields Welcome to the Jaeger project Please search for existing issues to avoid creating duplicate bugsfeature requests Please be respectful and considerate of others when commenting on issues Please provide as much information as possible so we all understand the issue If you only have a question you may get a faster response by asking in our chat room or the forum but please dont double post Requirement what kind of business use case are you trying to solve Support different sampling rates for the same endpoints in different environments devstagingprod required section Problem what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement The sampling strategies config does not have a top level env construct Ideally we would like to do curl required section If possible describe the impact of the problem Proposal what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation Extend the config to include env construct and expose it as an API parameter Its ok if you dont have one Any open questions to address Questions that should be answered before proceeding with implementation cc joeelliott cyriltovena By default collection and query uses schema jaegerv test so schema creation job should also use this default value as schema and not jaegerv dc Here is the related discussion thread where this change was done in operator Welcome to the Jaeger project Please search for existing issues to

everyone Im a gopher from China When using jaeger I found that there is no go mod go mod can provide great help to developers in China required section Problem what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement required section If possible describe the impact of the problem Proposal what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation Its ok if you dont have one Any open questions to address Questions that should be answered before proceeding with implementation Requirement what kind of business use case are you trying to solve Wed like to allow dev teams to control sampling strategies This currently is quite involved since jaeger relies on a filesystemfile In kubernetes this typically means a configMap volume which requires us to restart all jaeger collector pods when the file is updated Quite cumbersome Id like Jaeger to support a samplingstrategiesurl option where the sampling strategies file was downloaded from a url The cache timeout could be a separate parameter or it could use the cache headers from the dowload to determine how often to retrieve updates Imho this would allow much easier changing of the sampling strategies as we would be able to build a supersimple rest api to provide the json payload Problem what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement strategiesjson is implemented as a filesystemfile only Proposal what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation See requirement secion Any open questions to address As alternative to channelbased queue in Welcome to the Jaeger project Please

every minutes is it a bug or just a normal case Problem what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement The spanstoreWriter interface does not propagate context Proposal what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation Add a new WriteSpanWithContextctx contextContext span modelSpan error to propagate context Alternatively we may update to WriteSpanctx contextContext modelSpan error Unfortunately both of these are breaking changes Alternatively we may create a WriterV interface and supply a converter from Writer to WriterV Such a converter would simply use ctxBackground for the context parameter Its ok if you dont have one Requirement what kind of business use case are you trying to solve We want to have accurate global measurements of the potential data loss in Jaeger clients Problem what in Jaeger blocks you from solving the requirement Although Jaeger clients internally support integrations with metrics backends not all users actually configure those and even if they do the metrics are often namespaced to the application eg by including a tag servicexyz or using a custom prefix which makes it more difficult to observe across the site Proposal what do you suggest to solve the problem or improve the existing situation Allow clients to report certain data loss metrics when submitting span batches to Jaeger backend The data elements should include batch sequence number to detect possible dropped packets especially with UDP transports count of spans dropped by the client due to internal queue overflow count of spans dropped by the client due to exceeding max packet size eg bytes cap for UDP transport The Jaeger clients some at least are already including a clientuuid string tag in the Process which will allow the agentcollector to monitor those reported stats and emit consistent metrics x Thrift IDL change x Go client prototype Agent prototype Other clients Context we should consider whether the bytes processed and number of spans should be reset when a resize is triggered Things to consider the effects of this as a metric increase increase reset increase desirableundesirable effects on quick bursts the way we have quick bursts wont cause unnecessary resizes which is a good thing if we are under heavy load less processing but if the burst is big enough it might cause the collector to use more memory than it has available
