In the readme it says that you could not get MacOS Sync to work Is that still the case Added Access options to the get parameters with a default option set As posted in This provides a way for the developer to specify the same accessibility level that they saved the keychain item as to query out the keychain item By default it is set to when unlocked but it can be default to be afterFirst unlock to be able to access in the background Also Added some basic tests to validate the passing of the access options for the get parameter This PR fixes some threading issues with the library mainly caused by the incorrect assumption that Swift variables are atomic With this fix the lock introduced by is no longer useful assuming that KeyChain is threadsafe as Apple docs say so Besides the ConcurrencyTests run fine without the lock with a fix in the tests themselves Please consider submitting the following information if relevant Library setup method CocoaPods Version of the library

keyWithPrefix key String String return keyPrefix key Here the stack trace and the console img width altSchermata alle src Im having this issue only in the vendored framework version of my library meaning a framework If I run the exactly same code in the not vendored version normal pod the code works fine I am currently trying to use the iOS Keychain feature for within an Unity App The ultimate goal is to store data between apps I have set up the communication and followed tutorials online about keychain Using this GitHub I wrote the following code let keychain KeychainSwift keychainaccessGroup MyTeamPrefixmyKeychainGroup MyTeamPrefix is the actual char string from Apple Developer if keychainsethello world forKey my key Keychain item is saved successfully else printkeychainlastResultCode Unfortunately it does not set a new Keychain Item but instead prints This is referring to the access group I set to the keychain object It says that I am not authorised to set new keychain items When I do it without setting the keychain it works fine What I did In my eyes I did everything right to the following tutorial I created a keychain group entitlements says AppIdentifierPrefixmyKeychainGroup I got the prefix for Apple Developer for this right bundle id same prefix as for my other apps anyways Then I wrote the code but it does not work I dont know what to do at this point I went through a lot of online post but no solution Every help is well appreciated Cheers PS The code runs on a real device Similar post that didnt help as far as I tested Somehow if I try to use the accessGroup feature I get an errSecMissingEntitlement error I dont have manual profiles but use Xcode Managed Profile for the Provisioning Profile Automatically manage signing I activated Keychain Sharing in Capabilities and added commynameappnamekeychainGroup which is how I initialise my KeychainSwift object let keychain KeychainSwift let k KeychainSwiftkeyPrefix unixb y kaccessGroup commynameappnamekeychainGroup return k FYI also in the entitlements file there is an entry with the correct name Library setup method CocoaPods Version of the library Xcode version OS
