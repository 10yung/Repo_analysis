We made some fixes to the issues that include Save time of day so it is not reset when game is opened again Add a compass Add text under image of current block to explain what the material is Material renaming Upper text box gets cut off should show full text by continuing line of text below Having the text scrollloop sideways Thank you for your consideration Craftmasterzip Im reading through this project to help with my own OpenGL project and I noticed line of matrixc ymax znear tanffov PI Is fov in degrees If so the correct way to convert it to radians would be ymax znear tanffov PI Appreciate the work Are there any Linux binaries Perhaps it would be interesting to be able for the server to handle the way blocks lookact so you wouldnt need clientside mods outside of UI tweaks Currently the authdb and craftdb is stored directly under users home directory In GNULinux the standard application data directory is localshareCraft So the users home directory will not be polluted by all kinds of app data I find many places in the code w is regarded as a signed char Such as lightfill mapset and etc MapEntryw is char typedef union unsigned int value struct unsigned char x unsigned char y unsigned char z char w e MapEntry It seems a lot of code and algorithms need to be modified to increase block ID range from bit to bit If I modify MapEntryew be short mainclightfill will be leaded to dead iterator I just simply add a violent cast in lightfill it seems works But I know little about the algorithm of lightfill I worry it will work wrong in some cases void lightfill char opaque char light int x int y int z int w int force w charw add a violent cast simply if x w XZLO z w XZLO return Related satoshinmNetCraft When holding down a key the keyboard buffer fills causing the associated behavior to continue afterward for some time For example if I hold down the W key for a few seconds the character continues to move forward for some time after releasing the key This makes the game very difficult to play Using keyboard events key downkey up instead of buffered keyboard input would eliminate this issue
