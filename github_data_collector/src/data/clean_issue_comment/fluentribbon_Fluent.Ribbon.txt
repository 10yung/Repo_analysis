Ive been trying to left align GalleryItems in InRibbonGallery to the left without much success Things Ive tried Setting HorizontalContentAlignment on InRibbonGallery Setting the alignment on GalleryPanel under the hood So far my workaround is padding the row with placeholder GalleryItems and set their visibility to hidden but its kind of ugly Environment FluentRibbon v Windows NET Framework Im currently working on a project that uses the InRibbonGallery control The control has a number of items it hosts each item has a string property called Folder and the entire collection is grouped by Folder in the dropdown What I would like to achieve is the following Filter InRibbonGallery down to items in the same Folder as the currently selected item The filter needs to be disabled when dropdown appears allowing the user to see all the groupsFolders A filter is reapplied upon user selecting an item in the dropdown So far everything works fine except the scroll down button would not disable when filtering down to a Folder with an item count less than or equal to MaxItemsInRow The enabledisable logic for the scroll buttons are based on ScrollableHeight property in the ScrollViewer which doesnt change at all and it looks like its due to GalleryPanel height not adjusting to the new filtered down collection I hope Ive described my issue clear enough as Im unable to provide zipped code Environment FluentRibbon v Windows NET Framework Im currently try to make our application as accessable as possible and stumbled upon this tool The tool reports on every ribbon button the following issue It appears that the root cause is the implementation of the TwoLineLabelcs If the button text has enough space to be on one line the tool will report an error If there are two lines everything is fine I tried the following in the TwoLineLabelcs but this didnt solve all issues because there are some other code paths and it worked private void UpdateTextRun if stringIsNullOrWhiteSpacethistextRun Text thistextRun Visibility VisibilityHidden this didnt did the trick thistextRun SetValueAutomationPropertiesIsOffscreenBehaviorProperty IsOffscreenBehaviorOffscreen When I set the textRun to hidden it seems to be better Be aware Im not an expert in this area The accessibility tool gives some good hints but Im not sure how important those things are If you are interested and need help I could try to make a PR Maybe you could give me a hint if this code behind stuff is OK for you or if I should try to put this in the style or somewhere else Environment FluentRibbon v Windows v NET Framework NET Core Im trying to understand an issue that we finally solved with a call to InvalidateMeasure It feels like a bug in Fluent Ribbon but Im not sure We add QuickAccessItems from code after the ribbon has been initializedloaded c ribbonQuickAccessItemsAddquickAccessMenuItem We have enabled automatic state management xml fluentRibbon AutomaticStateManagementTrue And the result is that our quick access menu items are never added to the visually tree On some machines it seems Seems like a race condition of some kind The workaround Anyway if we add the following before adding our QuickAccessItems the items are indeed present in the visual tree c ribbonTitleBarInvalidateMeasure ribbonQuickAccessItemsAddquickAccessMenuItem Is this expected Is there a good explanation for this Auto opening the submenu is not working for MenuItems with ItemsSource bindings Having a DropDownButton with ItemsSource binding that binds to a collection of objects that themselves contain collections of objects like Dropdown auto close on click g button but with ItemsSource binding not manually adding MenuItem elements in XAML Adapting the style with FluentDropDownButtonItemContainerStyle Style TargetTypeFluentMenuItem BasedOnStaticResource FluentRibbonStylesMenuItem Setter ValueBinding Name PropertyHeader Setter ValueBinding MoreStuff PropertyItemsSource Style FluentDropDownButtonItemContainerStyle Problem is pinpointed to File FluentRibbon Controls MenuItemcs line and line thisParent is null Environment FluentRibbon v Windows NET Framework Why is the ComboBox Template ComboBoxxaml GridHeight set to Sure i can override it with a custom template but why not set it auto or bind it to the ComboBoxHeight Environment FluentRibbon v Windows NET Framework Is it possible to align the RibbonGroupBox inside RibbonTabItem to the right if yes then how Thanks in advance Environment FluentRibbon v Windows NET Framework I have been trying to figure out how to set the border color of the tab item itself when it is highlighted due to a mouseover Currently what I have working is the following No mouseover Mouseover of Tab As you can see in the mouseover case there is no border at all or a white border perhaps Which SolidColorBrush xKey is used to control that border color I looked through all the Border entries in but none seem to affect it Unless I missed it somehow Thank you Environment FluentRibbon v Windows NET Framework We have backstage views that need to receive the loaded unloaded events so we can dispose some classes There are a few things that we found and hope can be verified by others The backstage controls are eagerly loaded so when the shell is loaded all the backstage components are already being loaded The first time the backstage closes the unloaded event is not fired I will try to create a small repro If this is desired behavior we will implement workarounds in our apps Environment FluentRibbon Windows NET Framework If the RibbonGroupBox RGB header text is longer than the content buttons in the RGB the headers text will get trimmed Is there a reason this trimming is active Can you disabled it Left Header text is trimmed Right As I would expect the content If you decide to fix this In RibbonGroupBoxStyle set HorizontalContentAlignment to Center In FluentRibbonTemplatesRibbonGroupBoxOneLineHeaderTemplate set TextTrimming to None Check if FluentRibbonTemplatesRibbonGroupBoxTwoLineHeaderTemplate needs similar fix
