Changes for the Twitter API is disabled by Twitter remove some XML references does not support XML anymore update twitter domain to removed LibXML files moderate documentation updates fix compiler warning in MGTwitterXMLParserh Note not all REST commands have been tested for compliance I get an error about Twitter Rest API Request failed for connectionIdentifier B EE A AEEA B AACC FD A error The operation couldn t be completed HTTP error body xml version encoding UTF errors error code The Twitter REST API v is no longer active Please migrate to API v How can I resolve this problem Has anyone notice any change on the last hours Maybe an API update of twitter Im receiving ALWAYS on any status update on voidrequestFailedNSString connectionIdentifier withErrorNSError error Dear Concerned It is working fine on all the devices except the iPhone GS devices iPhone GS iOS version It always shows The request token for this page is invalid While on other devices iPhone or above and iPad or above it is working fine Please guide me with possible solution Thanks Regards Zahur File NSDataBase m in Method initWithBase EncodedString I believe you have to change the unsigned char inbuf to unsigned char inbuf Made MGTwitterEngine ARC compatible Updated XAuth authentication code to reflect the OAuthConsumer side API changes Im not sure if you are ok with me using this code I noticed that it has copyright text at the top and didnt want to use it if Im not allowed to Thanks Why using a c json parser like yajl Something smart could be better like the good JSONKit Possible to port to this the underlining parser The code takes in a long value but formats it as u This will truncate it to an integer and obviously fail the delete operation The formatting should use lu if at all we need to use a long value In Reality the direct message ids are not even long but are long long values So the format should actually use llu instead of lu OR for simplicity why not make it a NSString and save the pain of conversions Theres a bug in the size of buffers in the base files This commit fixes it and allows the NSDataBase files to be used independently of MGTwitterEngine
