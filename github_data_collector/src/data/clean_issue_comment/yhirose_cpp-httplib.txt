Hello It seems that latest update broke support due to Response default Responseconst Response default Response operatorconst Response default ResponseResponse default Response operatorResponse default Hello yhirose First of all thanks for the library Is pretty complete and easy to use Theres a small problem when trying to receive multipartformdata using a SSLServer I tried to upload an image file of size KB and a textplain data together in one request but the server only seems to recognize the first item while ignoring the last one Thanks Kevin Deprecate versions prior to I have just added instructions to use Conan to manage httplib as a dependency Version will be supported until Version will be supported until LTS Version is no longer supported Version is no longer supported Version is no longer supported Would it be possible for you to release a initial version even if it is Using tags and the github release system I would like to create a conan package that points to your repo for easy compilation using CMake I have made a pull request to add CMake support Once you are satisfied with it it would be nice if you made a release so I can properly add Conan support for master and the first version number Im new to native socket now I try to use the http client to recv from a lowbandwidthserver Sometimes the recv blocks forever never returns at that moment I attach debugger and see its blocking at line inline int SocketStreamreadchar ptr sizet size return recvsock ptr staticcastintsize blocking here I see there is timeout implemented for connect but not for recv I tried to set the timeout with int millisec second setsockoptsock SOLSOCKET SORCVTIMEO char millisec sizeofint But it doesnt take effect I set second but it still can blocking for seconds sometimes forever I asked this question on stackoverflow seems its about WSAFLAGOVERLAPPED I see the SOOPENTYPE is set ifdef WIN define SOSYNCHRONOUSNONALERT x define SOOPENTYPE x int opt SOSYNCHRONOUSNONALERT setsockoptINVALIDSOCKET SOLSOCKET SOOPENTYPE char opt sizeofopt endif From msdn SOOPENTYPE Once set affects whether subsequent sockets that are created will be nonoverlapped The possible values for this option are SOSYNCHRONOUSALERT and SOSYNCHRONOUSNONALERT This option should not be used Instead use the WSASocket function and leave the WSAFLAGOVERLAPPED bit in the dwFlagsparameter turned off So once the SOOPENTYPE is set the WSAFLAGOVERLAPPED doesnt work then the SORCVTIMEO doesnt work is this correct I tried to delete the lines about SOOPENTYPE but all http requests fail Any way to make the timeout work for recv Thanks
