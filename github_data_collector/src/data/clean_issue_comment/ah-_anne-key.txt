Also express the messageACK relationship better todo propagate further up the stack with better error handling implement and may help with Looking at code I found that you are performing UB conversion from primitive to enum rust repru nonexhaustive deriveDebug Copy Clone pub enum MsgType Reserved Error System Ack Reboot Macro Ble Keyboard Keyup Led FwInfo FwUp CustomLed CustomKey impl Fromu for MsgType inline fn fromb u Self unsafe transmuteb You may argue Hey but there is an attribute but in fact it doesnt work the way you expect and may produce panics in safe Rust Id better to be replaced with numderive rust repru deriveDebug Copy Clone FromPrimitive pub enum MsgType Motospeed ck missing tilde and grave Can I use annekey to fix my problem I know it was just announced but wondering if we could have a tracking issue for what chipset it is etc I would like this a lot but I dont know if this is technically possible with this piece of hardware Controlling individual leds would make a fun programmable toy or it could bring a whole new set of offscreen indicators Want this so bad that Im willing to get into Rust and driver development for that to happen Would be pretty cool to be able to use the kb completely wired without having to switch to Bluetooth to change layout or lighting As a PoC it only parses one byte Next up would be bufferpreadMessage but I havent cooked up a multiplexing tryfromctx for the different MsgType XOp yet Further we could have bufferpwriteLedTheme for sending the xca setLED messages too cc It would be nice to have some of the Tap Dance functionality When i used it first formerly known as eg double tap action i felt in love with this feature it basically allows you to give a key more than one action like When you press and release A just type an a but when you press and hold A youll get Shift this is called ACTIONTAPDANCEDOUBLE in Tap Dance You can find more details in the docs I would like to request that the ability to use the keyboard in a Grub menuBIOS is added for example being able to use the F Via FN to access the BIOS on boot up initially as a feature operated via USB cable connection and then also via Bluetooth Connection at a future point in time If Bluetooth functionality of this type is possible with this keyboard currently I cannot use my Anne Pro as my main keyboard because I need to have use of the F F And other keys at boot up thanks for the work that you are doing to expand the Anne Pros features making it more stable Support for cursor control Would be good to have cursor control as one of the available options in function layers This would be great when using the keyboard without a dedicated mouse
