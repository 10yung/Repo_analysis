This patch allows for longer names Tested with longest name telegram supports chars This resolves an issue where users with greater than or less than signs in their name appear to be html encoded Before patch img width altscreen shot at pm src After patch img width altscreen shot at pm src Using reply feature on the notification was deminiaturizing the main window even if the user was on other application or even in full screen view Things get especially weird when in full screen mode The window deminiaturizes and covers the screen and then goes into the background telegram This is my real bad implementation of the issue It adds an option in the general settings view and its value is a bitwise operation of the next after HandleMediaKeysSettings I wasnt sure why you started shifting from to so I kept it It also obviously isnt the best way to implement that option with the maximum sticker size hardcoded in every blockSize assignment but I suck at ObjectiveC and am not sure Id do it better without having a lot of time to spend The downside is you cant zoom it I guess the more userfriendly thing would be to make it zoom like an image perhaps with a fullscreen dimmed overlay on mouse click the user would still have an option to view all stickers in the stickerset by calling the context menu It looks like that stickers Feel free to ditch it just wanted to share with whomever is interested Thanks for the awesome project Ive been using it for years PS I also managed to keep stickers from being shown completely and displaying emoji characters instead like in the conversations list but I guess its not worth a separate pull request See Certain substitutions of emoji for ascii faces were inconsistent some had a hypen nose some didnt I added a version without a hyphen nose for all substitutions that only had the hypen nosed version Very simple one PLEASE can this be merged so that we can start a bit more community effort on this project Thanks Create localization file for the Norwegian language MtProtoKit at a affee doesnt exist
