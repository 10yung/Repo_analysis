Hi This is a really fantastic effort Thanks for maintaining it I noticed the RiffStation website in the Why MIR section seems to no longer be active thought Id drop an issue to notify Location I was following the tutorials step by step doing nothing but copypasting then I encountered a weird situation When I was on basic feature extraction my visual outputs of zero crossing rate and spectral centroid were different than its supposed to be in tutorial You can see the differances below my output tutorial output in order Im sure I did nothing different and restarted did it all again three times just in case the result didnt change Also my input hasnt been touched and I can confirm that they match in the first visuals pltfigure part what may be causing this differance thanks in advance Hello Your codes are actually written in python But in the readme you told user to download anaconda python x This causes SyntaxError in every print statement and its really annoying importgithubnotebooktocolab It would be much more accessible The new website looks great Please note that the NMF Audio Mosaicing link is broken on the front page
