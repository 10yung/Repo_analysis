 Please fill out this form Expected behavior The emulator would connect to host device if host Port Forwarded Actual behavior The emulator DOES NOT connect to host Steps to reproduce the behavior Simply try to play LAN Crash bugs If this is a crash bug and you have the time and inclination please provide a symblic backtrace Instructions for doing so are here ROM details Which games are affected by the issue please state if GBA or GB game Every game Which games if any are NOT affected by the issue please state if GBA or GB game Include screenshots of ROM Information File ROM Information If you are using a BIOS file please say which one Option details Video driver simple opengl Direct D Sound driver directsound xaudio openal SDL DirectSound Build details Operating System Windows Mac Linux state distribution etc Windows If using Linux specify if using xorg or Wayland Version of code prebuilt binary version or commit ref or just master Hardware details If your joystick or gamepad isnt working in Linux please try to troubleshoot using the information on this page BEFORE filing an issue We use SDL for joystick support any problems will generally be an issue with SDL and NOT the emulator If relevant the joystick you are using and the drivers you are using for it Im trying to open the project for almost one week but Im having very troubles with it Can you please generate a Visual Studio solution and send me Please fill out this form Expected behavior there should at least be defaults inputs provided by keyboard on gamepad Actual behavior no input Steps to reproduce the behavior compile with sdl only run a game Crash bugs If this is a crash bug and you have the time and inclination please provide a symblic backtrace Instructions for doing so are here

I recorded EXE Title music on VBAM and mGBA It could adjust speed to and cut blank nd loop off Lets see the result VBAM mGBA Then calculate So can you adjust speed to make more accurate to an actual GBA Heres music sample One more request Could you add record WAV feature Channel Noises volume is too low Expected behavior Being able to save while still doing things like running or jumping Actual behavior When holding a button for a continuous action like running pressing the save state hotkeys causes game to stop receiving the input until you stop holding the button and press it again I can confirm this is not a problem with my keyboard and that it didnt happen on previous versions of vba Steps to reproduce the behavior Boot up a game and try to run or any other action that requires continuous holding of a button then try to save state ROM Details Bug has been tested on both Dragon Ball Z Buus Fury and Castlevania Aria of Sorrow though it presumably affects other games as well Build details Using VBA for windows I changed the value to in FlashSize from vbamini But when I opened VisualBoyAdvanceM the message stated that the value is invalid New Bitmap Image MWV A few errors and QoL qualms with the Memory Viewer Windows x VisualBoyAdvanceM Cannot type in in the memory viewer due to window scaling sharing the same hotkey Changing the hotkey both removing the hotkey and replacing the hotkey do nothing to return usability Using a keyless and using the memory editor is a pain as an external numpad or a numpad emu is necessary Unable to scroll with the scroll wheel in the memory viewer Typing in values into address space is buggy Entering one value in one location can cause one value in another to change as well By just entering s By entering As A AA AAA AA A AA A A A A Overwriting a value Any value that isnt the existing value F Using DCDC D DC DCD DC C DC D Using BADE B BA BAD BA E BA E B A B B A BADE Littleendian isnt an error per se but is odd and may be unfamiliar to some users t tt t tt ttt tttt The rightside editor is otherwise unaffected Id love to use VBAM but my main motivation for using this emulator is in its memory editor and all of the capabilities it has using it in glitch hunting and everything that comes with it which you probably couldve guessed by how much I tinkered with this In this state its pretty unusable Hopefully this can be fixed in the future Im not sure if anyone still uses the memory viewer but Im throwing my hat in the ring just in case Please fill out this form Expected behavior At memory address x C the correct date and time should be showing in this format Year Bytes Month Byte Day Byte DayOftheWeek Byte Hour Byte Minute Byte Seconds Byte once the rom is loaded is Decembers number in this implementation This should be detected by default if RTC has been enabled via Options Game Boy Advance Realtime Clock as is done in SVN which is WxWidgets available here It is also important to note that the MFC version Beta available here also has the correct behaviour Actual behavior Only D displays in this implementation when RTC is not detected properly This behaviour is present starting with the WxWidgets Beta available here Steps to reproduce the behavior Patch Pokemon FireRed US v with this to add RTC capability rtczip Load the patched rom and observe x C in the Memory Viewer and see D in bit view To fix to enable RTC detection correctly instructions adapted from here After loading rom go to Options Game Boy Advance Configure Game Overrides tab Set Save Type to Flash and click OK File Close Reload rom and check x C in the Memory Viewer it should be detected properly now This leads me to conclude that the detection for FireRed custom RTC implementations is only properly working when Save Type is set to Flash There is another implementation that behaves exactly like this but the default bytes when not properly detected are different from the ones in step Crash bugs If this is
