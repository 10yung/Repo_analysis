serving pods It will crash for some reason i tried to look at the memory usage but dont see that tfserving runs out of memory any idea about the error I have a model with a single dimension input that is serialized tfexample TF serving does not seem to perform batching with this model and the input I have the following batching config maxbatchsize value numbatchthreads value batchtimeoutmicros value padvariablelengthinputs true allowedbatchsizes allowedbatchsizes allowedbatchsizes allowedbatchsizes I have tried it with and without padvariablelengthinputs true I have tried batchtimeoutmicros at various values eg batchtimeoutmicros value The value above is set to very high value to see if that would make the server to batch the incoming requests On the TF serving server side I run tensorflowmodelserver port modelnamemymodel modelbasepathserving enablebatchingtrue batchingparametersfileservingbatchingparameterstxt inside docker run it p p tensorflowservinglatestdevel The inference is running on CPU on a machine with CPU cores I run up to clients on different machine issuing requests via gPRC against this server The inference succeeds I get correct inference results in all clients However the resulting inference time is the same as without batching enabled which seems to indicate that TF Serving is not doing batching just queuing the requests and running inference with one request in a batch TF Serving also does not provide functionality to log or inspect whether it is doing batching or not and what the individual batch sizes are I have tried to enable multiple logging levels via TFCPPMINVLOGLEVEL and there are no tensorflowserving log lines that correspond to inference requests or batching This is very disappointing I have the same model with the same inputs running on the same machine using Nvidia TRT IS server with batching timeout set to ms and there batching produces significant speedup Plus TRT IS provides info about the batching that is easy to access to confirm that batching is occurring and that inference is done with batches that have more than one element So the issue is not the model being unbatchable The issue is not that batching wont help performance The issue seems to be in how TF Serving handles the batching in this case So questions and requests Is batching supposed to work with models that have single dimension tfexample serialized input Can TF Serving provide a way to access batching functionality logs or at least information of how many requests got batched into a batch Thank you some tensorflow model is trained using tfplaceholder and some by tfesitimator API there are some difference between this two method when creating warmup data for tfserving model if model is trained using tfplaceholder we can know all input tensor name and shape from savedModel by executing the command savedmodelcli show so we can make up data according to input tensor name and shape to generate tfservingwarmuprequests if model is trained using tfestimator we cant obtain any information about input tensor in detail the models input is format of Example or SequenceExample so how can we create tfservingwarmuprequests file just using model without any other input Thank you when i inference the model with tensorflow servingi found a questioni defined the dim of inputsexample input is shape or None inputs i test it in my modelpb that is truebut i enter more dim that is also ok ep i dont understant why curl d signaturenamevoiceclassification inputs input input input X POST my input dim is like but i enter also is ok QA System information OS Platform and Distribution eg Linux Ubuntu Ubuntu RHEL TensorFlow Serving installed from source or binary Both TensorFlow Serving version Describe the problem Currently when the configured model list is updated via a call to handleReloadConfigRequest the request thread blocks until any newly added models become available Their availability however depends on the filesystem polling thread rescanning the filesystem at some periodic interval meaning that theres an arbitrary delay before the requested changes actually take effect and the RPC returns This problem may not be very noticeable with the default polling interval of second but seems undesirable for longer intervals and in particular makes APIbased dynamic reconfiguration incompatible with the filesystempollwaitseconds setting in this case all handleReloadConfigRequest calls timeout and do not take effect Exact Steps to Reproduce Start tensorflowmodelserver with the filesystempollwaitseconds option and empty initial config no models Call handleReloadConfigRequest API with a ModelListConfig containing a valid new model It will hang indefinitely or until the grpc deadline I have opened PR with proposed fix
