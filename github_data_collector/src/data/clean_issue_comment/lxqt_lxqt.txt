Battery info applet shows invalid information Expected Behavior I would expect that Energy Full is less than Energy Full Design And that Energy Now is less than Energy Full and Energy Now Energy Full charged Current Behavior The battery info applet one of two sets of information State Charging Energy Full Design Wh Energy Full Wh Energy Now Wh Energy rate W State Fully Charged Energy Full Design Wh Energy Full Wh Energy Now Wh Energy rate W Steps to Reproduce for bugs I leave the laptop charging almost all of the time and often leave it in sleep mode instead of off The battery info applet one of two sets of information that Ive noticed I havent investigated what happens when I let the battery discharge Context It is hard to have confidence in the numbers reported since the Energy Full value is about times larger than the Energy Full Design value While it is possible that the battery is charged to times the amount of energy it was designed for is that really the case Also it isnt clear what is of or of for that matter Also why is Wh fully charged is that considered of Wh System Information Distribution Version Debian GNULinux Kernel amd SMP Debian deb u x GNULinux Qt Version

bugs against old dead versions but use your distribution bugtracker instead This is esp true for Ubuntu LTS Expected Behavior If youre describing a bug tell us what should happen If youre suggesting a changeimprovement tell us how it should work I have a Lenovo laptop thats usually plugged into a docking station with external monitors total including laptop screen The laptop is almost never unplugged from the dock but one of the monitors is often switched to my other machine via KVM The expected behavior is for the laptop to either switch to monitors when rd monitor is showing input form another PC or to remember it which is usually does but not always Current Behavior If describing a bug tell us what happens instead of the expected behaviour If suggesting a changeimprovement explain the difference from current behavior a screenshot might help Occasionally LXQT forgets about the rd monitor and disables it requiring me to manually reenable it in lxqtconfigmonitor When this occurs it also seems to forget the monitor position requiring me to manually dragalign it in the Monitor Settings UI This UI is also wonky and not userfriendly often requiring several attempts to get it pixelperfect otherwise I got partial monitor overlap or pixel misalignment between monitors Moreover some settings have no effect at all even though they should until the alignment is changed One example of such setting is which monitor is selected as primary Changing primary monitor has no effect until I also drag the displays around in the UI so the system realizes that something has changed Often when system accidentally resets the primary monitor because of the KVM this means that I have to dragapply the changes twice once to move them out of alignment so that the system realizes that something has changed and nd time back to where they were to fix the misalignment I caused for the sole purpose of making primary display change take effect Ive also noticed that despite saving the settings for alignment as the GUI allows applying saved settings afterwards doesnt always seem to have an effect requiring the awkward draganddrop via clumsy UI again Possible Solution Not obligatory but suggest a fixreason for the bug or ideas how to implement the addition or change There are several issues at play here changing either one would be a huge quality of life improvement but Id prefer a change to all Accept a textbased config file I can reuse instead of trying to draganddrop the alignment via UI hopefully something I can trigger via terminalcommand Fix the issue with primary display change getting ignored until screen alignment also changes this may be an xrandr bug since Ive seen similar behavior when working directly with xrandr Make the system more resilient to extended monitor disconnectionconnection so it doesnt randomly forget a monitor Or like Mac remember several previous configs and automatically pick the most sane one based on connected monitors Fix whatever issue seems to make saved config not get applied Steps to Reproduce for bugs Provide a link to a live example or an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce this bug Include code to reproduce if relevant Configure several monitors in my example in following horizontal configuration laptop extended desktop primary desktop extendedkvm Switch rightmost monitor to different machine Wait until LXQT goes into sleepstandby Reactivate LXQT the appearancedisappearance of rightmost extended monitor may cause it to forget about it may also cause it to forget which monitor is primary and switch the leftmost laptop screen back to primary this can also sometimes occur during reboot despite saving the config Applying older config from lxqtconfigmonitor may have no effect requiring manual reconfiguration which will forget the position of the extended monitor and require pixelperfect draganddropping via the awkward UI Context How has this issue affected you What are you trying to accomplish Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world This issue affects me because I have to realign my monitors at least once a day and its timeconsumingfrustrating especially with the poor UI Accepting a textbased config file would improve the issue for me even if the bugs were unsolved since I could map it to a bash command System

Please do NOT file bugs against old dead versions but use your distribution bugtracker instead This is esp true for Ubuntu LTS Expected Behavior If youre describing a bug tell us what should happen If youre suggesting a changeimprovement tell us how it should work It would be nice if the panel remained at the bottom of the virtual display When at first instigated the panel looks great but as you use the mouse to pan a larger virtual screen the panel is unstuck from the bottom and gets in the way Current Behavior If describing a bug tell us what happens instead of the expected behaviour If suggesting a changeimprovement explain the difference from current behavior a screenshot might help This was tried first on Lubuntu as request related to Lubuntu then on opensuse tumbleweed On Lubuntu updated I use xrandr to view my displays x landscape and x portrait resolutions and names then used the command xrandr output HDMI panning x to make my display pan using the mouse On execution there is no change but now the mouse causes the virtual display to pan across the display but the lxqtpanel is now unstuck and moves with the background windows It still operates perfectly but its no longer on the edge of the display It also hides any windows positioned to cross or be underneath it On opensuse tumbleweed snapshot Jul with two x displays I again used xrandr to check resolutions and view names then using the command xrandr output DVII panning x I got the same result same experience in tumbleweed as Lubuntu What I wanted but any windows underneath the panel was hidden and panel wasnt as nice to use Possible Solution Not obligatory but suggest a fixreason for the bug or ideas how to implement the addition or change Whilst Id expect this issue cannot be resolved in lxqtpanel for the reason mentioned by Tsujan in forgive me if Im wrong X dependency possibly this could be a featurerequest for MonitorSetting Display Settings that it handles a larger display what Ive described as
