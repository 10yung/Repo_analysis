lukemelas i am trying to replace Resnet FPN with Resent BiFPN and i am getting this error RuntimeError the size of tensor a must match the size of tensor b at nonsingleton dimension any idea to resolve this cannot we integrate BiFPN with any other architectures pytorch a f e onnx onnx trt tensorrt Any suggestions on this issue Thanks in the efficientnetpytorchmodelpy it has two function frompretrained what is the different def frompretrainedcls modelname numclasses inchannels def frompretrainedcls modelname numclasses Hi I want to test how to export ONNX model and I use your colab jupyter notebook demo Successfully installed efficientnetpytorch Successfully installed onnx and It stop in return I can not see any error information So Can you check this colab notebook btw I tried using modelsetswishmemoryefficientFalse like this Screenshot from Even it sucessful export onnx model But when I run Test Export that next Cell The system crashed Hope you can check it thank you very much I wonder why there is skip connection only when the stride equals to one Is it the origin realization of Efficient would you please explain it That would be so much appreciated lukemelas code in MBConvBlock Skip connection and drop connect inputfilters outputfilters selfblockargsinputfilters selfblockargsoutputfilters if selfidskip and selfblockargsstride and inputfilters outputfilters if dropconnectrate x dropconnectx pdropconnectrate trainingselftraining x x inputs skip connection What Im saying is why not add residual connection to every block we have Thanks for providing this repository How should i do if i want to use the efficientnet as the backbone of the RefineDet caffe vesion If I do not need to transform the tensorflow pretrained weight into this model instead I train it from scratch Can I just delete the Conv dStaticSamePadding Im training a efficientnetb on CIFAR I resize the picture to x using ImageBICUBIC And I set the initial lr to and multiply it by every epoches But I only get acc But the result on the paper is How can I get the similar result Hi I am trying to load a model I just trained to continue training from the last step however I get the following error AttributeError IncompatibleKeys object has no attribute loadstatedict This is the command I am using model modelloadstatedicttorchloadfefficientnetb modelloss pt Could you please help in this regard
