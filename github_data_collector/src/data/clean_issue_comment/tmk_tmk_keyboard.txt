 terminal usb converter does not work in windows Add support for DEC LK LK keyboards to PS to USB converter See LK md converterps usbLK md for details Also add compact keyboard debugging converterps usbREADMEmddebuggingkeyboard similar to but clearer I hope Soarer Converters diagnostic output define DEBUGKEYBOARDVERBOSE to restore the old debugging define PJRCBOOTLOADERJUMP uses PJRCs code for jumping to the Teensy bootloader HalfKay Ive been doing a lot of testing between Soarers Converter TMK and QMK to find what is best for my IBM This issue is a way of stopping people wasting their time By far the most reliable for daily use is Soarers converter It seems to have no issues with any of the three keyboards I tested with TMK QMK seem to have persistent issue interpreting the protocol correctly This eventually results in either phantom key presses or stuck keys I tried a number of different power supplies to ensure this wasnt a result of undervoltage The issues persisted My recommendation is not to use the XT converter for these keyboards When I enter avrdude patmega u cavr b Uflashwusbusbhex PCOM it shows avrdude seropen cant open device COM No such file or directory In fact I used the u u PCB file you designedAnd the Atmega u chip on this u u comes from an Arduino Pro microThe strange thing is that you can upload files on the Arduino IDE with this u uCan you help me analyze the reasons for this It seems to need to set bootkey before jumpwdt reset to the bootloader Also refer to Arduino Leonardo Sparkfun Pro Micro It needs code to initialize registers for ATMega u Im trying to convert a NMB HiTek RT to USB It has a switch that can toggle between ATXT I have it set to AT mode and Im trying to use the TMK ps usb converter to convert it to USB Note that the keyboard works flawlessly with a blue cube ps usb converter Im trying to use a pro micro which is possibly causing problems I dont have a teensy on hand to test but Id prefer to get this working with a pro micro anyway as I have some other ATps keyboards to convert and if I can use a pro micro its a lot cheaper Ive wired things to this Ive Tried all three ps usb variants default make make rev and make rev and none work I also tried jumping J for V operation to no effect Behavior is as follows For default make just running make in the ps usb directory I get nothing at all When I plug it into my windows computer I dont even get the Device connected sound Though the scroll lock num lock and caps lock LEDs flash on for a moment right when its plugged in For make rev make f Makefilerev at least windows recognizes that something was plugged in Device connected sound plays and HID listen sees something plugged in but I cant get any output from pressing keys Behavior for make rev make f Makefilerev is identical to default make ie windows doesnt even think anything got plugged in Let me know if I need to clarify anything Im at a loss here and definitely would appreciate help Thanks Problem Pressing Caps lock and a key quickly and repeatedly makes the converter unresponsive It seems this part which handles LED control report from host causes the problem That code is executed from ISR and may take long Build option INTERRUPTCONTROLENDPOINT controls how the code is excuted Without the build option it is called out of ISR context Workaround Build without INTERRUPTCONTROLENDPOINT option The converter can still misses key immediately after Caps lock but doesnt completely freeze fix link to tmkcore in readme
