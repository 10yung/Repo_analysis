hhariri This was such a nice work I dont enjoy the style of Ktor but thats the way it is I guess Refactor from boolean to calling next on interceptors or throw exception to clean up the implementation Add the ability to order interceptors in the wasabi pipeline PrePost execution interceptors have already been stripped out the pre and post interceptors are now only fired at the startend of the pipeline and per handler the current implementation needs to be reviewed to make sure we are only firing once per route and once at start end of wasabi logic As the name suggests Needs to be reworked properly currently spagettid through the http handler Implement GSON JSON deserialiser serialiser support within wasabi The current Json deserialiserserialiser has been renamed to reflect the Jackson parser under the hood Currently wasabi provides no mechanism for developers to be notified when a websocket client disconnects this needs to be resolved so they can release contexts this is also an issue internally as wasabi doesnt clear out clients associated with handlers Currently requestbodyParams returns an empty map on DELETE requests This is because DELETE request deserializers are ignored here is this intentional Currently in wasabi there is no access to the raw http body within an interceptor or handler This needs to be addressed
