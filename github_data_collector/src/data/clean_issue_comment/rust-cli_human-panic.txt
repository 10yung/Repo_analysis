It would be great if we could have a new release for the changes made in cc johnchildren While on desktop applications it makes sense to store the crash report in a file on mobile devices it can be challenging to actually find the report file especially for end users So for these cases I would like to print the whole report after message such that it is easier to report Is this sth you would consider Alternatively having a hook to customize the file writing would likely solve this issue as well Thank you The code attempts to downcast to str but this will return None if the PanicInfopayload is a String For example consider the following panic panicthis is a test The Cause will not be displayed in the explanation portion of the dump file as this panic has a payload of type String which is not str How do I get the Cause to show when I use a panic such as this Or does this require a code change to support downcasting to other types such as String question Provide a general summary of the issue in the title above Expected Behavior If youre describing a bug tell us what should happen If youre suggesting a changeimprovement tell us how it should work When using panic the log message is displayed prior to the stack trace As an example this statement panicfeed item cant be parsed as it doesnt have pubdate self will display an error message in stdout prior to the stack trace Current Behavior If describing a bug tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior If you are seeing an error please include the full error message and stack trace If suggesting a changeimprovement explain the difference from current behavior The generated log file contains lots of info but not this log message Possible Solution Not obligatory but suggest a fixreason for the bug or ideas how to implement the addition or change How could I add the log message to that file Context How has this issue affected you What are you trying to accomplish Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world Im using humanpanic in a commandline app Im developing Code Sample If you are seeing an error please provide a code repository gist or sample files to reproduce the issue Your Environment Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in name rrss imap operatingsystem windows crateversion alpha Im quite sure this section could be automatically generated when using humanpanic Would it be possible to set a custom error message Perhaps a project could have a text file or config file that it passes as a string to humanpanics sourcing of its text This would also fix This is a workinprogress tracking issue for a release of humanpanic set in motion because of New Features x Show message only to humans PR x Include original panic messages PR Include rustc version program was compiled with Provide a way for tools to hook into panic reports Provide a way for crash reporters to be called Split website and repository fields PR Update to Rust Expected Behavior I was investigating humanpanic for possible usage in Clippy because we usually get a lot of failures due to being on nightly and depending on a lot of internal APIs Is there a possibility to include the current rustc version in the report Ideally that would include everything thats shown in rustc vV Current Behavior Its currently not included Possible Solution I think executing rustc vV capturing the output and adding it to the report file should work but not sure Id be happy to work on this if you have nothing against including that in the report Choose one feature request Something I noticed in sentry which is an enterprisey form of humanpanic is the ability to capture logged warnings errors This could be a useful feature for humanpanic as well to get extra context for why things might have failed See their log integration for their API and what features it provides As per we should probably setup some tests killercup made a good suggestion that we could use for that Could this crate at a later date optionally allow for sending the report on behalf of the user if they allow it rather than manual submission from the user Or would that be the responsibility of another crate that builds off this one
