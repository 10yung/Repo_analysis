This tracker should only be used to report bugs and request features enhancements to PyInstaller For questions and general support use the mailing list see Use the search function before creating a new issue Duplicates will be closed and directed to the original discussion Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I have two virtual environments One uses Tensorflow GPU and another one Tensorflow CPU I created an exe file for both the environments The only difference in both the exe files is that pywraptensorflowinternalpyd file is different for both GPU CPU version So I either need to keep two exe for gpu cpu or manually or via code copypaste the gpucpu pywraptensorflowinternalpyd into the exe folder Describe the solution youd like Any way to load the GPUCPU TensorFlow file using a command at runtime Something like this exenameexe loadTensorFlowFilePathabcPathHere Just used Tensorflow example here I guess we can add this feature for all type of files Describe alternatives youve considered A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here the are we bundled check code runs in pyinstaller but not under the python interpreter Obviously the code should run in both configurations When my code found this issue I found someone on StackOverflow had a fix adding the False default to the getattr function on line It makes sense to get this fix back into the documentation to prevent this in the future Eg condaforge builds of qt have QTLIBINFIX set to conda thus generating library binaries called Qt Corecondadll for example on Windows Since libname is generated from the librarys filename it wont be found in the qtdynamicdependenciesdict leading to missing hiddenimports translations and plugins If libname was not found in the dependencies dictionary this matches the dependencies dictionarys keys as prefix to the libname searching longest keys first Tested on Windows macOS with Python fix simple new hook for jaracotxt to fix On macOS when building a simple QtWebEngine application example with PyQt

all required information The easier it is for maintainers to reproduce the faster itll be fixed ONLY TEXT DO NOT POST IMAGES Description of the issue Apple now requires all apps to get signed by their notary service before they can get run in macOS Catalina The notary service ensures that every binary in the app has security features enabled including that theyre codesigned and that they have the Hardened Runtime capability enabled As of January Apples notary service wont sign any apps that dont have Hardened Runtime I can successfully build an app bundle with PyInstaller that executes without codesigning it I can also codesign it but without enabled Hardened Runtime and the app runs fine codesign deep s DEVELOPERIDAPPLICATION MyAppapp But when I codesign and enable hardened runtime the app crashes codesign deep s DEVELOPERIDAPPLICATION o runtime MyAppapp This is what happens when I try running the hardened runtime version of the app Traceback most recent call last File

and choose to not use hardened runtime However Mac binaries built after January now require this if theyre going to run in macOS Catalina so not using hardened runtime isnt an option Context
