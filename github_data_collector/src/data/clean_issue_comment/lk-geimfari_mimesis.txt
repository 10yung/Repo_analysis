desired details Sometimes we need to access the data attribute So I suggest this python providergetrawdatamykey Instead of this python providerdata mykey We need to support the generating of unique usernames and emails I think that it can be done using some temporary storage of generated values If I am generating username in the following way genericpersonusernameUUd How can I restrict the length of string generated to say only characters or characters I have replaced Pipenv with Poetry because the second one is much faster almost in everything Pipenv just sucks We should use poetry Files to update x Update CONTRIBUTINGrst x Update travisyml I have made things Checklist Im sure that I did not unrelated changes in this pull request x I have created at least one test case for the changes I have made I have updated the documentation for the changes I have made x I have added my changes to the CHANGELOGrst Related issues Format is Closes Refs lkgeimfari sobolevn Before I continue any further Id like to know what do you think about this approach FutureDatetime is a subclass of Datetime It takes some argument in the init function to specify how much time to shift from the time when its initialized All the methods that take as argument a start date are overrided and start is replaced with the current future The end argument is set in a way that the timedelta from start to end is the same in Datetime and in FutureDatetime For example in Datetimeweekdate start and end there is a year of difference in the default arguments so in FutureDatetime by default we have startselffutureyear and endselffutureyear
