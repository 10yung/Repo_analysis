Im thrilled that this app has the Loop reminders until dismissed setting but if it is enabled then all reminders turn my device into a constant alarm clock What would be great is if users could enable this setting for only certain events event types or reminders More generally it might be useful to be able to change any of the event reminder settings Vibrate loop reminder sound on a per event basis more info at email from Victor on th January Hello After activating the widget i noticed the date format there was not what i wanted monthdaynumber instead of daynumbermonth I searched in the issues here and found a guy saying it was located in Settings here but i didnt see anything in the app settings that could do it nor in the settings of my phone Can you help me or if its not a feature can we make it into one more optional info at email from Dan on nd January Hello When using the calendar event list widget I cant seem to find a way to hide distant future events which may or may not be recurring If its not too hard of a feature to add would it be possible to support a setting for specifying a duration window after which future events dont show up in the event list widget In such a case where there are no upcoming events a message such as No upcoming events optionally with the duration window might be appropriate as a placeholder Thank you for continuing to support this app bowingman device I am running from fdroid Today I started seeing pretty much consistently an error message from android about the app with uid generating too many alarms See screenshot Screenshot Calendar Its really annoying to have a toast warning on the screen almost all the time Even a reboot did not fix the issue And I dont even use alarms reminders that much hello I use simplecalender multiple times daily to add calender events Every event ist different in terms of notifications Sometimes I want none sometimes different ones sometimes I just want to be notified when the event starts Currently I have to click each notification preset to then put them to no notification with preset notifications from last times event thats clicks Requested by me is a simple button without a popup in the edit screen of an event to either delete all notifications click delete notifications seperately clicks best regards Is this feature already there and did I miss it somehow I dont see it neither while editing any event nor when scanning the main apps configuration Btw great job on this happ most thankfull Hi all I use DAVx to synchronize my hosted CalDAV calendars to my phone I use repeating events where I modify single occurrences mostly adding descriptions This will lead to SimpleCalendar not showing the modified occurrence anymore at all Regular repeating events that are not modified work as expected I made sure its not a DAVx the events appear correctly if I use the Android Google Calendar app which for now I have to use because of this bug They also appear correctly in the Web UI of my provider and Thunderbird where I create them Possibly related to by glancing over them Android SimpleCalendar DAVx ose
