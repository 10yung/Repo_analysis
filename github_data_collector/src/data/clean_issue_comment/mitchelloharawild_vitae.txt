makeletterclosing details Currently citationpackage and latexengine options are locked by vitae package so that users cannot change their values when necessary For example I had to use citationpackage none to test pandocciteproc when using luafilter instead of biblatex Rather than hardlocking those values we could suggested values as default and allow users to change them when necessary This should give a nice error in R rather than failing in when rendering the tex Likely this will be implemented as a consequence of It would be nicer if we had date field in YAML for CV templates If date is provided that could be used as a timestamp to indicate when the CV has been updated Should make things easier to maintain simplify updating templates and make it easier for adding word and HTML templates in the future Related I have coauthors with two last names separated by a hyphen and I did not get expected output from detailedentries function For example if I want to include any paper from Ursula in my CV I have to make following correction r pubsauthor strreplaceallpubsauthorRuiz Vera RuizVera to make sure desirable output I guess that the same problem can occur in other arguments of detailedentries Breaking Changes Allowing users to print multiple bib files with preferable citation style using csl file and Added myself jooyoungseo to the author list as the third author as I think this commitment has made breaking changes and I have spent many hours hopefully it could be accepted Used multiplebibliographieslua Made and arranged instresources directory by including luafilter some widely used csl files apa csl mla csl acmcsl ieeecsl harvardcitethemrightcsl chicago csl and the existing bibformattex files Made some other required functions in utilsR Modified the cvdocumentR file to make the vitae package work with the multiplebibliographieslua filter Added academic template to demonstrate the multiple bibprinting and explain its usage Template A minimal usage

this is possible How would one code that into the tibbledataframe I imagine there would be some tinkering with the Latex template too I was wondering if there is a way to remove a particular field from the bib outputs I have used type field in Zotero to flag certain items eg MChem under the Thesis bibtype but would like to remove MChem from the pdf printout I thought select would work much like filter does but unfortunately it remains in the pdf Below is the code I have used bibliographyentriesheredata arnoldcbib filterbibtype Thesis type MChem selecttype I have checked that it does work when you create a tibble just not when it comes to creating the pdf ie the code below does remove type from the tibble mchem mchem bibliographyentriesheredata arnoldcbib filterbibtype Thesis type MChem selecttype Any thoughts on what I could use instead Thanks
