Hello Im trying to implement custom cells and am unable to change the cell heights In the documentation you mention being able to manipulate cell heights but I am not seeing a way to do that The cells are always the same narrow height of the basic table cell Help would be much appreciated Hi On iOS the whole table background color is white in dark mode and I cant seem to be able to change it When I press on each item it seems the pressed color and text colors are correct img width altScreenshot at src Is there anyway to fix this behavior Hi This issue is not related to reactnativetableview We are creating a new private component library for our organization I tried the following Component library itself as a separate project with react and reactnative as peer dependencies in my project But having just the components code in component library is not useful because we have to add new code or fixes and we have to run the story bookBecause of peer dependencies could not be able run story book Could you please help me with the model I have to follow for creating a react native library Thank you in advance Added support for edit and custom edit button title on editingswipe of TableView item Code for reproduction is here What I would like to achieve I would like to achieve that always when I add new items to the end of the list the list will scroll to the bottom What works I can achieve that when using Item from this library Gif bug works What doesnt work When I use exactly the same code except I use Cell instead of Item it will flash and also start from the top again and also it does not animate to the bottom Gif bug does not work Conclusion Looks like bug to me I would really hope this will get fixed because Item is too limited for me I have to style the component I can help also to resolve this issue if you guys point me to right place to look If this is not fixable do you have other suggestions on these kind of React Native iOS libraries Hi I added handlers for reorder events so now we can use reorderable TableView inside ScrollView PS Month passed from my previous PR it would be great if you test and approve it too iRoachie Are you interested in the option to support rounded corners on the sections Ive got it to work for me but would like to know if this is something you want in this library before creating a PR img d I use RNTableView with custom cell cell have touchevents too when I tap hold scroll release it performance as expect then when i quickly drag it and release immediately it will call tap action I find that when single tap or drag and release the behavior of RCTTouchHandler are the same touchBegan touchMove sometimes don t call touchEnd in almost s JS can not distinguish these two gesture I tried calculate time it doesnt work because these two cost almost same time I tried to override shouldRequireFailureOfGestureRecognizer method in RCTTouchHandler but I cannot prevent the touchEnd event I look up iOS system UIScrollView find out that system have a gesture called UIScrollViewDelayedTouchesBeganGestureRecognizer when this called other gesture will be cancelled Also I find docs in RCTScrollView For React scroll views we want the default to be the same behavior as UIControls so im so confused and looking forward for some help please give me some advise thanks a lot Is there a way to change an individual Items color without changing the color of the whole table textColor sets the color of the TableView and using Item stylecolor red doesnt seem to work I am looking to add a destructive button which is red and used to logout Now animation hardcoded to false Can you add property to change it
