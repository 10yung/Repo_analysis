My usage When findPath returns an empty array because the destination is impassable Im testing various surrounding nodes to see if I can reach them instead Using AStar algorithm the first time I call this function I receive a list of nodes as expected On subsequent calls using the same instance of AStarFinder with the same grid but different coordinates I seem to receive empty arrays in response Thank you for this I have learned a lot already about AI searching since finding this project I identified the solution I think to how this is applied Create default grid Clone default grid to objects Decision logic to determine destination findPath Update default grid Repeat Am I on the right track Chrys The first example in the documentation with walkability matrix does not seem to work var walkabilityMatrix var grid new PFGridwalkabilityMatrix typo here in the original documentation matrix instead of walkabilityMatric var finder new PFAStarFinder var path finderfindPath grid Produces the following error TypeError thisnodes e is undefined Im currently working on a project that renders a tile map based on a onedimensional array as grid So I have to transform that array into a twodimensional array in order to instantiate a Grid that can be used by the finders If Im not mistaken it seems that we could have a new Grid that knows how to handle a onedimensional array while exposing the same API or even extend PFGrid to handle a onedimensional grid argument I didnt read all of the finders yet but from what Ive seen it would be possible to extend Grid in order to support onedimensional arrays with no breaking changes to the finders right I dont know if its intentional but due to cloning my grid x in loop and adding collisions also in loop searching closest path is taking more than few seconds which makes this library unusable in my case But be aware Im not hating this is open source so thank you for sharing anyway Just wondering if there are plans to optimase performance of this library in future Hi I have this array with points x y x y xnyn how find best route with a start and end point Array of points The red dots are the points First I want to say This is an awesome fun tool for visualizing different search algorithms so thanks for making it While trying out I found that the goal seems to be starting offscreen on my platform Windows Google Chrome version Heres a picture to illustrate hiddengoal If I click and drag from somewhere within the circle I can pull the goal back onto the grid so its still usable its just tricky to get going I would guess it has something to do with this line here because seeing that line is what gave me the idea of trying to click and drag from offscreen at the same height as the start marker Unfortunately I dont know anything about web dev so I have no ideas about why its wrong or how to fix it Hello thank you for this library I d like to use it in Angular but I m not sure how to install it What I did npm install pathfinding In the angularjson I added it scripts nodemodulespaperdistpaperfullminjs nodemodulespathfindingsrcPathFindingjs In my component I tried to import import Grid Finder from pathfinding But I get an error when I compile it with ng serve PathFindingjs Uncaught ReferenceError module is not defined at PathFindingjs Is it possible to use it in Angular If so what s the best way to do it Any help would be very welcome I m building an interactive table app for shoppingmalls and I m trying to build the wayfinding module Thanks in advance Hello Nice code I am wondering if its possible to connect to points Like here from the middle left to the middle right Thanks in advance Chris Pappas im noob help
