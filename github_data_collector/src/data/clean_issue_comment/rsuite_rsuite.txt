 Versions package version react rsuite What is the expected behavior When an AutoComplete item is selected using the enter key the onSelect handler is passed the selected data item What is the current behavior When an AutoComplete item is selected using the enter key the onSelect handler is passed undefined What are the steps to reproduce Mount an AutoComplete component with some data and an onSelect handler Focus the AutoComplete Trigger the menu Use the down arrow to select an item Press the enter key to select to select the targeted item Versions Please tell our you using react version and rsuite version react rsuite package version react rsuite babelcli webpack babelpresetrsuite What is the expected behavior What is the current behavior babelpresetrsuite javascript babelrcjs presets rsuite style true babelpresetenv modules false babelpresetreact babelpresettypescript indexjs import Input Button from rsuite javascript indexjsx import Input from rsuitelibInput import rsuitelibInputstyles import Button from rsuitelibButton import rsuitelibButtonstyles webpack webpackbundleanalyzer Versions Please tell our you using react version and rsuite version react rsuite package version react rsuite What is the current behavior Hello thanks for this fantastic library Some classes have generic names like hidden which interfere with other projects such as tailwindcss The markup for hidden is hidden display none important So its not even possible to override it What is the expected behavior It would be great if every class names were prefixed with rs just like most classes hidden nshidden What are the steps to reproduce Try and use media queries with the hidden class media only screen and maxwidth px hidden display block It wont work Clear and concise reproduction instructions are important for us to be able to triage your issue in a timely manner Please fork this example reproduce the problem you are issue fork Any additional comments optional egsome backgroundcontext of how you ran into this bug bug Hi I want to use Rsuite with some cssinjs library styledcomponents is there a way of theming both with the same theme And have you thought about going to replace less with some cssinjs library Thanks gif What problem does this feature solve Its really helpful to have the spec guides available which I assume is exported from sketchmeasure but it would be even better to have the source file available for mocking up designs Especially when trying to choose a framework to start with before any frontend implementation Are there any plans to release this Thanks for the awesome library Versions package version react rsuite What is the expected behavior React Suite adheres to scriptsrc CSP without requiring unsafeeval What is the current behavior React Suite violates scriptsrc CSP due to the use of new Functionreturn this What are the steps to reproduce Build a project that includes an React Suite component eg Popover Serve the project with the CSP header ContentSecurityPolicyscriptsrc self cdnjsdelivrnet alternatively the source indexhtml can include the meta tag meta httpequivContentSecurityPolicy contentscriptsrc self cdnjsdelivrnet Watch the world burn Also the project wont load due to a CSP violation in Chrome at least Any additional comments optional The culprit appears to be the prefix util which uses the global new Functionreturn this pattern to ensure the correct global scope is accessed regardless of execution environment when checking for a custom CSS prefix It looks like this was introduced in the migration from flow to typescript It would be interesting to know why the global scope coercion needed to be employed as the previous version of the file didnt contain it supposedly relying upon webpacks definePlugin up until this point Finally thanks for creating the great set of cohesive components that is React Suite and sharing it with the world
