 Version macOS In the following code setFrame happens before show even though it is written after Modalbuild duration animationDuration origin function mFrame return x y text Some Text show WindowfocusedsetFrame It might not be so obvious because setFrame occurs so quickly But I have an animate function that calls setFrame in quick succession using a series of intermediate frames Its more apparent in that situation show executes after all the setFrames Modalbuildshow animateSetFrame function animateSetFramewindow origFrame destFrame a set loop of windowsetFrame Interestingly if I wrap setFrame in a zerodelay Timer show will fire before setFrame Modalbuildshow new Timer false WindowfocusedsetFrame or using animateSetFrame I dont mind refactoring my code and functions to account for the necessary Timers but it will just make my code a lot less readable and easy to understand Im also wondering if Im using the API incorrectly somehow leading to these effects In addition the same things happen when I assign the Modal or Timer to a variable Am I able to launch Chrome for example holding FnC Version latest macOS Im interested in getting environment variables or at the very least the users home directory from within Phoenix Could an implementation of nodejss processenv be added Ive had a look at but I feel like there should be a better way considering the convention among APIs Ive seen is to get the environment variables as they were when the program started Version macOS F The modal text is grey now Could Modal support colored text expected Modalbuild text Some span colorred size pxtextspan here Version macOS Beta A m Catalina img width altScreenshot at src I know macos is in beta Update I built the app from source and it works fine Version macOS E Phoenix binds to a key press ignoring the modifiers I pass meaning pressing the key on its own such as when trying to type this message triggers my callback Im using the following code js Keyonp command control function PhoenixnotifyHello there Edit This code also behaves the same as above binding to just the p alone js let keyHandler new Keyp command control function PhoenixnotifyHello there Ive worked it out at last but theres nothing in Consoleapp to tell me whats going wrong and the docs are unclear stating Modifiers command cmd option alt control ctrl and shift case insensitive I read this to mean both command and cmd are valid when it appears that only cmd is valid I would expect invalid modifiers to throw an error or for Phoenix to accept both command and cmd as modifiers the docs Hey I just got some general questions Im interested in writing my own window manager in JavaScript Id like to be able to use phoenix as a library from a nodejselectron context as opposed to my code being evaluated from within phoenix Something like this js const Window requirephoenix const screen ScreenmainflippedVisibleFrame const window Windowfocused if window windowsetTopLeft x screenx screenwidth windowframewidth y screeny screenheight windowframeheight Are there any plans to make phoenix available as an npm package like that This PR is adding popover for click on window zoom button popover Buttons on popover would control window size mostly of screen in directions My initial idea was adding JS API to create that buttons but I decided to start with smaller steps Also Im not sure how fit such feature is for this project Anyway heres the list of potential improvements that I have or something that can be turned into must have Align popover with window make popover left edge of popover to match window left edge just small visual improvement Option to control should it focusbring to front window on size change Popover is not part of application its directed to so target window is not activated on popover action Add option to control modifier key right now its hard coded to be command key but I see use cases to remove any modifiers at all Develop JS API to manage popover icons Last but not the least I was thinking on turning PHPopover into singleton but Im hesitating how much utility itll have Ever since upgrading to the latest MacOS the modals have been appearing with rounded corners appearing as awkward ovals screen shot at Ive looked around in the Wiki for some option to control the modals appearance but there doesnt seem to be any options for configuring the rounded corners Version macOS Hey kasper Is there a way to do that I miss the Stay in Front feature of the iOS simulator and I would love to recreate it with Phoenix
