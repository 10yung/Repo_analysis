Hi First of all thank you for great tutorials on D graphics There is an issue when building project on Windows with GCC In initial commit in file tinyraycastercpp in function dropppmimage you have stdofstream ofsfilename ofs P n w h n n On Windows GCC replaces n in output file with platform specific code x D A what is incorrect it should be x A in the file This result in incorrect ppm image representation This happens because of opening file in text mode To fix this file should be opened in binary mode for example like this stdofstream ofs ofsopenfilename stdofstreamout stdofstreambinary ofs P n w h n n Then everything works correctly I think this patch would not affect other platforms
