 This link seems to be broken Itd be nice to have that fixed as I dont seem to find any other way of finding out how I could implement require or even import Thanks include stdioh include v h int mainvoid struct v v v create v valt a v mkarrayv v arraypushv a v mknumberv v arraypushv a v mknumberv v arraypushv a v mknumberv printfd n v arraylengthv a v arraydelv a printfd n v arraylengthv a v destroyv return the output is if I change v arraydelv a to v arraydelv a the output is it seems that only the last entry can be deleted Some values cant be passed directly to a function I was trying to pass true as the first argument to a function but it got turned into undefined From what Ive seen this happens with false and null as well Check the below example and its output from running v filejs written in the comments use strict function fna b printa a b b fn a b fntrue a undefined b undefined fntrue true a true b undefined fntrue foo a true b foo If instead you put the true value in a variable and pass it through that variable everything works well print from a variable var trueVar true fntrueVar a true b undefined fntrueVar trueVar a true b true fntrueVar foo a true b foo Everything works if true is generated from any expression as well I compiled the latest master as of today of v with the following command gcc O DV EXE DV ENABLESTACKTRACKING DV ENABLEFILE v c lm But even when keeping only DV EXE I can still reproduce this issue could you give me one example about ajax Hello I was using American Fuzzy Lop aflfuzz to fuzz input the v program Is fixing the crashes from these input files something youre interested in The input files can be found here The files can be executed as v idfilename to cause seg faults Let me know if I can provide any more information to help narrow down this issue Fixed errors in example code Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend Fixed errors in example code Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend I couldnt get the example shown in the docs to run properly after fixing several syntax errors so I put together this simple test program C include v h static v valt jsget struct v v v valt thisobj v valt args voidthisobj voidargs return v mknumberv int mainvoid struct v v v create v setmethodv v getglobalv get jsget v valt result enum v err status v execv printget get result ifstatus V OK fprintfstderr error d n intstatus else printfresult f n floatv getdoublev result v destroyv return intstatus The output of the program is get undefined result nan Program was compiled with GCC gcc Wnoincompatiblepointertypes lm o test v c testc Any ideas as to whats going on Can I precompile the javascript code via v compile and then directly load the byte code and execute I havent found any interface that could deal with the generate byte code please impl the gettersetter supports we need it
