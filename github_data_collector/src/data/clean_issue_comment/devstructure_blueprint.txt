whats wrong Thanks With CentOS the output format of yum groupinfo and rpm q has changed slightly This causes a failure when blueprint parses the the output during cache file creation blueprintignore

include spaces possibly located at the end of the line With CentOS no more trailing spaces are printed causing the expression linerstrip linefind to fail for such line stripping off the last character

screenshot This trivial patch allows the PEAR package regular expression matcher to catch packages from all registered PEAR channels I encountered this as an issue when trying to track the
