Are there any toolboxes to replace Freesurfer I am working under Windows OS The QuickNAT wrapped by MatConvNet works I read in a volume image using Matlab and send it as the input of SegmentVol However the segmentation result is weird Therefore is it possible to make use of some other surrogate Freesurfer for predata processing such as transforming data into mgz format and to realize isotropic resolution Hope it is clear Thanks Hi I saw you mentioned in step Enter the path and name of the MRI volume use freesurfer to do it using the command mriconvert conform InputVol OutputVol Is this part of the preprocessing step If I have my own data do I need to run freesurfer or I can directly test my data Thanks Dear Dr ROY Can you give me a detailed introduction about how to make imdb thanks yujunjie The segmentation looks great but in my machine it took seconds after I changed Predictions SegTime SegmentVolData Change the based on your GPU RAM size to Predictions SegTime SegmentVolData Change the based on your GPU RAM size The problem is when do resampling we either change the spacing or the size In your sample case the spacing was mm and the size I have an image with spacing mm and size I dont think it is possible to change this image to mm and with keeping its actual measurements Sorry if this is a very beginner question but could you please provide an exampletutorial about how to train the network on different dataset
