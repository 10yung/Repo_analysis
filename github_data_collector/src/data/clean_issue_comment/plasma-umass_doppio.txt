Hi all Having run into some issues with using Scanner to read files within the BrowserFS filesystem Ive tried the following on your demo page just to confirm its not something in my project import javautilScanner import javaioFile public class FileTest public static void mainString args throws Exception File f new Filetesttxt Scanner fr new Scannerf SystemoutprintlnAbout to try to read while frhasNextLine SystemoutprintlnfrnextLine I get the same symptoms as in my own project that uses Doppio the Scanner is instantiated seemingly without incident but the moment one tries to do anything that involves reading the file execution seems to hang It fails silently in that the browser does not block and no console errors are generated Attempting a similar simple linebyline read from a test file using BufferedReadernew FileReaderFILENAME works fine so there seems to be something causing problems in the interaction between Scanner and the BrowserFSbased filesystem Have hacked around it for now by using an alternate version of Scanner see but the year on that says it all Would be nice if the real Scanner could be made to work Im following the instructions in readme file to set up a simple project But JVM filed to initialize From network log the last file loaded was rtjar All files have been downloaded successfully at Objectassert as default assertts at ConstantPoolparse

the serverside as a backend Also having an appletlike app is although great technical wise not amazing from user experience point of view Im trying to experiment something on this side which is running a backend server using doppio and use an iframe in the browser to interact with it But Im failing and running out of ideas Thus I need some help What Im trying to do Getting a minimal embedded jetty server into a jar file to run in doppio Its not working properly but still if it works then its going nowhere It will theoretically open port on the host machine and listen for connection But the host is a browser and it does not understand what is listening to port Im trying to fake it to make the process locate the iframe instead and interact with it In the previous example that iframe can be as simple as a blank page pointing to localhost and the end result will be getting h Hello Worldh in it This is rather a discussion than a bug putting my thoughts here since I couldnt find a discussion list Correct me if Im wrong but right now Doppio can be used only through CLI in some kind of emulated terminal I saw a years old branch for graphics that never progressed too far I dont have much experience in this but I can imagine that best way to get Graphics to work is to dump all the pixels into some kind of HTML Canvas It will then work similar to an Applet with major exception that the VM is builtin rather than required by the user Has this been considered before and research results PrintService printServices PrintServiceLookuplookupPrintServicesnull null

project I omit javahome content because its too big whats wrong myappzip Thank you very much for any help PS Does the browser have to load all the javahome content MB If its so I figure that it cannot be used in real world use cases
