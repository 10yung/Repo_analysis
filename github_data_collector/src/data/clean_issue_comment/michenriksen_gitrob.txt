Hi your tools are awesome but I think there are important things missing the easy one The token keyword is not treated as relevant so any slack or AWS token would be ignored Entropy there are no high entropy checks Steps to Reproduce the Problem Take any user with a repository containing the token keyword it will not be ignored The same for high entropy values Would you mind to add these two things please Switched to go modules for dependencies Closes Expected Behavior gitrob should use go modules to install dependencies Actual Behavior gitrob does not have gomod nor gosum to install dependencies using modules Specifications Gitrob version beta Operating system Arch Linux Go version Hi I get the build error while building the enterprise version of gitrob gitrobgithubenterprise buildsh Appreciate if you provide any assistance I have the updated version of golang Building linuxamd rootDownloadsgitrobgithubenterprise maingo sessGithubURL undefined type coreSession has no field or method GithubURL maingo cannot use sess type coreSession as type int in argument to coreCloneRepository maingo too many arguments in call to findingInitialize Building darwinamd rootDownloadsgitrobgithubenterprise maingo sessGithubURL undefined type coreSession has no field or method GithubURL maingo cannot use sess type coreSession as type int in argument to coreCloneRepository maingo too many arguments in call to findingInitialize Building windowsamd rootDownloadsgitrobgithubenterprise maingo sessGithubURL undefined type coreSession has no field or method GithubURL maingo cannot use sess type coreSession as type int in argument to coreCloneRepository maingo too many arguments in call to findingInitialize shasum Hey there and thank you for using the issue tracker Checklist before filing an issue Y Is this something you can debug and fix Send a pull request Bug fixes and documentation fixes are welcome N Have a usage question Ask your question on StackOverflow StackExchange Security or similar platform N Have an idea for a feature Make sure that it hasnt been suggested before and describe your idea in detail None of the above create a bug report Make sure to add all the information needed to understand the bug so that someone can help If information is missing the issue will be labeled with Needs more information and closed until there is enough information Expected Behavior Actual Behavior Steps to Reproduce the Problem gitrob access token username gitrob v beta started at T Loaded signatures Web interface available at Gathering targets panic sync negative WaitGroup counter goroutine running syncWaitGroupAdd xc xffffffffffffffff usrlocalgosrcsyncwaitgroupgo x a mainAnalyzeRepositories xc Usersmichaelgosrcgithubcommichenriksengitrobmaingo xdb mainmain Usersmichaelgosrcgithubcommichenriksengitrobmaingo x Specifications Gitrob version v beta Operating system Windows Pro Go version go version go windowsamd well problem i am facing is that when gitrob finishes its scan it says it found repositories and files and co but when the scan is done and i want to go through the findings nothing is responsive Hey Michenriksen I have read that it clones the repo somewhere for analyzing but I havent found the path Please confirm where it clone the git repo for analyzing I want to only scan the selected repo not all the repo of my account how can I do it Why not allow users to perform a keyword search against the api then iterate through each of the results How can I run gitrob on a particular Github repository only How to run gitrob against other git platforms eg GitLab Can I remotely feed a cloned repository to gitrob Answer to might solve the other two if there is one Also this is a suggestion to add the support for remotely adding repository which is preset in the system storage
