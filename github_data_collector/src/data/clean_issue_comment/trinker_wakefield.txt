trinker amazing package Quick question can I have control over the mean and sd for the first variable in an rseries It would probably look like this rseriesnormalmean sd min max name Question relate listoperation mean sd Add more groups to gender Nice It would also be great to set percentile distribution per var group Ex Age so forth Thanks for making this useful package I tried to use it initially by doing wakefieldrdataframeid age n This fails because it seems the id and age etc functions need to be available It is beyond my knowledge but perhaps you could interpret the symbols given in the wakefield namespace Adding all those genericsounding names to my namespace is a little worrying I suppose I can call each function directly using wakefield but this becomes more cumbersome Just a thought Currently all user errors are swallowed by try blocks in rlist rdataframe id sampleNULL answer Error in sampleNULL n from rlistR unused argument n which is unrelated to the real problem sampleNULL Error in sampleintlengthx size replace prob invalid first argument BTW you can eliminate such errors and avoid the substitution of each varfunction by having a smart n argument that would automatically pick n from the calling environment varfun functiona getN parentframe printa caller function N varfun caller librarywakefield fun functionn digits roundrnormnn digits foo rdataframe n Income funmean sd race Age funmean sd sex internetbrowser state marital Is it possible to generate values in a multiselect environment This could apply to survey research select all that apply or graphs edges between nodes of a certain type Below is a really hacky function that demonstrates this usecase in a hardcoded way helper function obviously not a productionquality function buildmulti functionids dfdata dataframe for i in lengthids randomize how many choices are made nobs samplex size prob c what are the choices available in the multiselect cvals cBIZARTSSCIENCEHEALTHOTHER vals samplex cvals replace FALSE prob c size nobs tmpdf dataframeid ids i values vals dfdata dplyrbindrowsdfdata tmpdf returndfdata generate a set of ids mydf rdataframeid id n and generate the data return a long dataset of multiselect options for given probabilities which I hardcoded mylong buildmultimydfid Above generates the dataset in a structure that I would need but I wasnt sure if this already existed in the current package I started work awhile ago on a much less ambitious project than wakefield to attempt to generate random data sets on the fly with a known correlation structure You can see the seeds of that work here It would be cool to include the ability to generate numeric or factor data with a known correlation structure to build structural relationships into the very realistic looking data generated by wakefield
