The current Graph Engine VS Templates dont support current workflows and they generate the flawed csproj file content Here is a list of things that dont work or inefficient Graph Engine Application Project Net Core Support for NET is limited to netcoreapp we are now netcoreapp Only NET Framework versions are presented in the Configure your new proejct dialog exhibit A exhibit C Note you cant select NET Core versions exhibit B The PackageReference Include statement is flawed at the Version parameter Does not generate a proper NET Core Project file and Package References is not generated AssemblyInfocs file is generated Visual Studio My code static void Mainstring args TrinityConfigCurrentRunningMode RunningModeEmbedded Error occurred Internal error T Maybe I did something wrong What

async method is being called Very frustrating to encounter this type of bug at this stage in development I have a mediumsize complex WPFMVVM project using TrinityGraphEngine I have integrated GraphEngine using a modular MVVM design pattern using PRISM and Castle Windsor DI I have created a number of NET assemblies that embody data segments using the Separation of Concerns design idiom I have created CommunicationShell a wrapper around the Trinity APIs that set up the communications stack the CommunicationShell is injected into each ViewModel this is done so as to avoid duplicate code and to only have a single established environment for the entire application and all ViewModel instances In this code segment the Trinity clientside environment is established You can see that Im using the module Trinity dynamic server composition API to register each communication module I am also getting each module implementation setting up reactive observables against each module Here is the error In this existing codebase the RPC method PushContactDataModelAsync is never called but as you can see here it has been called by the Trinity runtime Here is the only actual RPC method called in the app at this time As you can see I make the call to QueryUserAuthInfoAsync this is a bug I have a lot of material regarding this bug and I am willing to connect via LiveShare in VS so that it can be observed directly Please let me know what other data and or information you need to move forward in investigating the problem foreach var userAuthenticationSessionDataNode in GlobalLocalStorageUserAuthenticationCacheSelector var userAuthInfoSetCellId userAuthenticationSessionDataNodeCellId var userAuthInfoSet userAuthenticationSessionDataNodeUserAuthInfoSet This is bad I was only expecting a single cell here but the code stalls in the debugger and then I get the follwing error here is the preceeding code UserAuthenticationSessionData userAuthenticationSessionData new

connected to the same server and no write ahead log error is generated My guess is that there is some type of setting I must be missing Can anyone point me in the direction look for answers vs MVC net
