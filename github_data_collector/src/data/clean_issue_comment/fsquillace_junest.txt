I found nvim nodejs and some tools would aborted at startup For example nvim Aborted Executing nvim would lead to Aborted instantly The OS is CentOS lsbrelease a LSB Version base amd base noarchcore amd core noarchgraphics amd graphics noarchprinting amd printing noarch Distributor ID CentOS Description CentOS release Final Release Codename Final The reproduce steps junest proot f b k nvim Aborted Is this a known issue Is there a solution for this The reason why junest u is not used as the main backed solution for JuNest is that some Linux distros do not have the linux user namespace enabled by default It is required to have root privileges in order to enabled it Fortunately in several distros like Ubuntu and Arch Linux it seems they have enabled it by default This issue is to report the list of distro which have the namespace enabled by default and decide whether is the right time to have such backend as the primary solution for JuNest and Proot as secondary solution Major Distros to look at Ubuntu Arch Linux Debian Fedora Try to rename a file in junest junest bash homemejunestoptjunestlibcorecommonsh line usrbingetent Permission denied

screen properly writing among the data that was in the emacs buffer Then fg just comes back with emacs nw and a blank screen Actually it seems emacs is still there but the screen is all screwed up and its not responding to control characters properly Someone else was also having trouble with z This work around on the locale issue solved the z problem for me Hi Recently I noticed that the default build system provided in your URL seems outdated in that it gives problems installing packages like vim This problem was also raised in an issue The problem is rectified when I build my own image using your instructions I then created my own repo uploading my own latest system build image so I could use it as needed I will also be maintaining this repo from time to time I thought of somehow possibly including this in your project too so new users without an existing Arch Linux system therefore cant build their own system image or simply to avoid the pain of building one themselves can now use the images maintained in my repo I have updated your README to include this I have also deleted the section using yaourt to install since yaourt is no longer in use in Arch Linux If you are happy with this change or edit as you see fit kindly accept the proposed changes I have just updated with pacman Syu and Im getting lots of random crashes The first one is in installinfo which runs as part of the pacman command I also have a crash in my own c program which wasnt happening before It seems to be memory related in my code Im just appending strings in a loop and sometimes it works sometimes it crashes If I reserve enough memory for the destination string so that it never needs to reallocate to accomodate for the appended substrings then the crashe disappears completely If I downgraded to glibc all goes back to normal but I obviously end up with nonworking packages eg vim wont start anymore as it doesnt find the right version of glibc plus some other system packages As soon as I reinstall glibc the crashes are back Is there a solution for this git clone gitgithubcomfsquillacejunest localsharejunest export PATHlocalsharejunestbinPATH junest f I am getting Installing

proot development is halted However some forks are still in active development it might be worth looking at code of repos such as termuxproot for potential improvements Also is it possible to provide junest as an app for Android It seems it can be helpful in terms of project funding by keeping some addons for small price say like a donation version on play store Error message eliasolakka junest
