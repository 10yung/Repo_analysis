Hi When I add host in UI I always get test connection fail But i tried to connect the host server with ssh in terminal it is working why it says Test connection fails am i missing something thanks My guess is it is a gem version issue but I am not strong in Ruby The server component starts up but generates database errors I am guessing the first step is to do the db setup minicronserverbin

database engine Description This package contains the header files and development documentation for sqlite If you like to develop programs using sqlite you will need to install sqlitedevel Version minicron OS Ubuntu LTS Its a reoccurring issue that jobs fails to execute at their expected time Ive got cronjobs set up with minicron and every day I get messages like this to my slack channel Job failed to execute at its expected time Job failed to execute at its expected time Job failed to execute at its expected time When looking at the Executions history for a particular job the job which was alerted as failed to execute does not have an entry in the Executions history for that particular point in time Executions before and after is fine though and most executions for a job runs just fine I just checked for a particular job and it failed on a random day times thats a failure rate of Minicron simply does not run it and does not log why not even when verbose and debug flags are enabled at runtime to the minicron server Any idea what the issue can be here Let me know if you need more information I am currently testing minicron with MySQL direct connection with a external database However I have about query out of that goes into connection error Hello can anyone advise me on the correct process for the installation of Minicron with Postgresql Currently I log into PSQL and create a new minicron user also granting Create DB privilege and then create a Database manually called minicrondb with ownership set to the minicron user I change etcminicrontoml to access Postgresql with the new relevant DatabaseUserPassword information then upon using minicron db setup I get this error FATAL database minicron does not exist Its like the new TOML database name isnt being acknowledged If I change the TOML database name to just minicron to match the default and alter the database name to minicron I then get this error PGDuplicateDatabase ERROR database minicron already exists CREATE DATABASE minicron ENCODING utf Seems like a new issue to me this one suggesting I dont need to create a database manually at all but if I DROPDB but keeping the minicron user with CREATEDB privilege and then run again minicron db setup I get the FATAL database minicron does not exist error again seemingly contrary to the DuplicateDatabase error above Any ideas My PC already runs postgresql for another application so presumably its more efficient than using sqlite which for the record does seem to work PS Its true I am a CrontabUI refugee I had no joy getting that to run recently so here I am I had a buggy script that never exited The minicron web interface showed one instance as running but not the others Could it show all nonfinished scripts and all excutation logs from months ago will delete When I run minicron server restart I dont get an error but it doesnt restart either I must do a stop then a start eg loading execution takes more than a minute with ruby using cpu It would be helpful in the list of jobs beside the number of executions to have the number of total failed executions and also the status successfail of the last execution
