Hi Cameron like many users i am having limited consumers fixed threads with each one having a consumer token and enqueue can be called from any thread The readme section noted that calling with token will have better throughput Since my application needs to be very high performant in MillionsSec i am thinking about making tokens to all the possible producers which may count from to tokens from threads So to the straight question does creating more producer tokens will perform better than without tokens Added cmake support Did not touch xcodemsvc since I dont have access to this gnu makefile modified but did not try it out will give it a shot it should be good mikeroe please review as well Added cmake support Tested on Ubuntu Linux using gcc Any other nonLinux platform or compiler variation will need a tiny bit of work to get it going In addition cmake script now has a make install target which the current make targets dont have On my system concurrentqueueh and blockingconcurrentqueueh are installed to a directory in usrlocalincludemoodycamel I use c if constexpr stmt to reduce code size and fix some MSVC warning in stdclatest mode
