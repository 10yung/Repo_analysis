For some reason this function has an incorrect name pcapdatalinkvaltoName in libpcap its defined as pcapdatalinkvaltoname and even in masscan itself its properly referenced Found this when trying to build masscan with static libpcap How can i add this into the cmdline To show the rfb servers that he found I compile in vs with a little code modified it generate exe sucessfully and runs well when I copy this exe to anthoer windows got error if Device NPFBF EFCCB F D DB D D BFAFFF activate No such device exists How to solve the error Can anyone compile this for Windows x I have issues with it Thanks cc g ggdb Wall O c srccryptobase c o tmpcryptobase o make cc Command not found Makefile recipe for target tmpcryptobase o failed make tmpcryptobase o Error Hi If I am not wrong older versions had capture cert option I dont see it anymore has it been deprecated is there an alternative Thanks In output file function outputdorotate first use out pointer then verify if its null or not This action will lead to a null pointer dereference I use masscan to scan a nonexistent IP Address ports are the shell command is masscan p maxrate but masscan tells me that all the ports are open The ip address is not exist how do it find all the ports are open MacBook Pro test result masscan p maxrate Starting masscan at GMT forced options sS Pn n randomizehosts v sendeth Initiating SYN Stealth Scan
