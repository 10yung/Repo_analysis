 I am trying to figure out how to use RetransmitMult configuration field in TransmitLimitedQueue struct I have three nodes and send broadcast message from one of them As I see when RetransmitMult is equal to only one node receive the message Is this a valid behavior How to send broadcast message to all nodes in cluster I dont find a way to set handler on user message Checked the document and source code dont see a suitable public method I can call I can send user message via SentTo SendToUDP SendToTCP SendBestEffort and SendReliable but I dont find a way to set handler for them expecting something like SetUserMessageHandler githubcomhashicorpgomsgpack is an unnecessary fork of actively maintained githubcomugorjigo I recommend to use the latter memberlist successfully builds and passes all tests with imports replaced from githubcomhashicorpgomsgpack to githubcomugorjigo Please consider switching to githubcomugorjigo FAIL TestShuffleNodes s utiltestgo should not match See full build log here Consul uses an outdated version of this dependency Latest versions have deliberately broken the public API by removing dnsErrTruncated See This PR is part of a batch of PRs to update this module in the dependencies of hashicorpconsul so it can be updated cleanly there If no explicit advertiseAddr is specified and were bound to a wildcard address we dont want to advertise the wildcard address if its Instead of checking for use the Go stdlib to select for all possible wild card addresses
