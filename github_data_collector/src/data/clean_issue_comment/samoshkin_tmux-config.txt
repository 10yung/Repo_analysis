The new format for tmux has listed two incompatible changes as follow source INCOMPATIBLE tmuxs configuration parsing has changed to use yacc There is one incompatible change a on its own must be escaped or quoted as either or the latter works on older tmux versions INCOMPATIBLE Add a new syntax to the configuration file This is a string similar to single quotes but also includes newlines and allows commands that take other commands as string arguments to be expressed more clearly and without additional escaping So now and have to be escaped to and to maintain compatibility with tmux Im experimenting some errors with MacOS Catalina and latest Tmux tmuxconf syntax error that seems to be related with Unbind default key bindings were going to override unbind renamesession unbind renamewindow unbind splitwindow h unbind splitwindow unbind swappane D unbind swappane U unbind pastebuffer unbind unbind selectwindow Seems to be a problem with the lack of maybe I will try unbind in all special characters Then de next error is with the conditional statement if that may be because is now needed de ifshell If somebody has a guide on how to migrate this to Tmux will be very appreciated When copying buffer from remote you can also just save the selected buffer into a text file which you can just rsync or croc over to wherever you want it It seems that when I ssh into a server the status bar does not recognize this Switch to the copy mode Select text with the mouse symbols and characters appear next to the selected text Switch to the copy mode Press Space Select some text Press Enter symbols and characters appear at the command prompt OS RHEL tmuxcopymouseselect tmuxcopyspaceselectenter Well I think this change is needed so we can use the same key binding to go to the beggining of the line Change prefix key to Ca easier to type same to screen set g prefix Ca unbind Cb bindkey Ca sendprefix That would fix the option to move the cursor to the beginning of line just by doing Ca Ca As already some tmuxplugins are used tmuxyank might be a good option to be included instead of yanksh In my setup for example this has the advantage that tmuxyank supports integration for Windows clipboard clipexe when running in WSL After installing powerline patched fonts on OSX with iTerm I see the glyphs seem to be broken setw g windowstatuscurrentformat fgcolordarkbgcolormain separatorpowerlineright default IW fgcolormainbgcolordark separatorpowerlineright default I need to make the adjustment as shown below removing default to see the glyph arrows setw g windowstatuscurrentformat fgcolordarkbgcolormain separatorpowerlineright IW fgcolormainbgcolordark separatorpowerlineright default thoughts Hello thanks a lot for sharing your tmuxconf However I need some more precisions with regard to yank Id like to select text and copy it from remote session and paste it into my local session As I prefer keeping my own tmuxconf file I only grabbed the necessary part off your conf file So I have inserted in my local tmuxconf the following yanktmuxyanksh Copy selected text bind T copymodevi Enter sendkeys X copypipeandcancel yank bind T copymodevi y sendkeys X copypipeandcancel yank bind T copymodevi Y sendkeys X copyline run tmux savebuffer yank bindkey T copymodevi D sendkeys X copyendofline run tmux savebuffer yank bind T copymodevi Cj sendkeys X copypipeandcancel yank bindkey T copymodevi A sendkeys X appendselectionandcancel run tmux savebuffer yank Copy selection on drag end event but do not cancel copy mode and do not clear selection clear select on subsequence mouse click bind T copymodevi MouseDragEnd Pane sendkeys X copypipe yank bind T copymodevi MouseDown Pane selectpane sendkeys X clearselection Ive got several questions Do I need to copy yanksh on remote machine as well Do I need to insert the above extracted content to my remote tmuxconf as well Is set g copybackendremotetunnelport still necessary coming from tmuxremoteconf If so do I have to copy it onto the remote machine as well Thanks for your time Notes as a Mac user I have Enabled the plist file for listening on port Activated remoteforward localhost SSH Of couse I grabbed both files yanksh and tmuxremoteconf but dont know whether they must be copied on both machines or not I must mention that I have tmuxyank plugin installed on both machines Just in case I tested the following on remote session and it works date nc localhost What Id like to do instead is selecting text on remote press y key and the selected content jumps into my local clipboard
