Do we have any update plan for iPhone X with safe area layout guide FLKAutoLayout supported an interesting feature of Auto Layout that would let you create predicates that would not be applied due to too high of a priority this breaks all the nullability checks in alas and so is removed via runtime asserts Re Here is what I am using buttonalignTop leading FLKNoConstraint bottom FLKNoConstraint trailing toView selfview In previous version it works perfectly but in version it cause crash Currently the API is objc NSArray NSLayoutConstraint alignToViewidview This id isnt optimal With Swift we could do something like swift objc protocol FLKViewable var flkView UIView get extension UIView FLKViewable var flkView UIView return self extension UILayoutGuide FLKViewable var flkView UIView return selfrepresentedView extension FLKLayoutGuide FLKViewable var flkView UIView return selfflkview Then we could constrain the view to be a FLKViewable objc NSArray NSLayoutConstraint alignToViewNSObject FLKViewable view Ill save this one for a patch release and get out so this isnt blocking Im interested in the ramifications here diff CGFloat multiplier CGFloat multiplier It seems reasonable to think when FLKAutoLayout was written Auto Layout would accept a multiplier of in constraints but since then maybe since iOS The API does not allow using a as the multiplier which causes crashes in the example app and assumably in all of the app code I dont see any uses of distributeCenterXOfViews or the others in Eigen I expect because of this Can you think of a better way to do this andor do you think this would cause issues cc alloy if you want to have a think too this is part of the log pre translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints NSLayoutConstraint x fcb cac H UIView x fcb e a Bar view null NSLayoutConstraint x fcb c H UIView x fcb e a Bar view null Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInvalidArgumentException reason NSLayoutConstraint constraintWithItemattributerelatedBytoItemattributemultiplierconstant A multiplier of or a nil second item together with a location for the first attribute creates an illegal constraint of a location equal to a constant Location attributes must be specified in pairs pre Hi I have just installed FLKAutoLayout It looks powerful But when I run example layout not always look same Here is how example looks after run in simulator Also when switch orientation space between left and right view views with dark grey colour as background has random width Here is one screenshot screenshot Apply the categories on NSView instead of UIView on OS X
