We will try a full migration to codebergorg on th December in three days Technically GitHub has been a mirror for quite some while for wiki and repository but the main interaction happened still here since Issues and PRs were hard to migrate lockin effect So What will happen on GitHub repo will be archived to prevent creation of new issuesPRs We will try a full migration to a private repo on codeberg and see if everything worked On success we will make the new codeberg repo public and announce the move in READMEmd on failure we will unarchive the GitHub and try some weeks later Before

them and often shows the message that is the title of this issue before actually showing the charts without any other problem than the mentioned slowness New issues about already solveddocumented topics could be closed without further comments Same for too generic or incomplete reports Please add support for Keep Fit tracker The only Dokumentation I found so far is this As many of the supported watches offer an calorieconsumptiontracker it would be very useful if this information is viewable similar to the puls steps and sleep panel Thanks anyway from a very happy amazfit gts user

problem an answer to my question x If you upload an image or other content please make sure you have read and understood the github policies and terms of services Your issue is If applicable please attach logs I would like to be able to send a notification directly to the device bypassing android notifications as can be done from the Debug view with the SEND button However I want to do this via an intent from Termux Tasker or the adb shell It seems like the functionality is there embedded in the Debug view but I dont know how to go about exposing it as an external intent Im not sure if these notifications are generic within Android or if Gadgetbridge is having to do something specific to talk to the device Your wearable device is Amazfit BIP but generic functionality would be better Your

Blacklist mode using Whitelist all notificaitons option not working properly if using work profile Shelter utility from FDroid that isolates applications into a separate work profile more on this here For example Ive installed a mail application on my work profile and Gadgetbridge on my main profile I dont want notifications from the mail app appear on my device eg Mi Band so I want to disable them But due to the mail app being on a separate profile Gadgetbridge cant find it and doesnt show it in the list So there is literally no way for me to disable the notifications for the mail app except move Gadgetbridge itself to work profile or vice versa Your solution is Implement Switch to Whitelist mode and if already in whitelist mode change the button to Switch to Blacklist so only checked applications can send notifications in my case its just Telegram and Mastodon It can be another option in the Notifications blacklist options menu or just checkbox in settings Whitelist mode is pretty similar to MiFit one Your wearable device is Mi Band Your android version is Nougat LineageOS hammerhead Your Gadgetbridge version is FDroid Before reporting a bug please confirm the following x I

Your issue is Regular Telegram notifications are sent and displayed in mi Mi Band however secret chat notification are not Notifications for secret chat are functioning in Android Your wearable device is Mi Band HW V FW Your android version is Android LOS Your Gadgetbridge version is Extra info I believe that I had the same issue with Mi Band and telegram secret chats Only recently I started using secret chats more often so thats probably the reason I didnt really notice before So I guess its not a recent issue Also found a similar mention of it here Perhaps this is by design perhaps its better to not display secret chat directly on the wearable but it would be nice to have some form of notification A general notification or a notification that a secret chat has arrived would be great
