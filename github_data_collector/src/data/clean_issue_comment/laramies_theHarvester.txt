This is still a WIP Hello Im facing this issue where the internet wont let me connect I have had this issue from the moment i started using the Harvester I am in China currently and Im using shadow socks proxy so my question is does it have anything to do with it either ways please post a solution Thanks in advance A simple reverse DNS lookup Can be called with the n option Note The mainpy hasnt been modified IE the functionality is here but the results are not added to the report As is mainpy only prints the results l Feature Request or Bug or Other Other Describe the feature request or bug or other Add the documentation to the README on how to configure the API keys To Reproduce NA Expected behaviour Docs on how to configure in the README and not relying on the closed tickets Screenshots NA System Information System that tool is running on NA Additional context Information is in Feature Request or Bug or Other Feature Request Describe the feature request or bug or other It looks like reverse DNS is proposed in the CLI mainpy but not actually implemented To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behaviour Run python theHarvesterpy d n See error module theHarvesterdiscoverydnssearch has no attribute DnsReverse Expected behaviour Id guess DnsReverse would check the IPs in the neighboorhood of all the discovered hosts And then check whether theres a domain registered for every tested IP Screenshots NA System Information System that tool is running on NA Additional context NA Hello there great work Your project bumped me so much ahead of my little scraping D Apart from the functionnalities I have a few thoughts on coding style Its on the annoying side of coding since it wouldnt add features but it may make things easier in the future Feature Request or Bug or Other Other Describe the feature request or bug or other Code snippets are duplicated with hard to spot adjustments It makes the code bigger harder to read and harder to test since theres no central point for each feature mainpy is especially big and convoluted To Reproduce Read mainpy D Expected behaviour One function method script per feature argument parsing logging console file exporting html xml etc mainpy just controling calling the processing modules Screenshots NA System Information System that tool is running on NA Additional context It would make debugging testing profiling way easier no Hi I got an error Google is blocking your ip and the workaround returning Searching results Google is blocking your ip and the workaround returning Searching results Google is blocking your ip and the workaround returning Searching results Google is blocking your ip and the workaround returning Searching results Google is blocking your ip and the workaround returning Searching results No links found Feature Request or Bug or Other Other Describe the feature request or bug or other Enforce checkstyle using customized variation of pylint or pychecker As part of this we should enforce DocString for every method added As an aside we can revisit all the existing DocStrings and convert them to Google or Numpy format Recommended here and here To Reproduce NA Expected behavior Errors when checkstyle fails eg no DocString is added for a new method Screenshots NA System Information System that tool is running on NA Additional context NA Some of the dorks are not that helpful and coul be replaced with more useful stuff Some modules and functions throughout the code base have little to no docstring this should change
