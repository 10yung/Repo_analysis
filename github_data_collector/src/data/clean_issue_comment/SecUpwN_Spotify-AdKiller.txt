Just figured out SpotifyAdBlocker wouldnt work as in not blocking ads whenever I install Spotify using the snap package There is no mention of this in the README file and can help some users Hello days ago i have reinstall my Kali Linux to make a dual boot with Windows Today i tried AdKiller because im bored of YouTube i used these command sudo aptget install x utils pulseaudioutils libnotifybin xdotool vlc cd Documents git clone cd SpotifyAdKiller chmod x installsh installsh Then i have install Spotify i dont know if i can remember this but when i start spotify by the command line spotify the name of the app is Spotify Free but im not sure before it was just Spotify EDIT im on Kali Of course now i have advert Using spotify version gf d on ubuntu LTS Continuous mode works as intended though On simple when the ad gets played spotify mutes but it looks like the ad gets skipped because I just see my songs progress bar I can move it skip to next song or just wait but it never unmutes until I restartand sometimes even persists through restarts Created uninstall on readme Even though it is straightforward the readme is a bit more complete As per my thought This adds a new CUSTOMMODE option restart as well as a config file option RESTARTMINIMIZED Why the fuck is it playing Minecraft sounds when its muting the ads The dnsblock branch now completely breaks recent versions of Spotify Lots of pages are now blank and music playing is broken I dont know if there is still interest in making it work but when I get some time Ill experiment with the blacklists There are way of to run Adkiller with snap or flatpak packages
