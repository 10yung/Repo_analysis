Osgood doesnt respond properly to Nginx or any other load balancer I tested so far like and Osgood servers return the following error when invoked this way route not found GET hello It appears to want to include the origin port of the proxy in the search for a valid script to run for some reason Osgood returns Hello World fine when invoked directly its just not working through load balancing where as all other servers return to the reverse proxy as expected eg python m SimpleHTTPServer The error message is from this line Im not a rust programmer but it looks like further up the program the origin is worked out from the combined header hyperheaderHost which always includes the extra port if present Perhaps something like hyperheaderOriginhost is meant OR even hyperheaderHosthostname to gather just the IP If it helps anyone the workaroundhack I have in place for nginx is to set the upstream name to localhost so it gets through the origin check in osgood no port supplied etcnginxsitesavailabledefault server location proxypass upstream localhost server localhost server localhost ps thank you for giving us securable v isolates Hi The osgood project looks really cool I especially like your api and build script for building v Is there any chance you would consider publishing osgoodv as a crate so that your v bindings could be used in other projects
