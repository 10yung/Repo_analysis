 does not resolve screen shot at looky here i tried it and it worked xvim installed and is working and alcatraz was built and installed the problem is that i cannot install plugins i get an error while compiling or something im sure some of you guys can figure this out since you probably know more than me about how to integrate alcatraz As discussed in plugins using git submodules need to run git submodule update after a fetch to update their dependencies to the right commit git submodule update Update the registered submodules to match what the superproject expects by cloning missing submodules and updating the working tree of the submodules This is also related to which fixed the initial clone for plugins using submodules Changes Add option recursesubmodulesondemand to the fetch command to recursively fetch submodules commits Add command git submodule update after successful git fetch and git reset hard to make the submodules checkout the right commits Note Not a big fan of the pyramidcallbacksstyle in ATZGit updateLocalProjectrevisioncompletion if you have a better idea Ill take it As discussed in we didnt handle errors very well in ATZDownloader My intuition is that were not handling network errors well So you probably had an error when Alcatraz downloaded the gif which is quite large and we cached it anyway This PR fixes that and should somewhat improve performances see below Check for the error parameter in URLSessiontaskdidCompleteWithError to handle client side errors Check for the HTTP response status code and return an NSError for any code other than Replace NSURLSessionDownloadTask with NSURLSessionDataTask so the downloaded files are never written to disk since we always loaded them in memory anyway Remove strong references to callbacks after task completion Hi I found some memory leak issues by Instruments static analyzer Hope it helps All inputs are accepted and fetching the package list from an invalid URL does nothing No error is displayed nothing is logged Related to Some plugins fail to install properly SublimeShortcutsObjC for example because the xcodebuild install command fails They are still reported as installed because in the build process the PluginNamexcplugin folder is created in LibraryApplication SupportDeveloperSharedXcodePlugins and thats all we are checking to determine if a plugin is installed We should use NSTask terminationStatus to ensure the build exited with a error code Today we only display a blank view without any info Inspired by We should probably show the repo URL if its not the default one and no package was loaded Inspiration It may not need to display the stars number as issue mentioned But I think adding a button to quickly star a plugin can encourage the developer Hello Im an author and maintainer of a couple few Xcode plugins notably Better Console Cedar Shortcuts and Better Refactor Tools A few people have asked me to make these installable via Alcatraz and I was pretty excited to do this Unfortunately I learned that my plugins arent installable because they have dependencies that I track via git submodules I took a look at a few other plugins and it looks like none of them link against frameworks so maybe Im unique in having this problem I believe that my plugins could be installed by Alcatraz if the following changed issue the git submodule update init recursive command after cloning a repo for projects with submodules these need to be updated before building xcode clean build should be able to take in the scheme name since build settings such as FRAMEWORKSEARCHPATHS are stored on the scheme rather than the target any plugin that wants to link against a framework or have other build settings will need to specify the scheme Would a PR adding the optional usessubmodules and schemename flag to the package JSON format along with some changes to the ATZPluginInstaller class to support this be well received I havent dug into the code too deeply perhaps theres a better place where this behavior could be implemented Also Im a strong believer in TDD Are there tests for the Alcatraz plugin that I can refer to Id love to be able to contribute tests for these changes
