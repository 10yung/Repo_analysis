Hi Please help me solve the problem I use HelixToolkitWpfSharpDX There are two semitransparent surfaces on the scene one over another The OrthographicCamera is used In the Viewport DX window a color spot is displayed on the surfaces What is the color spot As I understand this spot is related to the camera target point How is it possible to remove the spot The source code for this case is here Thanks in advance Hi when I compile your FileLoadDemoexample sharpdxwpf and copy the bindebug folder to my targetpc this example does not start No message Soloution was to copy the packages AssimpNet runtimes winx native assimpdll into this folder On my development pc this DLL will be found in the GAC I think this is an error Thanks Gregor I have an issue with updating the Helix DViewport in WPF I am trying to update the robot position through iterations but i dont know how to update it before the loop finishes As it is right now robot moves teleports to the last position after the function that called it finishes But i would like it to be updated each iteration each iteration it moves by small fraction Grid GridColumn BackgroundLightGray HelixToolkitHelixViewport D ZoomExtentsWhenLoadedTrue Margin NameHelixToolkitViewport RenderTransformOrigin HelixToolkitDefaultLights ModelVisual D ContentBinding RobotModel HelixToolkitHelixViewport D Grid for int i i i RobotJointAngles PointToDoublemovedPoint RobotUR MoveByJointRobotJointAngles RobotUR UpdateRobotModel SystemThreadingThreadSleep I dont know how or where to access the update of the viewport any help would be welcome ty Attach a screen capture of my app jaggy Jaggy is occurring where shadows and objects overlap I want to know how to get rid of this jaggy I found the following web page From the above contents I think that it can be solved by using delayed rendering and modifying the SampleDescription of DPFCanvascs But now latest HelixToolkitWpfSharpDXv SampleDescription of DPFCanvascs does not exist And RenderTechniquesManager or RenderTechnique also do not exist I do not know how to specify the rendering equivalent to How to specify in the latest versionv Hi I have a problem with export metadata I updated FileLoadDemo example My function private void CreateMetadataHelixToolkitScene scene bool WithRootMd var root sceneRoot int i foreach var node in rootTraverse if WithRootMd node root continue Metadata if node is GroupNode gn gnMetadata new Metadata var hmStr new MetadataEntryMetaDataTypeString Md iToString gnMetadataAddNamestring hmStr It called from OpenFile foreachvar n in sceneRootTraverse nTag new AttachedNodeViewModeln CreateMetadatascene true here then after pressing Export to assbinformat I see property md for all nodes if CreateMetadatascene true or see nothing for CreateMetadatascene false zip Is it possible build something like terrain surface in SharpDX project Such example is present in WPF branch but absent in SharpDX Im trying to import a FBX model created with DS Max The model is imported in the viewport exploded By looking around it appears that the problem was already reported on Assimp but it should have been solved Do you know how to solve it May it be an importation configuration Capture Hello everyone I want to share the rendered scene over the internet For that I want to use WebRTC Dont worry too much about the WebRTC part because that is mostly working The WebRTC pipline expects a SharpDXDirect D Texture D which then gets encoded on the GPU and send to the remote peer I am completely new to WPF Dhelixtoolkit so please be patient with me The following code is not writte by me but by a colleague The application is a Viewer to look at various image formats Here is the Code how the image is loaded public async Task LoadRect area double scale CancellationToken ct int zLayer if isLoaded return var model new MeshNode var meshBuilder new MeshBuildertrue true false meshBuilderAddBoxnew Rect D bitmapFramePixelWidth bitmapFramePixelHeight BoxFacesPositiveZ MeshGeometry D geometry meshBuilderToMeshGeometry D modelGeometry geometry modelMaterial new PhongMaterialCore DiffuseAlphaMap bitmapFrameAsMemoryStreamFileExtension png SpecularColor ColorBlack DiffuseMap bitmapFrameAsMemoryStreamFileExtension png ModelGroupAddNodemodel isLoaded true And is then rendered like this hxElement DPresenter xNameMainContent ContentBinding ImageDataProviderModelGroup IsHitTestVisibleFalse I went through the classes and was looking for a place where I could catch a Texture D right before or after it is rendered But without success This is the function I would call to send a videoframe to the encoder Where the IntPtr is the nativePointer of Texture D public void SendVideoFrameIntPtr rgbaPixels int stride int width int height VideoFrameFormat videoFrameFormat In this example I use windows DesktopDuplicationApi to capture my desktop And send it to the WebRTC pipeline while IsRunning Try to get duplicated frame within given time is ms var res duplicatedOutputTryAcquireNextFrameoptionsTimeOut out var frameInfo out var screenResource if resSuccess if frameInfoAccumulatedFrames duplicatedOutputReleaseFrame continue using var screenTexture D screenResourceQueryInterfaceTexture D videoTrackSendVideoFramescreenTexture DNativePointer screenTexture DDescriptionWidth screenTexture DDescriptionHeight WebRtcVideoFrameFormatGpuTextureD D screenResourceDispose So my question is Is it possible to catch the currently rendered frame or about to be rendered frame and can that be used as Texture D Otherwise is it possible to convert a MeshNode into a Texture D Please keep in mind that I am developing a low latency application so performance is very important I dont want unnecessary copies between RAM and GPU memory Please let me know if you need more information about my problem I will respond asap Thank you How does one update rendering upon geometry colormaterial change In an older version of Helix we used to detach and reattach the GeometryModel D objects like so var geom GeometryModel Dobj if geomIsAttached var host geomRenderHost geomDetach geomAttachhost I understand that this was probably not the best way to do it performancewise but any suggestion on the recommended way to do so in the newer versions of Helix would be helpful holance Hello guys I am reading the docs and I would like to create a rectangle from the mouse selection on a plane only does anyone happen to have an example or similar I saw this class but not really sure how to use it
