Could you add a button that hides unlucked achievements or at least an option to sort it by unlock status Its pretty hard to search for achievements in games that have hundreds of them I have Steam installed on systems Windows Ubuntu LTS I used SAM to set achievements of a game say Fallout Shelter in my Windows machine But those changes arent reflected in the Steam client installed on my Ubuntu machine Any idea whyhow to make them sync It would be useful if we could set delays or specific times for unlocks for example you have those achievement with unlock per second spam games that frequently bug out and need to be restarted multiple times before unlocking everything SAM could be used to delay unlocks at per second instead of unlocking all at same time there are repetitive games with multiple kill n enemies where n could be and SAM could be set to unlock kill enemies at kill enemies at kill enemies at etc The second example would be the most useful since an user could easily get times from other websites set up SAM and do more interesting stuff like watching a movie playing other games or sleeping I am using wine version Activate next release game Button to Install dont show Run SAM Find appgame ID Try open Hello I have been using SAM But a few hours ago I found this program isnt working Actually the program works but game lists dont appear but only a black screen appears SAM I did these things to solve this Rebooting my computer Checking firewall accessSAM and steam Reinstall Steam and SAM Just waiting Could you please provide a solution to this problem Thank you and have a nice day Is there a way to run these apps on mac os This would be very useful Also if there is a chance that a Mac version is coming out when would that occur Is it doing some fancy magic with hex editing and some trickery to unlock these achievements or is it sending the steam servers the same instructions the game would normally Basically asking if its safe to use or im at some risk of getting banned Because if this just fakes being in a game and then sends the same instructions to the steam servers the actual game would then its fine and i wont get banned On the other hand if you found a way to circumvent steams achievement system to unlock these then thats risky I know im on github and that i could check but i dont know what the commands inside the files mean I understand their logic i just dont know any of the functions of the commands so im asking instead of checking Sorry To reduce code footprint
