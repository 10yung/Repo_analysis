Hello I am trying to run your PANDA code on my data however I have problem to download poslet detection code as well as data set provided on GitHub page for this source code I was wondering if you have any suggestion for me to deal with this problem Thanks helllow How to run this code Kindly provide me mannual Thank you for putting the code up I noticed that initm adds several directories to the path including detector and detectorposeletdetection However it doesnt seem like there are any such directories in the repo Maybe this is just an outdated path that has been fixed in later work However also createtrainingdirectorym calls function generateposelethits I get an undefined function fault at that point It has a similar name to generateposelethitsandpatches and seems to take the same few arguments a data object a model and a config object so I made that simple substitution But that causes a halt on line since generateposelethitsandpatches expects data to have a phits property Did I make a mistake and generateposelethits is not interchangeable with generateposelethitsandpatches Is the former in the directories that appear to be missing Sorry if these questions are very simple Im only just beginning with this type of work so I might have just overlooked something obvious Thanks for putting the code up on Github I was trying to reproduce the result but got an error from geticcvdatam that trainvaltesttxt is not found I downloaded the dataset from Is that file generated from another function or should I download the dataset from another link Thank you again
