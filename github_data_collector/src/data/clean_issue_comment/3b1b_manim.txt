By changing the preamble in textemplatetex one may use different fonts for the animations both for text and math formulas However some of the most interesting math fonts are only available in otf ttf which is usually related with a xelatex engine Is it possible right now to use these fonts in Manim Which is the easiest integration Thanks in advance Is there a way to draw geometry diagrams in Manim I have the asymptote code for it Thanks in advance Im making an video in manim where I show two ovwwrlaping shapes and I want to set one of the regions to be on the front how can I do that Matplotlib has a very nice method to define in which layer objects are shown on the screen with a parameter zorder When working with manim its sometimes a little tricky to get the layers right so what about an implementation where you can write py dDot selfaddd zordner Furthermore there could be defaults like Dots at the first layer Text Equations at the second layer Shapes on the third layer Functions and graphs on the fourth layer Upon installing the software through Brian Howells tutorial I ran the following code on Terminal to test run manim python m manim examplescenespy SquareToCircle pl but the Terminal on my Mac gives the following response Documentsmanimvenvbinpython No module named manimmain manim is a package and cannot be directly executed Im terribly unfamiliar with coding so would really appreciate help on this one x The file containing dependencies is requirementstxt with the missing s inserted The rotation happens in a clockwise direction because the sign of the argument is negative I found it confusing and had to check the video to make sure the square was rotating clockwise So I thought to send a change Thanks for contributing to manim Please ensure that your pull request works with the latest version of manim You should also include The motivation for making this change or link the relevant issues How you tested the new behavior eg a minimal working example beforeafter screenshots gifs commands etc This is rather informal at the moment but the goal is to show us how you know the pull request works as intended When working with relatively large images in manim on my Mac a BrokenPipeError occurs when FFmpeg tries to write to filewriter after stdin is closed The error shows up at seemingly random times even with the same input For instance the output below shows that the error occurs at different locations with the exact same input img width altScreenshot src img width altScreenshot src img width altScreenshot src With my commit everything works fine even when a BrokenPipeError is raised This can be shown by printing the exceptions that occur at the end of the run and showing that all the animations still play In the figure below it printed Errno Broken pipe once however that error now does not damage the video Notes If this error never occurred on some peoples machines this commit will not change anything since it is simply catching the exception when an error is caused Using wait is mostly an arbitrary decision and seems to work well If sleep is not called after wait some animations do not show up on the screen The changes in this commit do not print all the Errno Broken pipe exceptions that occur which was done in the final figure This error also corresponds to the issue Is there any way to add custom D obj files to a scene I know that D plots and a few primitive shapes can be added but have not seen any way to add custom D objects Thanks
