 In perspectivepy from scipyspatial import distance as dist D distcdisttl npnewaxis rightMost euclidean You ought to be able to do this without importing SciPy something like D nplinalgnormrightMost tl ord axis Hi I tried to upgrade imutils with the following command pip install upgrade imutils But this message appear ERROR Cannot uninstall imutils It is a distutils installed project and thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which would lead to only a partial uninstall how can I fix this Thanks I am following your instructions at its great for me But I have problems when I try to edit my code according to your instructions Its vs FileVideoStreamargs input start timesleep while vsmore the error is AttributeError function object has no attribute more I get filevideostreampy from this Please help me thank you someone just showed up freenodes opencv with this Im on arch linux and ive got an error running a python script here that imports imutils Heres the error when I run python filepy Heres the error when I run python filepy Ive then installed pythonimutils git files from arch wiki found here and I was hoping this installs the module so its available when I run python filepy This is the makepkg build of pythonimutils and this is the makepkg build of python imutils At this point im still getting the very first error Why might python still not recognize the imutils module What else do I need to consider here I would like to print out the current values to the console Because I want specific value for HSV in OpenCV I need to change the range for H from to When the WebcamVideoStream class is stopped the underlying cv VideoCapture class isnt released properly when starting the WebcamVideoStream class no frames are returned By adding the selfstreamrelease the cv VideoCapture class is released and the stated error is fixed Hello jrosebr I want to say thank you so much because I have learned a lot in pyimagsearch pyimagesearchcom However I am currently resizing an image to a specific dimensions width x height and I would like to discuss why in your imutilsresize you dont accept both sizes I remember that you said in one of your books and also here in the README that special care needs to be taken to ensure that the aspect ratio is maintained However I would like to resize to a specific resolution lets say x and I will care of the ratio and resize the image and after that I crop the image in the center with the size required I will continue maintaining the ratio python def getresizeimageimage width height h w imageshape calculate the ratio of the original image R w h calculate the ratio of the new dimensions r width height cropping starting points startw starth check if the original ratio is greate than the new one and resize the image from that new sizes if R r get the new width with the correct ratio neww height w h find the center of the new width startw intneww width resize the image resized cv resizeimage intneww height interpolationcv INTERAREA else get the new height with the correct ratio neww width h w find the center of the new height starth intnewh height resize the image resized cv resizeimage width intnewh interpolationcv INTERAREA crop the image to the sizes required return resized starthstarth height startwstartw width Exception in thread Thread Traceback most recent call last File usrlibpython distpackagespicameracamerapy line in capturecontinuous Timed out waiting for capture to end picameraexcPiCameraRuntimeError Timed out waiting for capture to end During handling of the above exception another exception occurred Traceback most recent call last File usrlibpython threadingpy line in bootstrapinner selfrun File usrlibpython threadingpy line in run selftargetselfargs selfkwargs File usrlocallibpython distpackagesimutilsvideopivideostreampy line in update for f in selfstream File usrlibpython distpackagespicameracamerapy line in capturecontinuous encoderclose File usrlibpython distpackagespicameraencoderspy line in close selfstop File usrlibpython distpackagespicameraencoderspy line in stop selfcloseoutput File usrlibpython distpackagespicameraencoderspy line in closeoutput moclosestreamoutput opened File usrlibpython distpackagespicamerammalobjpy line in closestream streamflush File usrlibpython distpackagespicameraarraypy line in flush selfarray bytestorgbselfgetvalue selfsize or selfcameraresolution File usrlibpython distpackagespicameraarraypy line in bytestorgb Incorrect buffer length for resolution dxd width height picameraexcPiCameraValueError Incorrect buffer length for resolution x
