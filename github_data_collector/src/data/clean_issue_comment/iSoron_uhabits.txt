Im loving the app so far so thank you to everyone who has contributed to its success Please correct me if Im wrong but I dont see any visualizations that track whether you have completed all of your habits for a particular day For example this photo shows how Productive has a calendar view with green circles filled in to show full completion along with some aggregate stats I apologize if there is an issue for this already I scanned the existing issues and did a search for previous issues but I didnt see this idea specifically This was the closest relevant issue I could find Ive never worked on an Android app before but Id be happy to learn and help build this into your app if you think its a good idea and feasible Id also be willing to work closely with a designer to figure out the UIUX and pair program with an Android developer to build it out Spaced repetition learning is based on the idea that the forgetting curve is exponential To reinforce long term memory formation or habit forming a review repetition of increasing intervals is proven helpful Spaced repetition intervals seem to vary as I read from different papers but all are somewhat similar to that of the Fibonacci sequence A custom repeat in Fib seq would be as follows initialization hr hours from initialization hr hr hr hr hr hr hr approximately month Spaced repetition theory described Thank you to the developers of this great project Its so useful for me I looked at the screenshots of the IOS close of this app mentioned in the issue and there was one thing that caught my eye that we could use in Loop as well that could improve the usability Im talking about the big tiles in the history see attached screenshot My suggestion is to increase the size of the tiles of the calendar card in a similar fashion With that change in place we could also think about the possibility of making the execution dates editable from within the habit itself x w I think it would be great to enable the user to sort the widgets in the habit details view That would make problems like the following obsolete I think the best place to show it is as a new card in the ShowHabitActivity either directly below the current SubtitleCard or after the OverviewCard Originally posted by iSoron in It would also enable the user to sort the information according to his preferences For some the calendar is more important than the Score graph Some others might want to see the Best streaks or the history immediately Resolves and resolves Changes added question column to Habit table This is a nullable text column similar to description added migration from db What this does is copy our old description to the question column and set the description column to null Refactor edithabitname layout to a constraint layout added dependency Related to this is updating NameDescriptionPanel the view class that uses edithabitname to include the notes input I think most everything else is just updating code across the app to refer to the question field instead of description Follow up questionscomments for iSoron wherehow do you actually want this new field to be shown Right now importing from various importers takes their description field and puts it into uhabits question field since I just replaced the name Maybe that doesnt make sense anymore and it should go into the new notesdescription field I ignored one test Its failing when trying migrate to because of the findAll method I think the method findAll should be refactored The reason the test is failing is because findAll queries all columns on the HabitRecord class even though version didnt have that column Maybe Im over thinking things here Let me know if that makes sense The failure reported by the unit test shouldnt actually happen in prod I might be wrong but I recall that notifications when in large number were combined together in the top bar in Android and were visible as one icon there When swiped down I had to expand the Habits category to see them all which was much better than notification at pm to scroll However it no longer happens after an upgrade to There is one other icon at the first place habits icons next and a small dot informing that there is no many icons to be displayed I wonder if it could be related to and if it can be brought back by some settings changes I havent found any Having the dark theme enabled I was surprised to open the settings page and be glared by the while background there Its not a big issue but it the back theme could be used consistently on Android Phone Samsung Galaxy S Android Beta App Version Scenario two or more notifications present click the Yes option and notice all notifications are dismissed at once The habit that I clicked Yes on goes through but the rest are not marked What should happen only the notification that I click Yes or No should disappear when I try to create a new habit its name changes to a random habit I already created this mostly happens when I try to rearrange my new habit hi first thank you for this great app I noticed that i still get reminders for archived habits is this normal Thank you
