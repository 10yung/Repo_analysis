I am developer who has Linux But want to build for iOS apps How could I use Mainframer to build for iOS from my local machine Hey so Im setting up the x version of mainframer and notice that the ignoreyml is not respected by mainframer Looking further I noticed that Ignorefromworkingdir uses three different files unlike what is specified in the Readme Although I can go in myself and modify the changes is this the approach the tool will take henceforth Is there a board scope of work for x that I could possibly help out with as well Thanks mainframer is really long thing to type coworkers of mine usually alias it to m I think mf can be a good option in the middle similarly to how ripgrep is rg ming wdyt We can run rsync in dryrun mode and then run rsync in parallel against resulting filesdirs might end up being faster Just an idea The instructions indicate that I can install mainframer from Brew However the tap looks like its a private repo brew tap buildfoundationhomebrewtap Tapping buildfoundationtap Cloning into usrlocalHomebrewLibraryTapsbuildfoundationhomebrewtap fatal Authentication failed for Error Failure while executing git clone usrlocalHomebrewLibraryTapsbuildfoundationhomebrewtap depth exited with Not really an Issue but Xcode builds are slow this would be amazing for Xcode Thanks enhancement buildfoundationmainframerlabelsenhancement l When hitting Control C it is not correctly propagated to the remote machine While the build stops locally the processes are still running on the remote machine Context heh arturdryomov asked if we should rewrite Mainfraimer in Swift I said it brings giant runtime and indeed as we checked with kastiglione a simple Swift CLI binary is MB and after strip Mainframer Rust release build is around K K after strip Right now we fully rely on sshconfig implicitly processed by ssh and the fact that default port is adding it on our config level will allow projectspecific overrides as part of Right now we rely on sshconfig implicitly processed by ssh adding it on our config level will allow projectspecific overrides Right now its also possible to set user as part of remotemachine like that usercomputer which is fine I guess but should be separate for better projectlevel override support as part of
