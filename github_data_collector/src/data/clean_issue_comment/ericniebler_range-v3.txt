stdsizet b a error no known conversion from rangesdetaildiffmaxt to stdsizet I am passing a fairly complex composition of ranges to hpxreduce where stdsizet is used all over the place Ive requested a DR against the CD saying Because it has to compute its begin it can never model sizedrange due to not meeting its nonamortized O requirement Please may I request that actionsjoin accepts an optional separator argument like viewsjoin does Or is this not possible due to it being ambiguous with a rangeofranges to be joined using nonpipe syntax Either way thanks very much This will also be the content of P R I may have missed some but Im pretty sure these are all safe code cpp stdvectorstdstring stringsaaa bbb ccc auto const stra strings rangesviewsjoin rangestostdstring auto const strb strings rangesviewsjoinrangesviewscstr rangestostdstring stdcout stra stra size strasize stdendl stdcout strb strb size strbsize stdendl prints stra aaabbbccc size strb aaabbbccc size The former line embeds null character after every delimiters because of the lack of rangesviewscstr I could assume that this output is pretty much the expected behavior since the string is actually a range of characters when used in the context of ranges However this could become a pitfall when ones using this library to format strings and I believe that it is quite common usecase The mistaken result is easy to produce and hard to debug since null characters are never printed to terminal To solve this we could either Mark some overloads of viewsjoin deleted for disambiguation or Show some kind of warnings to prevent faulty string concatenation Suppose I have an stdvector of some elements and Id like to have an infinite range of those elements repeated n times repeating What I use is const stdvectorint original const auto n auto rng original viewstransform n const auto e return viewsrepeatne n viewscycle viewsjoin Effectively I end up with Simple we change every one of originals elements into a range of that element reapeating n times and we end up with a range of those ranges Then we cycle them to have an infinite range of those ranges and then we join Why however if I change the order of viewscycle and viewsjoin the code fails to compile Why do I have to first have an infinite range of ranges to join it and I cannot cycle a simple range of elements Im aware Intels C compiler is not on the white list but I attach the error log for a simple example program for future reference and development Im using icpc ICC and prepared to perform further tests Example program
