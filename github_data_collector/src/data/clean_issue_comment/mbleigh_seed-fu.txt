Here I setup TravisCI I believe we need to have CI so that we can detect regression earlier For now we depend on Rails on tests I know its not enough but as a start it should be good Hi This patches will do RSpec transition from to Make compatible with Rails This patch will close Cheers When I tried building and testing this with following bundle install path vendorbundle bundle exec rake spec Following error is occured rake aborted NoMethodError undefined method lastcomment for RakeApplication x b ccc f tmpseedfuvendorbundleruby gemsrspeccore librspeccoreraketaskrb in initialize

working if filter regexp triggered by element of the project path Im trying to create a dev environment for an existing project Im working on this project for the first time and Im new to this gem When I run rake dbseedfu it gets to a certain point and then I start getting timeout errors Is there a way to change the default timeout setting So typically when passing a block to Fileopen the IO object with automatically close when the block terminates However we have notice when attempting to write fixtures for largish database dumps that the IO stream is closing before the last few strings are written I believe the cause of this is here Basically the ensure is killing the the stream before the last chunks have been written to the file by niling it I am not sure this solution is the best but it solved our issue I might take a stab at refactoring this code later Tests failing with rails Please enable support for rails Using sqlite to run the tests createtableseededmodels forcetrue s
