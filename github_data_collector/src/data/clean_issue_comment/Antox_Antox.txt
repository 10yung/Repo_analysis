Hi there I faced something really strange My friend sent me an image which was a hill roota plant in RIMWORLD game then I just opened it Though being only an image it deleted all my chats and contacts As a result I closed the application and I didnt use it for a rather longabout a week Surprisingly my application was in a good condition again Could anyone please tell what was that mysterious hill root image Thank you very much PS You can see that image here IMG Due to the rapid increment of mobile phone hardware performance The data loading speed is get faster and faster So the time for startup logo screen to appear would be extremely short The resolution of current logo screen is a little bit low It would be influence the user experience I would like to recommend that it would be awesome to remove this logo screen Or if it is very important to show the logo I would be also awesome to show a SVG simple logo which is same as the App entry icon with pure color background I got the below mentioned error while updating targetSdk to error target API level is out of range Hi I am developing an Android chat application for my college project So i I am implemented your library little bit confusion in videoclarity and voiceclarity calling cant load proper live video and voice clarity is very poor Hello I have noticed that Antox doesnt have a way to verify contacts Would you be able to add that in some form please Signal Private Messenger calls it a Safety Number Wire calls it a Key Fingerprint because Wire can be used on more than one device at a time with the same profileaccount although Wire has some problems too or undesirable features Verifying a conversation ensures that theres no man in the middle and that the messages are really EndtoEnd Encrypted Thank you when importing the project the gradle unable to download the comgithubjoshjdevllibsodiumjnilibsodiumjniaar snapshot It would be nice to have a way that a bot can send a clickable command that is then send back to the bot for example if the text contains start that that then is clickable and sends start back to the other party Trying to send a file from qTox to Antox but when the file is being opened through Antox the app crashes and asks to either close the app or to send feedback The file looks as if it gets transferred properly although Im unsure where the received files are located so I can not verify if it does Comments My tox id is AB C E F A C C D CBA C AD E C ACBD E I lost my tox account the app wasnt behaving well I was trying to open it up but it was closing itself I was trying really hard I also sent a feed back to company or maybe more than Many but who cares I really disappointed to this app Even before that I could not able to open my photos which I received from my other friends I lost my really best friend best friend I ever had or maybe first friend yeah leave that I have no other option to contact my friend so its really bad After this all mess I uninstalled the app and downloaded again but now I require new ID I was really pissed off I lost my first account and then I made one more on another device and also on my device too Unfortunately I have my old or lost account little info like tox id AB C E F A C C D CBA C AD E C ACBD E Profile name was Davextoner and name was username I couldnt get time to save my profile or import it so I just lost that
