Preamble This issue is not a bug report or a technical query but rather a generic question to the maintainers and contributors of this repository I hope it will be in accord your contributing guidelines nevertheless While testing this script I spent some time trying to configure the shade settings before finally realizing that it couldnt work as is Indeed I had downloaded the last available release June while this feature has been developed subsequently July I wonder why no maintainer has created a new release in order to incorporate these significant new features added in the README after the version And if no new release is planned for whatever reason I think it might be convenient to indicate in the README file that it is better to download files from the current master branch to use certain features I if use this example image Got as dominant color rgb I want specifically detect if the dominant color is white and this image does not Yet I am getting this image as a valid one when is not I used the basesinglehtml from demo folder How this can be solved Hi The version has no dist folder As was asked here can you build you lib and add to version in order to provide better hosting on cdnjs Thanks The current version has some serious performance issues I created a jsfiddle to demonstrate the problem After page load the whole page is blocked for more than sec Here is the developer tools performance report Profile T zip adaptive The current implementation will ignore optsparent option when using the dataabcssbackground feature This behaviour is as per design and explicitly stated as such in the documentation The proposed enhancement would respect optsparent if it has been set and the parent exists set the background colour of the element with a CSS background image only when a no parent is set or b if no parent was found The implementation would affect the code around lines L L Anyone want to chime in on the merits and rulesets In order to keep this project on the up and up well need to implement a little process and organization Technical Continuous integration with Circle Travis Publish npm bower Increment to version and then adopt semver Create nonjQuery version Badges npmtravis Code eslint AirBnB Build pipeline w gulp nvmrc Process Block builds using GH status API for code review Block builds using GH status API for unit tests Issues PRs Label all issues w Bug Code Review Feature etc Setup ReviewNinja or LGTM Close old unrelated issues Nice to have Hello firstly I want to tell you good job and great component But I would like to know which one is the best way to implement in AngularJS Thank you
