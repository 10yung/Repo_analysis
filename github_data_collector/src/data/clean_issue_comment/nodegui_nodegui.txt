dependencies Outofrange updates receive only lockfile updates if desired Security updates receive only security updates if desired details Describe the bug When I use the packer to package the HelloWord demo to executable binary on windows I get this info Snipaste When I copy the Qt dll from nodemodules nodegui qode dist bin to deploy win build MyApp The anther info appears Snipaste Then I copy the nodemodules nodegui qode dist plugins to deploy win build MyApp and new a file which is named qtconf Paths Prefix Then just fine Is my Qt version too low To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior shell git clone cd nodeguistarter npm install npm install savedev nodeguipacker npx nodeguipacker init myApp npx nodeguipacker pack dist Expected behavior get the executable binary Desktop please complete the following information OS Win nodeguinodegui nodeguipacker typesnode Still a WIP in progress I am new to working with Napi so if I am doing something silly please let me know Currently facing difficulties for calling QMenuWrapconstructorNew please see the issue for more details about that Hi is it currently possible to do anything like this with nodegui reactnodegui Id like to make it possible for users to sign in to my app with their google account Thanks for this project really exciting Example graphics for UI elements would provide a better overview The documentation would be clearer if the methods of the classes were divided into different categories as in the Qt documentation methods of the respective class slots signals events inherited methods properties from other classes An overview that shows which of the respective properties methods signals of a Qt class have already been wrapped and which have not would be helpful I would be willing to contribute to the latter if you also think it would make sense If so how about dynamically generated HTML tables or images that can be included or linked in the documentation Describe the bug When try to open file dialog got error NSXPCSharedListener endpointForReplywithListenerName an error occurred while attempting to obtain endpoint for listener comappleviewbridge Connection interrupted To Reproduce Example code js const file new QFileDialog const button new QPushButton buttonsetTextBrowse buttonaddEventListenerWidgetEventTypesMouseButtonPress fileopen Expected behavior Open file picker

Screenshots If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem Desktop please complete the following information the latest release version Additional context when revert flexlayout implementationit works wellso i think there is some prolbem about throttletimer and performLayout slot Its still very early days but it would be really cool to eventually have mobile support Nodejs can be built on Android and with the jitless flag for V it can be built for iOS too Its not officially supported currently but if there was a project like this pushing for it Im sure the community would happily step in to improve the level of support in Nodejs core
