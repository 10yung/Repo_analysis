Hello I use MulticoreoptTSNE on a big data events and parameters on a ubuntu server with core and G Ram with this command line python MulticoreTSNErunrunoptsnepy optsne data Datacsv outfile Datatsnecsv nthreads perp and i have this error Memory allocation failed Can you tell me if i change something in my commande line in my parameters i have more luck to run my job or if you know the setup necessary to run a MulticoreTsne on thi big data Best regards Quentin Barbier Hello Both through the pip and git clone install I get this ERROR running bdistwheel running build running buildpy creating build creating buildliblinuxx creating buildliblinuxx MulticoreTSNE copying MulticoreTSNEinitpy buildliblinuxx MulticoreTSNE creating buildliblinuxx MulticoreTSNEtests copying MulticoreTSNEtestsinitpy buildliblinuxx MulticoreTSNEtests copying MulticoreTSNEteststestbasepy buildliblinuxx MulticoreTSNEtests running egginfo creating MulticoreTSNEegginfo writing MulticoreTSNEegginfoPKGINFO writing dependencylinks to MulticoreTSNEegginfodependencylinkstxt writing requirements to MulticoreTSNEegginforequirestxt writing toplevel names to MulticoreTSNEegginfotopleveltxt writing manifest file MulticoreTSNEegginfoSOURCEStxt reading manifest file MulticoreTSNEegginfoSOURCEStxt reading manifest template MANIFESTin writing manifest file MulticoreTSNEegginfoSOURCEStxt running buildext cmake version CMake suite maintained and supported by Kitware kitwarecomcmake The CXX compiler identification is unknown CMake Error at CMakeListstxt PROJECT No CMAKECXXCOMPILER could be found Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment variable CXX or the CMake cache entry CMAKECXXCOMPILER to the full path to the compiler or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH Configuring incomplete errors occurred See also tmppipreqbuildztrw buildtemplinuxx CMakeFilesCMakeOutputlog See also tmppipreqbuildztrw buildtemplinuxx CMakeFilesCMakeErrorlog ERROR Cannot generate Makefile See above errors I am using a python version and could not install MulticoreTSNE using conda or using pip pip install MulticoreTSNE since it tries to downgrade a few installed packages including python itself to Below is the error message Should we be expecting MulticoreTSNE to be compatable with python or would you recommend installing I would avoid the latter since it means quite a bit of reloading Cheers Upon trying to install The following packages will be DOWNGRADED ipywjlabnbext py py louvain py h a py h a mklservice py hfbe c py hfbe c navigatorupdater py py pot py h cab py h cab pycairo py ha c a py ha c a pycurl py ha b ac py ha b ac pyqt py h a py h a pyreadr py h ce py h ce python h d haf pythonigraph post py h d ff post py h d ff sphinxcontrib py py Wonderful work The API is simply perfect But I wonder to know how to see the steps I have run and how can I visualize every step during the progress Tiny fix for issue compiles fine and pip install now works The problem was a simple typo For some reason the information being printed out when using the verbose flag was outputting to stderr and not stdout This makes sense for errors but not for general information Was this done for a specific reason Hello I get segmentation fault core dumped when run multicoretsne One of the cases that the crash occurs is when the input data contains lots of zeros Is there any fix for this problem Thanks from MulticoreTSNE import MulticoreTSNE as TSNE import numpy as np tsne TSNEnjobs perplexity tsnefitnpzeros python import numpy as np printnplognpnextafter npinf dtypenpfloat from MulticoreTSNE import MulticoreTSNE as TSNE tsne TSNEnjobs printnplognpnextafter npinf dtypenpfloat Result python printnplognpnextafter npinf dtypenpfloat from MulticoreTSNE import MulticoreTSNE as TSNE tsne TSNEnjobs printnplognpnextafter npinf dtypenpfloat main RuntimeWarning divide by zero encountered in log inf After calling tsne TSNEnjobs my numpy is not working any more as intended How can I fix this
