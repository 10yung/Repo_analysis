Pleased to learn about from Preetish could be useful in a datarectangling and joining example or exercise Arya has zero books Seems like an error but whatever In some ways this is good for the package because you have to deal with a field that is not equally present for all characters ie it queues up the need for default in purrr mapping functions But brings up the point that perhaps povBooks is really what you want Not sure where to put this so I decided to file an issue here xPath in general scares and intimidates but as I was playing with this plotly defiantjs example I started to wonder if xPath on nested objectsJSON is more intuitive and visual See defiantjs xpath evaluator as an example If you agree then I will explore potential ways of pursuing ways of incorporating this in R xpathjsondefiant Lists by topics or searchs via mkearney r devtoolsinstallgithubmkearneyrtweet rt rtweetsearchtweetsrstats n parse FALSE via masalmon Your call for examples made me realize I need purrr for tablefying the new sf classes Warning this is not extensively tested and I only look at polygons below not lines or multipoints but I think a purrrdplyrfriendly illustration to open up the fortify black box is worth exploring In sp data are stored as a list of list of matrices and ggplot has fortify methods to convert it to long table form R librarysp libraryrgdal libraryraster spdf shapefilesystemfileshapessidsshp packagemaptools libraryggplot ff fortifyspdf ggplotff aesx long y lat group group fill id geompolygon geompath guidesfill FALSE The underlying ggplot fortifyPolygons method applied by ggplot fortifySpatialPolygons and ggplot fortifySpatialPolygonsDataFrame is a bit obscure We can achieve the same with purrr mapping though we get slightly different fill due to the changed ID sorting R librarypurrr pm bindrowsmapspdfpolygons functionx bindrowsmapxPolygons functiony asdataframeycoords id part id feature part must be unique pm pm mutatepart pastepart feature sep ggplotpm aesx V y V group part fill feature geompolygon geompath guidesfill FALSE We can apply a similar approach to the new sf classes and its a fair bit simpler R librarysf new on CRAN more or less the same dataset nc streadsystemfilegpkgncgpkg packagesf ncgpkg crs ncgeomlong bindrowsmapncgeom functionx bindrowsmapx asdataframe id part id feature part must be unique ncgeomlong ncgeomlong mutatepart pastepart feature sep here the names are X X rather than V V but its not really relevant ggplotncgeomlong aesx X y X group part fill feature geompolygon geompath guidesfill FALSE
