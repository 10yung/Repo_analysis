Reproducible Demo Run expo upgrade on a Mac with yarn installed via MacPorts The issue is that PackageManager tries to spawn yarn via the yarnpkg executable name I have yarn installed via MacPorts and it does not have a yarnpkg executable but only yarn without pkg Currently all environment variables containing EXPO are exposed However if you are using a CI you might have some secrets and passwords defined that shouldnt be part of the build This PR removes these environment variables explicitly Im trying to retrieve the mobile token on android I could recover it but on ios I couldnt Despite it was working fine const status existingStatus await PermissionsgetAsyncPermissionsNOTIFICATIONS let finalStatus existingStatus if existingStatus granted Android remote notification permissions are granted during the app install so this will only ask on iOS const status await PermissionsaskAsyncPermissionsNOTIFICATIONS finalStatus status Stop here if the user did not grant permissions if finalStatus granted return Get the token that uniquely identifies this device let tokenOfMobile await NotificationsgetExpoPushTokenAsync thank you Ive followed the documentation guide to setup
