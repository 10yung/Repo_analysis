Hi Ive tried many things but still keep getting locked at default SSH auth method private key Has this happened to you Would you say is something related with the disco machine Im running laravel homestead and works fine which makes me think it is not related about my vagrant or vbox I think it should be mentioned somewhere in the readme or in the guides that we need to use mysql uroot proot to login to mysql Ideally it should be in this guide in Testing Active Record before mentioning create database activerecordunittest
