considered if this change warrants userfacing release notes and have added them to RELEASENOTEStxt if necessary Updates VoiceOver Usage and Guidelines based on what we learned while working on the Vision Accessibility Project paCBwpjwp Reviewing Please feel free to nitpick on the wording Guidelines The doc was significantly changed to focus more on the not so obvious parts of VoiceOver The new guidelines are based on the premise that if we had documentation like this when we started the project we would have been more equipped to decide how to improve some parts of the app Read the new voiceoverguidelinesmd file What do you think of these new guidelines Is there something that you do not agree with Is the structure easy to follow Are the code samples sufficient Is there something that should be added View the old voiceoverguidelinesmd file Did I remove or change something important Using VoiceOver The changes are minor and mostly structural I added some howtos that I think are not obvious for beginners Read the new usingvoiceovermd file View the old usingvoiceovermd file Please use the same questions in Guidelines above Submitter Checklist x I have considered if this change warrants userfacing release notes and have added them to RELEASENOTEStxt if necessary x If its feasible I have added unit tests This replaces the gutenberg commit hash by its equivalent tag in the Podfile To test Checkt that the app builds and run as expected PR submission checklist x I have considered adding unit tests where possible x I have considered if this change warrants userfacing release notes and have added them to RELEASENOTEStxt if necessary As noted in the UI tests dont fully mock API requests in the selfhosted site login flow Any requests made during UI tests should be fully mocked including selfhosted site flows Fixes To test Check the Aztec and Gutenberg editor to see if all is good Test the header and blockquote functionality on both to see if all is working correctly PR submission checklist I have considered adding unit tests where possible I have considered if this change warrants userfacing release notes and have added them to RELEASENOTEStxt if necessary This is a list of concerns we found when auditing VoiceOver support in Gutenberg The audit was done using develop a iPhone XS iOS Concerns Title Field Elements When navigating by swiping right there are accessible elements pertaining to the title field Please watch this video Content Field Scroll Bar Message When selecting the content field VoiceOver would speak information about the scrollbar For example it would speak Horizontal scrollbar page Vertical scrollbar page Not sure if this is intentional It seems correct but I thought to just bring it up Please watch this video Repetitive Button Hints img src width The hints of the Add Block Undo Redo and Hide Keyboard buttons are repetitive and most probably unnecessary For example for the Add button Label Add Block Hint Doubletap to add a block This goes against the Apple guidelines for accessibility hints Quoting some of them If the results of a user s action on a control or view are not clearly implied by its label create a hint Does not include the name of the action or gesture A hint does not tell users how to perform the action it tells users what will happen when that action occurs Therefore do not create hints such as Tap to play the song Tapping purchases the item or Swipe to delete the item With these the Add Block label should be good and descriptive enough Some buttons with similar concerns Move Block Up and Down buttons Remove Block button Unlabeled Element img src width There is an accessible element below the last block It does not have a label But it can be activated which creates a new block It can probably be disabled for VoiceOver since there is an Add block button already Dismiss Using Escape Gesture The editor cannot be dismissed using the VoiceOver global escape gesture make a Z with fingers This escape works in most of our views but not for the editor Remove Block Button Label img src width The button has a good label It can be enhanced by being more specific For example Remove paragraph block at row This gives more confidence to the user that they will be removing the correct block This WWDC video shows some similar examples of why specific labels can be useful Add Block Menu Selection When the Add Block menu is shown VoiceOvers behavior seems random Sometimes it would speak something about Contacts Often it would select an element behind the menu Please watch this video Add Block Menu Dismissal Sometimes I cannot dismiss the menu using the VoiceOver escape gesture This happens often if the menu was just shown It might be useful to add a transparent dismiss button on top of the menu too We do this for the Login dialog Add Block Menu Items Attributes img src width The menu items do not have the button attribute Paragraph Block Move Up Autoselected Add paragraph blocks Navigate and select the title field to start editing Navigate to the second paragraph block and edit it The Move Up button is automatically selected after starting to edit the paragraph contents Weirdly the text field is still being edited This video shows this behavior Move Up and Down The Other Block is Selected When moving a block up the block that replaces it is selected instead of the block that was moved Im not entirely sure if this is a problem But it seems more useful to have the same block and its Move Up button to be reselected again If thats the case it would be faster for the user to move a block multiple times This video shows this behavior In that video observe that the One paragraph block is selected after the Two paragraph block is moved This probably only happens if moving from the second row to the first which will cause the button to be disabled Separator Block Small Hit Area img src width This is probably subjective but I found the hit area to select the separator block to be too small vertically It took me a few seconds to select it with VoiceOver Here is a video of me moving my thumb up and down near the separator Spacer Settings Header img src width The Spacer Settings header title can make use of the header accessibility attribute Spacer Settings Quiet Presentation When a dialog is shown VoiceOver would usually select the first element of the presented dialog For the Spacer Settings case nothing is selected VoiceOver just stays quiet It may take a while for a blind user to realize that the dialog is already visible Here is a video showing this behavior In the late part of that video youll see that when opening the accessibility shortcut dialog VoiceOver speaks one of the elements That is probably what we want here too Image Settings Header Like the Space Settings header described above the Image Settings text can also have the header accessibility attribute Image Settings Quiet Presentation Just like the Space Settings described above the Image Settings dialog is also quietly presented No elements are immediately selected More Block Small Hit Area When Selected When Not Selected When not selected the Read More hit area is shorter Its probably better to make the hit area the same as when it is not selected see image above Video Block Video Label img src width When a video block is selected and its video UI element is selected VoiceOver would speak Write caption Horizontal scrollbar page Vertical scrollbar This is a bit difficult to understand Video Block Caption is Not Accessible When navigating by swiping right the Caption text field is never navigated to by VoiceOver VoiceOver skips to the Move Up button Video Settings Header Like the Space Settings header described above the Video Settings text can also have the header accessibility attribute Video Settings Quiet Presentation Just like the Space Settings described above the Video Settings dialog is also quietly presented No elements are immediately selected List Block Accessibility Value List Block Paragraph Block Unlike the Paragraph Block the List Block does not provide any information to VoiceOver about its contents Quote Block Accessibility Value Quote Block Paragraph Block Unlike the Paragraph Block the Quote Block does not provide any information to VoiceOver about its contents Gallery Block Add Button Label img src width The Add Buttons accessibility label is false block That is most probably incorrect The hint is also mentioning Doubletap which is not recommended by Apple Gallery Blocks Settings Adjustable Columns is Not Adjustable When selecting the Adjustable Columns VoiceOver says that the element is adjustable However swiping up or down does not change the value Here is a video of me trying to do that Media Text Block Button Cannot Be Activated img src width There are these buttons in the Media Text Block that are shown when selecting either the Media or Text subblocks The button cannot be doubletapped with VoiceOver It is also unclear what the purpose of the buttons are They could probably use a better label or a hint Preformatted Block Text Fields When navigating by swiping right VoiceOver can navigate to text fields This video shows this behavior Accessibility Inspection Hit Area Failures When running an audit using the Accessibility Inspector quite a few of the elements fail the Hit Area size check Suggestions Image Block Image Actions img src width After selecting an image block and then selecting the image VoiceOver would say Doubletap and hold to edit The doubletap and hold is VoiceOvers standard gesture which skips the VoiceOver gestures Another way this can be done is to use custom actions We can then provide actions Edit View Using custom actions would probably make both actions more discoverable And we dont need to provide the doubletap instruction in the label All Blocks Custom Actions img src width For a block that is currently not technically selected ie no Move UpDown Trash buttons are shown but selected by VoiceOver we can provide custom actions This may help speed up interaction For example for the Image Block we can have these as custom actions Move Up Move Down Settings Trash Add Block Expected behavior As text is inputed into the app the text should scroll upwards automatically as I get to the bottom of the screen so text is never hidden below where I can see it Actual behavior If an external keyboard is attached to the iOS device and used to enter text then it will be hidden as you get to the end of the viewable area The text stays hidden for lines then auto scrolls upward Steps to reproduce the behavior Add an external keyboard to your iOS device I used Apples Magic Keyboard Open a new post or page using the block editor Write until the page is full of text Tested on device iOS version WPiOS version Tested on iPad iOS WPiOS with Magic Keyboard User reported on iPad Pro iOS WPiOS with a Logitech keyboard zen Expected behavior Media Library should show a better indication of loading We can use a spinnerloader instead If well continue to have a text it should at least be positioned better and rephrased to indicate loading Actual behavior Media Library shows Nothing to show message during loading Steps to reproduce the behavior Be sure to reset Media Library cache by either fresh installing the app or switching to a new site that youll edit the first time Slow down your connection via Settings Developer Network Link Conditioner loss Add a new post via block editor Add Gallery block Tap on placeholder Choose WordPress media library Result It says Nothing to show as if the media library is empty The position of the message is odd File Tested on iPhone XS iOS WPiOS
