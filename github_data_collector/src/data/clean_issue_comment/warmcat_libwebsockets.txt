NDK version r c android API version So close in getting this built without issue have both libuv and openssl d compiled and built for ARM using the above Android ARM tools The initial CMAKE goes perfectly but the make process is failing Building C object CMakeFileswebsocketsshareddirlibtlstlsco mediajzer Devworkspacelibwebsocketslibtlstlsc In function lwstlsuseanyupgradecheckextant mediajzer Devworkspacelibwebsocketslibtlstlsc error implicit declaration of function lwstlsextant Werrorimplicitfunctiondeclaration if lwstlsextantbuf cc all warnings being treated as errors make CMakeFileswebsocketsshareddirlibtlstlsco Error make CMakeFileswebsocketsshareddirall Error make all Error To work around this I commented out the if defined around this function to ensure that is is not implicit if definedLWSWITHESP definedLWSPLATOPTEE definedOPTEEDEVKIT static int lwstlsextantconst char name it exists if we can open it int fd openname ORDONLY n char buf if fd return and we can read at least one byte out of it n readfd buf closefd return n endif and I am able to successfully make the libraries Not sure what kind of impact or instability this could introduce Tried with both master and stable branch Im having trouble getting the LWS client to accept a kindof selfsigned certificate with mbedTLS whereas with OpenSSL it works fine For tests Im using a certificate generated by githubcomjshaminica it creates a certificate authority and a server certificate Ive generated the certificate for an IP address and have configured the server to use the certificate and set up the client to load the CAs public key As Ive said above when linked against OpenSSL it works fine even after the hostname validation fix in the other issue MbedTLS client however returns the following error servers cert didnt look good X VERR Hostname mismatch Also Im pretty sure the CA public pem is loaded properly because if I dont load it it returns a different error expected servers cert didnt look good X VERR CA is not trusted I strongly suspect it has something to do with using the IP address because when Ive just as a last resort set up an entry in etchosts for lwstestcom generated a certificate for that one and set it as a host it connected just fine Id be fine with using localhost if theres nothing that can be done about the IP address access for mbedTLS however it doesnt work either with connect failed errno for neither mbedTLS nor OpenSSL
