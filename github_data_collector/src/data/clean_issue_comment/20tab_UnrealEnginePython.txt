Dear I am trying to use Threading with UE and Python but whenever I start the thread UE crashes Could you please help me in this matter My code is as follows def capturesceneself tic timeperfcounter selfpawncallfunctioncapturescene toc timeperfcounter uelogtoctic def tickself deltatime get current location selft deltatime if selft selft Threadtarget selfcapturescene selft start uelogexccc selft I am using UE Mac Can you publish binaries for windows ue with embedded python preferred or Thanks in advance HI Do you have USceneCapture implemented in Python Thanks For programmer it is easy to use the collision channel ECollisionChannel instead of object types EObjectTypeQuery Collision channel can be user defined and more understandable I know theres converting method in C engine code Im confused if theres python interface for programmers to use I found that this command didnt work in version Is there any improvement plan I was wondering if anyone has gotten pycharm or VSCode remote debug to work with UE If so can you share If not is there anything else that works for debugging besides print statements Thank you Most changes are simple I also changed methods that have deprecation warnings Disabled the following functions pyuefmenubuilderaddassetactions The menu build system has been refactored Needs more work to figure out how to port this correctly pyunrealenginereloadblueprint Reload functionality has been removed from the engine A few things need to be updated to work with UE v I have done an initial pass and will link that pr to this issue How can call thirdparty exe when executing a UnrealEnginePython script in the unreal editor I have a Blueprint character that inherits from c Nothing fancy in the c side just a base class In the character bp i have a Python actor component attached Here is the python module import unrealengine as ue class Player def beginplayself get a reference to the owing pawn a character selfowner selfuobjectgetowner the following two values were originally implemented as blueprint variable selfbaseturnrate selfbaselookuprate selfownerbindaxisTurn selfturn selfownerbindaxisLookUp selflookup selfownerbindaxisMoveForward selfmoveforward selfownerbindaxisMoveRight selfmoveright bind jump actions selfownerbindactionJump ueIEPRESSED selfownerjump selfownerbindactionJump ueIERELEASED selfownerstopjumping bind sprint actions selfownerbindactionSprint ueIEPRESSED selfsprintpressed selfownerbindactionSprint ueIERELEASED selfsprintreleased def tickself deltatime pass def turnself axisvalue turnrate axisvalue selfbaseturnrate selfownergetworlddeltaseconds selfowneraddcontrolleryawinputturnrate def lookupself axisvalue lookuprate axisvalue selfbaselookuprate selfownergetworlddeltaseconds selfowneraddcontrollerpitchinputlookuprate def moveforwardself axisvalue rot selfownergetcontrolrotation fwd uegetforwardvector rot selfowneraddmovementinputfwd axisvalue def moverightself axisvalue rot selfownergetcontrolrotation right uegetrightvector rot selfowneraddmovementinputright axisvalue def sprintpressedself selfownerCharacterMovementMaxWalkSpeed def sprintreleasedself selfownerCharacterMovementMaxWalkSpeed I have shift key assigned as Sprint binding and when i press shift character movement increases and returns to normal when not pressed It works fine in the packaged build but in standalone or PIE when i press shift the camera rotation seems to get faster each time i press shift I am on WIndows UE
