Training stops after every epoch completion need to manually close the window and then only it proceeds with next epoch Cant it simultaneously plot and proceed to the next epoch Thanks for this library btw Hi I am trying to use this library but the following error of no setmaxepoch attribute is showing Thanks Hi thanks for the really nice package I would like to suggest to add an option to skip pltshow in drawplots so that the plots can later be modified That is something like showTrue default run pltshow as usual showFalse skip pltshow By skipping pltshow users can then for example change the styles modify the labels or add annotations and call pltshow afterward For instance python livelossdrawshowFalse pltxlabelstep pltshow Thanks Hi is it possible to use livelossplot when training manually via trainonbatch in keras thanks Jani Hi Im using this lib which seems cool btw and I got this error message AttributeError PlotLossesCallback object has no attribute ontrainbatchbegin Im using TF Beta and Keras in python Thx It would be nice to have two subplots or even more if one wants to observe different metrics One should display the loss as is currently possible and the other one next to it should display a loss selectable by user I hope other people would like that as well The majority of functions and classes miss dosctrings ie helper texts Even if you new to livelossplot open source or Python in general I believe you can contribute And if you are a veteran it will be a piece of cake You can do it one by one noo need to do everything in one go Every help is appreciated Please adhere to PEP Docstring Conventions Im training a CNN model and I wanted to both a be able to reduce the optimizer learning rate when it hits a plateau with ReduceLROnPlateau and b visually monitor the losses with livelossplots PlotKerasLosses This combination in callbacks gives me a KeyError lr When dropping either one of the functions the training works as it should Hence my guess is that there must be a compatibility issue with the two Keras livelossplot Heres some code from kerascallbacks import ReduceLROnPlateau from livelossplot import PlotLossesKeras learningratereduction ReduceLROnPlateaumonitorvalacc patience verbose factor minlr history modelfitgeneratordatagenflowXtrainYtrain batchsizebatchsize epochs epochs validationdata XvalYval verbose stepsperepochXtrainshape batchsize callbacks learningratereduction PlotLossesKeras And heres the error I get KeyError Traceback most recent call last ipythoninput bd e in module verbose stepsperepochXtrainshape batchsize callbacks learningratereduction PlotLossesKeras anaconda envsupworklibpython sitepackageskeraslegacyinterfacespy in wrapperargs kwargs warningswarnUpdate your objectname call to the Keras API signature stacklevel return funcargs kwargs wrapperoriginalfunction func return wrapper anaconda envsupworklibpython sitepackageskerasenginetrainingpy in fitgeneratorself generator stepsperepoch epochs verbose callbacks validationdata validationsteps classweight maxqueuesize workers usemultiprocessing shuffle initialepoch usemultiprocessingusemultiprocessing shuffleshuffle initialepochinitialepoch interfaceslegacygeneratormethodssupport anaconda envsupworklibpython sitepackageskerasenginetraininggeneratorpy in fitgeneratormodel generator stepsperepoch epochs verbose callbacks validationdata validationsteps classweight maxqueuesize workers usemultiprocessing shuffle initialepoch break callbacksonepochendepoch epochlogs epoch if callbackmodelstoptraining anaconda envsupworklibpython sitepackageskerascallbackspy in onepochendself epoch logs logs logs or for callback in selfcallbacks callbackonepochendepoch logs def onbatchbeginself batch logsNone anaconda envsupworklibpython sitepackageslivelossplotgenerickeraspy in onepochendself epoch logs def onepochendself epoch logs selfliveplotupdatelogscopy selfliveplotdraw anaconda envsupworklibpython sitepackageslivelossplotgenericplotpy in updateself log selflogsappendlog if selfplotextrema selfupdateextremalog def drawself anaconda envsupworklibpython sitepackageslivelossplotgenericplotpy in updateextremaself log def updateextremaself log for metric value in logitems extrema selfmetricsextrema metric if isunsetextrema min or value extrema min extrema min floatvalue KeyError lr Bokeh as an alternative backend to matplotlib would make it simple to toggle between innotebook plots and external plots so that it would work seamlessly with both Jupyter Notebook Python scripts give mouseover view of exact numerical values no more eye squeezing zoom if needed I dont want to have it instead of matplotlib as this one makes it easier to save plots so that they are visible in Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub but as an additional backend My experience with Bokeh is limited so this issue is open for YOUR contribution It would make it simpler to interact with other plots Now we use global methods Vide
