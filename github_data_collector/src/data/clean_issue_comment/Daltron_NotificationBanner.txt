 Hello I have problems when adding to my project with Swift Package manager it gives me the following error I hope you can help me Captura de Pantalla a las Captura de Pantalla a las It would be great to adjust the image size as it is pretty small by default This is already implemented for GrowingNotificationBanner Thanks for this great library When using a rightView the layout is broken the view is shown but no text will be visible Using leftView works fine using both together breaks the layout again This can be reproduced in the example project It works when using a FloatingNotificationBanner Thanks for this library I am asking basically what was asking closed due to inactivity Currently theres no way to set the height for a custom view I am aware of the bannerHeight method but its broken if its set the library no longer applies adjustments such as those for iOS and for notch phones As a result its very difficult to replicate the logic in GrowingNotificationBanner in a custom set up Functions needed to manually set the height are set as internal Just a thought on the case where a custom view is in charge of dismissing a banner The pseudocode will look like the following let customView CustomView let banner BannercustomView customView customViewonClose bannerdismiss bannershow Do you think there is another way to rewrite that I dont like too much Got this error when trying add cornerRadius CATransformLayer x d dea changing property cornerRadius in transformonly layer will have no effect I encountered several banner position issues Seems like it happens when a new banner is triggered while the visible one is disappearing I was able to reproduce it with the sample App Simulator Screen Shot iPhone at Simulator Screen Shot iPhone at And if I set bottom they sometimes appear on top Version is working fine iPad orientation issue resolved In the project Im working on were getting crashes related to connectedScenes on iOS in v Fatal Exception NSInvalidArgumentException UIApplication connectedScenes unrecognized selector sent to instance Fatal Exception NSInvalidArgumentException CoreFoundation x a d c exceptionPreprocess libobjcAdylib x a f b f objcexceptionthrow CoreFoundation x a c f c NSOrderedSet initWithSetcopyItems UIKitCore x d a UIResponder doesNotRecognizeSelector CoreFoundation x a d d forwarding CoreFoundation x a d e c CFforwardingprep NotificationBanner x ec closure in variable initialization expression of BaseNotificationBannerappWindow BaseNotificationBannerswift NotificationBanner x specialized BaseNotificationBannerinitstylecolors BaseNotificationBannerswift NotificationBanner x specialized NotificationBannerinitcustomView compilergenerated NotificationBanner x ec NotificationBannerinitcustomView compilergenerated I cant reproduce this but we have over crashes from this in the past week Ive researched this property quite a bit and researched how other libs handle this and it seems the same I have no idea though why UIApplication cant find this method signature sometimes but it happens on iOS only so it must be connected to this somehow If someone can point me in the right direction Ill be glad to help this get fixed Any thoughts
