Fixes dropexists is casesensitive This means that it will incorrectly return FALSE in the following scenario Alice creates in her Dropbox a file named Foobarbaztxt Alice shares Foo with Bob Bob renames on his filesystem the subfolder bar to Bar Bob invokes dropexistsFooBarbaztxt expecting the result to be TRUE Following up with a pull request I believe you are missing a dtoken dtoken row of dropdir function if isnulllimit while contenthasmore content droplistfoldercontinuecontentcursor results appendresults contententries This is causing issue as asking new authentication when going in

Hi I recently started using rdrop but to experiment on a shiny app i was developing I tried to upload an image from my local system into my dropbox account But I noticed that the images uploaded there were replicating the same name png I tried printing the address path of fileinput and noticed the tempfile copied the images a path png for every image in try to upload Can you help to figure what I should do r libraryrdrop libraryshiny you can use an image for your reprex outputDir www ui fluidPage fileInputnewimage Upload your images accept cpng jpg dropauth server functioninput output session observeEventinputnewimage infile inputnewimage ifisnullinfile returnNULL else dropuploadinfiledatapath www mode add shinyAppui server Expected Behaviour I expect each unique image to be uploaded with each unique name as name of image file egbirdpng cowpng etc Actual Behaviour I got images file with only png and tempfile output as C Users myusername AppData Local Temp RtmpaQy Xv d f fad a ae d png

predetails Hello and thank you for this package I got this strange message while working locally on my shiny app I already have a shiny app online and I also uploaded a dropbox token created locally to read files from my dropbox account The application was working fine Today I continued to work on my application but locally but through the same Dropbox token to do some modification Every time my application starts one file is read by my dropbox account While working locally I had to start the application several times and at a certain point I received this strange error I checked the application online and it was not working as expected too Then I tried again after some minutes and now it seems that the application online works again fine I am wondering if there is a limited number of request in a certain amount of time that could be done through the Dropbox token If yes where can I find these informations Thank you and best regards Nico I hope it makes it easier to understand and it insist on the problems with dropcreate see Partially fixes Short description of changes and motivation only change it information given Details Hello everyone and thanks for your
