baseFontSize px baseLineHeight headerFontFamily Lato Helvetica Neue Segoe UI Helvetica Arial sansserif bodyFontFamily Roboto serif Insert styles directly into the head typographyinjectStyles export default typography And I also tried to customize gatsby plugin theme ui like so javascript export default novelaTheme colors novelaThemecolors primary secondary D accent themecolorsterracota grey D
