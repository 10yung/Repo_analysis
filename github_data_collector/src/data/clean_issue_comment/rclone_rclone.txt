to solve Accidental Deletion How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that Add the ability to specify something like interactivemode true within rcloneconf Enabling interactive mode would cause rclone to present YesNo options to a user when conducting an operation that results in overwriting or deleting a file to prevent accidental data loss Welcome We understand you are having a

you think you might have found a bug please can you try to replicate it with the latest beta If you can still replicate it with the latest beta then please fill in the info below which makes our lives much easier A log with vv will make our day Thank you The Rclone Developers What is the problem you are having with rclone Receiving Inputoutput errors I use it regularly and didnt have this issue in the past but I did not change anything knowingly What is your rclone version output from rclone version I tried several including the latest beta rclone version rclone v g a b acbeta osarch linuxamd go version go Which OS you are using and how many bits eg Windows bit Linux bit Which cloud storage system are you using eg Google Drive Google Drive The command you were trying to run eg rclone copy tmp remotetmp rclone mount A log from the command with the vv flag eg output from rclone vv copy tmp remotetmp I mounted with loglevel DEBUG dircachetime m and then run find gdrivefs maxdepth twice Both find commands end with find gdrivefs Inputoutput error The rclone command produces a ton of output but nothing looking suspicious On the second run with everything cached it only procudes DEBUG ReadDirAll DEBUG ReadDirAll item errnil What is your current rclone version output from rclone version Rclone v What problem are you are trying to solve there is no support for the provider furknet wwwwfurknet How do you think rclone should be changed to solve that rclone should access rw or only r the MyFiles on furknet and mount the cloud drive The API is described at Space is shown in GTM units notation appearing to be measured in GBTBMBetc but is actually GiBTiBMiBetc See Please use the appropriate notation to prevent confusion Hello I am a university students in engineering I interest in program a new remote but have some problem faced hr Canvas is a platform mostly used in university which allow for teacher upload their notes for students and allow student to access it And also for grade checking and assignment submission Basically there are two types of storage can be implemented in rclone of this remote in the students side The FileFolder of each course which should be readonly The account storage which should be readwrite while for the Submission folder saving any submitted assignment is readonly hr Canvas has a RESTAPI by using a API key The API allow for list the folders and files in a course which require to provide a course id while the course of a student can be listed to get all the course id While the idea of a remote path is canvas course title folders or files inside the course and the methodfunc used to list root directory suppose to be different But I am not sure the whole scenario of rclone Is any preexisted remote is using RESTAPI for reference and which interface inside fsfsgo should be programmed And also how to handling the permission of the folders and files Rclone adds AcceptEncoding gzip header on requests even when the nogzipencoding flag is present DEBUG rclone Version v starting with parameters rclone about gdrive logfilerclone log fastlist vv dumpheaders nogzipencoding DEBUG Using config file from C Users HARRY
