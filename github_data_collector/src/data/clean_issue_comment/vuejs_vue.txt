 Version Reproduction link Steps to reproduce Open the codesandbox and youll see a warning like Vue warn Duplicate keys detected constructor This may cause an update error Click the swap button TWICE to swap the list in the data triggering the error If the literal string constructor in the first list is changed for any other string there are no errors or warnings What is expected The list should swap between the first and second list What is actually happening TypeError Cannot read property key of undefined this was a hard bug to track down generated by vueissues DO NOT REMOVE What kind of

problems when trying out Vue The default vuecli setup creates several supporting vue scripts For instance open the Chrome devtools and ctrl p for Appvue in a new project The top entry is the correct Vue file the others arent From the VS Code perspective the user might ask us to set a breakpoint in a Vue file We know which file the breakpoint is attached to on disk and we need to figure out which loaded file that breakpoint gets mapped to However because all these paths are quite similar and all in the context of a generic web app possibly the file we want we end up putting the breakpoint in the wrong file and breaking in the incorrect place And often the supporting scripts evaluate before the real script does so we cant for example wait and pick the best match from the possible candidates What does the proposed API look like The simplest solution would be to prefix the supporting files with some path like vue or something along those lines This would prevent the paths from incorrectly mapping to files that exist on disk generated by vueissues DO NOT REMOVE Please make sure to read the Pull Request Guidelines PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE Update to x to check a box What kind of

Currently subresource integrity isnt supported by SSR This PR implements it along with crossorigin support by putting the SRI hashes into the client manifest so that they can be added during server rendering The feature is optin when creating the renderer Version Reproduction link Steps to reproduce The bug reproduction is quite specific so please be patient open Appvue in safari my version is open the console so that you can watch the logs the values of eTimeStamp and attachedTimestamp from are logged make sure that the variable WITHGENERATENEWVUE is false wait a while at least about a minute click the Press me button several times to make sure that everything works most likely in the console there will be etimeStamp attachTimestamp Now the difficult and not completely clear part change the value of the variable WITHGENERATENEWVUE to true without reloading the browser page click on the button now most likely the log will change to something similar to etimeStamp attachedTimestamp this is Safari and etimeStamp the first number in the logs is zero but after some time or a few clicks it will begin to grow and now until it becomes more than the value of attachedTimestamp the click will not work What is expected click and method on it works What is actually happening in the above case this check is not performed This is a specific situation something like emulating an application in which there is a lot of legacy different sections can be written on different technologies and sometimes this bug is caught when switching between sections Unfortunately I can t even suggest how this bug is related to the instantiation of a new vue maybe this is a coincidence I think this can be fixed by adding etargetcontains ecurrentTarget to the conditions specified in but I don t know if this will not affect performance generated by vueissues DO NOT REMOVE What problem does this feature solve Hello Vue I have questions linked to your raodmap In the current roadmap ending in Q is quite hard to see which milestone was completed Is it possible to have somehow something like a level of completion More important what is the roadmap for Currently on Vue x with vuerouter vuex I would want to plan a migration to Vue x Responses to those would help me a lot Thanks JP What does the proposed API look like generated by vueissues DO NOT REMOVE Version Reproduction link Steps to reproduce Since the my IDE VSCode now suggest me import Vue from the vuetypesumd namespace instead of the ESModule vue Im using Vue VueCLI VScode Typescript What is expected Prior VScode was suggesting to import Vue from vue What is actually happening VSCode is suggesting me to import Vue from vuetypesumd see screenshot maybe its releated to generated by
