As described on computational science The last equation in the last block has an error The backwards substitution method starts with i not i See link It doesnt make sense as written so hopefully people will realize it but this could confuse people Plots under Lstability section have typos in labels Comparison of error for backward euler should have label for Backward Euler Comparison of errors for trapezoidal rule should have label for Trapezoidal Rule not Forward Euler Typo or unfinished block within Taylor Series Methods Example no math mode u ptn f p tn utn In linearalgebra complement is misspelled as compliment Want to take content and make it more modularized and reorderable for ease of reuse or go find a good one
