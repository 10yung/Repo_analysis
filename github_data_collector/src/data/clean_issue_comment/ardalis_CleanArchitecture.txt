I am trying to understand what SharedKernel is for It is expressed that types that would likely be shared between multiple projects This is what Core project stands for isnt it Any other projects in the solution always references the Core project so what I need to share accross solution can be resided in the Core Am I wrong It was my understanding that with ASPNET Core x it was recommended to use IHostBuilder vs IWebHostBuilder I noticed you were using IWebHostBuilder was this intentional thanks Hi As you didnt add any example of this I want to know what is proper namespace for such a class eg public void Foo Bar bar The Bar class is DTO here btw Im not talking about any data related situation here Foo is just a method maybe it just add number If you try to complete ToDoItem the handlers are never registered or handled I tried to register the Handlers as follows in the container but still does not work var handlers AssemblyGetAssemblytypeofIHandle builderRegisterAssemblyTypeshandlersAsImplementedInterfaces There is a visual studio template for this repo here which is on the NET Core version of the code We should update this to be the latest version GregTrevellick would you be able tointeresting in updating it Ive updated the newest version of the repo to support the template package It uses the nuget pack flavor of packaging versus the dotnet pack flavor Here is some information that should probably go into the readme file I wasnt sure how to update it since I didnt know if you already have a channel to publish this template to NuGetorg or not or whether it was something youd want to do Simplest possible usage instructions without publishing NuGet package to NuGetorg clone the repo into an empty folder Make sure you have the nuget CLI installed In the root directory run nuget pack This will create CleanArchitectureTemplate nupkg Make sure you have the dotnet CLI installed Run dotnet new i CleanArchitectureTemplate nupkg This will install the templates from this package into the dotnet CLI Now to create a brand new project using the template Navigate to the directory where you will put the new solution Run dotnet new cleanarch o YourProjectName where YourProjectName is whatever you want to name the project The YourProjectName directory and solution file will be created and inside that will be all of your new solution contents properly namespaced and ready to runtest NOTE This could be published to NuGetorg if youweI have an account established there I dont at this time If we did get this published to NuGetorg then the top list of simplest steps would be simply this dotnet new i CleanArchitectureTemplates This command would install the templates from this NuGet package from the default NuGet sources and use the latest version Demonstrate how to use a feature folder use cases organization for the solution template See for background So my question is simple As an example if I have a simple create command DTO containing a List of Product DTO s received from the Controller Endpoint and forwarded to a CommandHandler via Mediator and there are many properties that I have to set in the Aggregate method would it be ok when I pass the DTO to the method instead of each parameter see example below public class Cart private readonly ListProducts products new ListProducts public IReadOnlyListProducts Products productsAsReadOnly public void AddProductsListMyProductDTO dto foreachvar p in dto Product newProd new ProductdtoProductName productsAddnewProd Hi ardalis This is very interesting template for DDD design and it could be great if you could provide a diagram and document of the components of your implementation Thanks and Regards Duy Should helper classes be inside the Core project or the Infrastructure project
