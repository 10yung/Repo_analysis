when i used this with very fast action to switchfragments variable are in disorder Height and Width of my fragment decreased after Page Transformation Im using BackgroundToForegroundTransformer After the transformation i want to set my fragment size to original size I dont want to decrease the height and width of my fragment How can i do it How to test bug add next code in onCreate run app choose some transformation and wait for seconds it will change something but slider wont appear or animation would be frozen paused at its start test bug Handler handler new Handler handlerpostDelayednew Runnable Override public void run mPagersetCurrentItem false protected void onCreateBundle savedInstanceState superonCreatesavedInstanceState int selectedPage if savedInstanceState null mSelectedItem savedInstanceStategetIntKEYSELECTEDCLASS selectedPage savedInstanceStategetIntKEYSELECTEDPAGE final ArrayAdapterTransformerItem actionBarAdapter new ArrayAdapter getApplicationContext androidRlayoutsimplelistitem androidRidtext TRANSFORMCLASSES setContentViewRlayoutactivitymain mAdapter new PageAdaptergetFragmentManager mPager ViewPager findViewByIdRidcontainer mPagersetAdaptermAdapter mPagersetCurrentItemselectedPage test bug Handler handler new Handler handlerpostDelayednew Runnable Override public void run mPagersetCurrentItem false final ActionBar actionBar getActionBar if actionBar null actionBarsetListNavigationCallbacksactionBarAdapter this actionBarsetNavigationModeActionBarNAVIGATIONMODELIST noinspection ResourceType actionBarsetDisplayOptionsactionBargetDisplayOptions ActionBarDISPLAYSHOWTITLE actionBarsetSelectedNavigationItemmSelectedItem for example with ZoomOutSliderTransformer slider wont be fully taking all space of layout you can see white paddings or margin at right and bottom screenshot com toxicbakery viewpager transforms Hi I am using your library trying to implement FlipHorizontalTransformer Inside my view pagers I have fragments with buttons and their onClickLIstenersbut every time I use your library these listeners start to overlap I have pages On page on i have Button and on page i have Button on same sort of relative location But when I am on page and click to Button Button onClick lister fires up Its like this page never left screenits still on top but hiddencan you explain how to fix this Dont have time to do a proper change test and pull request so Im just going to write this issue If no one fixes Ill come back to make the change and pull request after my app release Problem those modifications have the side effect that if I change transformations after a vertical or horizontal flip when I swipe the other direction the off screen view which is now on screen remains hidden I believe the framework already sort of supported the necessary change to remedy this For anyone that runs into the problem make the following change to ABaseTransformer if hideOffscreenPages position f position f pagesetVisibilityViewINVISIBLE pagesetAlpha f pagesetEnabledfalse else pagesetEnabledtrue pagesetAlpha f pagesetVisibilityViewVISIBLE And then you can remove the onPostTransform from FlipHorizontal and FlipVertical In doing other work I did a limited amount of research on alpha vs visibility I found a post from Romain Guy saying to use visibility and not alpha to hideshow as its more efficient The original defects were due to the framework using alpha to hide The partial fixes switched to using visibility to prevent interaction with off screen pages as it should be IMO Problem is the side effect I found Moving this into the framework itself fixes both these transformations and future transformations I left the alpha change in as its necessary to clean up after some transformations I dont think the setEnabled is necessary and its commented out in my copy To the original developer that fixed the Flip transformation thank you Id been having a problem being unable to scroll after a transformation and not taking the time to debug Your fix helped very much I override PagerAdaptergetPageWidth Override public float getPageWidthint position return f
