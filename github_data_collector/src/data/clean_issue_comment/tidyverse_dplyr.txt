Hi I was trying out some of the rowwise stuff in the the dev version when I hit the following error message parts of which I thought could be a bit a bit clearer r librarydplyr warnconflicts FALSE parameters tibbletribble mu sd parameters rowwise mutatedata rnorm mu sd Error mutate argument data must be recyclable data is rnorm mu sd x x cant be recycled to size x It must be size or not supCreated on by the reprex package v sup When I was reading the error message I was very confused about what x is as there is no x anywhere in the call I found the or clause quite odd and had to reread it a couple of times to firstly make sure that I had not misread and then work out why it was like that All the best We need a vignette that broadly explains how grouping works and shows how grouping and the various verbs interact usevignettegroupingRmd Copy in existing content from which scheduled for removal Ensure each one table verb has a section with a small example that demonstrates how grouping interacts with its operation unselect grouping vars arrange not grouped by default show example of filter to remove entire groups eg filterdf n Should try and work with one dataset starwars as much as possible How to access data about the current group with curgroup and friends Briefly show the underlying data structure accessed with groupdata This is a lot to do in a day so if you dont get it all done please submit a PR anyway as your work will make it much easier for us to finish off Fix any small mistakes directly For any larger sections that dont make sense or leave you with questions add a comment like INITIALS description of problem The introduction to dplyr is getting a little long in the tooth and needs a substantial refresh to make sure it covers the verbs included in dplyr Replace samplensamplefrac with slice and related helpers Add relocate Provide over arching organisation around row ops column ops and summarise Remove the Grouped operations section Introduce the pipe much earlier Remove data sources section will be bulleted list in README Remove comparisons section Should go in its own subheading for scanability and link to dbplyr dtplyr and datatable and cubelyr Maybe theres nothing to be done here but I think slice shouldnt actually provide data masking since its about selecting rows based on their positions It still needs to provide n though Proof of concept implementation I dont think we can make this much simpler without introducing a new dplyr generic that allows you to modify columns and change their order at the same time I think thats ok though since groupby which sometime called mutate has something of the same flavour Will need some refactoring probably pull out and export relocatecols to make this easier for other backends to use Fixes This is an extremely quick and hacky implementation of morph as described in New curdata and curgrouprows Connect contextual functions to datatable pronouns Access curgroupid and n through mask instead of context Fixes Since across doesnt help with this problem Maybe select and rename could gain a transform argument that would be applied to the variable names
