Im trying to make use of bibliometrix in a package just of helper functions for my own use But Im having a weird dependency issue The following lines are in a function in my package bibData bibliometrixreadFilesfilelist bibliometrixconvert dfdbsource wos format bibtex bibliometrixbiblioAnalysis The convert df step throws the following error unless I actually have bibliometrix loaded in my session Error in dataframebibtag ISI undefined columns selected In addition Warning message In databibtag envir environment The function correctly imports the functions Im calling importFrom bibliometrix readFiles convert df biblioAnalysis My description file correctly imports bibliometrix devtoolscheck doesnt have any problems does convert df depend on something else i need to import While most of the field tags generated by convert df can be found through either package vignette or the WoS website I was not able to find any explanation about the following five variables DT PP BO AUUNNR SRFULL These are not explained in metaTagExtraction function help document either Would you mind adding the definitions of these five tags in the convert df help document I really appreciate massimoaria for always promptly addressing all the issues The responsiveness makes me more like this package and it really helps my academic work I was wondering if you could also address the following at your easiest convenience It would be so much appreciated if you could provide more information on biblioNetwork function arguments in its help document For instance analysis argument can have any of the four character objects ie collaboration coupling cooccurrences or cocitation however I am so confused since no definitions of these concepts are missing while those seem very similar to each other Would you mind adding brief definitions of each option to the user help document Of course users could examine bibliometrix package source code to understand the underlying calculation however it would be very helpful for users because they do not need to do reverseengineering for this Many thanks again Some universites or institution of France will change to France I inverstigate the the cause and found that errors maybe extract the last word in C For example PETELETGIRAUD E REPRINT AUTHOR BUR RECH GEOL MINIERES LAB DIV AVE CLAUDE GUILLEMINBP F ORLEANS FRANCEPETELETGIRAUD

planning to use bibliometrix on rscopusscopussearch instead of going through scopus website and downloading bibfiles Ie something like response rscopusscopussearchTITLEABSKEYsomthing and something data rscopusgenentriestodfresponseentries M newfunctiondata I have only recently started to use both rscopus and bibliometrix and as far as I can see you are already wrangling some of the output eg from rscopusauthordforig in bibliometrixretrievalByAuthorID So I am a bit surprised that there seems to be no general function to generate Mobjects directly like convert df does Before I go on and write something myself I wanted to ask is this something you have already looked at and abandoned or is this out of scope for you Hello I am using the biblioshiny app from bibliometrix but I am not able to plot a historiograph using data downloaded from the Web of Science in Plain Text format using the Full Record and Cited References I always get a noncharacter argument error Some other graphs can be produced without problems for instance the Authors Production over Time Data from the joizip example works fine and with casual inspection of the contents I do not see a clear difference except for the presence of a byte order mark but removing it does not solve my problem Am I doing something wrong with the data preparation Im having some trouble to do my research of bibliometric with bibliometrix on R Ive already made a lot of time using the same code i found the error on results part Error in if sumind It says that is missing the TRUEFALSE value but at this part dont need it I have sure that im doing all the things right and didnt found nothing on web about this error Have someone already found this error Anyone can help me librarybibliometrix To cite bibliometrix in

strsplit function R will produce an error called noncharacter argument at some special environment such as R scripts on the KNIME platform Till now I dont know why to cause the problem but I think if you add all ascharacter string conversion at the strsplit function may solve this problem First of all thanks for the very usefull bibliometrix package Recently I have had troubles with the pubmed connection server using the pubmed df function When I try to download around more than records the next error appear HTTP status was Too Many Requests months before I used the function to download around records successfully Do you have any idea about the problem and how to solve it Thanks in advance Dago Thanks for de the great job My question is possible unite two bib files for example wosbib and scopusbib Best regards Felipe Smolski
