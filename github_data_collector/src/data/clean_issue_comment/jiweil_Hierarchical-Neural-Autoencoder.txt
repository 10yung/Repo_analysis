I am very sorry to bother you I would like to ask Where is the file saveparameterWS I didnt find this file when I ran the code Im sorry to disturb you I was studying your essay A Hierarchical Neural Autoencoder for Paragraphs and Documents recently and I think this essay is very good For further understanding and learning I plan to run the code you share on github Unfortunately Ive been running the same error code I ultimately can not solve so I would like to ask you about itThanh you very much Here is my error situation I plan to train hierLSTMAttention so I ran hierLSTMAttm After the runtime code was started the program would work fine for some time without error but after a couple of hours an error occurred I tried to run Many times the same error occurs every time This is the wrong message Out of memory on device To view more detail about available memory on the GPU usegpuDevice If the problem persists reset the GPU by calling gpuDevice Error softmax line gradsoftW gradsoftW gradsoftmaxhsoftW Error hierLSTMAtt line batchcost grad softmax result currentbatch parameter My environment is GPU matlab b memory G meet Requirements GPU matlab b memory GB I try to find the reason but ultimately can not solve this error so I would like to ask you thank you Sorry again bother you This is my operating environment ubuntu memory G processor CPU E v operating system bit matlab b CUDADevice with attributes Name GeForce GTX Ti G Index ComputeCapability SupportsDouble DriverVersion ToolkitVersion MaxThreadsPerBlock MaxShmemPerBlock MaxThreadBlockSize MaxGridSize e SIMDWidth TotalMemory e AvailableMemory e MultiprocessorCount ClockRateKHz ComputeMode Default GPUOverlapsTransfers KernelExecutionTimeout CanMapHostMemory DeviceSupported DeviceSelected Thank you very much Hi Thanks to sharing your work I wonder how you divide sentences from paragraphs of HotelReview Corpus I guess you divide sentence boundary based on punctuation marks such as But punctuation marks often makes ambiguity it can be used as end of the sentence as well as other functions such as abbreviation continuation etc Could you provide any tips how could detect sentence boundary with minimal punctuation marks ambiguity Specifically how could you divide sentences by comma
