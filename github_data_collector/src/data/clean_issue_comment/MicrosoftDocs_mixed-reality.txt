the MRTK package in Unity All compiler errors have to be fixed before you can enter playmode with ArgumentExceptions in the Console After creating the project closer to the root directory I was able to complete the tutorial with no issues It would be helpful to have a warning that a project saved deep in the directory tree may cause long file path errors Document Details Do not edit this section

trying to install a newer nonLTS version of Unity for a specific purpose we recommend not installing the Unity workload as part of Visual Studio installation and instead install the LTS stream of Unity as noted below In the Unity section The current recommendation is to use Unity x which is the LTS build required for MRTK v below Im sure this is accurate for Hololens but only Unity f works for Hololens in my experience I was blocked from any development for about weeks trying to get a basic Unity app running only the camera and a x x cube in front of the camera I was trying all different versions of Unity and LTS Visual Studio but I would never see the Unity splash screen and would only see blankblackempty space when the app ran on the Hololens As soon as I created the basic app in Unity it worked like a charm Today I tried opening the working app with Unity LTS and saw the same blankblack screen and lack of splash screen It seems LTS completely broke the app because the previously working app now shows the same broken behavior when I open in LTS Please update both sections to clarify Unity LTS for Hololens Unity LTS for Hololens Document Details Do not edit this
