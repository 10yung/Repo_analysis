 Can you please help me doing a version with Visual Studio I think there is something odd in here Build succeeds with instructions from README but launch fails with error console Illegal Instruction Does anyone know what is happening Hi I would like to include this in guix Is it stable Could you tag a release The mouse sensitivity seems a bit fast I cant find a good place even when in Low sensitivity that allows me to be level with the ball and not spinning around it Perhaps there should be a larger neutral zone and less range on the maximum height and spin speed Looks good It would be very usefull and probably easy to implement a AssetsMods directory lookup to allow overriding of games assets for safe modding The titles says it all Maybe with access to the marbles rotation using triplanar or even cube mapping it would be possible to implement a skin system for the marbles I mean can you add this feature please To stretch game on screen with low resolution Marble Marcher generates absolutely beautiful images and it would be nice if we could easily capture those Screenshots should not render the UI render the game at a configurable resolution for example I may be running the game in p but want to take an k screenshot Please refer to for more information TLDR throwing everything at the users home directory is a terrible idea that should stop Making use of XDGDATAHOME would be ideal
