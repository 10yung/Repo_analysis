CPU Haswell Intel i k Motherboard ASRock Z MITXAC Ethernet controller Qualcomm Atheros QCA Gigabit Ethernet rev from lspci output After running mecleaner the Ethernet interface doesnt show up to multiple Linux OSs To be clear running ip link or ifconfig the enp s device simply isnt listed and doesnt work This is true on all of Ubuntu Arch and Fedora Strangely WiFi does work Reflashing the original firmware immediately fixed the issue After some experiments this ethernet problem occurs when using the S flag and when using no flags but when using the s flag ethernet works I used an external CH A flasher everytime i boot my PC I get warning abnormal ME state recommended reflash is there any way to remove this annoying notification In addition Manufacturing mode is in disabled state already Running intelmetool it keeps saying that cannot read the table even if iomemrelaxed is set sudo intelmetool s Bad news you have a HM Chipset LPCeSPI Controller so you have ME hardware on

I ve been hearing that boot guard may not work or wont work after IME deactivation What is better to have the gates or not to have the gates I changed processor Intel Pentium Processor B to Intel Core i M in Samsung NP E CA PL After change laptop power off every minutes even after apply MeCleaner witch parameter S witch no arguments and witch parameter s I have chip Macronix MX L E and I don t have problems witch flashing it Unfortunately in this laptop I have Chipset HM which is blocked to work longer than minutes witch processor better than Pentium It is possible to deal witch this issue using MeCleaner Was reading They note that on ME version it ignores the HAP bit Just a heads up that two images are now replaced with placeholders on the following Wiki page error in example For me it only works the other way round lcd get very darkdont have light and keyboard not working after flashing im restore stay blank laptop get power from keyboard but lcd very dark
