Bumps handlebars from to details summaryChangelogsummary Sourced from handlebarss changelog v September th Fixes Security Disallow calling helperMissing and blockHelperMissing directly c Disallow calling helperMissing and blockHelperMissing directly c Features Add new runtime option allowCallsToHelperMissing to allow calling blockHelperMissing and helperMissing Breaking changes Compatibility notes Compiler revision increased b This means that template compiled with versions prior to will not work with runtimes The increase was done because the helperMissing and blockHelperMissing are now moved from the helpers to the internal containerhooks object so old templates will not be able to call them anymore We suggest that you always recompile your templates with the latest compiler in your build pipelines Disallow calling helperMissing and blockHelperMissing directly c Calling helperMissing and blockHelperMissing directly from a template like in blockHelperMissing was never intended and was part of the exploits that have been revealed early in see It is also part of a new exploit that is not captured by the earlier fix In order to harden Handlebars against such exploits calling thos helpers is now not possible anymore Overriding those helpers is still possible If you really need this behavior you can set the runtime option allowCallsToHelperMissing to true and the calls will again be possible Both bullet points imly that Handlebars is not percent compatible to despite the minor version bump We consider it more important to resolve a major security issue than to maintain
