 Hello I am encoutering this error on my ASPNET web application Could not load file or assembly MicrosoftOwin Version Cultureneutral PublicKeyToken bf ad e or one of its dependencies The located assemblys manifest definition does not match the assembly reference Exception from HRESULT x I do indeed have a dependency to MicrosoftOwin in my project But my project is using the latest version and in my webconfig my redirects are configured to redirect to it dependentAssembly assemblyIdentity nameMicrosoftOwin publicKeyToken bf ad e bindingRedirect oldVersion newVersion dependentAssembly Here is where it gets weird Locally it works just fine I can build it and run it in debug or release mode The build in my build pipeline on Azure DevOps also works great However the deployed version deployed in Azure does not work The landing page which is a login page works fine but as soon as I try and login I get a yellow screen wih this message An unhandled exception was generated during the

have tried every fix I could find online had help from multiple people and nothing could fix this Looking forward to get your answers Cheers This is a reminder to check all of the OAuth packages before the next release to make sure their endpoint addresses are current We know the Facebook one is stale This doesnt cause any functional problems until a provider makes real breaking changes but it can cause some warnings about using stale addresses Hello Sometimes I get this exception when writing the response to the response body stream Exception info dump SystemIOIOException

different continent so assume slower connection and the response size is a couple of MBs I was testing on MB I was not able to repro this behaviour locally however The code looks much like this Stream originalStream contextResponseBody using var newBodyStream new MemoryStream contextResponseBody newBodyStream Invoking other middlewares await thisNextInvokecontext try newBodyStreamCopyTooriginalStream catch Exception ex Swallow any exception during sending the response Getting the exception here finally contextResponseBody originalStream Wireshark shows that the underlying TCP connection stays open no RST no FIN but with no activity Where the issue might be Here are some other info that might be useful Im on OWIN Does it make sense to update to to hope the issue will go away Unfortunately its not an option to stream the data directly to the response stream I have to buffer the data first for other reasons Since the client does not get any data at all and the connection stays open how do I actually terminate that connection Thanks a lot On the first time a user signs in with Apple onto our app Apple provides the email or a generated one and the name of the user However the Identity created by the OpenIdConnect middleware never exposes the users nameneither as a claim nor in the ExternalLoginInfo from the MicrosoftAspNetIdentityOwin package our app uses too Is this an issue in the MicrosoftOwinSecurityOpenIdConnect package Please add and support changelogmd or add info into readmemd where to find the release changelog I couldnt find any tutorials using Azure AD v endpoints to secure AspNetMVC web APIs Most of the samples are now in dotnet core using different middlewares The below code configuration only works when the applications

the license element and embedded package icons before the next release Hi All hope you are doing great It seems referesh token does not expire on in active session time out I am using azure b c sign in policy v i explain the issue below Let suppose when we sign in am time the UTC time was am Framework set session cookie expiry time to UTC time After mins user inactive session on user interaction we redirect to sign in page as expected But if you try to load index page url its let you sign you in and extend the session cookie expiry time which is totally weird if you can suggest any thing in this matter would be highly appreciated thanks kam MSFT thread page I have a website that utilizes physical directory browsing Heres my code public void ConfigurationIAppBuilder app

until a user created a folder with an ampersand The URL in the OWINgenerated directorybrowsing page doesnt properly escape the ampersand although it DOES appear to escape spaces which is interesting When a user clicks on the link it results in an error Heres what the URL on the OWINgenerated directorybrowsing page might look like Notice the ampersand is NOT escaped The error in IIS is SystemWebHttpException A potentially dangerous RequestPath value was detected from the client My project targets Net Framework Im using MicrosoftOwin Nuget packages with version I suspect the fix for this will be to use SystemWebHttpUtilityUrlEncode for URLs rather than ONLY escaping spaces
