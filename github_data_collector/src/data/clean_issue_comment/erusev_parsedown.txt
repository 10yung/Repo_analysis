dashboard for that I am using turndown script to convert and save in the database the markdown text and as editor I am using the tinymce The discord app recognize the Something markdown text as an underlined text but this parsedown recognize as a bold text So I am trying to do so Test to bTestb Test to iTesti Test to uTestu Test to strikeTeststrike How can I can change I recently upgraded to php and got a php error on one of our pages I tracked it down to the following Reproduce using inStr a b Has error outStr ParsedownExtrainstanceparseinStr inStr a amp b No error outStr

wrong Doesnt work Whereas in PHP Markdown Extra it outputs this correct a hrefDoesnt worka Take the following markdown markdown Formatting Symbol Example Code Three backticks print Hello World In the first cell I want inline code markup in the second cell i want three escaped backticks and in the third i want a pair of three escaped markdowns As can be seen in the screenshot made using this breaks the table img width altScreenshot at src I couldnt find a way around it either Oh the irony of documenting a markdown flavour and finding an issue in a markdown parser which you then have to report using markdown escaped inside markdown After some research i dont find why my markdown file is not shown like in Markdown PHP used your demo site complete md file partly somethin destroys my table of content links and therefore the rest of the document RSGallery Documentation centerRSGallery Teamcenter centerVersion centerbr This is just a collection of all written documentation for the RSGallery web page We are sorry for the ugly style It results from the limitation of writing in fast Markdown syntax We hope that at least you have all needed information in one document and you dont have to scan through all online documents to find what you need This is a work in progress and will be updated regularly Sadly some bits and pieces are missing With each new development we try to update the documentation of this part more or less immediately There are many places where we can continue our work and sometimes we have to decide develop or document Here we are more likely to publish than to
