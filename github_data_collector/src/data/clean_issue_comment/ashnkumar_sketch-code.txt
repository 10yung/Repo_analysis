Bumps tensorflow from to details summaryRelease notessummary Sourced from tensorflows releases TensorFlow Release This is the last x release for TensorFlow We do not expect to update the x branch with features although we will issue patch releases to fix vulnerabilities for at least one year Major Features and Improvements As announced tensorflow pip package will by default include GPU support same as tensorflowgpu now for the platforms we currently have GPU support Linux and Windows It will work on machines with and without Nvidia GPUs tensorflowgpu will still be available and CPUonly packages can be downloaded at tensorflowcpu for users who are concerned about package size TensorFlow contains a complete implementation of the API in its compatv module It contains a copy of the main module without contrib in the compatv module TensorFlow is able to emulate behavior using the enablev behavior function This enables writing forward compatible code by explicitly importing either tensorflowcompatv or tensorflowcompatv you can ensure that your code works without modifications against an installation of or EagerTensor now supports numpy buffer interface for tensors Add toggles tfenablecontrolflowv and tfdisablecontrolflowv for enablingdisabling v control flow Enable v control flow as part of tfenablev behavior and TF BEHAVIOR AutoGraph translates Python control flow into TensorFlow expressions allowing users to write regular Python inside tffunctiondecorated functions AutoGraph is also applied in functions used with tfdata tfdistribute and tfkeras APIS Adds enabletensorequality which switches the behavior such that Tensors are no longer hashable Tensors can be compared with and yielding a Boolean Tensor with elementwise comparison results This will be the default behavior in Auto MixedPrecision graph optimizer simplifies converting models to float for acceleration on Volta and Turing Tensor Cores This feature can be enabled by wrapping an optimizer class with tftrainexperimentalenablemixedprecisiongraphrewrite Add environment variable TFCUDNNDETERMINISTIC Setting to true or forces the selection of deterministic cuDNN convolution and maxpooling algorithms When this is enabled the algorithm selection procedure itself is also deterministic TensorRT Migrate TensorRT conversion sources from contrib to compiler directory in preparation for TF Add additional user friendly TrtGraphConverter API for TensorRT conversion Expand support for TensorFlow operators in TensorRT conversion eg Gather Slice Pack Unpack ArgMin ArgMaxDepthSpaceShuffle Support TensorFlow operator CombinedNonMaxSuppression in TensorRT conversion which significantly accelerates object detection models Breaking Changes Tensorflow code now produces different pip packages tensorflowcore containing all the code in the future it will contain only the private implementation and tensorflow which is a virtual pip package doing forwarding to tensorflowcore and in the future will contain only the public API of tensorflow We dont expect this to be breaking unless you were importing directly from the implementation TensorFlow is built using devtoolset GCC on Ubuntu This may lead to ABI incompatibilities with extensions built against earlier versions of TensorFlow Deprecated the use of constraint and constraint with ResourceVariable tfkeras OMPNUMTHREADS is no longer used by the default Keras config To configure the number of threads use tfconfigthreading APIs tfkerasmodelsavemodel and modelsave now defaults to saving a TensorFlow SavedModel kerasbackendresizeimages and consequently keraslayersUpsampling D behavior has changed a bug in the resizing implementation was fixed Layers now default to float and automatically cast their inputs to the layers dtype If you had a model that used float it will probably silently use float in TensorFlow and a warning will be issued that starts with Layer layername is casting an input tensor from dtype float to the layers dtype of float To fix either set the default dtype to float with tfkerasbackendsetfloatxfloat or pass dtypefloat to each of the Layer constructors See tfkeraslayersLayer for more information Some tfassert methods now raise assertions at operation creation time ie when this Python line executes if the input tensors values are known at that time not during the sessionrun When this happens a noop is returned and the input tensors are marked nonfeedable In other words if they are used as keys in feeddict argument to sessionrun an error will be raised Also because some assert ops dont make it into the graph the graph structure changes A different graph can result in different perop random seeds when they are not given explicitly most often Bug Fixes and Other Changes tfestimator tfkerasestimatormodeltoestimator now supports exporting to tftrainCheckpoint format which allows the saved checkpoints to be compatible with modelloadweights Fix tests in canned estimators Expose Head

security fix PRs for this repo from the Security Alerts page details Hi many thanks for sharing the data and code how can we take it forward how can we generate more data apart from synthesised data can we create same kind of dataset for real time html page if so then how can we generate gui files for that if you have any resource or any thoughts please do share us Augmentation is used to generate more data Isnt it But this function augmentandsaveimages does not generate more training data it just changes the meta data and the data length of result is equal to the length of input data Is it just used to improve adaptive performance When i am trying to train my dataset i do not know that how the gui file i will get for my images the ubuntu Comes with Downgrading is very troublesome Using TensorFlow backend usrlibpython importlibbootstrappy RuntimeWarning compiletime version of module tensorflowpythonframeworkfasttensorutil does not match runtime version Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement Keras from r requirementstxt line from versions No matching distribution found for Keras from r requirementstxt line I have installed numpy and my python has been but it
