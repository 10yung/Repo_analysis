There was an issue with the clear command deleting everything Image clearing didnt seem to do anything in Shoes Has this problem been fixed in Shoes Otherwise it just keeps stacking images without the ability to clear the screen Does shoes provide a mechanism for detecting HiDPI displays I have a project Id like to create in shoes however it needs to be able to detect and display text correctly on p as well as k monitors cross platform Thanks the great work to create the gem When i try to package an app i found if the app include the music it can not work normally the music can not play I have try to package the sample in this projectsamplessoundssimplesoundrb there are no sound but it work normally in the development environment My Steps git clone bundle install binshoes package mac samplessoundsimplesoundrb So is this a known issue or a bug Or just i do the wrong steps Thanks Apparently while Ive been away Travis CI has started working with Windows Worth a shot to see if we can simplify our CI down to one spot This PR should fix LintHandleExceptions and LintRescueWithoutErrorClass rubocop offenses Hello Ive installed the shoes gem with jruby S gem install shoes pre on my windows machine and it succesfully installed gems But when i try to run shoes with or without any arguments ive tried bareword shoes and to open my app shoes srcmainapprb and packaging my app shoes package jar srcmainapprb but all of the above commands result in ArgumentError No gems found matching selectgenerator at Cjruby librubygemssharedgemsshoescore rc libshoesuipickerrb requiregenerator at Cjruby librubygemssharedgemsshoescore rc libshoesuipickerrb run at Cjruby librubygemssharedgemsshoescore rc libshoesuipickerrb main at Cjruby librubygemssharedgemsshoescore rc binshoespicker load at orgjrubyRubyKerneljava main at c jruby bin shoespicker prefixing shoes with bin gives me bin is not recognized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file but given the stacktrace is also clear the gem was found without and as said its a windows PC What should i do in order to get shoes running on my pc If there is anything i need to provide you to help investigate this dont hesitate to ask Thanks in advance Hi I started to play around with shoes a little bit It is a nice project I like your goal to build apps with same sourcecode for windows mac and linux Im working on a linuxlaptop Ubuntu using RVM to install jRuby VersionInfo jruby d b ff Java HotSpotTM Bit Server VM b on b jit linuxx and installed shoes via gem install shoes pre My apps are working but Im wondering about startuptime When I start an example app like Shoesapp width height do background limeblue stack do para Welcome to the world of Shoes end end with this command shoes examplerb then it takes around seconds on my laptop until the message appears on screen Do I miss something in configuration or reading documentation Any chance to speed up things Thanks in advance for any usefull hint gTom Opening this for some feedback For Issue I have it working with most cases I have found It took a between my schedule the complexity and how much of math I have forgotten I wanted it to work with samplessimplearcrb if you put a click event on them and it mostly does Since those use nofill but the default is not I built out the code to handle both cases At opening of PR I think the main code could use some more comments similar to those added for centerpoint Also the specs are just what I have been using to get coverage while I refactored They could use some work to be clearer at what is being tested However I wanted to open this early because I am not sure where the code should live Should it stay in arcrb or be broken out somewhere else Besides just being a large chunk of logic within arc it could apply to other shapes Since at its core an arc is an oval a good part of the methods would be useable in expansions to Ovalinbounds When I try and run the bat script in the package Windows directory it flashes up then disappears shortly after and the app doesnt run This is on my machine with Shoes and a JDK already installed If I double click on the jar to run it or write my own bat script with just the run command in it it works fine Seems like the checking if Java exists is broken
