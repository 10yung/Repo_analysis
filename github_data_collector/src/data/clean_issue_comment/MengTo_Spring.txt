The example of the Spring is not working at all not master branch nor swfit With Xcode now supporting SPM for iOS and tvOS it would be great if we can include a Packageswift file here I submitted a pull request for this as well Added Packageswift for SPM support and updated the READMEmd to include installation instructions add property animations String which can mix animations and instead animation property add function clearAllAnimations for next animation action add sample AnimationsViewController First of all Thanks for posting the code for this Its working well with Swift Xcode but theres something weird I cant explain and that I havent been able to fix yet When the keyboard is opened theres always a space of about pts above it that doesnt seem to be useable which makes one of my UI elements decrease its height even though there should be enough space for it I opened a Stackexchange question here explaining it in detail How do I get rid of this additional space or at least decrease its height to something like pts Cannot inherit from nonopen class DesignableButton outside of its defining module So it can be overriden outside the module This adds support for SwiftPM manifest based dependency managers Specifically this adds support for installing via Accio but will probably also work with SwiftPM once its integrated into Xcode Please note that this project is part of Accios official integration tests within the Demo project Ive had some trouble getting this to work consistently with Predictive Text on vs off and on all iPhone X models there is a significant gap between the top of the keyboard and the bottom of the constrained element while the older iPhone models appear correctly
