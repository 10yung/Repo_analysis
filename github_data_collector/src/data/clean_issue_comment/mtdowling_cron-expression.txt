The timezone login was refactored for more code readability I made sure that all the tess have passed Im setting the timezone sitewide by using datedefaulttimezonesetUTC If this is set some nextRunDates are wrong seemingly randomly cron Cron CronExpressionfactory then getNextRunDate returns currently correct cron Cron CronExpressionfactory then getNextRunDate returns The hour is correct but its adding minutes All other hours seem to be correct If I comment out datedefaulttimezonesetUTC then it works correctly If the result of getPreviousRunDate happens to be within the missing hour during DST change an Impossible CRON expression error is thrown Im getting an impossible cron expression error which seems to be a combination of day of the week the Sydney timezone and the particular current date of php dateTime Cron CronExpressionfactory getNextRunDateCarbon Carboncreate UTCtimezoneAustraliaSydney If both fields are restricted for day of month and day of week a cron should match for either case as per the cron man Note The day of a commands execution can be specified by two fields day of month and day of week If both fields are restricted ie are not the command will be run when either field matches the current time For example would cause a command to be run at am on the st and th of each month plus every Friday However in a test with the following expression fri The expected behavior is every Friday OR every month on the th However when running this it matches if it is a Friday AND it is the forth here is sample output Next Fri Nov Last Fri Mar Great library otherwise I didnt notice anything in the source handling daylight savings time Crons consideration for this is that any time changes less than hours should be considered daylight savings time Not handling this would mean that hourbased runs could run more than they are suppose to For example if something were scheduled for AM it would run twice when rolling back See So I pulled and added a test Added a method to get run dates in a date range and some minor optimizations
