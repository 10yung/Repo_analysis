Hi there Super cool plugin My XAVC MXF videos preview fine in quicklook without QLVideo but they do not show thumbnails Installing QLVideo solves the thumbnail issue but now my MXF files quicklook as snapshots whereas they were full videos before Is there a way to toggle onoff the snapshot feature Running on Thanks When a custom icon or image attachment is included with a MKV file QLVideo should show this thumbnail as the first big preview frame as long as true QuickLook playback of MKV videos is not supported what would make this plugin outstanding If you use Homebrew to install the mkv format file cannot be previewed After that I uninstall it After installing it through the pkg installation package the mkv format can be previewed ive downloaded version but when selecting it in the macOS Finder it reports version the difference is actually semi major releases I am unsure whether or not this is by design but while the files I am referring toa bunch of mkv have previews if I navigate to their directory they do not have previews in a search or in my smart folders Mac mini i GB on High Sierra Hi Info MacBook Pro QLVideo Issue White Frame in finder preview please see attached screenshot Selecting another mkv file to preview in Finder works okay and returning to the mkv that is previewed as white frame works okay again I have also attached the qlmanage report as requested Cheers Vangeliis reporttxt img width altscreen shot at src Hi is there any way QLVideo could show some Placeholder Image as Preview if it wasnt able to create a preview instead of the default Finder image Im always wondering if it failed or if I still have to wait for some preview image Thanks It would be nice if the advice displayed to the user at the end of the installation was localized Please feel free to comment below with a translation into your language of the following text which will appear in the installation was successful dialog To see thumbnails of video files you may need to relaunch Finder or log out and back in again You may experience high CPU and disk usage for the next few minutes while Spotlight reindexes all of your nonnative audio and video files Also please provide a translation of the term Frame rate which will appear in the Finders Get Info dialog
