Since I have two monitors I like to keep Terminals maximized on one monitor while I work on another Many times after I close a client connection the Terminals window will shrink down to a minimum size Meaning I have to maximize the screen again I know this isnt the end of the world but its very annoying Also it doesnt appear to do it all the time Ive only seen it do it when I close the last client Meaning as long as I have an open connection its fine But closing the last one often times it will shrink the window There appears to be no way to issue CtrlAltDel when in VNC connection Add master password commandline argument to provide master password from commandline This is useful for launching terminals from scripts IT appears as though it is not possible to create read only access to a database for terminals can you confirm the correct database permissions needed to create readonly access for a large team thanks Is SSH support planned I minimized or removed the menu bar consisting of File View Favorites etc Now I am not able to get it back as there is no icon or option to bring it back Please suggest My laptop crashed and when I opened Terminals all my connections were gone I had an export from a year ago and I am unable to see the menus so that I can import my old connections Also for some reason it set a password and when I uninstall and reinstall it will not let me reset password Hey contributors This project still alive Hi First thanks for the Terminals program I am using version Files store I have my username and password stored using credential management I have all servers setup to use this stored credential account which works perfectly If I rightclick on any server and use a different account and press the EnterReturn key then it opens remote sessions to the same server one session under my stored account and the other session using the alternate account If I click the OK button using the mouse then one remote session is opened using the alternate account Any ideas Thansk Hello it gives me that error when I try to connect using ssh to a server This is the log file ERROR ms Terminals Register Error accessing registry SystemUnauthorizedAccessException Access to the registry key HKEYCLASSESROOT TRM is denied at MicrosoftWin RegistryKeyWin ErrorInt errorCode String str at MicrosoftWin RegistryKeyCreateSubKeyInternalString subkey RegistryKeyPermissionCheck permissionCheck Object registrySecurityObj RegistryOptions registryOptions at MicrosoftWin RegistryKeyCreateSubKeyString subkey at TerminalsProtocolHandlerCreateTrmRegistrySubKey at TerminalsProtocolHandlerRegister ERROR ms Terminals orPublishedRelease Failed during Check for release SystemNetWebException The request was aborted Could not create SSLTLS secure channel at SystemNetWebClientDownloadDataInternalUri address WebRequest request at SystemNetWebClientDownloadStringUri address at TerminalsUpdatesUpdateManagerDownloadReleases at TerminalsUpdatesUpdateManagerDownLoadLatestReleaseInfoVersion currentVersion at TerminalsUpdatesUpdateManagerTryCheckForPublishedReleaseVersion currentVersion at TerminalsUpdatesUpdateManagerCheckForPublishedReleaseVersion currentVersion INFO ms Terminals SaveHistory History saved Duration ms INFO ms Terminals Connect Connecting to a SSH Connection FATAL ms Terminals Connect Connecting to unknown Connection SystemArgumentException Empty path name is not legal at SystemIOFileStreamInitString path FileMode mode FileAccess access Int rights Boolean useRights FileShare share Int bufferSize FileOptions options SECURITYATTRIBUTES secAttrs String msgPath Boolean bFromProxy Boolean useLongPath Boolean checkHost at SystemIOFileStreamctorString path FileMode mode FileAccess access at GranadosSSH SSH ConnectionUserAuth at GranadosSSH SSH ConnectionConnect at GranadosSSHConnectionConnectMainSSHConnectionParameter param ISSHConnectionEventReceiver receiver VersionExchangeHandler pnh AbstractGranadosSocket s at SSHClientProtocolConnectSocket s at TerminalsConnectionsTerminalConnectionConfigureSshConnectionIGuardedSecurity security at TerminalsConnectionsTerminalConnectionConnect
