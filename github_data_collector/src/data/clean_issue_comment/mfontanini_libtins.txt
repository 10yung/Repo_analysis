Hi there I am currently using a Raspberry Pi mod A with a Alfa AWUS ACS ac AC Dual Band WiFi USB Adapter I am currently capturing approximately packets a second however feel this number should be significantly higher Just wondering if there is any suggestions to boost the packets sniffed Thanks James Hi First thanks for the amazing work on this library I was able to outperform my old C tracing tool by Secondly I was wondering if you could give me some advice here I started with this Windows VS sniffersniffloop TinsPacket packet thisprocesspacketpacket return true This worked for me but when using FileSniffer timestamps were not the ones from the file but from the moment the file was read and I really really need those timestamps I saw in snifferh a check is present to prevent using invokeloopcb when you compile in VS c b a b e fbcbbf e e a e a which would force me to write a handler for PDUs instead of Packets which I cant as I need the timestamps Im wondering if this could have something to do with it I circumvented my original issue by making two changes Removing the VS check Changing the definition of makesnifferhandler to accept a callback with Packet instead of PDU One could probably make it generic for both as I preferred this over the lambda function Would there be a better way to implement this maybe without my changes Any help is welcome Thanks The MS C compiler doesnt seem to understand that a small constant like although strictly being an integer will fit perfectly fine into an bit type so add some safe casts to silence that warning If libpcap support has been disabled LIBTINSENABLEPCAPOFF then the headers requiring that library will not be installed but they will still be included from the main tinsh convenience header This fixes that by sorrounding the includes with an ifdef the same way it has been done for DOT support Windows MSVS I have started up with this code ifndef TINSSTATIC define TINSSTATIC endif TINSSTATIC include tinstinsh include iostream int main TinsSniffer sniffereth TinsPDU pdu sniffernextpacket TinsDNS dns pdurfindpduTinsRawPDUtoTinsDNS for const auto query dnsqueries stdcout querydname stdendl delete pdu and tried to build it x Result was a bunch of LNK errors at the end of which there was this libtinsmaster build lib Debug tinslib warning LNK library machine type x conflicts with target machine type x Ok tried to

when I run it I got this I have tried installing Winpcap that places needed dll in System folder but then there are memory access violation in this code sniffercpp if pcapactivategetpcaphandle throw pcaperrorpcapgeterrgetpcaphandle Well am I doing anything wrong Hello Is there a way to accomplish this with libints Basically I dont see a way to access the bar control field of the block ack frame which is bytes by using the barcontol getter which is only smalluint If I wanted to get to this field and read the compressed bit bit and the TID high bytes do I need to parse the raw data myself Please see image Im having a hard time getting at this field blockack Regards and thanks in advance Ive read the documentation and some classes on doxygen and theres no way to either send a packet through a file descriptor as if I were writing directly to devnettun or theres no option to dump the packet into a simple uint t buffer so I can do the write manually I also found no way of creating my own PacketSender that writes to an interface The closest I found was PDUs serialize but it is protected so I dont know exactly what its for Am I rigth I need this because Im creating a way to send an IP packet through OpenVPN and I need to write to a virtual file from which it reads and sends my packet I tried and got Not building examples as pcap support is disabled googletest git submodule is absent Run git submodule init git submodule update to get it CMake Error The following variables are used in this project but they are set to NOTFOUND Please set them or make sure they are set and
