 Why The Merchant Warrior gateway does not support the recurringFlag field which is used to indicate if a transaction will be marked as recurring CE What Changed Added support for the recurringFlag field via a recurringflag option on the process and authorize functions Added missing unit test for Merchant Warrior authorize function Test Suite Results Unit tests assertions failures errors pendings omissions notifications passed Remote tests assertions failures errors pendings omissions notifications passed These were caught by a novel type inference system built on RDL I wanted to bring these to your attention and also confirm whether they are true bugs so that we may better evaluate our inference system Here there is no variable or method called number Here BillingIntegrations appears to be undefined in this scope When using a payment token to make a purchase ActiveMerchant gets the subscription ID by splitting the token at a semi colon However the payment token I have which comes from the flex method to tokenize a card doesnt contain a semi colon which results in a blank string being sent as the subscription ID failing the transaction Here is the code for reference gateway ActiveMerchantBillingCyberSourceGatewaynewlogin x password x gatewaypurchase THETOKEN And the associated StackOverflow post ActiveMerchant Version CE Unit tests assertions failures errors pendings omissions notifications passed All remote tests pass between existing credentials and new credentials but some things arent yet turned on for new credentials Ive sent an email CardConnect no longer requires ports to be included in their valid domains so this change removes that requirement allowing customers to use CardConnect domains without specifying a port CE Unit tests assertions failures errors pendings omissions notifications passed Remote tests assertions failures errors pendings omissions notifications passed Two failing remote tests testsuccessfulrefund testpartialrefund Both of these tests are failing with the message Txn not settled and are failing on master as well The last commit to CardConnect Oct shows fully passing remote tests so something appears to have changed in the gateway integration since then These new failures seem to be unrelated to the changes made in this commit All unit tests tests assertions failures errors pendings omissions notifications passed Is there any way to add pypay method of payment from payment express Adding support to TSYS Multipass Payment Gateway Both Unit and Remote specs are added Screen Shot at PM Screen Shot at PM Add Adyen support message to wiki Add support for temporary vaults and AVS CoF when storing cards in the permanent vault Combines to other PRs for easier merging Remote tests tests assertions failures errors pendings omissions notifications passed Unit tests tests assertions failures errors pendings omissions notifications passed
