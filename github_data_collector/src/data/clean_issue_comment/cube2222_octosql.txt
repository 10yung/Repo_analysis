 A modification of linkedlist to support insertions and deletions from both sides so now its a deque When running a query SELECT FROM foo f WHERE fname LIKE Ab an element with name Ab gets matched because Tokenizer parses Ab as Ab and thats what gets inserted as the right variable in LIKE in the parse tree This issue doesnt have a trivial solution since escaping characters is based on context For example when someone wants to alias a column as a b then they will use column as a b and the first should not be inserted into the string On the other hand in the LIKE example above we want the to make it into the final string because Ab is a different match condition from Ab obviously I try to execute query like SELECT dyusr FROM dynamodepartments as dydep LEFT JOIN dynamouserrole as dyur ON dydepid dyurdepartmentid LEFT JOIN dynamousers as dyusr ON dyusrid dyuruserid WHERE dydepid with expectation it will returns only users data but it return all of tables field value Hi I try to query using subquery like this SELECT pta tam createdat as ticketagentmappingcreate FROM premierticketaml pta LEFT JOIN SELECT FROM ticketagentmapping tam WHERE tamagentrole amlagent as tam ON pta ticketid tam ticketid ORDER BY pta id ASC But its doesnt work Did I do something wrong Im not sure how feasible this may be but the old logparser program from Microsoft supported queries like Select from testcsv And it would read from testcsv without needing any config files
