I tried to install jupyter and then I saw this error ERROR haxornews has requirement prompttoolkit but youll have prompttoolkit which is incompatible wouldnt it be better if prompttoolkit upgraded so I could use jupyter without having to uninstall haxornews Hello there It would be great for haxornews to use the standard XDG directories to save data In this case haxornewsconfig could be XDGCONFIGHOMEhaxornewsconfig usually confighaxornewsconfig and haxornewshistory could be XDGDATAHOMEhaxornewshistory Would this be something youre willing to discuss Hi guys does anyone know the regex param to view comments sorted by the of comments in descending order Description A website currently number on HN crashes the html text parsing library The following url crashes the library The exact issue is a type error on line with a call to sub where text is not a string or byteslike object The full sterror stacktrace is here errortxt This is a fresh install from pip of haxornews on osx I have not gotten a chance to properly debug I am willing to investigate and potentially PR any fix Hi Is it possible to filter posts by a regex other than hiring posts Installed from AUR on arch linux everything uptodate as of The program doesnt start but displays this error haxornews Traceback most recent call last File usrlibpython sitepackagespkgresourcesinitpy line in buildmaster wsrequirerequires File usrlibpython sitepackagespkgresourcesinitpy line in require needed selfresolveparserequirementsrequirements File usrlibpython sitepackagespkgresourcesinitpy line in resolve raise VersionConflictdist reqwithcontextdependentreq pkgresourcesContextualVersionConflict prompttoolkit usrlibpython sitepackages Requirementparseprompttoolkit haxornews During handling of the above exception another exception occurred Traceback most recent call last File usrbinhaxornews line in module from pkgresources import loadentrypoint File usrlibpython sitepackagespkgresourcesinitpy line in module callaside File usrlibpython sitepackagespkgresourcesinitpy line in callaside fargs kwargs File usrlibpython sitepackagespkgresourcesinitpy line in initializemasterworkingset workingset WorkingSetbuildmaster File usrlibpython sitepackagespkgresourcesinitpy line in buildmaster return clsbuildfromrequirementsrequires File usrlibpython sitepackagespkgresourcesinitpy line in buildfromrequirements dists wsresolvereqs Environment File usrlibpython sitepackagespkgresourcesinitpy line in resolve raise DistributionNotFoundreq requirers pkgresourcesDistributionNotFound The prompttoolkit distribution was not found and is required by haxornews Fixed return value of safesplit function safesplit function return value is list type but If an exception occurs str type is returned At that time getcompletions completingsubcommandoption return in line This is the same as to return in completerpy line So If an exception occurs is returned in safesplit the behavior does not change Please confirm Fixed that arg is displayed even if the subcommand is wrong before hoge is wrong subcommand but arg suggestion limit int opt limits the posts displayed is displayed bash haxor hn hoge limit int opt limits the posts displayed after hoge is wrong subcommand so suggestion is not displayed bash haxor hn hoge Please confirm Upgrade to prompttoolkit As far as I could test it looks like most stuff is working fine I still have to check the ignorecase option I was about to leave an issue that the screenshots look nothing like the program But after some investigation I realized that I had installed hn from npm a completely separate program and it happened to be before your injected hn in the path I removed it and of course haxornews works beautifully I dont know if its possible or a good idea but it would be nice to check for dumb people like me who forget they installed or HN CLI clients at once
