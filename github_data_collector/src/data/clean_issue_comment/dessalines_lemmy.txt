Fixes The next button is always showing on the overviews Should be hidden when there is not enough content to warrant a next page Similar to the way Peertube does it post creation could have a language dropbown That would allow users to filter by language and only see those posts they can understand This would make it easier to have multiple different languages in the same servercommunity Reddit doesnt support this at all so users in other languages have to go to their own subreddit and all the big ones are completely dominated by English Honestly what you expect from an American company when it comes to language support so I think we can do much better There might be a way using the husky precommit checking for any changes in the translations folder and altering the translation report generator to manually edit the README This should have a good method to replace text between markers img webkitfilter blur px Would be cool if this could somehow be generated automatically Here is some discussion about it A whole lot of component updates based on issues mentioned in updated a long of translation elements with direct string translation functions this removes all the wrapper elements that are being added less elements in the DOM updated default div to main and aside for the layout added for attributes to all the labels and added ids to all the form elements these labels point to still have some components to go updated some level h headings to h and h proper styling for these need to be added quick fix centered the loading svg for the page load added arialabel to the hamburger menu So on maintsx and communitytsx add a radio button to switch between post or comment view with the sorting given by the other radio buttons Would be useful for the announcements community
