I just noticed that the MIT template starts with Copyright YEAR COPYRIGHT HOLDER Permission is hereby granted free of charge to any person so subject to the following conditions The above copyright

that the values for YEAR and COPYRIGHT HOLDER must be filled see I came across the need to load images from an object tag After not finding a good enough solution elsewhere I thought it would be a nice addition to the plugin For this to work there are two requirements There has to be an option objects true set in the imagesLoaded call The object tags need to have typeimage attribute specified to avoid unnecessary loading of objects There might be more issues that need to be covered if this is to be merged however I thought Id share in case anyone else needs that functionality Any thoughts welcome Hi great plugin been using it for ages but on a specific use case right now I need to know certain behaviours to solve a specific problem but reading your documentation you dont say much about the internal mechanisms Ive just experienced an issue Ive built a lazyloading image Vue component for a specific use case and I used imagesLoaded to detect when the image has loaded so that dimensions can be retrieved and manipulations can take place I when the load is triggered pass the img element directly to imagesLoadedel callback However in a strange twist the specific listeners on each img element fire when an image thats inside the Image Library popup component within the app is loaded even after the specific img passed to the imagesLoaded function has loaded The images loaded inside the Image library popup are different variations of the same images with a different resolution and different URLs Perhaps its some odd Vue quirk where it rerenders the components on the page when ImageLibrary component is shown and loads its own images But its certain that the components are not destroyed and recreated when this happens the imagesLoaded event simply fires again for the already loaded image when a different image is loaded in a specific context It isnt mentioned in the docs that you can pass the image element the examples you give are all container elements not individual img elements You did say in the imagesLoaded function definition in your docs elem Element NodeList Array or Selector String But it doesnt say HTMLImageElement even though it derives from Element Im thinking about changing the implementation so that I have an external system notifying the lazyload components when an image has loaded and the lazyload component can ask the external image manager to be told when the given image is loaded But you dont say if it knows new img elements are added or if Id have to remove and reattach the event in the instance of new images being inserted in order to detect them And on events if I just do imagesLoadedimg callback does the event listener remove itself after load In can infer that it doesnt from the problem posed above but the point is I had to infer it from observations Itd be really great of there was a nice full explanation of the librarys behaviours and the specifics of how it works I understand this takes a little bit of time but its the point that most documentation falls over on All of the examples are well and good but examples and much more can be derived from a good explanation of behaviour removing the need for all except the most rudimentary surface examples for those who quickly Googled a solution and copiedandpasted it Hi there have been using this for ages thanks so much For a current project I need to detect when images inside an SVG are loaded html svg version xmlns xmlnsxlink g image classlazyload xlinkhrefimagesimage jpg x y width height preserveAspectRatioxMidYMid sliceimage g g clippathurlicmask image classlazyload xlinkhrefimagesimage jpg x y width height preserveAspectRatioxMidYMid sliceimage g svg would be a very nice thing if you would add support for images with xlinkhref in imagesloaded I hope my question was clearby default it detects background images along with img Is it possible to detect only when bg images are loaded Is it possible check this Hello thanks for the great piece of the code of yours Though I found imagesloaded while in the background mode does not detect if the image is loaded Either it is or it is not or even when the element does not have any background the callback function signals in all the cases that the bg is loaded Here is the reduced test case on CodePen based on your recommended example Can you please kindly check and fix this or tell if I do something wrong Thanks again Val jQuery prior to v didn t support deferred objects but some very old CMS templates although a minority still rely on that version We recently ran into such a case where one of the Shopify s templates used jQuery When we added our custom gallery script which uses imagesloaded library and doesn t depend on jQuery at all vanilla JS it resulted in an error when imagesloaded tried to create a Deferred object This pull request fixes this issue It appears that images loaded through input typeimage elements are not considered by this library
