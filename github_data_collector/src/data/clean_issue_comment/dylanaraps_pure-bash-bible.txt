Whats the purpose of these instructions chapter i n in buildsh I run bash buildsh without them in ubuntu TLS x it get the same result sh usrbinenv bash Turn the single document bible into a book separated by chapters main rm rf manuscript mkdir p manuscript Split the READMEmd into chapters based on markers while IFS n read r line do chap chapter i line n line CHAPTER START chap line CHAPTER END chap i done READMEmd Write the chapters to separate files for i in chapter do chapter i n printf s n chapter i manuscriptchapteritxt printf s n chapteritxt manuscriptBooktxt done main None Would be neat to have a file that could be included from a bashrc eg source bashrcbashbible This could also be useful to reproducibility with testsh Many thanks for this great bible I have translated it in Turkish I am not sure about how you manage and list translations of this document so I created this PR The Turkish translation is in READMEtrmd READMEtrmd file If this structure is not ok for you Turkish translation will be kept in my fork This is very likely not perfect but it seems to pass any RGB color I throw at it sh rgb hsl usage rgb hsl r g b rgbtohsl local r g b local h s l local min max Ensure input is greater than rr gg bb Ensure input is lesser than rr r gg g bb b Convert RGB value to a range This is usually a range but we multiply by to fake floating point rr gg bb Give the min variable the maximum possible value We must set it to something min Find the minimum and maximum RGB values for use below minr min r min maxr max r max ming min g min maxg max g max minb min b min maxb max b max Calculate the luminace using the above values lmin max Calculate the saturation using a different formula based on its value Again we multiply the values by to fake floating points smin max l max min max min max min max min Calculate the hue based on which RGB value is the maximum hs r max g b max min g max b r max min b max r g max min Convert the calculation result into degrees Divide by to reverse the floating point hacks hh printf s n h s l rgbtohsl Include prepend function as described here sh prepend printf ss Use exec to redirect all shell output thereafter Hey dylanaraps I think is super useful thanks for making it I was wondering if you could add a bit on your rationale for using usrlbinenv bash instead This is generally my thoughts but Im not a bash expert Add a method to turn off text effects
