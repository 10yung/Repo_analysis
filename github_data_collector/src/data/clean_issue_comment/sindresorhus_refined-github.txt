 Thanks for contributing Closes Closes Does this PR closefix an existing issue Put it here Eg Closes Test List some URLs that reviewers can use to test your PR I felt that the errors could be more detailed and helpful img width src Thanks for reporting a bug Make sure the bug is caused by Refined GitHub Try disabling the extension first Include a full URL where the bug appears Include a screenshotgif Issues without a URLscreenshot will be closed Response code Bad Request json error errors domain global reason badRequest message Publish condition not met The single purpose description is required A justification for activeTab is required A justification for the broad host permission is required A justification for remote script is required code message Publish condition not met The single purpose description is required A justification for activeTab is required A justification for the broad host permission is required A justification for remote script is required Example URL Editdelete file links are already there but theyre not active IMO it would be useful to be able to quickly edit files from there if you notice some error in files Of course that link should only be active when you can edit the head branch Edit I also noticed that View file link there doesnt link you to branch but to commit so that makes it take even longer to edit a file GitHub implemented a more generic ie less efficient version of tagchangeloglink img width alt src Their feature is not a strict replacement but now tagchangeloglink needs to be moved above it or alternative solutions welcome Test Visit the Branches page of a repo you own Resize the window to less than px of width Click the Delete icon The branch is deleted but the icon is still shown yo In the gif I click the icon again and the site obviously throws an error A solution would still be preferred to be CSSonly When creating or editing a release ctrlenter or cmdenter wont do anything Normally this shortcut is set to submit the form from textarea elements like when creating a new issue leaving a comment leaving a review etc but it doesnt work when creating a release Example URL Thanks for reporting a bug Make sure the bug is caused by Refined GitHub Try disabling the extension first Include a full URL where the bug appears Include a screenshotgif Issues without a URLscreenshot will be closed There should be a space between the branch pull down menu and the corresponding open linked PR If you turn the addon off the PR button moves to the right which looks better no space See v Related to Closes Please review and suggest further copy or explanation you think its needed here Thanks for contributing Currently the link to create a PAT for Refined Twitter encompasses the entire Repo scope There is currently a link provided within the extensions options to the functions accessing the API but its not immediately clear which access scope each one requires ie repostatus repodeployment publicrepo repoinvite I think it would be ideal to document these specifics and even the need for a Personal Access Token in the READMEmd instead of users finding out once they open the extension options for the first time Adding the required scope after each feature requiring it would be nice for those that like to limit PAT auth access without them having to dig through the source code I realize that the Repo scope isnt very invasive but it would have been nice to know and have documented up front Cheers Please specify a URL where the feature should appear
