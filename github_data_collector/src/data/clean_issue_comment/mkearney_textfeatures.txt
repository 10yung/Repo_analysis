Thank you so much for your excellent work on this package I have some questions about the way the w results are presenteddocumented The function documentation uses some language about word vec but in the functions that create these results only functions from text vec for topic modeling are called not any vector embedding functions The text vec package has functions for LDA topic modeling and also for word embeddings specifically an implementation of GloVe If I am understanding correctly it looks like only the first are used in this package but the language describing the results refers to the second What are your thoughts on this Do you think the language and naming should be updated Provides a concrete example for within documentation I would be happy to work on a PR with a more traditional interface modeling function predict method if that is something you would like sorry for such a lame pull request Hi Could you explainclarify how to apply train preprocessing to new data newdata If a textfeaturesmodel is supplied to text supply this with new data to which you would like to apply the textfeaturesmodel Cause after textfeatures function I get a data frame Im missing some information about where the politenessdict is coming from If you supply the source I dont mind adding the documentation
