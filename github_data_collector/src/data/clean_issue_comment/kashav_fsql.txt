 Super cool tool you made thanks kshvmdn I would like to see some plugins how to extend the fsql for example git can find uncommit unstage files ref tag can find with macOS filefolder with tag exif can find photos with exif query As requested this PR was created to replace the name property with the path property as an interim solution to relative path indicators A simple SELECT query should be able to identify the relative path of a file which should include its folder name Example fsql SELECT from Usersvagrantjenkins prints rwrr Dec b configxml instead of rwrr Dec b jobs configxml what if i want to find which file contains the specific string just like in IDE Would you mind add update support to this tool egupdate dest xxxx to copy select result file to dest folder or delete from where XXX I just want this tool long ago Thanks in advance If I run a query like in the README gif it works fsql SELECT from WHERE name LIKE mkv AND size gb lots of results but taking away the name LIKE mkv clause breaks it fsql SELECT from WHERE size gb strconvParseFloat parsing gb invalid syntax Introduce subqueries to be used in condition statements example sql SELECT name FROM foo WHERE name NOT IN SELECT name FROM bar WHERE date This shouldnt be too hard to implement First step is to introduce an IN operator for stringsnumbers The operator will return true if current the value is in the provided list The subquery should be evaluated individually It returns a Result for all files that passed the query a Result struct holds each of the applicable attributes for a single file Now we can apply IN to this result list Idea from
