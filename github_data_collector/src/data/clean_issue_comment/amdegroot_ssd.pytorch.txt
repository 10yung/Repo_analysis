I want to train on custom dataset with VOC format Hi I downloaded VOC dataset and ran a training with original trainpy but got an error nefteprovodssdpytorch python trainpy homekarinanefteprovodssdpytorchssdpy UserWarning volatile was removed and now has no effect Use with torchnograd instead selfpriors Variableselfpriorboxforward volatileTrue Loading base network Initializing weights trainpy UserWarning nninitxavieruniform is now deprecated in favor of nninitxavieruniform initxavieruniformparam Loading the dataset Training SSD on VOC Using the specified args Namespacebasenetvgg reducedfcpth batchsize cudaTrue datasetVOC datasetroothomekarinanefteprovodssdpytorchdataVOCdevkit gamma lr momentum numworkers resumeNone savefolderweights startiter visdomFalse weightdecay trainpy UserWarning volatile was removed and now has no effect Use with torchnograd instead targets Variableanncuda volatileTrue for ann in targets usrlocallibpython distpackagestorchnnreductionpy UserWarning sizeaverage and reduce args will be deprecated please use reductionsum instead warningswarnwarningformatret Traceback most recent call last File trainpy line in module train File trainpy line in train lossl lossc criterionout targets File usrlocallibpython distpackagestorchnnmodulesmodulepy line in call result selfforwardinput kwargs File homekarinanefteprovodssdpytorchlayersmodulesmultiboxlosspy line in forward lossc pos filter out pos boxes for now IndexError The shape of the mask at index does not match the shape of the indexed tensor at index do you have any ideas what to do I checked these two file and find many common codes so I am confused about the differences Also I find some Inconsistency in these codes is someone have the same question with me thx How to achieve realtime detectionThanks I only see the iters in the code and i find this thing epochsize lendataset argsbatchsize but the value of epochsize is I feel it is too big is this number the real epochsize The following errors were encountered in training PyTorch python Traceback most recent call last File trainpy line in module train File trainpy line in train ssdnet buildssdtrain cfg mindim cfg numclasses File mediadiskwudissdpytorchssdpy line in buildssd base extras head multiboxvggbase strsize File mediadiskwudissdpytorchssdpy line in vgg conv d nnConv dinchannels v kernelsize padding File mediadiskwudilocallibpython sitepackagestorchnnmodulesconvpy line in init False pair groups bias paddingmode File mediadiskwudilocallibpython sitepackagestorchnnmodulesconvpy line in init outchannels inchannels groups kernelsize RuntimeError CUDA error out of memory What is the reason for this mistake Thanks I met this error in training Original Traceback most recent call last File mediadiskwudilocallibpython sitepackagestorchutilsdatautilsworkerpy line in workerloop data fetcherfetchindex File mediadiskwudilocallibpython sitepackagestorchutilsdatautilsfetchpy line in fetch data selfdataset idx for idx in possiblybatchedindex File mediadiskwudilocallibpython sitepackagestorchutilsdatautilsfetchpy line in listcomp data selfdataset idx for idx in possiblybatchedindex File mediadiskwudiSSDssddatadatasetsvocpy line in getitem boxes labels selftargettransformboxes labels File mediadiskwudiSSDssddatatransformstargettransformpy line in call selfcornerformpriors selfiouthreshold File mediadiskwudiSSDssdutilsboxutilspy line in assignpriors besttargetperprior besttargetperpriorindex iousmax RuntimeError cannot perform reduction function max on tensor with no elements because the operation does not have an identity Why does this occur Thanks Hi the version of my pytorch is and the python version is when I run the code y netx which is for the detection the warning is arise UserWarning Legacy autograd function with nonstatic forward method is deprecated and will be removed in Please use newstyle autograd function with static forward method Example I am very confused about how to solve that problem so is there anyone have a clue Dear all I am running SSD on a custom chest Xray dataset preprocessed as VOC format so far trainpy testpy and demopy works well while for the evalpy I am getting the results as follows VOC metric Yes Reading annotation for Reading annotation for Reading annotation for Saving cached annotations to homeyuyangdataVOCdevkitVOCNIH annotationscacheannotspkl AP for atelectasis AP for cardiomegaly AP for effusion AP for infiltrate AP for mass AP for nodule AP for pneumonia AP for pneumothorax Mean AP Results Does anyone know how may I solve the issue Thanks
