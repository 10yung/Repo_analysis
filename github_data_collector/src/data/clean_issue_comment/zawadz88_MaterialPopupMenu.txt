i need change text size Sometimes we would like to have our own very customized view to show in the popup Please offer what you have today with the nice alignment autopositioning etc for a more generic popup Currently the only documentation available is in Github README Theres also Github Pages with Dokka documentation and a sample app with most APIs covered but it feels to me that the documentation should be better There were many new features added recently but the documentation in README does not cover it at the moment A better more organized documentation might decrease the initial learning curve and make finding available APIs easier It should probably be moved to Github pages I dont feel like we should clutter README too much Ideally I would like to have README similar to this and wiki page generated by Asciidoctor like here I want to be able to modify the UI elements in the popup menu when the user clicks on them however I cant do this right now because they private I think it would be better if they were public so that we could modify them or offer users a different way to modify them On the native framework if you dragtouch from the overflow menu you can still select an item This means a single touch is needed to show the popup till you select an item from it Is it possible to do it here too Ive tested the sample and it seems it doesnt work this way
