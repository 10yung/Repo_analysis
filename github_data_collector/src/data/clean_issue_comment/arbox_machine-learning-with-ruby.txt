My team is writing a recommender system using collaborative filtering and data scientists at our institution have suggest this is the algorithm we need to use Is there one that could be included here And if not would you be interested in listing ours if we find we must invent our own Thanks Dear ML in Ruby Gist contributors especially mohawkjohn stympy irfansharif gbuesing jjgh v dro giuse Im the curator of the RubyNLP list and Im glad to welcome you all to the new community effort to collect and curate ML related resources in Ruby After the initial talk to gbuesing Ive decided to make the next step and convert the gist to an Awesome List Why it could be useful In my opinion please correct me we all need a central place for information about special applications like ML NLP DataScience where Ruby can compete with eg Python sciruby makes great work on developing tools but therere plenty of other resources which should be collected described tested and represented among Rubyists and Developers using other technologies I can take the role of the list curator but I definitely lack all you expertise and dont have the wide horizon to find and review all the possible projects So if you find this project useful please contribute spread the word and use it My plan is to support the lists for NLP ML Data Science Ruby Interoperability These lists are not programming projects which propel Ruby over night They are not a new killer app like Rails But they are still very useful as documentation and a stable basis for a steady and long term development Thank your for your participation Any ideas
