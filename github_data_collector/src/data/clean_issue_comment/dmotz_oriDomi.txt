Im currently trying to update the code to just use the foldUp and accordion methods and rotate specifically between those two I want the accordion to fold out at a specific angle instead of a randomly generated angle as well as have the method function switch between foldUp and accordion and not be randomly generated function documentaddEventListenerDOMContentLoaded function var demos methods demos new OriDomipapermap vPanels ripple true setTimeoutfunction demos accordion methods accordion foldUp return documentgetElementByIdcontentaddEventListenerclick functione var angle el method n if el etargetclassName button return n elgetAttributedatan method methods MathabsMathfloorMathrandom methodslength Mathrandom angle demos n method method foldUp angle void if method foldUp angle return elparentNodegetElementsByClassNamelabel innerHTML method angle false callthis Theres the updated code Every time I try to specifically define the angle it throws this error Cannot set property innerHTML of undefined relating to the demos n function Could you point me in the right direction for switching between the two specific methods with preset angles I have downloaded and used this library and had a lot of fun But I have an issue that we can only manipulate one side I have a requirement in which I want to manipulate and apply oridomi functions to all the sides of the div I want to ask if it is possible if yes then how and if not then why Thank you I pulled this out of my other issue because it is unrelated Tested on firefox that this works okay too glitchy on chrome to test well the mouse dragging animation just snaps into place and if folding is triggered by JS then it goes too fast to catch in chrome foldedaccordion works smoothly foldedaccordion happens instantly foldedunfold halfway works The first unfold motion glitches then the remainder are okay my intuition is that it is diving behind other DOM elements even though the container has a zindex of yeah this is the case I can test with foldedramp versus foldedramp In firefox everything is aokay in Chrome only foldedramp is okay because it goes towards the viewer instead of foldedramp which dives behind other elements Hello thank you for this library I have encountered an issue with my implementation i would like to use Oridomi to showhide additional information in a list Is there a way to remove the space taken on the flight by the element being closed Here a sample of my problem First off this is a superb plugin thank you One question if I have three custom panels is there a way to keep the last panel from changing perspective so that it appears flat during animation Im trying to do this so that the flow of the page appears to be pushing the page down edit just to elaborate after reading the docs the Custom Behaviour looks like it will do what Im after For example if you wanted to create a foldin effect that keeps the first and last panels flat against the page surface So Im after an accordion effect with panels the last panel to appear flat Not sure how to implement any suggestions Hi there Ive been having quite a bit of fun with OriDomi thanks for making it available to us I have however encountered an issue with one implementation in particular that I was hoping to execute I would like to have an OriDomi overlaying another aligned element such that folding it up would more or less seamlessly reveal whats beneath Unfortunately after OriDomi has done its magic on my overlay DOM element it no longer aligns with whats beneath You can see more specifically what Im talking about in this fiddle Youll notice that if you comment out the OriDomi JS the vertical columns line up perfectly Let me know if you have any suggestions for me It would be great if there was a way for the element as it is unfolding to have other element appear connected to it for things like folding menus the way the main application looks attached to the menu in this video After binding oriDomi to an element a strange amount of whitespace appears at the bottom of the container Before Binding before accordion After Binding after accordion well its kinda hard to explain what i mean so i just post screenshots firefox in firefox and chrome for comparison how it should be in chrome in firefox the last fold somehow goes to the top only tested with firefox nightly a dont know if it happens in other versions too
