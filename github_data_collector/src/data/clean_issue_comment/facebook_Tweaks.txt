Hi I am trying to add tweaks in swift so cant use macros I am able to add text and switch type tweaks but not able to add action Although in swift there are more option with SwiftTweaks I dont want to add another pod This is how I am trying can somebody please tell what I am doing wrong let tweak FBTweakidentifier key tweakname key tweakdefaultValue debugPrinthello value UIApplicationtopViewControllernavigationControllerpushViewControllerAnalyticsLogTableViewController animated true There are more within the pod but these are especially annoying because by being in public headers they propagate to my project img width altscreen shot at pm src img width altscreen shot at pm src img width altscreen shot at pm src Changes Fixes color test Reviewers grp After upgrading iOS to Beta A g the voidmotionBeganUIEventSubtypemotion withEventUIEvent event method on FBTweakShakeWindow is never called Allow the shake to be disabled in the simulator too This is useful especially if you want to show the React Native Developer menu in the simulator with a shake gesture while also using Tweaks shakeEnabled is already defaulted to YES load takes ms or more on an iPhone Although we only use it internally it creates a discrepancy between our internal app and our production app Could we move all that code out and execute it in the background soon after app startup I used FBTweakAction macro to add items in the FBTweakViewController but now its empty after using useframeworks in Podfile to load other Swift libraries I looked into this and I found that dladdr returns NULL in FBTweakInilinem by some reason that I dont clearly understand I know that I can fix this by avoiding using FBTweakAction macro but I wonder if theres better way to fix it Thanks in advance Hi when address sanitizing is turned on we get a crash at line of FBTweakInlinem where it says FBTweakCategory category store tweakCategoryWithNameentrycategory Were also looking at a memory corruption issue in our app thats present in debug when tweaks is enabled but not in production when tweaks is disabled Do you think Tweaks is causing some sort of memory corruption Current version of Tweaks displays warnings in your project when the pod is added So we have got ahead and fix the warnings in the header files Also since we were here we thought it would be nice to fix the rest of the warnings in FBTweak and FBTweakExample projects But happy to roll back these changes see commits if not a good idea Devs emmaviolet ecaselles is too long for trigger tweak view controller with a vibrate to notify trigger is cool
