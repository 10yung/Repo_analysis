 Hi Thank you for making this useful codes open source Im glad I found a small room for improvement in the code and be able to suggest a change Currently VoiceOver users cannot access placeholder information Even tough placeholder textview shouldnt be selectable for voiceOver users as discussed in its information still should be delivered to them With this implementation UITextViewPlaceholder acts just like UITextField in terms of VoiceOver experience Add backgroundColor into observingKeys so the KVO will observe it and set selfplaceholderTextViewbackgroundColor selfbackgroundColor in voidupdatePlaceholderTextView so the background color of placeholderTextView can be the same as the super TextView screen shot at am I use auto layout and when a view is aligned to the bottom of the text view it cuts off the placeholder label My project is in ObjectiveC I got an error UITextViewPlaceholderUITextViewPlaceholderh file not found after importing this library by pod install Then I found that the right way to import UITextViewPlaceholderUITextViewPlaceholderh Expect to add another item in the Usage section like the following Import Dynamic Framework eg If youre using CocoaPods with useframeworks flag import UITextViewPlaceholder Import Static Library import UITextViewPlaceholderUITextViewPlaceholderh Import by pod import UITextViewPlaceholderUITextViewPlaceholderh Bug There is a bug where a font attributed is ignored when using attributedPlaceholder The UITextViews font is used instead Fix Checks to see if there is font set on the attributed placeholder If so we use that If not we fall back and use the UITextViews font instead when project has more category for UITextView now set data method will be crash The initial value of textViewtext is not empty Then edit textViewtext to empty the code for setting the font cannot be executed when updating the placeholders This results in inconsistencies between textViewfont and selfplaceholderLabelfont
