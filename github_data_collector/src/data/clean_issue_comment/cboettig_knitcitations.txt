Hi I am currently coauthoring an R Markdown Cookbook and thought this would be a nice package to include as an alternative to the typical bibliography workflow Will be looking to play around with the package as I have not previously used the package but I just wanted to check the status of the project The repository looks like it is in a good state If you were interested in it being included would it be possible to use content from your README file Another alternative would be for you to write updated content if you were interested Let me know your thoughts Thanks Michael Here is my reproducible example When I use citep with the citation function I get an error Im running Windows R RStudio My sessionInfo is listed below along with the code that produces the error Error in ncharaut invalid multibyte string element Note citep works fine for most of the other packages Im currently citing in my project I would appreciate any suggestions on how to fix this citation for the

work before citepdoi works but then bibliography returns the error mentioned above if I use writebibtex it does write the bib file correctly citing R packages works btw I am the only one with the problem Date not in most recent DESCRIPTION file Open Id like to use knitcitation outside RStudio specifically in the CRAN build and check process using an Rmd file I have the vignetteEngine set to knitr In the vignette Im doing r setup echo FALSE suppressPackageStartupMessageslibraryknitcitations cleanbib jnk readbibtexunmixingbib and then where I want an inline citation Im doing r citepSomeAuthor But the system doesnt see my bib file doing this I dont think readbibtex was really intended for use this way Since it is the CRAN system I dont think I can do any yaml Is this possible Or is another package the better way to go Thanks Dear Dr Boettiger First of all thanks for providing this package its really quite useful for me Ive been using the citep function in my text and it works well however when trying to use the bibliography command I can only get the plain noargument version to run bibliography I tried using bibliographyhtml but that throws error messages Error in mgetnom envir BibOptions invalid first argument Calls Anonymous bibliography PrintBibliography BibOptions mget I also tried using bibliographystyle nature sorting ynt which generated this message Error in catlist file sep fill labels append argument type list cannot be handled by cat Calls Anonymous withCallingHandlers withVisible eval eval bibliography cat Id appreciate any advice you might have in fixing these issues Best Lina PS this is the output of sessionInfo in case it is useful sessionInfo R Under development unstable r Platform x appledarwin bit Running under OS X El

and Macro Evidence on Labor Supply author Raj Chetty institution National Bureau of Economic Research type Working Paper series Working Paper Series number year month December doi w URL abstract How can price elasticities be identified when agents face optimization frictions such as adjustment costs or inattention I derive bounds on structural price elasticities that are a function of the observed effect of a price change on demand the size of the price change and the degree of frictions The degree of frictions is measured by the utility losses agents tolerate to deviate from the frictionless optimum The bounds imply that frictions affect intensive margin elasticities much more than extensive margin elasticities I apply these bounds to the literature on labor supply The utility costs of ignoring the tax changes used to identify intensive margin labor supply elasticities are typically less than of earnings As a result small frictions can explain the differences between micro and macro elasticities extensive and intensive margin elasticities and other disparate findings Pooling estimates from existing studies I estimate a Hicksian labor supply elasticity of on the intensive margin and on the extensive margin after accounting for frictions I am seeing this error on my Windows machine but not Mac I am assuming some settings on my RstudioR installation with regard to UTFE encoding is screwed up I think the output of rcitepcitationpander is causing this problem the xf If anyone please direct me to the right direction to solve this that would be great
