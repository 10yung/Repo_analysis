Hi Im trying to get the addon to work with OF on Mac OS Mojave All the examples seem to compile fine but the console gives me this This is for the blink example exampleblinkDebug CMIOUnitScopeElementh SafeGetElement Throwing err exampleblinkDebug CMIOUnitFigBaseObjectImplc CMIOUnitCreateFromDescription Invalid paramater exampleblinkDebug CMIOUnitInputDevicecpp GetPropertyInfo CMIOUInputFromProcsGetPropertyInfo failed for id Error Then it seems like no processing happens tracking not working but everything else seem to work fine The weird thing is that it worked the very first time i used it then nothing I tried using the nightly builds OFxCV uses some conversions macros which are not recognised by the nightly builds convert to Gray using the release tagged clean and re run the example compile for debugg for release run executable inside the packages as admin None of it has worked so far Help Thanks for the great work though P Cheers srcmaincpp homeshankofworkspaceaddonsofxFaceTrackerlibsFaceTrackerincludeFaceTrackerIOh fatal error opencvopencvh No such file or directory include opencvcvh compilation terminated make homeshankofworkspacelibsopenFrameworksCompiledprojectmakefileCommoncompileprojectmk objlinux Releasesrcmaino Error make Leaving directory homeshankofworkspaceaddonsofxFaceTrackerexampleblink make homeshankofworkspacelibsopenFrameworksCompiledprojectmakefileCommoncompileprojectmk Release Error HI Im using OpenFrameworks v in Visual Studio When I want to try the example exampleoverlay I find the following error c ofv vs ofv vs apps myapps exampleoverlay src FaceOverlayh error C xy is not a member of glm tvec float compiling source file src maincpp c ofv vs ofv vs libs glm include glm detail typevechpp note see declaration of glm tvec float compiling source file src maincpp c ofv vs ofv vs apps myapps exampleoverlay src FaceOverlayh error C FaceOverlay determinant function does not take arguments compiling source file src maincpp Distancecpp c ofv vs ofv vs apps myapps exampleoverlay src FaceOverlayh error C xy is not a member of glm tvec float compiling source file src ofAppcpp c ofv vs ofv vs libs glm include glm detail typevechpp note see declaration of glm tvec float compiling source file src ofAppcpp c ofv vs ofv vs apps myapps exampleoverlay src FaceOverlayh error C FaceOverlay determinant function does not take arguments compiling source file src ofAppcpp Does anyone know why error Remove more swizzles see I see there is a ofxFacetracker IOS repo here can you add some documentation of how to make this work on IOS I would like to use it with the current master of OF as well as with some other addons so I need to go from scratch with the project generator In some cases where high framerate tracking is not required eg the main work is being done on the applications other threads and you just need a check for faces every half second or so then with threaded face tracking it can be very useful to sleep the thread for a few milliseconds in its loop to effectively make it run at a lower framerate than the main application This pull request incorporates an optional int forceWaitTime into the setup function for the threaded face tracker without breaking the more usual use case It looks like auto leftEye trackergetImageFeatureofxFaceTrackerLEFTEYETOPgetCentroid D auto rightEye trackergetImageFeatureofxFaceTrackerRIGHTEYETOPgetCentroid D they both return the same position Also trackerdraw should draw all the features detected At the moment is just drawing the nose base and the mouth bakercp as Ive seen that you updated the example recently does exampleempty draw all the features or just the nose and the mouth This example does not compile OF OS Ubuntu error Sourcesofv linux gcc releaseaddonsofxFaceTrackerexamplecalibratedsrcofAppcpp error undefined reference to convertFromIndicesofMeshglmtvec float glmprecision glmtvec float glmprecision ofColorfloat glmtvec float glmprecision const Sourcesofv linux gcc releaseaddonsofxFaceTrackerexamplecalibratedsrcofAppcpp error undefined reference to buildNormalsofMeshglmtvec float glmprecision glmtvec float glmprecision ofColorfloat glmtvec float glmprecision Hi all Is it possible to get the head d coordinates xyz I would like to use the head position as a d particle attractor Any tips on how to achieve this Best
