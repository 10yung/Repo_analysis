Hey I just want to report a warning raised by visjs sinve this module tends to pass invalid parameters visjs Invalid type received for container Expected dom Received undefined undefined Problem value found at options configure container visjs Invalid type received for code Expected string Received undefined undefined Problem value found at options nodes icon code visjs Errors have been found in the supplied options object For parameter code the solution was simply passing undefined with extra quotes so it becomes a string after parsed by visjs For parameter container this simple fix didnt work even though their code should be able to accept undefined I was able to fix it like this visJSmodulevisjsnetwork nodesdict edgesdict graphidtitle containerfmynetworktitle nodeiconcodeundefined Would be nice to have this fixed Greetings Thomas I am plotting multiple frames in one notebook using different gaphid for each frame The graphs work in the notebook but not if I export the notebook to HTML Only the last graph will show Also any idea how I can export to html without having to save the style file in the same folder I would like to show some of the notebooks the same way you show your examples Thank you making a proper package so it can be installed via pip git right now the version on PyPI is out of date and not tracking this repository this will allow someone to install from github source right now pip install loads a deprecated version that will not import I encountered this with a newer version of Jupyter notebook I think it has to do with a change of the Tornado version This is how to replicate pull the most recent image from Docker days old at the time of writing docker run p jupyterscipynotebook c e b a do a pip install visJS jupyter Next follow the basic example Use f to look at the console error The line is crashes on is function init windowparentsetUpFrame return true I believe that using iframe sandboxallowsameorigin may solve it but it may need to be called from the Jupyter notebook rather than the iframe itself In any case the current implementation looks broken My way of solving it was to go back to an older version of the notebook stack I still had an months old image cached at my system so Im unable to give you the tag number that works Hi I have a problem with displaying graphs on the cells I am using Python and Anaconda When I run examples from notebooks folder I get an empty cell default But if I export data to a separate HTML file and open it in a browser its OK default What can I do to see the content right on the Jupyter Notebook cells I am using Python and Networkx I am able to do the imports and I converted the edges Gedges to a list and added positions for xy for each node as in nodesdict idnxpos n ypos n for n in nodes to make it work When I try to display the graph using visJSmodulevisjsnetworknodesdict edgesdict timestamp it shows the plot area but nothing else it is not zoomable nor contains the graph
