Added ability to compile with assembly references by looking in the csproj Added command to build the ILStrip project as the GenerateTrimmedMscorlip build command for BlazorHost depends on it A basic and a bit crude implementation of a FromAttribute attribute for component parameters This PR requires the corlib changes of the corlib and JIT updates PR for it to work relies on some basic reflection This makes the PInvoke interface work again No idea is this will be useful but it really does put things back to working in a pure DNA built on to run on the command line I think that adding in the extra params was the main mistake This makes the PInvoke fall in to a little heap on the floor I think making an extra attribute or calling convention for the C side would be a better method for getting this working More metadata would allow you to automagically add the extra params when they are required Simple fix for the underlying issue of the bug described here because the DotNetAnywhere runtime crashes if you try to put a delegate instance as a key into a Dictionary and then check whether dictContainsKeythatDelegate Tested with code like this csharp Action actionA new ActionTestMethod Action actionB new ActionSomeOtherMethod Action actionC new ActionTestMethod same Target as actionA Before the fix calling Equals give the error Opcode not available x c ConsoleWriteLineactionAEqualsactionB actionAEqualsactionB False ConsoleWriteLineactionAEqualsactionC actionAEqualsactionC True To properly allow DNA to handle boxingunboxing of IntPtr support would have to be added for JITBOXPTR probably here UNBOX CIL opcode CILUNBOXANY is already supported Here are a few fixes and updates to the corlib and JIT Better C support added some missing JIT features some bug fixes and updates Added F support uses custom FSharpCore see here for a working example Tried my best to keep the corlib light its still around k in release mode Release build assemblies now work too after JIT bugfixes I see you added CLR debugging in the browser thats awesome For details see This has already been rebased onto a recent commit from the Hackathon repo
