any chance for rhel centos and fedora support if not any chance on build instructions When I try to clone repo it blows up saying user not found It looks like the code first checks to see if the user exists and if not found it blows up It should be able to clone a repo for a user that doesnt exist and then simply create the user afterwards Currently to achieve nested aliases we have to embed entire case switch statement inside the aliases file that pick up the aliasing parts Might be awesome to be able to create nested aliases Would allow us to create very advanced aliases If you run aliases rehash and a new alias isnt created its hard to see why Maybe we could add a debug or trace or something so you can see exactly whats happening Proposal smartdynamic autocompletion of aliases Problem If I have an alias g that completes to git I dont see the git bash completion Solution Dynamically work out the command being entered and direct the bash completion to the right command Proposal enable parent aliases Problem If the working dir is codemycoolapp and I have a aliases file there but Im in the test dir I want to be able to use the aliases in the parent dir Solution Similar to git if the current dir isnt git initialized it will go up the dir tree until it finds one Proposal man pages to enhance the documenation Problem The cli command descriptions only allow line of text Solution Using man pages will allow us to describe the commands in more detail and provide clear examples of how you can use the commands in different situations Proposal Increased cli for aliases remove Currently aliases remove only takes an alias name User story As a user I want to be able to remove user aliases or directory specific aliases via the cli So I dont have to manually edit the aliases file Suggested cli enhancements remove for a user aliases remove user superman fly remove for a directory this does not allow a local option aliases remove directory codesuperman fly remove for local directory this does not allow a directory option aliases remove local fly remove for directory and user this does not allow a local option aliases remove directory codesuperman user superman fly remove for local dir and user this does not allow a directory option aliases remove local user superman fly Proposal Interactive mode when executing an alias Problem Depending on how you use aliases things can get quite abstracted You can nest aliases use positional parameters pass through arguments etc An interactive mode would help to break down aliases into each of their steps with confirmation at each step Eg Imagine I have an alias console console maps to buildcontainer runcontainer bundle exec rails console buildcontainer maps to docker build t myimage runcontainer maps to docker run ti v PWDcode myimage If I want to understand the magic behind the console curtain a user could set export ALIASESINTERACTIVEtrue and then when they run console at each step before execution the user sees the current stdout and stderr and the proposed command and gets to choose whether they want to continue or not This proposed command will include any positional params or arguments included so basically if the user copied it and run it in another shell it would work Proposal aliases search So this is just documenting mu thought process around this Given you can clone a user and it automatically looks for users in githubcomusernamedotaliases Example commandusage aliases search git commit introduced string This under the covers makes an external request to an aliases search server which caches all known external aliases and returns results that match the query string How does the cache get built When a user aliases clone successfully a ping is sent to the aliases search server to index that user What does the search search use as search data It uses all the current data about an alias but we also add a description field to allow for free text What can a user do once they have found an alias they want to use Copy it locally straight copy of the alias to a local userdirectory Clone it clone the users alias and there can a further update process that can keep it in sync with prompts to confirm as this could be dangerous Use it once maybe copy it to clipboard or something
