 Describe the bug An error occurs when adding a layer without data Having no data to display can be common in interactive environments To Reproduce r librarysf Linking to GEOS GDAL PROJ librarymapdeck sf sfstassf capitals coords clon lat mapdeck addscatterplot data headsf radius fillcolour country layerid scatterlayer tooltip capital Error in rcpppointgeojsondata l geometrycolumn digits scatterplot getCharCE must be called on a CHARSXP supCreated on by the reprex package v sup Expected behaviour The layer to be added to the plot without any data to display Versions Current dev version Is there a way to change the basemap language so that the labels from Mapbox appear in another language Capture Resolves Upstream branch can be updated when the appropriate merge destination is created Resolves This PR replaces to merge from the appropriate branch related What do you want the feature to do Add support for the icon layer Related to and any reason why these were closed Do you have a desired interface for adding these icons I expect something similar to addscatterplot with additional arguments for the icon Perhaps auto packing icons will be the simplest place to start and the default interface for users where the icon variable input is simply the path to the image What do you want the feature to do Add the H hexagon layer Happy to help with this I briefly tried to add support for it but the input structure for the geometry is nonstandard enough that I wanted to get your opinions before going further Some potential nuances for supporting this layer Geometry data for h is a character vector and not a recognised sf geometry expect df data input not sf Computing the bounding box for the h hexagons may require converting the hexagons twice Once in RRcpp for computing bbox second in deckgl to add it to the map is this necessary To work with requires so I can downcast sfcMULTIPOINT objects What do you want the feature to do We want to control the dual map view by using the package mapdeck And also from shiny environment we want to do it As a example attached is what we want to do test Is it possible Could you suggest any idea SymbolixAU Thank you so much
