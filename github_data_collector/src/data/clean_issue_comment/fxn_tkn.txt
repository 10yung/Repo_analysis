Ruby novice here How do I use this awesome tool I have Ruby p installed on my Mac I ran sudo gem install bundler to get bundler then I ran bundler install from the root to install all dependencies Then I went into the examples folder and ran ruby constantautoloadinginrubyonrailsrb and got this error constantautoloadinginrubyonrailsrb in main undefined method center for mainObject NoMethodError Terminals such as xterm allows one to show true images using sixel graphics Since you are already supporting images in iTerm any chance of supporting images in linux using libsixel This PR maps keyboard shortcut v to open the slide deck in VISUAL or EDITOR or vim If the editor is any of vim joe or nano the cursor is placed at the start of the current slide For that purpose slide hash keeps record of line numbers where the slides are defined This is useful when reviewing slides to fix typos during presentation to add notes etc right into the presentation Making a mistake with search regexp resulted in tkn bailing out This PR adds beginrescue block to display any such error and continue as if nothing happened
