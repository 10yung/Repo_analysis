Let see if we can clean up a bit here and there to make future work easier Synopsis We might face capacity shortages when it comes to bring nodes active on both sides clearnet tor network Thats why it would make sense to introduce dynamic nodes for them who have to use the clearnet mode since the node would now be shared between both networks by default Which makes it easy to share blocks etc throughout both networks Right now you have to solely build your tor proxy on top of a clearnet node in order to archieve this very approach Which isnt quite easy for exchanges andor miners to handle thus I would suggest to activate the dynamic network Technical Idea Clearnet vs TorNet your node other clearnet nodes proxy nodes all nodes tor node tor nodes Dynamic Networking keeps tor networking removes the restrictions from clearnet routes your dyn node other clearnet nodes tor node tor nodes Adding more than digits for parsing amounts Issue For Release Hashes shown are SHA yet are referenced as SHA BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE Hash SHA d c ab b d a c f f d e d b bc e dd verge osxunsigneddmg a f bc e ac ed f ac c fd e c f verge osx targz d c f f c eb c c af f d aa ffb ba a c cb d verge win debugzip b e bede e e a ba ea c c e d eaadcb c verge win setupunsignedexe a a d ccffdc cc a c fc eea e ab e a f verge win zip d f d c d afb c c ff e fd bf e fbddfdf e verge x linuxgnudebugtargz c d fbce a d a fa df b e aa e c a a dae e dd verge x linuxgnutargz d ff f b b b a fe b c d a fa a f bbe verge targz BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE
