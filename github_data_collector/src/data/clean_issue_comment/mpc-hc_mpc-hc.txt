Steroscopic D video and images Specifically Side by Side usually need to be edited in some software before they can be presented on a D TV as the left and right halves of the image must be squshed horisontally in place so a large black column appears in the middle and two smaller columns on the left and right edge Additionally fine adjustments to the seperation and the leftright eye elevation need to be made to correct for lens calibration issues with the source recording Currently there is no playback software which allows the user to make these adjustments to the source video in real time This feature provides all this functionality allowing raw D SBS content to be viewed on a TV without the need of recompression and time consuing videoimage editing The keys for controlling all this are within the hot key screen at the bottom and are currently mapped in a similar form to the WASD movement but using the IJKL keys to avoid conflicing with more critical keys I and K shift the left eye updown and the right eye downup J and L shift the eyes apart and closer together The top left and right of these keys are the U and O keys which shrink and enlarge the left and right images Over to the left the S key enables and disables the horisontal Squish of each eye This is default to enabled The purpose is in case someone has presquished left and right eyes but wants to adjust the seperationelevation To enabledisable all this D functionality simply press the key A sample D SBS image is included for testing SBS DSampleImage Note It works best with video because images only draw once so changes made to the D settings only update on screen if the window is resized Note There was an error when I was trying to compile the latest source before doing this work in MainFrmcpp so I did a hacky fix type casting CComQIPtrIBaseFilter pBF CComQIPtrIBaseFilterbIsSplitter CComQIPtrIBaseFilter pSS CComQIPtrIBaseFilterpObject Until some proper technology is used this change would make the video a bit more responsive The change is small enough so that browser CPU utilization is kept below on average while the normal is about on i ms delay would make the video more stable but CPU usage would be double when playing a media file user can click Grab Audio from the context menu by right click the mousethe menu item will be checked then the player will start to record audio as MP file to the personal music folder until user unchecked the menu item or the media file stopped playing If the menu item has been checked before playing the when a media file begin to play the audio will be recorded automatically kasper This enables streaming Youtube videos with youtubedl by giving a Youtube URL in the Open File dialogue or on the command line Supports individual videos and playlists Requires youtubedl to be present in PATH variable IDSINTERNALLAVFWMV is missing line breaks Following Compilationmd MPCHC was unable to compile with many missing includes in Windows Visual Studio until I selected Windows Universal CRT SDK under Individual Components Compilers build tools and runtimes Selecting and ensuring that Windows Universal CRT SDK allowed compilation without issues Updates the output settings page to automatically reload the current file at the same seek position after changing the video audio or subtitle renderers so the changes are visible immediately This adds an option in advanced settings to allow users to customize the default filename used for snapshots when using File Save Image or pressing F Currently snapshot filenames are hardcoded like videomkvsnapshot This option lets users choose their own filename format string defaulted to fsnapshott YmdHMS to copy current behavior Trac Instead of creating a ticket for this personal minor annoyance I had a go at compiling and contributing to MPCHC Not sure if its interesting enough for the main release but heres a pull request in case you feel it is up to standard The changes As Im always accidentally moving the window instead of seeking which also restores it from its maximized nonfullscreen state Ive added a setting under Advanced which controls the ability to drag the main window on client area controls video panel toolbar infobar statusbar Its enabled by default to be backwards compatible
