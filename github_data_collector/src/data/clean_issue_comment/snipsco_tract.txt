 Hi kali will the SONOS aquirement of snips affect this repo It would be such a shame Hello Was trying tract and so far it looks amazing While playing with a conv autoencoder model I noticed that the Deconvolution layers are not supported in ONNX and Tensforflow Would it be hard to implement it I looked at the code but so far my skills are very limited as I really dont understand well deconvolution I could try to implement it because i feel that this op is not very different from the Conv layer The thing is that dynamic outputs might be problematic Very good job so far its a pleasure to see something so advanced in pure rust Cheers I tried importing a simple model from the TF tutorial Python from future import absoluteimport division printfunction unicodeliterals TensorFlow and tfkeras import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow import keras fashionmnist kerasdatasetsfashionmnist trainimages trainlabels testimages testlabels fashionmnistloaddata classnames Tshirttop Trouser Pullover Dress Coat Sandal Shirt Sneaker Bag Ankle boot trainimages trainimages testimages testimages model kerasSequential keraslayersFlatteninputshape keraslayersDense activationrelu keraslayersDense activationsoftmax modelcompileoptimizeradam losssparsecategoricalcrossentropy metrics accuracy modelfittrainimages trainlabels epochs modelsavemymodelh tfsavedmodelsavemodel modelastf Then I copied the pb file and ran Rust use tractcoreprelude fn main let tf tracttensorflowtensorflow let model tfmodelforpathsavedmodelpbunwrap But it results in thread main panicked at called Resultunwrap on an Err value TractErrorMsgWireErrorUnexpectedWireTypeWireTypeVarint State nexterror None backtrace InternalBacktrace backtrace Somestack backtrace Does this lib work with TF if not is there a way to convert a TF model to TF BTW thank you for this awesome lib Im trying to load a model into rust and Im getting an error when I run the model thread main panicked at called Resultunwrap on an Err value TractErrorMsgTranslating globalaveragepooling dMean UnimplementedMean State nexterror SomeTractErrorMsgOperator can not be made a TypedOp State nexterror None backtrace InternalBacktrace backtrace None backtrace InternalBacktrace backtrace None It seems that the mean operation of globalaveragepooling d is not supported does anyone know anymore about this Thanks for your greate work I would love to see an audio streaming inference Example here TIA Andy kali Opening this draft PR so as to collect some potential early feedback The core generic tree ensemble engine seems to be working what Ive managed to test so far I was actually super surprised that the tests vs lightgbm passed from the first try after I got it to compile lol now need to pin it to protobuf config set up the rules run a few basic benchmarks wrap it in classifierregressor types etc All features including score post transforms except probit different various comparison ops inputnan handling etc that can be provided in ONNX protobuf config are already supported here Its definitely not implemented in the most efficient way now but I think it shouldnt be too bad although before theres benchmarks I have no idea how much worse it would be than the existing lightgbmxgboost c engines
