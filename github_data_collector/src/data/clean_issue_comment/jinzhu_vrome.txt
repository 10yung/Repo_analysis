One of the most useful shortcuts vrome gives me is the ability to hit G to instantly go to the bottom of the page This is especially useful on long JIRA tickets However on atlassiannet using the G will result in the following error in the console TypeError eventinitWebKitWheelEvent is not a function at generateWheelEvent chromeextensiongodjoomfiimiddapohpmfklhgmbfffjjfrontendmodulesscrolljs at scrollElement chromeextensiongodjoomfiimiddapohpmfklhgmbfffjjfrontendmodulesscrolljs at scroll chromeextensiongodjoomfiimiddapohpmfklhgmbfffjjfrontendmodulesscrolljs at KeyboardEventwindowScrollScrollbottom chromeextensiongodjoomfiimiddapohpmfklhgmbfffjjfrontendmodulesscrolljs at runCurrentKeys chromeextensiongodjoomfiimiddapohpmfklhgmbfffjjfrontendmoduleskeyeventjs at HTMLDocumentwindowKeyEventKeyEventexec chromeextensiongodjoomfiimiddapohpmfklhgmbfffjjfrontendmoduleskeyeventjs debugjs Any clues This only seems to happen in JIRA cloud When using hint mode with useletters vrome display number like vimperator Vrome is following the link only if the number is typed from the numeric pad If not the number go in the hint textbox Is there a way to use those number for following the link Vimperator the leading Vim plugin for Firefox is undergoing an endoflife transition as the Firefox based XULtype add on support is ending in that browser Theres a discussion at Vimperator about porting to the WebExtension API Since To a large extent the system is compatible with the extension API supported by Google Chrome and Opera it would seem desirable to unify the existing vimlike addon community into a project using this shared architecture It also may be the case that Chrome inevitably forces its own add ons to conform to the WebExtension API Regardless Im creating this issue to bring attention to the previously mentioned effort Feel free to join the discussion here Sadly vrome is in conflict with Jupyter Notebook so keyboard shortcuts for Jupyter dont work when using vrome Google inbox is nonfunctional for creating messages With this extension enabled it is impossible to enter a body or subject for a message being composed Adding inboxgooglecom to the disablesites variable does set pass through mode for the domain but does not resolve this issue Im trying to use this software with an ABNT keyboard layout The software does not take my keyboard layout into account just the plain ENUS layout It looks like this issue is a general case of Best regards every scroll operation cannot work while browser my gmail mails Is there a bug Movement commands j k etc dont work on most of the site here here etc The commands work on main page only First I should thank you for this great extension I cant imagine using Chrome without it I wanted to know if its possible to use this great extension on safari too I know there are alternatives for Safari but none are as complete and intuitive as your extension so considering that both Chrome and Safari are based on webkit I thought maybe theres some way to enable it in Safari too is it I use google docs alot for school and I want to disable docsgooglecomd Its not a huge deal but I dont feel like it would be difficult at all
