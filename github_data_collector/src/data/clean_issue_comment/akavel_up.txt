 terminal code TERMxtermkitty was not found in the database provided by tcell library Please try checking if a supplemental database is found for your terminal at one of the following URLs If yes download it and save in the following directory HOMEtcelldb then try running up again If that does not work for you please first consult and if you dont see your terminal code mentioned there please try asking on Or you might try changing TERM temporarily to some other value for example by running up with TERMxterm up Good luck How to get it to work with xtermkitty This is not an issue per se but I wrote a small zsh function to integrate up zsh zleupify bufecho BUFFER sed s tmpmktemp eval buf up unsafefullthrottle o tmp devnull cmdtail n tmp rm f tmp BUFFERBUFFER cmd zle endofline zle N zleupify bindkey U zleupify If you add this to your zshrc CtrlU will run up passing the current commands output and when you exit up with CtrlX the result will replace current prompt Its slightly easier than dealing with upNsh files It was quite useful for me Im just sharing this so maybe youd like to put it to READMEmd or somewhere people can find out The document of tcell says as following SetCell is an older API and will be removed Please use SetContent instead This PR alters SetCell into SetContent Including the ability to tab complete would make this tool truly perfect Great job either way love this idea The new pressentertorun mode makes up a lot safer but it would still be nice to have something like the old mode Maybe a new mode where the command is automatically run but only after a configurable amount of time without any input Probably still shouldnt be the default but it would be a nice inbetween option Would happily dive in and make a PR to implement this if youre interested I tried to do some pipelining for comparison But when I tried to paste the content of my clipboard to this tools command prompt only the first characters got copied to it Heres the screencast in case needed plumberup Writecopy it based on readme update with features added in subsequent releases With short licensing info for all dependency libraries The following change allows for up to be called directly without first needing to pipe a command in to it It can still be called the normal way through a pipe
