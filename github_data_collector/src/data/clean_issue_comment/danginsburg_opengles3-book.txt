 Hello I have a need as follows Draw a threedimensional coordinate system and can achieve the zoom function Other modules constantly send me D coordinate points which I need to draw on the coordinate system How should I deal with these massive data Are they all in VBO Can you give me some ideas or examples Thank you very much On page there is some discussion regarding clearing the color in the Init function Looking back to page the color is set to The discussion on page mentions it being set to When the code for glUniform is presented the glUniform f version uses the character O instead of the numeral a preliminary support for LinuxSDL The note say Instructions for building for each platform are provided in Chapter OpenGL ES Platforms But where is the Chapter Icant find that And I open the project at AndroidStudio IDE warning a lot of error So the problem is AndroidStuido cant drectly product apk How to do that I think reading sample codes is the best way to understand OpenGL ES but there is some missing key code in the Ch sample code Can you provide the full sample codes in Chapter Section Thx Cast void pointer to correct type Was getting compiler error error cannot initialize a variable of type UserData with an lvalue of type void UserData userData esContextuserData Page says Once a texture has been loaded as a compressed texture it can be used for texturing in exactly the same way as an uncompressed texture In my opinion this statement about exactly the same way is not entirely true Calling glGenerateMipmap on a compressed texture returns an error in most drivers This is not noted on page or on page where Automatic Mipmap Generation is covered It would be helpful if the restriction on compressed texture mipmap generation is noted somewhere The ES man page says that glGenerateMipmap is unsupported on compressed base level GLINVALIDOPERATION is generated if the levelbase array is stored in a compressed internal format Hey guys I am very new to OpenGL development I am learning to develop Open GL ES apps following your book Here is current environment spec Emulator MaliOpenGLESEmulatorv g a Windows bit IDE Visual Studio Win Cmake version OS Windows I am referring the Chapter for building it on Windows and for Visual Studio After a lot of beating my head around and digging I managed to bring down the number of Linker issues that I was getting Currently I am stuck on linker issues that I unable to resolved or get any help Error LNK unresolved externals HelloTriangle C Users nikhilbagul Documents OpenGLES Projects opengles book Chapter HelloTriangle VisualStudioSolution Release HelloTriangleexe Error LNK unresolved external symbol main referenced in function int cdecl scrtcommonmainsehvoid scrtcommonmainsehYAHXZ HelloTriangle C Users nikhilbagul Documents OpenGLES Projects opengles book Chapter HelloTriangle VisualStudioSolution MSVCRTlibexemainobj Error LNK unresolved external symbol WinCreate referenced in function esCreateWindow HelloTriangle C Users nikhilbagul Documents OpenGLES Projects opengles book Chapter HelloTriangle VisualStudioSolution esUtilobj Any help is much appreciated Thanks
