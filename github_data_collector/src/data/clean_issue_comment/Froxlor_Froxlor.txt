I was using acmesh on my server even before Froxlor started using it but now Froxlor is breaking it by always removing the cronjob This is really bad Maybe Froxlor should keep its own copy of acmesh and not mess with the installed one This is a minor issue when DNS resolution is not available for the nameserver entries from the panel configurtion for bind these entries will show up unresolved in the config file thus bind wont start anymore as only IP addresses ar permitted in AXFR entries For replication testing open the froxlor webpage navigate to bind config and enter two comma separated hostnames that do not resolve Have the config files created again via cron and bind will stop working This is a rare event if your DNS is not responding while the config file is recreated bind will be dead as well Entries in the hosts file will be ignored Feature Request Summary It would be great if we manually can addremove columns in the CustomersDomains overview For example Customers overview add the applyed hosting plan Email and other fields Domains overview add the document root separate logfile enabled Emaildomain enabled Only email enabled and other fields System information Froxlor version Steps to reproduce Open Froxlor and navigate to Ressources Customers or Ressources Domains Expected behavior Able to addremove columns in the overview Actual behavior Not able to addremove columns in the overview Bug report vs support request If youre unsure of whether your problem is a bug or a configuration error contact us via IRC in froxlor on freenode or post a thread in our forum at As a rule of thumb before reporting an issue see if it hasnt been reported and possibly already been fixed first try with the git master Summary If changing period to collect traffic and disk usage more than once a day stats should be merged for example a day or after a month to avoid huge amounts of usage records System information Froxlor version Web server apache DNS server none POPIMAP server Dovecot SMTP server postfix FTP server proftpd OSVersion Debian Buster MySql x Steps to reproduce Set Consettings of traffic and disk usage for example to Minutes After a while Months there many records in the tables Open Customers this will take long time Expected behavior If setting cronsettings traffic and diskusage to smaller values ui is also fast as collecting much less traffic and disk usage stats Traffic and customer are available within less than second Actual behavior Too many records in paneltraffic paneltrafficadmins paneldiskspace and diskspaceadmins made UI tab customers and traffic very slow minutes Feature Request Summary Would be nice to have DNS configuration instructions for CentOSRHEL systems DebianUbuntu instructions can mostly be followed if the correct paths for CentOSRHEL are substitutedsymlinked System information Froxlor version Web server apache DNS server Bind POPIMAP server Dovecot SMTP server postfix FTP server proftpd OSVersion CentOS Linux

Comment Intentionally have not updated to as the system running is being made production ready and cannot take an update right now ensuring update will not negatively impact production no separate test system available yet Description IP validation sorts out any reserved IP Thats a good thing because we do not want eg to DHCP bind to broadcasts IPs But there are some special cases that are filtered out by FILTERFLAGNORESRANGE Using in Ports and IPs to create a Port listening on any IP Using eg for MySQL to allow access to any IP Personally I have only use case but since Its quite similar I added the other too Type of change Please delete options that are not relevant Bug fix nonbreaking change which fixes an issue X New feature nonbreaking change which adds functionality Breaking change fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected This change requires a documentation update How Has This Been Tested I have manually tested that creating a port with IP works as expected I have added Tests into ValidationTests for both use cases Checklist x I have performed a selfreview of my own code x I have commented my code particularly in hardtounderstand areas I have made corresponding changes to the documentation No idea where to document it exactly its just a minor fixenhancement My changes generate no new warnings How to test x I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works X New and existing unit tests pass locally with my changes Summary There are a few dns records that help clients to do auto discoveryeg for mail caldav and carddav It would be great if Froxlor would make sure that they are in the DNS zones For domains with email support adding rfc compatible records This is related to defines autoconfigdomain defines autodiscovertcpdomain in step The iOS feature would also be nice to have see for an example Adding custom records to multiple domains managed by Froxlor would help too eg caldav carddav see rfc Thanks Summary Allow customers in Froxlor to addconfigureremove domains Not just subdomains as today Prepopulate the zone configuration with sensible defaults for zone hosting email web and any combiation of them Optional Allow an easy integration with a domain registrar Thanks Hi all the SRV entry in the dns settings is a bit special Often a dns editor has special fields for this entry in the editor port weight protocol service Can you add this special fields in the editor If it is not possible can you add the description how to make a SRV entry not in the error message but as a message directly in the editor or when the entry type SRV is choosen An example for a right SRV entry would be great too fully working now working creating DKIM keys and pusing
