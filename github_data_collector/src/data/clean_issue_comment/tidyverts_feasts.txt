From Use a difftime to represent lags instead of the cflag class Store the interval elsewhere for plot breaks Add some of the functionality of tsclean and tsoutliers from the forecast package Related question Hi I think that the names of the functions SEATS and X or the associated documentation can be misleadings since if Im not mistaken in both functions the seasonal decomposition is made with X ARIMASEATS In both case a preadjustment step is done to adjust from trading days effects some outliers etc And a forecast of this preadjusted series is done Then it is this preadjusted series that is decomposes with SEATS or X Therefore X doesn t not perform a seasonal adjustment with X but with X ARIMASEATS Maybe I should ask this other question in another issue but I was also wondering why the decomposition mode is forced with X to additive and not with SEATS By default X ARIMASEATS performs an automatic selection of the decomposition mode and the most common decomposition mode for economic time series is multiplicative At the moment the column name is given as V if a function is passed otherwise a named list will rectify this Im not sure if its worth it but I was thinking it might be nice to have some autonaming of columns if a named list is not provided So ideally the first function would return the same output as the second What do you think r librarybrolgar worldheights featuresheightcm min A tibble x country V chr dbl Afghanistan Albania Algeria Angola Argentina Armenia Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahrain with more rows worldheights featuresheightcm listmin min A tibble x country min chr dbl Afghanistan Albania Algeria Angola Argentina Armenia Australia Austria Azerbaijan Bahrain with more rows supCreated on by the reprex package v sup When asking for an STL decomposition it should always use an STL decomposition The current behaviour of calling Friedmans SuperSmoother for nonseasonal data is incorrect and can cause confusion and inconsistencies with features This will require reimplementing STL and while doing so it would be worthwhile to add support for exogenous regressors Which lag is most appropriate Old or new Which gives best ARIMA performance on M M With earowang Rather than accepting values these functions should accept which computes the ACFPACF for each column with the resulting column names matching the input names rather than just acf Details for the type of cf used will be stored as an attribute for printing and plotting For CCF it should evaluate all pairwise crosscorrelations with resulting names joined by This should use the distribution or hilo class from fable These class definitions should probably be ported to feasts thoughts robjhyndman
