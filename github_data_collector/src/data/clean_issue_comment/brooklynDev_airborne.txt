you havent been active in years I hope all is well I have a growing concern that this project wont receive any more attention and will eventually become useless That would be a shame What do you need Would you like to completely transfer ownership to someone else What can I do to help Using Faraday I am also able to make changes to the URL from the base url carrierwave was resolved to which depends on mimetypes carrierwavebase was resolved to which depends on mimetypes airborne was resolved to which depends on restclient was resolved to which depends on mimetypes rails was resolved to which depends on actionpack was resolved to which depends on racktest airborne was resolved to which depends on racktest lock carrierwave activemodel activesupport mimetypes carrierwavebase carrierwave mimetypes mimetypes mimetypesdata actionpack actionview activesupport rack racktest racktest rack seems that dependency on racktest and mimetypes need to be updated for what rails are locked to Some of the apis were testing require xml is it possible to use airborne for this Also how do I find out all the header options that airborne does support I would love to be able to use this type of response validation without making an HTTP request but instead operating directly on JSON that I already have but unless Im missing something this isnt currently possible with this library Hi I was trying to test out the response headers And the response header is something like XTVsubscriptionId and I tried to expectheader XTVsubscriptionId and it returns false it will return true only if I do expectheader xtvsubscriptionid Wondering is this behaviour intended As headers are case sensitives anyway case switch is not an issue for me But converting hyphen into underscore is breaking my test Many thanks in advance Update looks like even expectheader Xtvsubscriptionid will return a false The downscore is not working Hi Im trying to test an api call with JSON array as the body post accountsidsubscriptions body header For the body it is a JSON array like instead of a hash Can I do that in airborne Thank you very much airborne with this data all this is true
