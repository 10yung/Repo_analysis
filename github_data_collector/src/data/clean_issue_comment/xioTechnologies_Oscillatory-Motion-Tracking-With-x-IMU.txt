I try the sample data the project works well But I dont know if this method works for realtime data Thank you Hello I see in the code that it says it pulls the XIMU back to the origin when its stationary Do you know how I could remove this feature Thanks Mike Hi xioTechnologies I have a question regarding the value for the beta and zeta of the MagwidckTahony ahrs According to the documentation the filter gains beta and zeta should represente the bias of the gyroscope In am working with the BMI IMU and I would like to have its respective gyroscope bias too is this error the so called Zerorate offset On the other hand how do you knowcalculate the time to get an estable output of the Madgwick filtering its convergence Thanks in advance Regards Undefined function or variable avifile Error in SixDOFanimation line aviobj avifilefileName fps AVIfps compression Cinepak quality Error in Script line SixDOFanimationlinPosHP R I am using latest matlab version During execution am getting above error message kindly let me know how to solve the same Hello Im triing to realize tracking device via arduino I integrate velocity but I have drift As I understood you use Butterworth filter in matlab to remove drift Could you advice what filters should I use in arduino Hi I am having some troubles using the code It works perfectly with the dataset provided but when I use the samples obtained from my own IMU the output does not make sense I think that this is due to the initial condition Quaternion that represents the Earth relative to the sensor Probably I should set my own Quaternion as an argument of the MahonyAHRS function If this is right how do I find this quaternion Please let me know Hi Thanks for this awesome example Ive tried running the demo data that youve supplied in the example but Im getting very weird results Can you upload a walking example on the repo please Thanks FYI screen shot at
