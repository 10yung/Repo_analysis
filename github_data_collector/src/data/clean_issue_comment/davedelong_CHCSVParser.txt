Hi there Thanks for this library Ive found it useful I use it in my iOS app Reading List This pull request adds support for the Swift Package Manager which makes it easier to include the library in another project direct from Xcode Any extra steps to do Hello We are using this library for export our data as a CSV but we are facing an issue with export data related to a temperature which contains degree symbol For example C we are expecting a result same as C but at the time of export we are getting C there is one extra character added at the time of export open FYI We tried to write this character using Unicode hexacode AscII value Emoji of Xcode etc Still we are facing this issue add a framework target to support Carthage In order to use Carthage as our framework management tool we needed to create an iOS framework target scheme and have it shared ignored I installed the CHCSVParser Version from CocoaPod Also I use some library which are written in Swift so I need to write useframeworks in Podfile When I built CHCSVParser gave me four warnings listed below PodsCHCSVParserCHCSVParserCHCSVParserCHCSVParserm Method override for the designated initializer of the superclass init not found PodsCHCSVParserCHCSVParserCHCSVParserCHCSVParserm Method override for the designated initializer of the superclass init not found PodsCHCSVParserCHCSVParserCHCSVParserCHCSVParserm Designated initializer should only invoke a designated initializer on super PodsCHCSVParserCHCSVParserCHCSVParserCHCSVParserm Designated initializer missing a super call to a designated initializer of the super class Is there any good idea to avoid this The docs say it is alright to send empty strings and nils to the CSV Exporter as fields However nil fields in the first line cause exception because firstLineKeys NSArray wont accept I followed the example of the next lines of writeField which replace nil with empty string which is acceptable in the array Same in the CSVParser although nil fields there can cause problems if there are more than one I think the use first line as keys option isnt very robust option CHCSVParserOptionUsesFirstLineAsKeys should be CHCSVParserOptionsUsesFirstLineAsKeys
