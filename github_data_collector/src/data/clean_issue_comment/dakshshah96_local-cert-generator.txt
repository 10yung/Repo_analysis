Hey there thanks a lot for the article and the lib The generated certificate isnt trusted by iOS simulators due to Apple new requirements Hi there I just came from reading And I could follow through but I have a much simpler setup and I dont want to run a node app I simply have an html file and I run to serve it Is there a way to include an ssl certificate with such a simple setup Also the reason why I am doing this is because I want to access a mobile devices deviceorientation Unfortunately you have to run on https to get some values In my case I call my localhost server via the IP in the network like Of course this should be https Even if I got to run your way of having a valid certificate for localhost would that also be valid for Thanks for some clarification Sorry I am really not at home with the whole certificate stuff I just want to run a simple server to execute the most simple javascript Hach how darn complicated has the web world become fix problem with never ending openssl terminal session infinite loop when using with mingw add example server and generated root and selfsigned certificate Thanks for creating this I am trying to get this to work on my Linux Ubuntu machine and this step just doesnt have quite enough details that I need Linux Depending on your Linux distribution you can use trust updatecacertificates or another command to mark the generated root certificate as trusted I would type trust what trust Local Certificate and trust rootCApem do not work or updatecacertificates what just updatecacertificates doesnt seem to solve it either Any help appreciated I followed all the steps in your README but the generated certificate does not work READMEmd steps works fine on Windows will create rootCAkey and rootCApem Step is related only for OS X Trust this certificate after importing it to your System keychain Windows doesnt have System keychain And step fails sh createSelfSignedsh createSelfSignedsh cannot make pipe for process substitution Function not implemented req Option config needs a value req Use help for summary x Cannot open input file servercsr No such file or directory x Use help for summary
