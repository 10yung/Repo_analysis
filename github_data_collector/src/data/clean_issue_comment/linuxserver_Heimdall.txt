Hello I work with my team on a framework for Big Data analysis FADI This toolkit is mainly based on Helm and Kubernetes We want to integrate a dashboard that would make navigation between services Ingress more interactive and pleasant Heimdall seems to be the ideal candidate However we would like to be able to automate the tasks of adding elements and users so that the dashboards are selfgenerated according to the services present in our cluster of containerized applications At the moment this is not possible using only the routes in the file routeswebphp We hope this use case will lead you to develop the API of your application Because we prefer to use an existing mature tool and support it rather than developing it from scratch With this in mind if this functionality were to come to light we certainly plan to collaborate to enrich the list of enhanced supported applications and transmit a lot of feedback When running multiple instances of Heimdall eg one for LAN and one for WAN it would be useful to see the URL you are going to visit at the bottom of an item So here maybe in light blue or gray pointing to just to get a visual indication of where you are going and that you are not visiting the WAN address instead of the LAN one Cant update apps list due to network connectivity issue Is there any way to update the list manually Version laravelERROR Error

PUSHERAPPKEY PUSHERAPPSECRET PUSHERAPPCLUSTERmt as per title heimdall is generating http links when I want it to generate https links I setup heimdall using docker container in kubernetes I used The container is listening on port http After initializing the application data I edited wwwenv and changed APPURL to be APPURL and restarted Links are still incorrectly being generated it is my understanding that heimdall uses laravel and it seems to have a lot of confusion surrounding generating HTTPS urls when run with a reverse proxy Is there anything else to get heimdall to work in this environment At the moment if you wish to have a solid colour for the background you have to create and upload a wallpaper image of just that colour It would be great to be able to set the background to a static colour by using the colour picker as you do when creating an app box thereby avoiding having to upload a wallpaper image altogether Heimdall already works without javascript but not optimal For example some icons are not shown Some users disable javascript for privacy reasons if there would be some configuration option for javascript onoff of course dynamic updates wont work anymore this would be really nice Enhanced qBittorrent worked fine with qBittorrent x in LSIO docker container but after recently upgrading to the feature stopped working Config test returns Failed Please make sure your URL is correct and that there is a trailing slash It would be nice if we could hide the admin buttons that are in the bottom right of the homepage My users never need these links and I access an admin tag so they would be visible there for me Basically less clutter for the enduser
