The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

deployed page is just a normal SPR Describe the bug Content Security Policy is not implemented properly due to many things eg usage of unsafeinline for CSS scripts To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Go to Expected behavior Some of the CSP things could be added examples would include frameAncestors self removing unsafeinfline from scriptSrc setting upgradeInsecureRequests true for blocking loading of activepassive content over insecure FTPHTTP Desktop please complete the following information OS any Browser any Additional context Due to Angulars Universal inline CSS rendering we actually cant achieve CSP so the unsafeinline for CSS must be there but others could be improved based on the Mozilla Observatory scan It would be useful to show how you would approach prerendering
