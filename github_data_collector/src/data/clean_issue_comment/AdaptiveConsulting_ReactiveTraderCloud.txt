 Hi team this is really great work and cant thank you enough for sharing this Its not trivial to wrap ones head around the depth of the complexity in this code and Ive spent a lot of time doing so but I feel like I may be missing something at this point In addition to the obvious clientbackend flow whether over RPC or PubSub via WAMP a use case that I was thinking of that would come in very handy for my own adaptationextension of this is a more nuanced service to service communication To be clear as architected here it is easy for say the trading execution service to listen a knownaheadoftime topic prices on the broker so that it is essentially capturing ALL of the price data that flows from the pricing service if available or basically just nothing if no pricing service instance is running However modifying this so that the trade execution service could connect to a specific traded currency price stream using the RPC to get topic name then pubsub method to the least loaded pricing instance seems less tractable using the current code base Certainly on the javascript client side there is a lot of work that has been poured into this the bulk of the magic which seems to be in the serviceClient and serviceBase and other supporting classes wherein a status stream is listened to to learn the name of the pricing service then requests are made to that specific instance However has any of this logic been implemented on the backend net side Perhaps I am just missing something as I have been known to dobut just to be clear the basic idea is that I want a trade execution instance on the backend to be able to find the best pricing instance to use and then send a request to listen to the price feed for a specific traded currency and not just all prices since clearly in the real world there are market data pricing issues and so forth and I cant just subscribe to everything If I were to try and recreate the above sort of functionality on the net side any advice ahead of time would be appreciated certainly starting with the javascript class and porting to net I imagine would work eventually but seems like it could end up being a nontrivial amount of work and so I wanted to pose this question here first and thanks again This isnt really an issue this is just a request I am trying to learn how to build microservices with CQRS ES reactive programming and messaging I have a good understanding of the theoretical part but there isnt much handson examples about this subject Reactive Trader Cloud is the most complete app that I could find which implements all these concepts and much more I am trying to dive into the code to understand its ins and outs however I would really appreciate having some code documentation to help Also having more learning resources andor examples would be really helpful This app is nice if this is a demo showcasing app I am wondering how an enterprise reactive cqrses microservices architecture would be nice work Introduce a process manager for trade execution to better model realworld usage of event sourcing
