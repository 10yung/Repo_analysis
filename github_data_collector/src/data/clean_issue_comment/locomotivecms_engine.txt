Im setting up some header with background video It requires three formats mp ogv and webm that is missing Good day Ive come across the superadmin boolean attribute for an account in the code and see that it is meant to allow the super admin to see all sites and not simply the ones to which they have a membership This is outlined in the SitePolicy on line where the policy directs the app to return all sites if the account is a super admin However Ive found that the sites controller does not use the SitePolicy nor is it used elsewhere so this capability of a super admin is never actually exposed The SitesController which I presume is used to return the list of sites available to the user on the landing page uses the SiteServicelist method to return the list of sites for the account but it goes through the defined account relationship and not the SitePolicy line I suspect that to resolve this inconsistency and enable the super admin flag to be used it would require that we replace the current accountsitesorderbynameasctoasort sorter with something like LocomotiveSitePolicynewaccount LocomotiveSiteresolveorderbynameasctoasort sorter or similar What do you think Additionally there doesnt seem to be any way to make a an account a super admin through the UI Is this known What is the current status of the super admin feature This PR allows super admin users to configure maximum file size for each site This can be done from the Advanced tab in the site settings page This limit is enforced in the assets uploading zone and in the image picker widget too Also this limit is checked also in the server side to increment consistency and avoid security issues imagen Finally this PR also tries to improve the assets dropzone usability fixing a missing cloudupload icon and including the configured file size limit in the description imagen Hi I need create a select field with a list of fields There any way to archive this with wagon Thankx When accessing the locomotive admin area for a site ie via locomotive or admin if the user accidentally uses http instead of https and the site is set to have an https redirect no redirect occurs Subsequently editing a page is done via http but the iframe for the preview goes to https due to the https redirect being set to true and crossorigin errors start to pop up ie the section editor doesnt initialize The preview button at the top correctly goes to https its just the edit interface that doesnt should the whole Admin section for a loco site be redirected to https if https redirect is set to true I believe this would fix the problem Otherwise would need to specifically fix the edit interface to use the correct protocol Since it is possible to crop and resize images within the assets editor it should also be possible to rename the asset file Fixes bug contenttype label customized with entrytemplate should now render the correct link to the entry My understanding is that contenttypeentrytemplate is a mechanism for customising the label of an entry using liquid etc to interpolate values into a label for the backend contenttype index I noticed when I used it that as soon as it was defined the label successfully reflected the liquid values but there was no link to the contenttype form All tested in v It would be nice to have a multifile upload field type Ex for a blog post that contains multiple images I realize you can use hasmanybelongsto for this but it seems extremely heavy handed for the use case This would have the following options MinMax number of files File types restriction Currently when placing a globalsection within the head tag it ends up rendering it at the top of the body instead Please allow sections to be rendered within the head
