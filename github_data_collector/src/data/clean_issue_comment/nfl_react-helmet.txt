Specifically this upgrade is done to pick up this change which renamed componentWillMount to UNSAFEcomponentWillMount A very large deprecation warning is logged in the console otherwise see the Note section here Im using gatsbyjs which by default brings Helmet installed I would like to add some more content to my head in this case just a comment with a ref id Would it be possible without any property of helmet tag for additional content Im missing something like a headAdditional property that takes a string and put it in the head exactly as it was written Do you want to request a feature or report a bug Report a bug What is the current behavior Hey buddies everything works fine the head tags updates correctly except that the React warns that componentWillMount is obsolete See for details reactwarning How did I know this caused the warning Well when I removedisconnect the Helmet from my Appjs the warning disappears Suggested fix according to the console message Move code with side effects to componentDidMount and set initial state in the constructor Rename componentWillMount to UNSAFEcomponentWillMount to suppress this warning in nonstrict mode In React x only the UNSAFE name will work To rename all deprecated lifecycles to their new names you can run npx reactcodemod renameunsafelifecycles in your project source folder Please update the following components SideEffectNullComponent Which versions of React and reacthelmet and which browser OS are affected by this issue Did this work in previous versions of React andor reacthelmet I never tested old versions of reacthelmet I am using current version of React and Hooks in my Project Browser is Brave Chromiumbased OS is Windows Pro can i create applicationidjson in reatjs jsx google seo Do you want to request a feature or report a bug Bug currently the version of reactsideeffect thats currently used is causing deprecated warnings to be thrown in react due to its usage of componentWillMount What is the current behavior When mounting components in a react or above environment deprecated warnings are thrown If the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesnt have dependencies other than React and reacthelmet Paste the link to your JSFiddle or CodeSandbox example below Use Helmet in a react environment or above What is the expected behavior Warnings are not thrown Which versions of React and reacthelmet and which browser OS are affected by this issue Did this work in previous versions of React andor reacthelmet React Do you want to request a feature or report a bug Bug What is the current behavior I am using the peek function to test that a stylet ag is added to the document head but I am getting a type error as styleTag does not exist in the HelmetData interface What is the expected behavior It should allow me to destructure the styleTag property without getting any ts warnings when using the peek function so as to check style tags added to the document head Please extend HelmetTags in the HelmetData interface Which versions of React and reacthelmet and which browser OS are affected by this issue Did this work in previous versions of React andor reacthelmet I am using but the issue persists in the latest as well I have implemented a third party widget on my website to get Rich Snippets stars The issue is that the Googlebot and Google structureddata testingtool do not recognise the ldjson markup because its outside the html tag

using Create React Application CRA method To have SEOFriendly web app I would like to have a meta title and description page wise To achieve this I have already installed below NPM reacthelmet which makes console data dynamic BUT the dynamic data is NOT displaying as expected for source code NPM Question Is there any way to have a dynamic meta title and description pagewise using a reacthelmet and CSR based ReactJS app NOTE At the moment I am not looking to convert into SSR using expressJS or NextJS Folks the community needs this to be merged AND released that easy as a dependency update I see the implications and that might be done in a breaking major release Then do it or update the beta that is one year old I guess stale because of something and most probably it will need this to make travis work again If you cant maintain the project anymore try to find someone who can I guess there will be plenty of volunteers Unfortunately React Helmet simply does not provide good compatibility with opengraph data We inherited a project which uses React and ReactHelment extensively and although the head updates this is a virtualised DOM update Facebook and Twitter can not crawl the opengraph meta provided I have added the following to the React Render function Helmet title itemPropname langenWelcome Chenjatitle meta nametwittercard contentsummary meta nametwittersite
