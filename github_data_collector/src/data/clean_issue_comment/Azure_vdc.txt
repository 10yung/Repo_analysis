MicrosoftPowerShellCommandsWriteErrorExceptionStartDeployment The quick start guide to run the SharedServices orchestration does not deploy in Azure Public I have tried multiple times with disabling modules on each successive attempt Could you please test it and setup a GH Action pipeline that runs daily to ensure that the quick start does not regress Thanks The DSC package called installADDSNoDiskFormatzip gets used in the Shared Services pipeline perhaps others In my testing it doesnt select the correct NIC to setup DNS and AD I found that I needed to change the azureps file to just force it to use the Ethernet adapter as follows Interface GetNetAdapterWhereObject Name eq Ethernet Not the most flexible solution perhaps but it lets the pipeline work AD gets installed and well things are OK after that Sorry Im too scared to do a proper pull request for this When building the docker image behind a corporate proxy it seems that there is an issue related to retrieving the powershell modules It seems that PSRepository is not available probably due to proxy settings not being used Are you aware of any workarounds related to this Setting up powershell ubuntu Processing

archetypejson executablesvdcexec ERROR There was an unhandled error while provisioning the resources executablesvdcexec ERROR No module named interface Any ideas RBAC deployment should be based on if the property exists or not if no RBAC is specified in orchestration the RBAC shouldnt run There are use cases where you may want to deploy RBAC for one deployment but not for another This is especially true for common resources such as storage accounts We may not always want to assign permissions If the RBAC deployment is only initiated when RBAC is present in the module orchestration this allows for selective RBAC deployment RBAC deployment should happen after the module deployment This opens scenarios to apply RBAC directly to a resource that was just deployed This could be extremely useful in instances where RBAC can be used for access to the data plane for instance storage account This allows you to then make an RBAC assignment on a resource that has just been deployed After creating agent VM using the build scripts it takes some time for the VM to show up into the Azure DevOps portal under agents It should be helpful if it is mentioned in the document
