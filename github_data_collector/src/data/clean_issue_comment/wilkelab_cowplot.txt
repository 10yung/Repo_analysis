A follow up on this SO question stackoverflowcomquestions two years later maybe a feature request if you agree on its usefulness Sometimes plots require fixed aspect ratio eg ternary plots when the coordinate space triangle has to be regular It would be very useful if cowplotplotgrid can define relwidths or relheight automatically in order to scale and align the plots Consider the example below

I am trying to draw a few transparent images over my ggplot I wish to position the transparent image at the very bottom left of the plot I used x and y to position this transparent image However drawimage somehow does not recognise transparency and instead positions the bottom left corner of the entire image at those coordinates first plot below To try and improve this I tried the imagetrim function of the magick package However even here the leftmost part in this case the blue dice is not quite at x second plot below I understand there is an hjust option but I am running this operation for hundreds of images and cannot define the hjust in every case Is there a way of getting the true left most edge of a transparent image to x Thank you r librarycowplotquietly T Note As of version

check programmatically if a given ggplot is a plotgrid and what layout it has Asis you basically have to try if any of the elements is a GeomDrawGrob and then painstakingly reassemble the layout from geomparamsxminxmax This would be useful to write an alternative to saveplot that infers the number of rowscolumns using abovementioned metadata or information from facets Brief description of the problem or desired feature Using stamp and its variants dont produce the characteristic bar on the right hand side of the plot as in the examples The examples also seem to reflect old behavior where themecowplot would be set as the default theme To reproduce run the code from the online examples r p ggplotiris aesx SepalLength y SepalWidth geompointaescolor factorPetalWidth stampbadp guidescolor none example If the user wants to draw a compound plot with a shared legend it needs to manually extracted the legend and add it to the compound figure A nicer interface would be to add an option to plotgrid to request a shared legend akin to the ggarrange function of ggpubr It would be nice if we could place plots onto the canvas at an angle This should be possible with viewports as long as we dont insist on proper clipping Im opening another issue in order to keep the request for semiautomatically handling vertical whitespace This was basically reported in and but both of those are closed now while the feature doesnt really exist Only manual workarounds In my particular case I have four plots in one column and four rows with only the last plot having horizontal axis tick labels So the whitespace between the other plots is very pronounced I will play around with the margins manually but I think this feature would be a great addition I find cowplot very useful in most situations but got a bit exasperated by simply trying to fit a graph of one column width under a row with two columnsgraphs Just felt it should be possible to define number of rows and to reference each one individually in order to define the number of columns in that row Many thanks and best wishes Ir insert reprex here Sometimes I want to scale text objects differently to everything else once I have a plot Is it feasible to have a scaletext argument that would overwrite scale for text objects only annotategeom text axistext axistitle title etc
