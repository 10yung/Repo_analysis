get AI players to appear in my LAN games in rc Multiplayer STK was one of the highlights of family xmas thankyou Through the local networking create a server GUI when I set the number of AI karts to some number like no AI players appear in my normal race Human LAN players are able to join as expected RC change log indicates there is some new AI multiplayer functions but it is unclear how to activate this I note that this issue appears related to issue I experimented with setting the aihandling valuetrue value in my serverconfigxml but this did not change the result I note that it is

actually decide on an option when I want to play online Enter server address has also been renamed to Direct Connect for concision This also tweaks menu option casing to match the rest of the menus Dont merge yet as this currently lacks translation changes Should I update the source strings in all translatrions or just in the POT file Is there a tool to do so or does it have to be done manually Speaking of which I also noticed casing inconsistencies in track names We should probably settle on a single style either Like This or Like this My vote goes for the former as the rest of the UI seems to follow that style Agreement By creating a pull request in stkcode you hereby agree to duallicense your contribution as GNU General Public License version or any later version and Mozilla Public
