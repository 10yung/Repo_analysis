I dont now how easy you can hook with JS hiding all the menu of a notebook and having native menubarmenuicons etc would be quite cool I dont find how to close split view Also a split view is not attached to a tab so if you change tabs the split beneath stay the same Is it by design I would have put split inside tabs and not tabs inside split Does what I say make sens In both horizontal and vertical view slide mode and html latex is not rendered Again on OS X On os x youtube video does not appear neither in tab nor in html view On Mac OS most shortcut use cmd instead of ctrl reloading is cmdr and doing it show QActioneventFilter Ambiguous shortcut overload R In command line and does not do anything Note that ctrl key does exist then this is a complicated Qtissue as if I remember correctly qt use Meta for cmd key and something else for alt I have to check prev next and reload icons disappears when no tab is selected Which change the toolbar height and is a little disturbing I would suggest preventing notabs and always fallback on at least one tab that is the dashboard or the help This is more UIrelated and a small detail Qt application ofter use the unifiedTitleAndToolbar to look more like native applications See qt blog for screenshot Tabs should use PySideQtGuiQTabBardocumentMode when each tab is a separate document Even if I am on a notebook when clicking on any related action it says This tab is not an IPython notebook Both on master and rel of ipython OS X BTW as a whishlist action should be disabled when not on notebook tab Again sorry for the spam ill open more issues to keep each separate Sorry ill throw issues here as I am testing otherwise ill forgot to report it later Sorry for the future spam Unable to get to dashboard when serving over https
