Hi First thanks for this great library While experimenting with the API Im wondering if theres a way to include an image say at the top of the first column of a column layout where the image pushes the first column down as much as its necessary My first naive approach was to use new lines at the beginning of the text than position the image accordingly doc textTitle of the page

produces the desired result but Im not sure if thats a good idea Any suggestion Thanks Bug Report Description of the problem docheightOfString blocksruns until the process is terminated It doesnt

Processor Speed GHz Number of Processors Total Number of Cores Memory GB Question How can I reduce the memory usage of pdfkit when creating a PDF containing a lot of data URI images Description I am generating a data URI imageheavy PDF in a lambda function with a maximum memory size of MB Generating my MB PDF is using nearly all of the memory my lambda is allowed and I will need to generate larger PDFs in the future All of my images are provided as data URIs I looked at the pdfkit images code and I am wondering if the excessive memory usage is because pdfkit uses the src string as a key in the imageRegistry in imagesjs So my data URIs are being saved in the imageRegistry in both the key and value as well as being embedded in the PDF document I only use each image once so I think that I dont need the images to be stored in the imageRegistry at all Question How can I add an additional single line in header from second page onward in my python project using pdfkit Description I am

version if applicable Operating System Windows Pro I have PDFs that are not generated by pdfkit It would be cool if I could inject them into my pdfkit document the same way we can embed an image This would allow me to add other content to the page as well so I could add a header and footerwith correct page numbers over the top of the injected PDF so it all looked like it belonged together To my knowledge the only way to do this today is to use some tool to convert the PDF pages to images and inject them that way Either that or I would need to use another tool to merge these PDFs after being generated by pdfkit The downside would be that the footer wouldnt be on the merged pdf pages What do you think Doable Bumps handlebars from to details summaryChangelogsummary Sourced from handlebarss
