 Context There isnt a current way to remove a user from site access This may be an existing feature request but it would be awesome to have Our account removal process consists of revoking site access from users I dont currently see a way to do this with JiraPS Description It would be a great feature add to revoke site access SetJiraUser would be extremely powerful if you could revoke a users site access as well as remove them from groups The latter we are able to do already but the users still seem to have site access regardless This is in regards to Jira cloud and not Jira server We ran into an issue this week due to GetJiraIssueComment being completely broken for us in versions prior to the following change With Paging set to true the function seems to end up searching jira for comments endlessly With Paging set to false the function works as expected markdownlintdisable MD markdownlintdisable MD Description AddJiraIssueAttachmentps failing with URL error This operation is not

Expand Changelog for Jira Issues about Add ability to pull changelog for issues markdownlintdisable MD markdownlintdisable MD Context We are trying to pull data from an issue regarding when it transitions Essentially to calculate how long an issue stays in a specific status Feature appears to be missing from module but API is available to pull it A clear and concise description of what the problem is Ex Im always frustrated when Description It would be great if this functionality could be added to a new function or the existing GetJiraIssue function Any capabilities to pull dates when a Jira Issue transitions would be great also but just being able to pull the changelog would be great A clear and concise description of what you want to happen Additional Information StackOverflow link with more info Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here markdownlintdisable MD markdownlintdisable MD Description Running GetJiraUser Username or variants returns users successfully but their EmailAddress property is blank This seems to be down to a change in the API but reporting here as the field is returned so people would expect it to be populated Im logging this more for the benefit of others encountering this issue than for a bugfix in this module as I dont think its fixable within this module but is rather a restriction of the API The reason we see the EmailAddress property is because its assigned here The reason this is blank is because the API no longer populated an EmailAddress field eg going to does not include a mail address Atlassian have documented removing this field here Steps To Reproduce Run GetJiraUser Username Select First Unless the first user found is your account the email address property will be blank Expected behavior The users email address should be populated Your Environment GetModule JiraPS ListAvailable Select Name Version Name Version JiraPS PSVersionTable Name Value PSVersion PSEdition Desktop

users only that is the cause In theory to resolve click Edit Settings top right then change User Email Visibility to Public Sadly initial tests have shown that info still doesnt come through the API it seems this issue was discovered and reported years ago Note Im not sure whether JiraPS could show a warning explaining why this information is not shown when its not retrieved Alternatively happy for this to be closed as its not a JiraPS bug just wanted to ensure the tickets here to help others hitting this issue in future markdownlintdisable MD markdownlintdisable MD Context GetJiraUser is great but I need more data for further processing A clear and concise description of what the problem is Ex Im always frustrated when Description Add additional header to output of GetJiraUser A clear and concise description of what you want to happen Additional Information I found method in API documentation where session information is stored markdownlintdisable MD markdownlintdisable MD Provide a general summary of your changes in the Title above A pull request that fixes an issue Description This pull request allow to use few sessions to Jira server in same time For ex GetIssue Key AA Session sessionA GetIssue Key AA Session sessionB GetIssue Key AA Session SessionNameA GetIssue Key AA Session SessionNameB Motivation and Context There is project exists that I work for The project requires to write a scripts that fetch information from one Jira server and create an issue on other Jira server Current version of JiraPS does not allow such behaviors without call to SetJiraConfigServer Therefore the pull request allow to skip a switching Jira server between cmdlets calls Types of changes What types of changes does your code introduce Put an x in all the boxes that apply Bug fix nonbreaking change which fixes an issue X New feature nonbreaking change which adds functionality Breaking change fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change Checklist Go over all the following points and put an x in all the boxes that apply If youre unsure about any of these dont hesitate to ask Were here to help X My code follows the code style of this project X I have added Pester Tests that describe what my changes should do I have updated the documentation accordingly Hello team i got a question where i cant found any reply We use could jira and we use a functionality called Comment Internally to avoid users seeing our comment on their requests I cant se in any issue or wiki how to add an internal comment via jiraps have you some feature to do this Thanks a lot for your reply Alex markdownlintdisable MD markdownlintdisable MD Context Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Way back in I mentioned that it was not possible to set users as active vs inactive via the REST API To my surprise the Atlassian issue Ive been tracking for years has been updated and theyve finally added support for this in JIRA Since it is now possible to manage this via REST we should add support for it in this project Description Describe the solution youd like Add a new parameter for SetJiraUser Enabled bool If the parameter is provided add active true false to the body of the REST endpoint If the parameter is not provided do not change the users active state Additional Information Atlassians doc on the user endpoint contains the active property I have not tested this myself as I dont have access to a new enough JIRA environment to play with I dont recommend doing a check of the JIRA server version before trying to set this property as that would negatively impact performance Instead this would just be a user beware feature that is marked in the documentation as not usable on versions of JIRA older than This should also be a pretty simple change for anyone looking to get their feet wet contributing to the project
