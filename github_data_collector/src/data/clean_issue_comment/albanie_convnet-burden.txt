How do you calculate the FLOPs for each model Are there relevant papers or learning materials available And is this FLOPs defined as the time it takes to run a forward propagation during testing or the time it takes to complete forward and backward propagation completely during training Youve calculated the FLOPS per respective CNN architecture what execution performance can be expected from particular device GPU or CPU means what would be estimated inference time per single image where FLOPS performance of device is known FLOPs Floatingpoint operations FMAs Floatingpoint multiplicationadds Based on the values you give I think they should be FMAs instead of FLOPs and the number of FLOPs is approximately FMAs Could you please clarify Thanks Please tell me what is mean by res crelu and why Estimates for a single full pass of model at input size x takes GFLOPs while res crelu features with the network x input sizes using a batch size of takes GFLOPs
