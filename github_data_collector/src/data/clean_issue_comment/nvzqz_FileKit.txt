Setting pathExtension replaces any possible path extension on the Path even if it doesnt actually have one eg a file named Image Path needs appendextension String or some such Is there no way to get file base name filename without extension If yes then what the path that should be used and what changes are required for xcode project to support icloud on macOS When adding a String to a Path if the Path ends with and the String starts with then the results include AnySequence garbage swift import FileKit printPathFoobar wat prints FoobarAnySequencePathbox SwiftSequenceBoxSwiftDropFirstSequenceFileKitDirectoryEnumerator Tested with the latest develop d b e c b eb f eb on Swift It would be great to have a way to addremove extended file attributes For example If I wanted to associate different display name for file rather than original name of file In such case extended file attributes can come in handy Hi When I build your component with carthage I have these warnings SourcesCarthageCheckoutsFileKitSourcesPathswift warning ExpressibleByStringInterpolation is deprecated it will be replaced or redesigned in Swift Instead of conforming to ExpressibleByStringInterpolation consider adding an initString SourcesCarthageCheckoutsFileKitSourcesTextFileswift warning conditional downcast from NSString to String is a bridging conversion did you mean to use as I just tried building this on an linux machine running Ubuntu with swift and there were several build errors failurestxt I will attempt running this on my macOS laptop to see if I get the same failures Its have a easy method to get relative path When testing FileKit testWatch will sometimes fail on the first attempt Im not familiar with GCD so I dont necessarily know why this occurs
