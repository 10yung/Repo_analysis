Data related to CI status is only displayed in PRs not commits Cannot see first line of an Issue as you type it also cannot see the Issue title If I compare the app s user activity for someone in my organization I only get nonprivate activity Id lile to see my most importan org at the top not the one that starts with A When I open a repository using the ioc url structure the app doesnt let me navigate through that repository backwards only forwards That means I cant star the repo or look at other branches or see the authors other repos For that I have to open the authors profile page GitHub added reactions to PRs issues and comments Theyve also made an API available to retrieve reactions It would be absolutely fantastic if this was supported in ioctocat I find myself viewing issues in the browser just to see what the reactions were for a given comment I recently purchased ioctocat so this might be just the newbie speaking but I cant figure out how to return to code comments I made and edit them The comments dont appear in the code after I put them in I have to go to a browser to see them And since I cant find them I cannot delete or edit them Thanks for any help you can provide Steps to replicate From your feed view a repository someone has starred Raise the share sheet select Slack edit or not doesnt seem to matter Tap Post App crashes Slack post not sent Expected behavior App should send post App should not crash It would be great to have true iPad Pro support full resolution not scaled up iPad version split screen support etc These could simply work like labels and milestones the user could add a project label to an issuer remove it but otherwise couldnt edit the project
