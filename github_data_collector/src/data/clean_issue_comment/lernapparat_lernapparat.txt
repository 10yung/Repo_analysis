Apparently the following line should be changed in the class MyConv d x Fconvtranspose dx w stride paddingwsize should be instead x Fconvtranspose dx w stride paddingintwsize This is the best Python implementation of Style GAN for Pytorch Ive found so I wanted to make it easy to use in other projects Pytorch Hub makes it super easy for others to reuse this model and weights python import torch model torchhubloadndahlquistlernapparat stylegan pretrainedTrue done so easy Note There are a few references to ndahlquistlernapparat vs lernapparatlernapparat If youre interested to merge this contribution Im happy to change those Hi This code base lets us generate new samples but it cant be used to train new models Is there any possibility of you releasing that part of the pipeline as well Thanks Is this work covered by the MIT license I understand that the NVIDIA models wont be but I was hoping the PyTorch code would be Hi Thanks for releasing this code it is helpful for me But when i use a same noise input to your implementation and the official one i got two similar image but not exactly same Hi When I attempt to train is model on GPU it reports the error below while it can be trained on CPU RuntimeError Assertion dWeightisContiguous failed at optcondacondabldpytorch workatensrcTHCUNNgenericSpatialDepthwiseConvolutioncu Do you have any ideas about it pytorch cuda
