Testing the generic driver that is possible to use a domain name in the genericipaddress attribute For make easier to make others understand that is it possible a good idea should be change it to just genericaddress I can make this PR if you guys like this idea Please split system and peruser configuration and accept a path argument or env variable DESTDIR preferred One great feature that Dropbox offers a versioning backup system Have you looked into implementing this with say an automated git repository on the server You could even use git cloneing to nicely have an offsite backup just like Dropbox has Some features that you would get for free Cloneing File merging File conflict management by using a repository for each machine File transfer protocol Client adds files to server and then disconnects Client adds files to server Client connects with delete and removes every file added by client Im sad and confused halp when running usrlocalbinlipsyncd I get the following error messages in lipsyncdlog Thu Aug Debug daemonizing now Thu Aug Function InotifyaddWatchmediaGarbagesync true nil nil Thu Aug Inotify addwatchmediaGarbagesync Thu Aug Function InotifyaddWatchmediaGarbagesyncsync true nil nil Thu Aug Inotify addwatchmediaGarbagesyncsync Thu Aug Normal recursive startup rsync mediaGarbagesync mnthomedanarkysync Thu Aug Exec usrbinrsync delete r lts mediaGarbagesync mnthomedanarkysync Thu Aug Call getAlarm Thu Aug Debug getAlarm returns false Thu Aug Masterloop going into select no timeout DDWRT v sp mini c NewMediaNET GmbH Release SVN revision Enhanced with OTRW rsync failed to set times on mnthomedanarkysync Operation not permitted rsync recvgenerator mkdir mnthomedanarkysyncsync failed Permission denied Skipping any contents from this failed directory rsync error some filesattrs were not transferred see previous errors code at mainc sender Thu Aug Call collectProcess Thu Aug Delay collected an event Thu Aug Error Failure on startup of mediaGarbagesync Any ideas what might be causing this On a separate note I believe I found two typos In installsh line REMOTEHOSTLOCALDIR REMOTEDIR should be changed to REMOTEHOSTREMOTEDIR LOCALDIR And in usrlocalbinlipsync line REMOTEHOSTLOCALDIR REMOTEDIR should be changed to REMOTEHOSTREMOTEDIR LOCALDIR Hello Im running lipsync on archlinux and I had some errors in the installation process One is with all the chown usernameusername I dont know if there is a group with the same name as the username in ubuntu and debian but not in archlinux Is there a reason to do it that way I fixed it using groupid g username and chown usernamegroup everywhere New files are not detected by lipsync on the client and consequently deleted every cron sync until lipsynd is manually started I had to add lipsynd to startup with updatercd on all clients updatercd lipsyncd defaults Just setting up lipsync for the first time Ive run through the installsh with elevated privileges and supplied all the arguments to generate to the etclipsyncd conf file Everything in there looks great Initial sync interprets the input for client directory as that fullpath but on the server rather than the client local machine I do not believe this is expected behavior Ive tested this several times If I specify a fullpath that does indeed exist on the laptop client it will report that the directory does not exist unless I create it on the server first in which case it will work successfully The client machine then syncs files correctly but between the client and remote folders both of which are on the remote machine server Am I misunderstanding something Should there be both client and server folders on the server and then I should set up my own rules for syncing Should each client have its own folder on the server in addition to the server master copy or is this not expected behavior as I suspected i hope i can have a ignore list in client to ignore to sync some files to server I do not need to sync some files from server to my clientA But these files need to sync from server to my clientB When a computer is in a network that needs a proxy the cron job fails How can we add proxy handling to the application
