Hello The tables corresponding to the outputs and do not showed up well Bye Hello I found your TSP example very useful There is a small issue that I came across I found that using a set in generatecitiesn leads to problems with the indexing for larger problems As a set has no fixed order the expression listset in createtour used later might reorder the elements There is also a TSP example in the DEAP repository Instead of toolboxregistermate toolscxOrdered they use toolboxregistermate toolscxPartialyMatched but I dont know what exactly the difference is
