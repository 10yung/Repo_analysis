 We would like to generate rendered images of all models in ModelNet however the code released shows a missing of vlargparse which defines the rendering parameters for the view renderer and I am wondering if you can update it on Github Thank you I want to test the shaptnet dataset but I cant seem to find the label of the test set Hi I wonder if you have the rendered images for shrec The provided shapenet dataset is rendered from ShapeNetCorev right I would like to run some baselines So it would be better if I use the same dataset for fair comparison Thanks Hello When git submodule update init theres no error But when matlab nodisplay r setuptruestructenableGputrueenableCudnntrueexit the errors I got I guess the dependencies installed unsuccessfully So should I install the dependencies independently Or there are any better solutions Thanks Hi I am just trying to recreate the results of the finetuned CNN experiment that you showed on the paper specifically that a a pretrained CNN with finetuning on the ModelNet dataset using x views for both testing and training can achieve accuracy When you say finetuned did you retrain just the last layer as your number of classes decreased or did you retrain the entire classifier portion of the network and if so what parameters did you use when retraining I have currently tried both VGG and Alexnet and only tuning the last layer due to class number changes I can only get an accuracy of for Alexnet and for VGG I believe it has something to do with my parameters or my understanding of finetuning but any help on this matter would be phenomenal Thanks Manik Hi You mentioned that there are object instances in the ModelNet dataset in your paper However in your provided dataset I find there are only object instances Could you please provide more details about the dataset Thank you for your help Sorry Im new to this area When I follow READMEmd finish the installation I run this command shapecomputedescriptorairplane off And I got a txt file named airplane descriptortxt What is the purpose of this file And how can I get the predicted label with this file Thanks for any help Hi I have seen the great power of d object classification MVCNN And I wonder whether you have examined the network s performance when the texture information of the d model is included I have collected a bunch of models and some of them are in different class only due to their different color on the surface So I wonder whether you have tried using colored rendered picture as the input Thanks Hello suhangpro Is there any way that I could visualize layer weightsgradients to see how well it is training Thanks
