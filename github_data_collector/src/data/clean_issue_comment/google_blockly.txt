warnings on the console And UserAgent strings will stop being updated Other browsers appear to be following suit This is being done to reduce fingerprinting We need to investigate the new landscape and adjust as needed Personal opinion This will simply spawn a raft of libraries which check for known JavaScriptobservable quirks of each browser Net result will be the same amount of fingerprinting but now with more bugs Thanks for opening an issue for us Before you open an issue please check if a similar issue exists or has been closed before If youre asking a question about how to use Blockly in your application please ask questions on the mailing list instead of filing issues Describe the bug Comments are missing scrollbars A clear and concise description of what the bug is To Reproduce Explain what someone needs to do in order to see whats described above Steps to reproduce the behavior Create a comment on a block that results in needing to scolls Observe no scrollbars Expected

TODO Does any documentation need to be created or updated because of this PR If so please explain Additional Information Had to change reading of variable name from XML because textContent of parent element is changed by adding childNode with textContent For discussion is if it is not problematic about backward compatibility If yes better could be using attribute than element but strange if anybody stores large data Anything else we should know Be careful this is my first pull request in this project Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe We have had a problem with the blocks in blockly games turning black a lot see so might be worth it to set up a test for this However we dont currently have any infrastructure for this setup A clear and concise description of what the problem is Ex Im always frustrated when Describe the solution youd like A clear and concise description of what you want to happen Describe alternatives youve considered A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here Thanks for opening an issue for us Before you open an issue please check if a similar issue exists or has been closed before If youre asking a question about how to use Blockly in your application please ask questions on the mailing list instead of filing issues Describe the bug When I create Block with side effect of creating nonexisting variable mirroring is not functioning properly due to bad order of Create and VarCreate events A clear and concise description of what the bug is To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Define block with variable field and put it into toolbox Move it to the workspace Nonexisting variable is created as side effect of creating block Fired events in this order BLOCKCREATE VARCREATE in BlocklyFlyoutprototypecreateBlock Due to first event is created block on mirrored environment side effect is creating new nonexisting variable Due to second event is created new variable but it was created in error Expected behavior In mirrored environment is variable created before the block so it is existing before block creating and has not attempted to create is as side effect Additional context If You swap BlocklyEventsfirenew BlocklyEventsCreatenewBlock and for var i i newVariableslength i var thisVariable newVariables i BlocklyEventsfirenew BlocklyEventsVarCreatethisVariable All is ok Or do not disable events when creating block and do not test for newly created variables Only set event group before creating block It would be clearer in my opinion but I dont know about another effects Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe A clear and concise description of what the problem is Ex Im always frustrated when Ive been thinking about how to make functionality of App Inventor more discoverable and one big challenge has always been helping people discover how the mutator works Id like to be able to encourage people to rightclick anywhere in the editor and see a Help item to explain what something does The problem is that icons such as the mutator icon pass context menu activation to the block so the Help is the block help Describe the solution youd like A clear and concise description of what you want to happen I propose adding an iconMenu field for blocks that if set is called and passed the icon being clicked and a list of menu options probably empty to start or with a Help option but similar logic to generateContextMenu This context menu is shown in place of the blocks context menu Describe alternatives youve considered A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered We have animated GIFs in the App Inventor documentation to show how mutators work but even knowing that the blue icon is called a mutator makes it hard to discover By making it so that people can rightclick and request help gives us the opportunity to more directly link the explanation to the item Since we also want to add more icons in the future for different features my proposal includes the icon so that we can customize the options based on the icon type Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here Not at this time When a listsgetIndex block has a list input that is not a variable but a literal like listscreatewith the generated Lua code looks like foo bar Thats not valid Lua according to the interpreter Im working with and two other online interpreters I tested replit and tutorialspoint Wrapping the literal in parentheses makes the interpreters happy foo bar Maybe listscreatewith should always wrap the list literal in parens or listsgetIndex should have different operator precedent rules lualistexample Thanks for helping us improve our developer site documentation Use this template to describe issues with the content at developersgooglecomblocklyguides Where A link to the page with the documentation you want us to update More specific is better If no page exists describe what the page should be and where What What kind of content is it Check a box with an x between the brackets x x Text Image or Gif Other Old content This is not the default look for Blockly but it may be added by either setting BlocklyBlockSvgSTARTHAT true or by adding a theme and setting the hat option on the block style What the documentation currently says Suggested change We should instead suggest overriding the rendering constant ADDSTARTHATS Your suggestion for improved documentation Additional context The constant BlocklyBlockSvgSTARTHAT referenced in the documentation was moved to BlocklyblockRenderingConstantProviderADDSTARTHATS in change Add any other context about the problem here If this is related to a specific pull request link to it
