I upgraded a quad from FC SucceX F V to the SucceXD V nothing else changed and arming it was doing roll of death after checking everything possible I found the Gyros alignment incorrect I verified comparing to the F V wich their defaults I tested good in and After I fixed manually the alignment of both gyros it worked well Here are the diff for the gyros and gyro sensoralign CW Allowed values DEFAULT CW CW CW CW CW FLIP CW FLIP CW FLIP CW FLIP CUSTOM Default value CW I have to set it to CW manually you can see the default is gyro sensoralign CW Allowed values DEFAULT CW CW CW CW CW FLIP CW FLIP CW FLIP CW FLIP CUSTOM Default value DEFAULT The default value DEFAULT not sure what it means but apparently for the other SucceX F V is CW which is correct Thanks Denis Rename FLASHSIZE used in build system which in turn passed to gcc with D to TARGETFLASHSIZE to avoid symbol collision with library The addition of a driver for an I C interfaced RTC to the system would be great Some suggested devices are preferably the PCF MCP x etc A reliable battery backed clock which has the actual time and date is a nice addon The DPS has been out for a couple of years and is an advanced barometris pressure sensor It has a capacitive sensor rather than a resistive sensor like most ubiquitous barometric sensors MS BMP etc The capacitive sensor is immune to light sensitivity unlike the resistive sensors In addition they have a higher resolution and accuracy The BMM compass is a solid component and it has been around for some time yet it is not supported Would be nice to have The Memsic MMC A is an advanced version of the ubiquitous HMC It is a newer stateofthe art component It has much higher data rate capability However its register set is a bit different than the HMC part similar just uses different locations Hi Why PPM frame is limited to channels it is not consistent with iNav and very disturbing define MAXSUPPORTEDRCPPMCHANNELCOUNT Possible to set channels Treatment of unused pins are moved to the end of system initialization for F and F and F This will help peripherals that are sensitive to pin levels being high for a while during power on initialization period F and H actually did not have any pin initialization at the beginning of the system initialization so this PR will add it
