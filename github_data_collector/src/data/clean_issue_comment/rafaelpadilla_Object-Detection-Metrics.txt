I was absolutely shocked to find that line of pascalvocpy is this shutilrmtreesavePath ignoreerrorsTrue Clear folder Because of this I accidentally deleted a very important folder that contained all of my data documents and programs from the past month I am lucky that I have a backup of most of it Others will not be so lucky and Im sure I will not be the last person to assume that specifying the save path as the projects top level directory will be a harmless decision This line definitely should be changed to something like if not ospathisdirsavePath osmakedirssavePath or anything besides what it currently is After this frightening experience I will be writing a script to check all code downloaded from github for rmtree so I never make a mistake like this again With that said thank you for writing this program Overall it is excellent I am getting the below error Traceback most recent call last File pascalvocpy line in module showGraphicshowPlot File datamodelassessObjectDetectionMetricslibEvaluatorpy line in PlotPrecisionRecallCurve pltplotrecall precision labelPrecision File dataanacondaenvspy libpython sitepackagesmatplotlibpyplotpy line in plot ax gca File dataanacondaenvspy libpython sitepackagesmatplotlibpyplotpy line in gca return gcfgcakwargs File dataanacondaenvspy libpython sitepackagesmatplotlibpyplotpy line in gcf return figure File dataanacondaenvspy libpython sitepackagesmatplotlibpyplotpy line in figure kwargs File dataanacondaenvspy libpython sitepackagesmatplotlibbackendbasespy line in newfiguremanager return clsnewfiguremanagergivenfigurenum fig File dataanacondaenvspy libpython sitepackagesmatplotlibbackendbasespy line in newfiguremanagergivenfigure canvas clsFigureCanvasfigure File dataanacondaenvspy libpython sitepackagesmatplotlibbackendsbackendqt aggpy line in init superFigureCanvasQTAgg selfinitfigurefigure File dataanacondaenvspy libpython sitepackagesmatplotlibbackendsbackendqt py line in init createqApp File dataanacondaenvspy libpython sitepackagesmatplotlibbackendsbackendqt py line in createqApp raise RuntimeErrorInvalid DISPLAY variable RuntimeError Invalid DISPLAY variable Can anyone please help me debug this does anyone know how to run this library directly on tensorflow object detection checkpoints You write In some images there are more than one detection overlapping a ground truth Images and For those cases the detection with the highest IOU is considered TP and the others are considered FP This rule is applied by the PASCAL VOC metric eg detections TP of a single object is counted as correct detection and false detections But in the VOC paper they say Detections output by a method were assigned to groundtruth objects satisfying the overlap criterion in order rankedby the decreasing confidence output Multiple detectionsof the same object in an image were considered false detections eg detections of a single object counted as correctdetection and false detection Ie they say they sort on confidence but you say you sort on IoU is this an error or am I missing something Hi in the readme example there are two detections R Y with the same confidence but one of them is labeled TP and the other is labeled FP When creating the Precision x Recall curve the order of these makes a difference for the final mAP score Is there a rule on how to order these FP but comment False Negative Hi I would like to calculate threshold values for given precisionrecall point using GetPascalVOCMetrics method However Im confused how every box confidence scores are used in conjuction with IOU threhold From the code I can see that only IOU threshold is used to determine if a detection is a FP or TP The confidence scores seems to be ignored I assumed that detections confidence scores are also used to calculate TPFP however it is seems that they are not As such I dont know how to extract threshold values per each precisionrecall point What am I missing Seria interessante a implementa o do Log Average Miss Rate j que utilizado como m trica em detec o de pedestres I run eval methods in every epo during training but i found it runs very slow So how could I move metrics methods in GPU thx
