Closes x Write unit tests it would be great to pass through some options to requests such as for example a value for the timeout parameter any thoughts on allowing this in general on all the apis or less flexibly but still usefully allowing for a general configuration for all queries as an example it would be great if when calling place we could pass through an additional dictionary of these values and use them as an arg for requestskwargs thoughts thanks placesphoto returns responseitercontent but responseheaders contains the mimetype of the file so its hard to find out the extension of the file I read the following doc The duration in traffic is returned only if all of the following are true The request includes a valid API key or a valid Google Maps APIs Premium Plan client ID and signature The request does not include stopover waypoints If the request includes waypoints they must be prefixed with via to avoid stopovers The request is specifically for driving directions the mode parameter is set to driving The request includes a departuretime parameter Traffic conditions are available for the requested route For condition how do I prefix via to the waypoints I have a list of coordinates The API doc specifies that departurearrival times are in seconds since January UTC When generating the appropriate timestamp from a Python datetime object in converttime the library ignores attached timezones assuming local datetimes For example the following code returns wrong traffic information gmaps googlemapsClientkeyXXX clientidXXX clientsecretXXX times datetime tzinfotimezoneutc datetime tzinfotimezonetimedeltahours datetime tzinfotimezonetimedeltahours for time in times res gmapsdirectionsMontauban Toulouse departuretimetime printdatetime duration formattime res legs durationintraffic text where the first two times correspond to the exact same timestamp and the third time is an hour before the other two print the following datetime duration mins datetime duration mins datetime duration mins I think that the right fix would be to use the timezone aware timestamp datetime method rather than timetuple in converttime Was there a reason for using timetuple I can open a PR for that if it helps
