This PR adds an option throwerrors to runxunit which defaults to false if not supplied It used then test cases will be run outside a try catch block The purpose it to make it easier to debug test cases and use test cases for development of features PR the fix for introduced a test failure on R a Windows bit TestSuiteTesttestfromNamewithrelativedirnameonpath fails with the message below because matlabsystemCoreBlockSystem contains an error The specified superclass matlabsystemBlockCore contains a parse error or cannot be found on MATLABs search path possibly shadowed by another file with the same name I modified the test to use its own directory on the path rather than assuming anything about MATLABs internal packages I verified that this version of the test fails in R a and R a when the fix for TestSuitefromName is backed out Merged in multiple logging support from adambard commits fb f da f b a da c f cd a a de fb d be d fb a f d e Fixed to work with psexton branch Example usage Output test results to console text log file and JUnit XML file runxunit verbose logfile testreporttxt xmlfile testreportxml tests Output multiple JUnit XML files one per TestSuite runxunit verbose logfile testreporttxt xmlfile C tools matlab matlabxunit testreport tests The documentation for filemarker will be helpful here Theres some thats just n and some that are r n Git seems to really want them to be n in the repository but since so many Matlab people use it on Windows Im not sure if thats best If you run your examples in Matlab thats like columns wide but the tests are run in an environment thats only columns wide there will be differences in how Matlab paginates the output so the tests will fail This only happens if you eg print a x matrix
