In file vlmserc line the height of the two trees r ridx and r nridx is determined before the two roots are computed climb I think this should be done after the two climb statements So this should be reordered to Now we join the two subtrees rooted at RIDX ROOT IDX NRIDX ROOTNIDX Note that RIDX ROOTIDX might change as we process more neighbors so we need keep updating it ridx climbr idx nridx climbr nidx int hgt r ridx height int nhgt r nridx height As far as I can tell they are not doing anything According to this maxvalue should be less then but in code we have pgmc if maxvalue return vlsetlasterrorVLERRPGMINVMETA Invalid PGM meta information As result all valid pgm images considered as incorrect Hello I tried to install the toolbox on MATLAB R b on my mac running on MacOS Mojave I downloaded the package and moved it to toolbok I ran run ApplicationsMATLABR bapptoolboxvlfeat toolboxvlsetupm but get the following Warning Warning Name is nonexistent or not a directory ApplicationsMATLABR bapptoolboxvlfeat toolboxmexmexmaci there is indeed no files there and the folder mex does not exist Any idea how to install this package Thanks R mi There are tons of open issues and tons of pull requersts that fix critical bugs Do something c gcc fopenmp c vlkmeansc In file included from vlkmeansh from vlkmeansc vlkmeansc In function vlkmeansquantizef vlmathoph error vlinfinityd not specified in enclosing parallel define VLINFINITYD vlinfinitydvalue vlkmeansc note in expansion of macro VLINFINITYD TYPE bestDistance TYPE VLINFINITYD In file included from vlkmeansc vlkmeansc error enclosing parallel pragma omp parallel defaultnone In file included from vlkmeansc vlkmeansc In function vlkmeansquantized vlkmeansc error vlinfinityd not specified in enclosing parallel TYPE bestDistance TYPE VLINFINITYD vlkmeansc error enclosing parallel pragma omp parallel defaultnone Any chance for updating the lib It compiles the code in VS hello world works siftexe after some compatiblity changes compiles as well but crashes during IO reading file with unhandled exception invalid paramaters from ucrtbasedll according to stackexchange it is a VS version issue best Przemek There are options to build VLFEAT for Windows with Matlab or Unix with Octave or Unix for Matlab but not Windows for Octave
