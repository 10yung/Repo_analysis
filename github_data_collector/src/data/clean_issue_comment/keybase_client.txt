It would be nice if Keybase used instead of when adding the Keybase repository to a system Ive no notification sound on incoming chat messages on desktop Gentoo Linux while text popup notification works okay My friend doesnt have notification sound both on desktop Ubuntu and on phone Android but do have text notifications on both Ive notification sound on phone Android This is very annoying and may become a reason to stop using keybase May be related to x add a checkbox for user consent about FUSE for macOS being closedsource x add the same checkbox for finder integration popup when user clicks the icon when integration is not enabled x persist dismiss action across app restart so banner wont show up in Files tab after app restarts if user has dismissed it x hide the finder integration icon on rows and in header if user has dismissed the banner user can still enable it in Settings if they want x a few design tweaks for the Files settings tab including getting rid of the banner there and replace the checkbox with texts and a button automatic uninstall the kext with helper upgrade cc mmaxim Based on review that one first Also index filenames separately from contents This will let us rename documents without having to reindex their contents And tokenize the names by removing the punctuation Issue HOTPOT keybasereacthackers this is ready for review It adds buttons to the Whats new rows and a Nyctographic hover effect for desktop keybasereacthackers Based on review that one first This refactors indexChild a bit to make it easier to update an existing alreadyindexed file It moves the docID into place for the new block ID and makes sure it is used while indexing Issue HOTPOT A user tried to resolve an implicit team by ID when their network was flaky They got back an AppStatusError with an APINetError code This caused them to fallthrough to the code that treated it like a normal team which unfortunately set the name of the TLF to the keybaseimplicitteamstyle name which caused a lot of confusion until the next reboot We should treat network errors like that as real errors and only fallthrough for certain kinds of errors Theres not a proper error type yet for that so this commit does our best to improve the situation for now Issue HOTPOT Previously this just panicd on an error which could lead to a smiliar issue to the one that exposed HOTPOT fixed in e a Theres no reason not to handle the error in the normal way Issue HOTPOT
