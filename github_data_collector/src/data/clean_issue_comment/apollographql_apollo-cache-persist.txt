reactnativecommunityasyncstoragenext doesnt support setItem removeItem and getItem functions anymore and sticks to get set and remove APIs This will break the implementation of apollocachepersist and make it completely unusable in latest versions Hi I have an issue where every time I change my query old data cant be fetched Lets say I have to following query js gql characters client id name Everything works fine cache is persisted If I in some point want to add to that query js gql characters client id name age The old data wont query anymore This PR contains the following updates

rebasecheck If you want to rebaseretry this PR check this box This PR has been generated by WhiteSource Renovate View repository job log here When using a local client cache its helpful to have a default state that only gets initialized the first time the cache is created and not when the cache is restored from persist storage With this doesnt seem simple anymore has an old example of setting up defaults And this workaround js withClientState resolvers cache defaults windowlocalStoragelength defaults typeDefs But both of those code snippets are invalid in In theres a link to Apollo Boost code but that code has now been removed together with all of Apollo Boost See for the explanation that neither defaults nor intializers are necessary in because writeData is available Id like a way to initialize data only once in a way that works with apollocachepersist If such a mechanism already exists then maybe it just needs documentation After initializing the client I can do a query to see if data exists in the local cache This results in an error as explained in But swallowing the error is an OK workaround for me js let data undefined try data clientreadQuery query catch error
