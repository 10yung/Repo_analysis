It would be very helpful if there would be a copytoclipboard button icon especially for the Show access path textbox Nowadays the documentexecCommandcopy function is widely supported so this shouldnt be much of a problem and would help avoid many repetitive steps Might even be as simple as using double click to copy although in this case the user would need to know about that functionality first of course I have file tstphp php requireonce vendorautoloadphp d run this file in cli with phpkint v and with phpkint v Why data displaying is not correct in phpkint v Make xml access paths out of xpaths Im not sure if this is properly doable but if not Ill scratch this idea SimpleXML currently doesnt not sure about domdocument d without an argument just returns No argument so it is not really used So why not using d for the debug backtrace because it feels more intuitive than d is it possible to have a configuration which uses xdebuggetfunctionstack instead of debugbacktrace Its useful if you want to print trace inside fatal errors easy to see stack trace inside fatal errors
