 lepton v g d bc terminate called after throwing an instance of stdsystemerror what Resource temporarily unavailable This is the entire output stderr I am using lepton as a subprocess with stdin and stdout piped to compress hundreds of thousands of jpgs Stderr is piped to stderr There is a crash approximately one in every It does not appear to be dependent on the file rerunning the program works fine through the file that previously failed My main issue here is that lepton exits with code even though it failed and wrote bytes to stdout If lepton fails for any reason shouldnt it exit with a nonzero code to indicate the error If not how can I discover this error other than searching stderr for this string I dont know if its a good idea to force marchnative in configureac without an option to disable it or use ie mavx Appearently this might lead to binaries that could crash if you want to run them on a different machine see Hello My organization is considering using Lepton Ideally we would like to eventually port the software over to an FPGA platform however that would require that ANS support as there is no way the VP encoder could reasonably fit I havent seen much development happening with respect the ANS encoder that is presently hidden behind an experimental feature flag Is this encoder fully supported yet Will this encoder be supported going forward Thanks srcleptonvp decodercc drain There is a memory leak in VP ComponentDecoderSendToVirtualThreaddrain in vp decodercc If Line takes true branch function drain will return without releasing data srcleptonvp decodercc read Similarly in function VP ComponentDecoderSendToVirtualThreadread data is leaked if Line takes true branch Im so close to getting lepton to run in my browser with WASM but this is the last thing I cant figure out I was thinking that it must be create by merging prejs some custom code and postjs but its not clear what the contents should be Could you point me in the right direction Thanks I got for it We found with our fuzzer that lepton f d c may spend too much time on some crafted files as listed in this directory Given the fact that these file are quite small k we think this may result from some implementation pitfalls Command lepton FILE tmptestjpg When running lepton unjailed FILE tmptestjpg it exhibits several runtime errors Lost a few files today due to a typo so decided to make sure Lepton cant be made complicit in such activities again Files can be clobbered by adding clobber to the options I noticed the presence of a o for overwrite but it doesnt appear to do anything I added a new option in case that option is used elsewhere And dont weep for my files They live on in my heart and backups can we improve compression rate by compress the residulals of ac coefficients and its predicted values Hi Im trying to experiment with lepton for my software portability class however when I try to run lepton on one of my class servers I get these errors srcioseccompbpfhh warning warning Platform does not support seccomp filter yet Wcpp srcioSeccompcc error error AUDITARCH value unavailable error AUDITARCH value unavailable and srcleptonjpgcodercc In function int appmainint char srcleptonjpgcodercc error builtincpusupports was not declared in this scope builtincpusupportsavx Im compiling with the option you gave in issue Is there any advice you can give Thank you Sanjit
