 Category Question x Bug Enhancement Authors wobba VesaJuvonen Expected or Desired Behavior Running npm install should install all dependencies so that I can then progress onto testing the build and

Steps to Reproduce git clone cd C dev spdevfxwebparts samples reactscripteditor npm install Category x Question Bug x Enhancement While working on this project I setup this with the environment Ive a SharePoint Site with the list named Events and I try to fill up the form for adding events to the list Everything is working as expected except on field Expected or Desired Behavior The expected behavior should be that it asks for both date and time as the type of the field in the list is Date and Time Observed Behavior I have various fields in the list and one of the field named Start Time has a Type as Date and Time and when I use the default form provided by SharePoint it gives me option for choosing both date and time for that field can be seen in pic But when I use reactlistform webpart for the same that field doesnt give me option to select time it only provides me with the option to select date can be seen in pic a pic b Thanks for your contribution Sharing is caring Question x Bug Enhancement Authors koltyakov Expected or Desired Behavior Webpart would work both in Chrome and Edge Observed Behavior Webpart works great in Edge right side of screenshot I only see a whitespace in Chrome left side of screenshot Also not sure if this is a problem but I also see a lot of purple request lines while running gulp serve screenshot Would this cause any problems later on Steps to Reproduce npm install npm install onelresize gulp serve Chrome is on left Edge is on right SharePoint Web Part Workbench and more pages Microsoft Edge I have about rows of the purple request lines running gulp serve FacebookPage tsx Socialiis Visual Studio Code Q A Bug fix yes New feature yes sebastienlevert Whats in this Pull Request Two small updates Add order to Youtube API search params Without an order in the YouTube api parameter it seems to return them in order of published date So if you have any number of videos the component shows the oldest ones first which is not recommended I hardcoded order by date which returns selection similar to when you go to that channel on YouTube Decode Title and Description properties of video Attached is an example of a result I saw I just added a small loop to remove convert the amp to Im sure there is a betterfastercleaner way to do it but this does the job NOTE that I also apply it to the description which may or may not be best practice I only noticed it on the Title as seen in the attached screenshot Otherwise great component Window Category Question x Bug Enhancement Authors DanyWyss Regarding reactlistform webpart Expected or Desired Behavior SharePoint validations such as mandatory fields or custom column validation must be applied when saving a new list item Observed Behavior I have used this web part and set the Form Type to New When I try to save a new list item I do not see any of the validationserror messages The Save button just refreshes the page or if I have set up the redirect URL redirects to that URL Steps to Reproduce Add this web part to a page Link it to a list where there are mandatory fields and custom column validations Set the Form Type to New and Publish the page Then try to create a new list item which misses some of the mandatory fields or violates the column validations Notice that the error messages are not displayed on the page Thanks for your contribution Sharing is caring Category x Question Bug Enhancement Expected or Desired Behavior I expect to see all past and new events registered on the calendar with the type of event displayed on the pop up card in order to inform users what type of event each color represents Observed Behavior I understand that the web part was built with the intention of randomizing the colors of each event However all event cards display a name days and time taken but not the type of event registered It will be useful to also include the type of event on the card for the sake of matching a color to an event type For example the scenario of leave types Sick PTO Vacation Bereavement etc Steps to Reproduce Download repo Select reactcalendar to build and package Install app on SharePoint environment Add app to site contents Add web part to SharePoint modern page and select desired calendar in property panel Category Question x Bug Enhancement Expected or Desired Behavior I expect to see all past and new events created via Microsoft Flow represented properly on the calendar Observed Behavior Events represented on the calendar via Microsoft Flow displays hour later that applied for For example if I request personal time off from pm pm the event registered on the calendar displays the time as H H If I were to add an event directly to the calendar via the property panel the event registers correctly However we are not allowing this functionality as our only method of adding events to the calendar is via Microsoft Flow Items created by Microsoft Flow that are represented on the calendar displays in the color of blue and does not randomize If I were to add an event directly to the calendar via the property panel and I refresh the page the event color randomizes In my previous calendar I had specific colors to represent each type of event Category Question x Bug Enhancement Authors sebastienlevert VesaJuvonen Expected or Desired Behavior reactgraphcalendar The calendar whether in WebPart format or in Teams should pull through group events and represent them to the viewer showing the correct start and end dates Observed Behavior The calendar in both Teams and SharePoint shows all events as a day later than they are when they were created If I add an event to the group that is scheduled for all day on the th January at to at it will display in the webpart or team app on the th January at to at Steps to Reproduce I have added the Teams app and SharePoint WebPart to various teams both recently created and Year old teams and it does the same on all of them I have checked the timezones on the teams and my client and everything is UKLondon as the same as my Outlook client I have also tried cloning a fresh version and reinstalling it to my app catalog however it still does the same thing If I add Microsofts own Group Calendar web part the events show the correct date and times Also if I use the Microsoft Graph explorer and pull the events for that group it shows them with the correct timings so it doesnt appear to be anything to do with the groups themselves I am importing events from site contents site url using properties panel when imported the timings in the modern pages comes different wrt classic web page Can someone help me regarding this issue After downloading both by using the ZIP and Git I am instructed to execute npm install However this results in an enormous amount of warmings due to missing files and the end result are errors gulp serve als gives errors So Im stuck on getting the files before starting How can I get all the files and all dependencies andor make sure that the code I download is complete and working
