This is a small PR to disable note bubble physics the feature that constrains the bubble at the walls of the screen The motivation behind this modification is that those physics behave in an unpredictable way making the bubble feature almost unusable see this video Futhermore I cant understand why the user should not be able to position the bubble wherever they want If you create a notification or reminder for a note then edit it while the notification is there in the drop down it keeps pinging with the updated text as it is typed For urgent notifications that means the heads up display keeps showing up on the screen and virtually stays there until the editing is finished The app should wait until the user exits the edit mode then update the notification This PR improves the top toolbar by replacing title and icon with the ones pertaining to the current navigation mode Archived Locked etc except for Home so that the user can clearly see which is the current context in particular when there are no notes A positive sideeffect of this improvement is that theres no more flashing in the UI when the user switches to search mode since the toolbar has been extracted from the RecyclerView Futhermore now when the user is inside a folder and switches to another navigation mode the current folder is resetted This is in general more consistent with the change to back button behavior in and emphasizes the fact that we are switching to a different context Finally Ive made some minor tweaks to how coroutines are used and removed that pesky and useless singleThreadDispatcher Heres a video recap of the changes intoduced with this PR This is a rather small PR aimed at fixing some little UI bugs and make some improvements to the note viewer Changes are the following fix text formats padding which was slightly but visibly higher than the other paddings improve the look of list bullets which was really horrible after the latest update The new look combines the best parts of both the old one v and the most recent one fix the color of checklist formats which wasnt consistent with all the other formats it had been set to a different alpha likely by mistake in a Here are a screenshot before and one after the PR Screenshotbefore Screenshotafter Using local folder sync within the app Ive noticed a couple of strange things in its behavior only notesfolderstags created after the enabling of local sync seem to be synced Id expect all notes to be synced notes in trash are not put in the deleted subfolder bug Could the working GDrive folder sync algorithm be used also for this feature In the current state it seems very buggy If you pin a note then remove the app from the recents list opening the app again removes the pin This happens even if you swipe down to sync with the local folder Version FDroid When editing a note text blocks can be dragged by touching an area outside the drag handle at the left of the block As it can be seen in the screen capture here this causes other problems if you start editing a note by selecting a word the text block suddenly gets moved when the keyboard opens if you select some text the text being selected can be used as a drag handle If thats the intended behavior I think that should be changed In landscape mode all bottom sheets main menu settings edit notebook etc show up only for a very little portion when you first open them which is suboptimal for the user experience because you need to open them fully to interact with their content You can see a screen capture of this problem here I propose to change the current behaviour so that when the device is in landscape bottom sheets open fully right away instead of just partially There is already a PINLock in order to lock notes So privacy is basically interesting I guess Especially for syncing in the cloud or storing backups it is important to encrypt Only then they are secured and stored safely Android prevents access to app data by default but it would be great to see the encryption on that data as well All encryption should be optional of course Would be happy to see an improvement there It might be useful to see the back up of notes as a new commit for a remote or local repository
