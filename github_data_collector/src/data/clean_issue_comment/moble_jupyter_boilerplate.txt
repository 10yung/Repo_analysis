After checking Snippets Menu in Configurable nbextensions Snippets didt appear as expected then I checked out JavaScript console found a red line htmlmenuitemspecnameUncaught in promise TypeError Cannot read property name of undefined at mainjsline while I don t know much about JS could you please help with it Thanks I systematically tested them and here are some improvements and fixes It would be so awesome if in addition to being able to go to the snippets menu in order to insert snippet one could simply type for example function then hit a hot key say tab and have the snippet inserted like def functionname variables something return variables I dont know how feasible this is but it would be awesome There is already something like this called ultisnips as a package for Vim Like tic toc install nbextension etc The main thing stopping this from being a pretty general menuing extension is the inability to accept general JavaScript for onclick instead of snippets While Im at it I might as well add an option to accept simple text items for typesetting for example to explain that CODATA returns are valunituncert This is a new feature since the last time I was doing serious tree traversal Might be useful Looks like EPath stands for manipulating expressions by path Perhaps meant to be a formation similar to XPath Ah yes It even says so in the docstring for epath There are still some not yet implemented functions that are mostly just placeholders to remind me to do something about them x SymPy examples can probably be copied from the cheatsheet x Matplotlib examples can probably be easily copied from the gallery NumPy needs some real functions SciPy needs some real functions pandas needs some good slicing examples Generally more boilerplate can always be added Change the default menu to specifically note that it is python Then add as best I can some boilerplate for Julia and R Note that markdown is common to all three so I can just separate that out and add it in to each
