 Should be unsafeRunSync not unsafePerformSync Now that catseffect is out itd be nice if this used it I am receiving errors like this Exception in thread main javalangNoSuchMethodError catseffectAsyncshiftLscalaconcurrentExecutionContextLjavalangObject at knobsResourcewatchStreamResourcescala at knobsResourceanonfunwatchEvent Resourcescala at knobsResourceanonfunwatchEvent adaptedResourcescala at catseffectIOMapapplyIOscala at catseffectIOMapapplyIOscala at catseffectinternalsIORunLoopliftedTree IORunLoopscala at catseffectinternalsIORunLoopstepIORunLoopscala at catseffectIOunsafeRunTimedIOscala at catseffectIOunsafeRunSyncIOscala I assume this is because the catseffect version is a bit older Custom watching implementation in knobs can be replaced with WatchService wrapper from fs Are there any plans to add defaults for environment variables It looks like the latest version of this project now supports Cats It would be great to have some documentationexamples of how to use this with Cats Weve done something like this to support decoding dates form our config files scala implicit val configuredLocalDate Configured LocalDate new Configured LocalDate def applya CfgValue SomeLocalDateparseaprettyreplace ofPatterndd MMM yyyy Is that something that couldshould go into the CfgValue trait Wed do a pull request but arent sure how youd prefer it to slot in The BaseConfig class keeps its internal mutable state as IORefs and we should change this to scalazstreamasyncmutableSignal to make it easier to subscribe to changes Users should be able to get a Process TaskConfig from or even instead of a MutableConfig
