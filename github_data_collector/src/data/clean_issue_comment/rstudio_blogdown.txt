Hi I am trying to add a table to my post to the Hugo Academic themes using Rmarkdown with the kableExtra package in an R chunk code However it seems that I can not customize the styling options to my table such as to position the table to the center of the page or to use the basic format in the bootstrap options by default the table appears with strips of alternative colors in each row Here is the reproducible code r echoFALSEerrorFALSEmessageFALSE librarykableExtra libraryknitr librarydplyr optionsknitrkableNA optionskableExtrahtmlbsTable TRUE dt mtcars kabledtformat html kablestylingposition rightbootstrapoptions basic I notice some odd behavior on the list page of the post directory for the Hugo Academic theme and blogdown Specifically if a code chunk is the first piece of text in an Rmd post AND includeFALSE is not set then the summary for that post is the code chunk img width altScreen Shot at PM src Steps to reproduce Make a new website using blogdown and Hugo Academic theme File New Project New Directory Website using blogdown Hugo theme gcushenhugoacademic Create Project build site blogdownbuildsite serve site blogdownservesite Go to post page and notice last entry Hello R Markdown followed by some summary text Edit the file contentpost rrmarkdownRmd by removing the first paragraph of text save and reserve site if necessary Now if you look back at the post page the summary under Hello R Markdown is the code from the first code chunk Unless you specify includeFALSE in the code chunk whenever you have a Rmd file and code is the first thing on the page then the chunk and its data will be used in the summary Please keep the below portion in your issue Your issue will be closed if any of the above boxes is not checked In certain rare cases you may be exempted if you give a brief explanation eg you are only making a suggestion for improvement Thanks By filing an issue to this repo I promise that X I have fully read the issue guide at X I have provided the

sometimes I would like to utilize distilldistillarticle output format for a specific post Do you think it could be achieved See We need to update the blogdown book accordingly at least remove the section on Updog When I write a new post for I generally use the Serve Site addin which calls blogdownservesite It initially appears in RStudios Viewer and I use Show in New Window to send it over to Safari There I navigate down to the post Im working on So far so good As I make edits and save over in the Rmarkdown file corresponding to the post somehow the way Im constantly rendering and previewing frequently but not always results in a new tab being opened It feels like its because my existing Safari tab is not viewing the main page but is viewing a specific post That is just a theory But it swiftly results in a crazy proliferation of browser tabs conceivably one per save Hi yihui hexo Post r blogdownnewpostaddin Listening on Warning message In value L cond Cannot parse the

Markdown syntax and formatted my issue correctly Version changed the default behavior to use post bundles You can create a new post as the index file of a Hugo page bundle via blogdownnewpost or the RStudio addin New Post if you set optionsblogdownnewbundle TRUE One benefit of using a page bundle instead of a normal page is that you can put resource files associated with the post such as images under the same directory of the post itself This means you no longer have to put them under the static directory which has been quite confusing to Hugo beginners thanks DavisVaughan romainfrancois apreshill Images added to the site as resource files in this way do not show up in RSS feeds For example refer to The first image is referenced from the root static directory and is correctly qualified ltfigure gt ltimg src alt View Scheduled Content gt ltfigcaption gt ltp gtView Scheduled Content ltp gt ltfigcaption gt ltfigure gt Whereas the second image is referenced in a page bundle and is incorrect ltfigure gt ltimg src assetscipng alt CICD Toolchains gt ltfigcaption gt ltp gtIntegrate Connect into CICD Toolchains ltp gt ltfigcaption gt ltfigure gt For certain sites such as the rstudio blog this issue also prevents the relative image from being correctly rendered as a thumbnail for a post By filing an issue to this repo I promise that x I have fully read the issue guide at I

have learned the Github Markdown syntax and formatted my issue correctly This PR proposes an option to buildsite using multiple parallelrunning R processes utilizing only the base package parallel This can result in significant speed improvements with hardware common in To enable the parallelization the user must specify options options blogdownuseparallel TRUE blogdownuseparallelcores numberofcores The functionality is only triggered if the option blogdownuseparallel is TRUE the option blogdownuseparallelcores is the length of files is the parallel package is available If this direction of functionality is accepted we can make the implementation less conservative and easier to use I have followed the guidance for inserting citations but neither the citations or the references are printed Im currently using RMarkdown to write entries into my blog and the most recent version of hugo and the academic theme Has anyone else had this problem or resolved it Hi yihui I hope it is OK for me to place there here I would like to update this section after our workshop next week to reflect additional global options listed here Also I would like to reference the usethiseditrprofile function here it alerts users to the empty line rule at the end of the file in a userfriendly way Again Im assigning this issue to myself if that is OK with you Alison
