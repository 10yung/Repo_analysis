Would it be possible to create a Homebrew formula for rdedup Maybe it would be possible to use formulas of other Rustbased projects as a starting point The build steps for macOS seem to be documented in Can it be used to backup filesystem images eg LVM snapshots for them to be readonlymounted later without extracting fully While experimenting with rdedup on my RAM limited VPS I noticed that the init and load commands used around GB of memory This caused the program to swap which made it rather slow rdedup store does not suffer from the issue and is basically instant I ran usrbinenv time v rdedup vvv init on my desktop vvv didnt seem to reveal anything enlightening but time showed that the program had a lot of page faults Maximum resident set size kbytes Average resident set size kbytes Major requiring IO page faults Minor reclaiming a frame page faults Im running rdedup and both machines are on NixOS Dear Dawid Could you be so kind to generate exe for the rest of us who are mere Windows users wo compiler Trying to backup a Maildir Im seeing quite a few of these lines in the logs thread unnamed panicked at called Resultunwrap on an Err value Os code kind NotFound message No such file or directory libcoreresultrs It would be helpful to include the filename in the panic messages so this gets easier to debug Im using rdup with rdedup like the README example shows Has someone verified that filenames with spaces and special characters are handled correctly EDIT I just noticed that Im on a rather old rdedup version The main first point of contact for new users is and the rendering of the READMEmd which is automatically shown Adding some content from would get the message over more clearly eg the unique features of rdedup such as the ability to securely backup multiple hosts with compression and deduplication whilst still having all hosts be write only Hi It seems rdeduplib uses a version of the base library which is vulnerable to security issues Please refer to patch commit patched version used version base This is done using cratesio data Feel free to close this issue if its not relevant Thanks Would you also like to implement some error correction code like eg ReedSolomon Theres already a mature crate in cratesio Bup ist doing it by just running the par tool over the archive but I dont like this approach writev doesnt seem to make a difference fallocate maybe blocked on ODIRECT to prevent cache pollution or fadvise
