Hi I am trying to look around in the wiki but couldnt find any guide on how to run the project in debug mode and how to run boost unit tests Sorry for this beginner question since I am very new to C Hi all Ive been using OSRM for a while now but Im facing an issue for which I dont seem to find a way out therefore here I am asking for help My use case is for tracking and routing of ski sessions on ski slopes and lifts Its working for the most of it but my problem is in some particular cases with the routing Lets say that Im currently standing in a slope In the exact same coordinates theres a lift too its over my head Im not close to neither the starting or ending point of the latter lets say half way I request a routing to reach the topending point of the lift Because the engine doesnt now whether Im standing on the slope or sitting on the lift it assumes that Im in the second case and it tells me to stay on the lift and proceed further till the end What Im trying to achieve is to find a way to tell the engine that its not possible to enter a way of type aerialway but from the starting or ending point Can you help me in anyway with this Thanks for your help Alessandro Dear maintainers As you may find in the attached osm file all nodes have really big ids loireosmzip When I process it with osrmcontract and make it available with osrmrouted a query like gives me the following annotations codeOkwaypoints hintsQAAgNwAAIDlAQAAHQAAAFICAAAVBgAADxBCQjBdOEBLm CbIqQzlEAAANBAAAilMAAB bAAABAAAAhWpEACHptgIqbEQAhui AgIAvwEuiaZulocation name hintSQEAgGcBAIA AQAAmQAAAAAAAADuAAAAZvL QSLDdEEAAAAA yk QtkrAAB FQAAAAAAAHshAAABAAAArHdEAJH tgK d QAfa AgAArwMuiaZulocation name routes legs steps weight distance annotationnodes summaryduration weightnamesurfaceweight distance duration Any of returned node dont exists in the input file Why What should I do to get a consistent answer with existing nodes please I have tracked GPS data of few cyclists More often then not they travel on a path not shown on OSM Is there an efficient way to find if there is a road actually present on the path taken by them and then add it to OSM Hi I want to have the wayId of the highway in the osrm response if I add it to ref will it make problem for OSRM I read somewhere in the issues that changing name and pronunciation will make problem is it the same for ref Thanks I tried to build osrmbackend with GCC which is shipped with recent version of Ubuntu It fails because of these lines With the error srcupdatercsvsourcecpp required from here includeupdatercsvfileparserhpp error moving a local object in a return statement prevents copy elision Werrorpessimizingmove return stdmoveresult includeupdatercsvfileparserhpp note remove stdmove call I see that the two stdmove that create the issue are removed on master Any plan to release a soon Im starting to write doc for layout of osrmxxx files since theres only a toolchain overview currently which is not detail enough Its helpful for me and I also hope it can be helpful for other people to understand the underlying structure layout Therere a lot of osrmxxx files understand and write details for them will take time We may work on them one by one Heres the first doc for osrm Also a command line tool osrmfilesextractor has been created to loadview the contents It implements by golang you can build it by your self with latest go or get it by docker if youd like to have a try bash docker pull telenavmaposrmbackend docker run it entrypoint osrmbuildosrmfilesextractor telenavmaposrmbackend If anything not correct or any suggestions please feel free to ask Thanks This is a minor documentation fix Replaces references to includeextractorguidanceroadclassificationhpp with includeextractorroadclassificationhpp The latter is included in the project It looks like that file was moved at some point but documentation references werent updated I was trying to add exclude flag parameter for toll in the request but there does not seem to be any documentation on how to do it while using nodejs bindings Im running OSRM docker backend and frontend with MLD and car profile german dataset installed weeks ago Calculating a route sometimes unnecessarily leaves and reenters the highway at some exits Eg calculating a route from Heidelberg to Karlsruhe has this effect at Bruchsal and Karlsruhe Durlach but not at the other exits OSRM with text instructions OSRM This happens in my system and on official routingopenstreetmapde instance but not on demo server Is this an error or an effect avoidable eg during data calculation
