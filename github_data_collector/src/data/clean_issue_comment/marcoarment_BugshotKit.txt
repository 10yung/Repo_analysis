Sometimes email is not an option and there is a need to send a report to somewhere else For example as a developer I could implement a JIRA plugin that sends information to JIRA instead of email oslog has replaced asl I have a temporary solution The static analyzer was complaining about aslresponsenext and aslresponsefree the deprecation comments point out appropriate replacements which Ive substituted here Hello Well i included Bugshot in my delegate and added following line in my didFinishLaunching function if definedDEBUG definedADHOC BugshotKit enableWithNumberOfTouches performingGesturesBSKInvocationGestureDoubleTap feedbackEmailAddressxxxgmailcom endif But when i double tap in map nothing happening there I added breakpoint right before if defined DEBUG and its not coming in if Can you help why Very slow input when the triple tap gesture is enabled Special character suggestions come up Device iPhone s Although its a clever way to prevent people from shipping BugshotKit to the AppStore the class dump private API reference creates additional hassle for developers In order to exclude BugshotKit from App Store build configurations we have several unappealing choices Manually create a static library every time master is updated which makes it likely that the Bugshot library will become outdated compared to the current master branch I just discovered mine was commits behind Configure the Xcode project to include a freshlybuilt static library as a target dependency which is not as straightforward a process as it should be Im not sure its even possible to do this on a perbuildconfig basis Add a separate target for devbeta builds Manually addremove the source h and m files when submitting to the App Store Its much simpler and cleaner to include BugshotKit dynamically leaving it up to the developer to exclude BugshotKit from release build configurations however she sees fit perhaps with preprocessor macros This isnt possible while the class dump safety feature is still around Thats all thanks a lot for open sourcing this its super useful Hi I recently fund that when Im developing in the iOS Simulator my mac use one core at and consequently the fans work and full speed and the temperature rises a lot At first I was thinking that maybe is some bug with a new version of the simulator But I tried to use instruments to search for some bug in my code and I found that BugshotKit is causing this Specifically BugshotKit updateFromASL method Instruments I suppose that this method is the one that checks for logs This happen every time I output a log in my code But the main problem is that a single line of Log makes this method consume of cpu time for seconds or more Is this a normal behavior because we are trying to read the logs or is this a real issue Thanks
