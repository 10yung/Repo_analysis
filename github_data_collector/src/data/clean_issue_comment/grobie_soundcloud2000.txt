actually the songs from soundcloud They should not be kept there as many songs on soundcloud are under copyrights A possibility could be that they will be deleted right after listening This will slow down the player but soundcloud would be more on the legal side I apologize if this I overlooked the solution or missed the obvious answer lozengeramtag sudo gem install soundcloud Building native

just pass a soundcloud url as a command line parameter and have the app play that particular track It would be even nicer if it got the suggested tracks playlist and kept on playing the next suggested tracks after that As soundcloud dosent support repeat onoff feature I think its more intuitive to make the first song of the playlist to be played when the last one is over For now when the last ones over the player just repeats that particular song I guess we can achieve this by adding simple conditional statement whether current one is the last song of the playlist or not to the nexttrack function of playercontrollerrb but Im not sure how to exactly achieve that Can anyone give me little guideline or make a patch for it Ruby gem has not been updated since need to get it up to date
