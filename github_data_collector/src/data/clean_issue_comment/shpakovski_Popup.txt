How can I set an text next to the icon in the statusbar Thanks When clicking on the status bar icon the window appears on the desktop screen rather than the screen with full screen application What needs to be changing in order for this to work img width altscreen shot at src Fix issue when clicking icon on second monitor Is there a way to enable dark mode for so the icon is more visible when in dark mode Just a little adjustment The popup window if you click the star on an external monitor doesnt open on the external monitor Instead the view flies over to the primary monitor and opens at the farright of the display Since having menu bars on all monitors is new in Mavericks Im guessing that the app just hasnt been updated to work appropriately with this To be honest Im not sure on how to fix it anyone have any ideas
