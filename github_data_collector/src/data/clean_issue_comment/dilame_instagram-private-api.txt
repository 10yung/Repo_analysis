its understandable to anyone You may add pictures YOUR QUESTION HERE So Im making an Instagram chatbot When a user sends hello to the user it replies hello It works perfectly But sometimes the bot account doesnt know a new user account and it throws the following error IgExactUserNotFoundError User with exact username not found This error comes from the code which try to reply to the user And it happens when the bot receive a DM Request By looking for a few hours I could find the solution myself but the problem is that I cant reproduce the bug since I need a new instagram account for each test else it wont trigger a dm request So I was wondering if youd know how to do that when a message is received from the FBNS client detect if its a real message or if its blocked by a DM request automatically accept the DM request send a message to the user I dont know if thats possible and if so I very much hope you know how Nerixyz Feature Request Read the Notes notes and fill out the form

leave Ive searched the Issues Ive read the basic concepts Im using the latest version Question A specific question so its understandable to anyone You may add pictures I am developing an Progressive Web Application by part of this App user is able to search an Instagram page and fetch all public info about page followers following bio Since this app will have a lot of users if a lot of user call to backend at the same time and backend code call to Instagram private api based on one specific account then Instagram platform will banded this account so I am ganna to know that is it possible to force user Login in through Instagram OAuth and when user received access token then we use this Token for login and fetch data from Instagram directly on client side I would like to know if it wouldnt be possible to create a real objectoriented library a bit like discordjs For example a User class with the following properties js username string followers User followed Boolean Whether the client is following they biography string etc methods send follow block etc And for example for the message event using your library Nerixyz js clientonmessage message messageauthor User messagereplycontent shortcut for messageauthorsend so we can do messageauthorfollow I dont know if making a library like discordjs for instagram would be possible maybe its not at all the same and Im imagining impossible things but it would still be great to be able to do that Currently its not optimized at all When you want to send a message you have to fetch the thread something like that would be more optimized I think How to hide with api user publications and stories General Question Form Put an x if you meet the condition else leave x Ive searched the Issues x Ive read the basic concepts
