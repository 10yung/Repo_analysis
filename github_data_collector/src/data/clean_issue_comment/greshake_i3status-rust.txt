This is possible as ip has a JSON output option Since have been working with dependencies a lot lately this had been getting on my mind Had a gander at some other crates like tokio and they do this there too Would be nice to be able to customize the load block similarly to how the CPU block can be customized with info warning and critical The load on my system is generally high so the load block is constantly blue or yellow with no way to change it Also if load goes above logicalcores state is set to Idle as it is the default Load can go beyond logicalcores so the logic should probably be changed to something similar to the CPU block fixes Using the music block like this block block music oncollapsedclick spotify After clicking on it to launch spotify and starting music playback going fullscreen in i will cause it to pause musicfreeze I reckon this is caused because spotify is lauched as a child process of i statusrust and going fullscreen suspends both processes Launching spotify by other means avoids this issue but loses the convenience of the single interface for music control i statusrs version i statusrs This adds a simple block to display the current time tracking status for watson The module does not add any dependencies and is rather simplistic Right now it just supports volume Defaults to volume After not getting sysfs access to work even with the udev rule mentioned in the documentation I investigated how other applicationsdesktops are controlling the backlight brightness As it turns out on systems governed by systemdlogind or elogind the correct way according to the systemd developers is the DBus interface of logind This commit uses this method as a fallback for when we cannot open the sysfs file This works great on my system but Im not particularly attached to this method if you find it too surprising If youd rather like a configuration option to switch between two methods I can implement that as well Prior to this NaturalScrolling option configured on XServers input devices would lead to inverted behavior The new functionality is enabled via a top level scrolling natural line in the config file The default is scrolling reverse
