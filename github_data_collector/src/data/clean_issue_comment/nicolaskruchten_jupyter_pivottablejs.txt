 Step is to run following command pivotuidf Step is to select required data using GUI now i want to collect data in jupyter notebook for further processing Please guide us Hi i used pip install and had this same null error aas What is the solution packages under my pip list abslpy altair astor attrs backcall bleach bokeh boto certifi chardet Click colorama cycler decorator defusedxml entrypoints Flask gast grpcio h py idna imageio ipykernel ipython ipythongenutils ipywidgets itsdangerous jedi Jinja jsonschema jupyter jupyterclient jupyterconsole jupytercontribcore jupytercontribnbextensions jupytercore jupyterhighlightselectedword jupyterlatexenvs jupyternbextensionsconfigurator KerasApplications KerasPreprocessing kiwisolver lime lxml Markdown MarkupSafe matplotlib mistune nbconvert nbformat networkx notebook numpy packaging pandas pandocfilters parso pickleshare Pillow pip pivottablejs prometheusclient prompttoolkit protobuf Pygments pynegv pyodbc pyparsing pypiwin pyrsistent pythoncertifiwin pythondateutil pytz PyWavelets pywin pywinpty PyYAML pyzmq qgrid qtconsole requests requestsnegotiatesspi scikitimage scikitlearn scipy seaborn Send Trash setuptools six tensorboard tensorflow termcolor terminado testpath toolz tornado traitlets urllib vega vegadatasets virtualenv virtualenvwrapperwin wcwidth webencodings Werkzeug wheel widgetsnbextension wincertstore wrapt xlrd XlsxWriter Hello Thank you for solution really magic We have several issues Doesnt work showUIFalse maybe special syntax Would you please be so kind to make example in readme for Filter function Thank you I catch exeption when i try to open notebook in nbviewer whit code like this import pandas from pivottablejs import pivotui dfpandasreadcsvdatasetsdatacsvdelimiter dfhead pivotuidf which perfectly works in jupiter notebook interface I find workaround for nbviewer but it doesnrender pivot in jupiter notebook in editing mode maybe ill be possible to include method like plotlyofflineinitnotebookmode In pivotuidf Out IPythonlibdisplayIFrame at x there is no popout Screen below remains blank no popout words either In some locations for some reason network device etc cloudflare may not be resolved thus no script css gets downloads and thus the content does not render My suggestion would be to embed the css and js on the html output itself I did a quick test on one of those locations wget i linkstxt which linkstxt containing all those Cloudflare links and then edit the output html to link to local files It all works But having several local files is a bit of a mess thus Id prob fork to get those embed You ok with that fork as I assume youd not like to merge that change Can support for jupyterlab Thanks First of all this tool is amazing and useful but I would like to know if is possible to show only the chart itself without any additional drag and drop stuffs I have tried to set the showUI parameter to False but it was not enough Thanks Hi Is there a snippet of code somewhere of how to use an extension renderer such as Subtotaljs with PivotTablesJs on Jupyter One of the things the pivot table gadget is good for is helping novices get a feel for reshaping a dataset and looking at the output from a particular transformation I would be really handy to be able to export he pandas equivalent code for a transformation so it could be applied directly to the pandas dataframe that feeds the pivottable in the parent notebook I can think of one corollary to this the jigsaw magic embeds an HTML blockly code editor and optionally allows the exporting of code equivalent to the program in the editor into a code cell created beneath the widget It would be handy if jupyterpivottablejs could do something similar by exporting pandas code equivalent to the transformation operation applied in the pivottable if not the visualisation
