desired details In Homebrew we install doitlive with python setuppy install prefixusrlocalCellardoitlive libexec where python in PATH is usrlocalbinpython which is a symlink to usrlocalCellarpython binpython However when we do this the doitlive in usrlocalCellardoitlive libexecbin contains this as a shebang usrlocalCellarpython binpython which is not desirable at all for us Other python packages dont do that so I think its an issue specific to doitlive It would be nice if setuppy could simply use the python path that is given to it rather than try to guess Closes Should read occurred rather than occured It would be cool if we could have some more documentation in the help text Explain how to use CtrlC and CtrlZ in a presentation this is self explanatory for CLI veterans but many users might not be so experienced CtrlC and CrtlZ are really a great part of how to use the programm in a presentation Explain how promptthemes work How can I create my own Where can I find premade ones When I copypaste with mouse ie paste more than characters only first bytes go to the console Only top characters are ingested uparrow doesnt work with tmptmpti n m line E A command not found prompt Thanks for such an awesome tool There are a couple of bugs in the terminal handling First we see staircase when running background command for i in seq do echo hello sleep done Got prompt hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello hello While in normal bash it is not staircased I have two features I think would make doitlive better but I see something similar is supported though not documented The first feature is typing out a whole line with a key combination Basically if Im at the start of a long line I can press some combination and have the entire line typed out I dont think this is currently possible but also Im not sure about this feature I want it for showing presentation topics as comments which are too cumbersome to type out but maybe echoed comments will do The second feature is being able to pause and resume the stream I see that pressing tab will pause but I get erratic behavior where it will skip the entire line press enter midtype and odd things like that I need it in case Im in a Python shell and the audience asks me to make changes or so I can take control if something goes wrong while being able to resume afterwards This isnt documented so I had to discover it in the code Tab and CtrlZ do different things in the code but in my testing CtrlZ doesnt work the process just gets backgrounded Can you explain a bit about how these are supposed to work maybe document them and discuss whether a pausing feature would be acceptable I sometimes press Escape while typing as a reflex and it would be very inconvenient if this exits the presentation while Im presenting Could we have an option to disable this key I have added typed comments Comments that start with dilc will get typed out as normal dilc This comment will get typed to the console with the dilc part removed
