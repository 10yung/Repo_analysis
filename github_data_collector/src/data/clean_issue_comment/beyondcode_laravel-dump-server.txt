 DumpServer Version Laravel Version v PHP Version OS MacOS Catalina Description php dumpthis text is displayed in web output dumpthis text is displayed in dumpserver output While php artisan dumpserver is runnig first dump result is sent to the output of my application and the next dumps appears in the dumpserver output The issue exists in MacOS but same code is ok on other linuxbased os anything to be considered As Symfony just came out we could update this packages as well There arent really tests in the package so let me know if stuff broke Ill gladly fix it SymfonyHackday Any plans to provide autoreload the dumphtml file so the developer can immediately see the dump calls without hitting F This should be easily done by serving the dumphtml file with browsersync browsersync start server files dumphtml index dumphtml But the html dumped does not have body tag and browsersync requires a body tag to embed its script In the most case user just want to see the output on current request This will be helpful if user can see the dump without scroll too much composer require dev beyondcodelaraveldumpserver Using version for beyondcodelaraveldumpserver composerjson has been updated Loading composer repositories with package information Updating dependencies including requiredev Package operations install updates removals Installing beyondcodelaraveldumpserver Loading from cache Writing lock file Generating optimized autoload files Illuminate Foundation ComposerScriptspostAutoloadDump php artisan packagediscover ansi In Connectionphp line Argument passed to Symfony Component VarDumper Server Connectionconst ruct must be of the type string null given called in Userskkhsinkv endorbeyondcodelaraveldumpserversrcDumpServerServiceProviderphp on l ine If I use php artisan dumpserver formatcli with a json API it will output the dump in response instead of the CLI Im not sure if this is connected to or not I have noticed that when working from the command line and dumping or dding it is not outputting all items I have noticed this in conjunction with the hynmultitenant package also being installed It appears if I remove either this package or the multitenancy package things return to working normally I have posted an issue in their repo as well However I am having a hard time figuring out where the conflict is occurring While diving through the code nothing stands out and also while triggering a manual exception after dumping there doesnt appear to be any code run from the multitenant package Any thoughts as to what might be causing this or where I might look further to try and debug this Thank you Update after further debugging it appears this issue remains even without hynmultitenant installed So perhaps my suspicion of a conflict with that package was premature Also I wanted to clarify that this is the case when the dumpserver is NOT running Everything outputs fine when it is running Hi I get inconsistent results with my laravel valet Below code dumps to dumpserver every so often but not on each request If I remove dump then of course code works as expected each time Any ideas what might be the reason for such behaviour php namespace App Http Controllers use Illuminate Http Request class TestController extends Controller public function testRequest request e foo bar dumprequestall return e Thanks It would be helpful to have an option to hide the info block date Fri Dec controller HotelsController source HotelsSearchServicephp on line file appServicesHotelsSearchServicephp In my case I need to dump a lot of data in array and this blocks take all the space on the screen make it not comfortable to read and require to scroll a lot It would be nice to have an option to not show this block
