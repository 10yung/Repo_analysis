 Id like for a hybrid sample to be added Its not clear how a hybrid app should be added for example one with response type code idtoken Edit Hybrid flow can be enabled by allowing both Authorization Code and Implicit Flow Its not clear as of right now how this should work even though the documentation mentions it can handle hybrid flows I do not see a way to implement this in the documentation The AllowFlow also dont contain a hybrid one Does this mean it has to be a custom one and implement it myself Would be nice if there was a sample doing this then as well Id appreciate it if the client could be a Net framework with Owin since im currently trying that but i have some trouble getting just the code to work I noticed that just code is not supported so want to do code idtoken Thanks in advance To avoid Bearer errorinvalidtoken errordescriptionThe audience is invalid exception I am using OpenIddict with the implicit flow for my NET Core combined API and Authorization server that uses JWT Bearer authentication and everything is working great Now I need to add a second resource server which is a separate NET Framework web application using Web API This is a reporting API which has to rely on the full NET Framework Now I want to secure my Controller endpoint with the Authorize tag and get this to play nicely with my main Authorization Server endpoint using JWT Bearer access tokens Ive seen different ways of setting up JWT Bearer authentication to secure the controller in Web API projects from writing a custom JWTAuthentication attribute filter to using Owin middleware Do you have an example or suggestion on the recommended way to configure a NET Framework x Resource server which uses the original WEB API not version with JWT Bearer authentication and allowing it to talk to the main OpenIddict NET Core Authorization Server The existing samples that show Resource Servers are all in NET Core Hello on is a bug in my opinion Starting at line There should be a map to return the ObservableAuthTokenModel Or other functions have to be changed I couldnt compile this I think the right implementation is private getTokensdata RefreshGrantModel LoginModel grantType string ObservableAuthTokenModel const headers new Headers ContentType applicationxwwwformurlencoded const options new RequestOptions headers headers Objectassigndata granttype grantType scope openid offlineaccess const params new URLSearchParams Objectkeysdata forEachkey paramsappendkey data key return thishttppostenvironmentbaseApiUrlconnecttoken paramstoString options pipe mapres resjson tapres const tokens AuthTokenModel res const now new Date tokensexpirationdate new DatenowgetTime tokensexpiresin getTimetoString const profile ProfileModel jwtDecodetokensidtoken thisstoreTokentokens thisupdateState authReady true tokens profile RefreshFlowAuthorizationServerControllersAuthorizationControllercs at line In my project Im using the MicrosoftAspNetCoreAll
