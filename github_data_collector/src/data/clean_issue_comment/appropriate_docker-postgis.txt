Im using mdillonpostgis I then install pgconfig while in the container aptget update aptget yes install libpqdev I then run pgconfig and get the following PKGLIBDIR usrlibpostgresql lib Thats not a valid path and instead I expect to see the following PKGLIBDIR usrlibpostgresql lib Any suggestions on how to fix this From docs istemplate If true then this database can be cloned by any user with CREATEDB privileges if false the default then only superusers or the owner of the database can clone it I suggest using ISTEMPLATE param where possible to make initdb script simpler and complaint with postgres security best practices on not editing pgdatabase directly Hey guys I am using this image to fiddle with GitLab CICD implementation My gitlabciyml file looks like this yaml test image python services name mdillonpostgis alias postgres name redislatest script aptget update pip install U pip setuptools pip install r requirementsdevtxt pytest x strict variables POSTGRESDB testdb POSTGRESUSER xxx POSTGRESPASSWORD xxx PGPASSWORD xxx REDISHOST redis REDISPORT However once tests start running Im getting following error which only happens inside CICD pipeline with this image statement SELECT userspassword AS userspassword userscreatedat AS userscreatedat usersupdatedat AS usersupdatedat ND usersid userfollowersfollowsid AND userfollowersstate state s ORDER BY userfollowersupdatedat DESC parameters param state yes context sqlalchemydialectspostgresqlpsycopg PGExecutionContextpsycopg object at x f a dce def doexecuteself cursor statement parameters contextNone cursorexecutestatement parameters E sqlalchemyexcNotSupportedError psycopg errorsFeatureNotSupported input of anonymous composite types is not implemented E LINE rfollowersfollowsid AND userfollowersstate yes ORDE E Does anyone have an idea about whats going on It seems to have problems with ENUM PostgreSQL types but I am not sure on how to debug or fix this I am not able to reproduce this error outside of the container A handful of packages namely gdaldev geosdev and projdev and their nondev dependencies were moved from testing to community Changing the apk add commands to use the correct repository instead of fixes the issues This is likely because of something that was brought up in the mailing list though I havent been able to find any further discussion after that thread E Version dfsg exp pgdg for postgresql postgis was not found E Version dfsg exp pgdg for postgresql postgis scripts was not found E Version dfsg exp pgdg for postgis was not found I do not understand what means a dfsg exp pgdg addition What can I do wrong Or maybe this version is not supported now adding Postgis for Postgres did not work anymore maybe due to Ubuntu update adding Postgis for Postgres A bit of background Im running a restore against an old dump of a PostGIS database Original Error pgrestore archiver db Error while PROCESSING TOC pgrestore archiver db Error from TOC entry EXTENSION postgis pgrestore archiver db could not execute query ERROR could not open extension control file usrsharepostgresql extensionpostgiscontrol No such file or directory Command was CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis WITH SCHEMA public Reproduction Steps Create an mdillonpostgis alpine container to act as the database Well call this the db container Create another mdillonpostgis alpine container to act as the pgrestore executor Well call this one executor Create a simple sql file with the line CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS postgis WITH SCHEMA public Run pgrestore with this sql file on the executor pointing to db Terrible Solution Incoming I can work around this by manually moving all of the files under usrlocalsharepostgresql to a new directory usrlocalsharepostgresql Im not too familiar with how these directories are laid out or anything but it seems to me that they should be versioned even if there is only one version present on the image This is based on proj is built with g and libstdc from edge so the same version need to be installed for it to work It compiles and runs but I didnt test it thoroughly yet Im going to try importing an OSM extract to test it Trying to build the dockerfile located at alpineDockerfile after fixing causes an error while compiling postgis configure error could not find libproj you may need to specify the directory of a PROJ installation using withprojdir Proj is currently only available on edge in the future it might be available on the community tree but for now installing every dependency from edge fixes the issue
