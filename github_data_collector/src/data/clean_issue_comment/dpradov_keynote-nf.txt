gone I lost weeks of work due to this bug Please help This has happened twice The first time approximately weeks ago After finding the bak file since the original file is gone I realized I lost an hour worth of notes which I thought was hopefully a one time incident However I made certain to constantly manually click Save every half an hour or so going forward to prevent any lost This second time last night the bug occurred again and I lost weeks worth of notes and that is ALOT I am scared to used this program until I know how to protect my work notes Please help BUG Lost File due to a

save formatting information Select in any text editor like notepad large text fragment large than KB Paste this text to any KeyNote note Text will be truncated Only bytes of text will be copied Program seems to disappear not visible in tool bar cant alttab to it but the process is still listed in task manager Running but you cant get to it Starting it again brings up the closing this instance dialog as it should since I have it configured to run only one instance This solves the problem but Im worried about losing work if I accidentally revert to saved Running KN Hello Daniel About KeyNote NF Can you make a horizontal ScrollBar for notepanel If big images are inserted maps for example then it is not convenient to view And its not convenient to use zoom for viewing Need for it Best Regards Zom On a nonmaximized window I resized the resource panel aka search panel all the way to the right to hide it The result is that it got stuck on the right side of the window and couldnt be dragged back even though the Click and drag to resize panels tooltip and mouse cursor still showed up Things I tried to solve the problem I tried hiding then showing the resource panel by clicking the Show or hide resource panel button but it had no effect it just nudged the edge of the note a little to the right back to the left still undraggable I tried looking for an option to reset the scaleposition of everything If it exists I couldnt find it I searched the Help Contents and discovered in Auxiliary Files that information about the size and position of several dialog boxes is stored inside the MRU file but I couldnt find it in windows explorer even though I have all file extensions hidden files visible When I maximized the main window I finally regained the ability to resize the panel Now it doesnt seem to get stuck anymore regardless of the window size I cant reproduce it anymore Version Beta Operating system Windows Is there a setting that I am missing as the older versions did not do this Every time I paste a screenshot taking by screen shot tool picPick it would paste it into KNF full size Now when I paste it is limiting the size and image needs to be resized manually
