Hi This is BYFAR my favorite notebook extension But I prefer the functionality of jupyter lab multiple tabs navigation bar and templates Any chance you can make this extension available for the lab as well This will be legendary Thanks When running in Appmode cell in scratchpad will also be hidden Is there anyway to ship with a different CSS file from main window so it will still show up Really great extension It is more useful in Appmode for more than one cell This PR is a workaround for issue where this extension sometimes breaks if jupytervimbinding is installed at the same time It seems that whenever this extension loads before jupytervimbinding the shortcuts get overwritten causing this extension to break The loading order of the extensions is nondeterminstic so the bug only appears some of the time I dont know enough about Jupyter internals to figure out a proper fix but for now a good workaround is to wait seconds to force jupytervimbinding to finish loading before we register our shortcuts For MacLinux users using ctrlb may cause conflict with native keybindings for cursor moving Thanks How can I change the shortcut keys for scratchpad I want to launch the scratchpad with Cmdb Hi minrk I found when scratchpad is enabled the all shortcut for open the command palette do not work I tried adding a new shortcut Still not work Do you have any idea what I did run Thank you very much Hi I find myself often wishing to reexecute a single line or expression of a nb cell This small change adds two shortcuts which allow exactly that CtrlShiftEnter executes current line or currently selected lines in the scratchpad immediately CtrlShiftAltEnter copies current line or currently selected lines into the scratchpad If you like this idea and are willing to merge such a change I can extend the docs too Cheers Hi So AFAIK currently we have only one cell to draft with This is great but has some limitations Are there any limitations on running more than one cell in the scratchpad so If you are in the scratchpad an ALTENTER will run the current cell and open a new one below Is that Doable Great extension really boosting the productivity Thanks This could be really useful but mostly it sometimes seems to work my run cell command just runs the cells in the main notebook even when the scratchpad is open might be nice to have the option to change the scratchpad run command to avoid any interference or I really like scratchpad and would like to use it with my sos kernel where the kernel used to evaluate a cell can be selected from a button to the top right corner of the cell Unfortunately scratchpad when opened would cover the right half of the screen and the kernelswitching buttons Is it possible for you to update scratchpad so that I can move it around preferably to the left of the notebook Something like the toc panel would work great for me Also I like scratchpad so much and I am attempted to make it part of the SoS frontend The benefit for users would be that they do not have to install another extension and I might be able to stop the increment of executioncount for scratch statements I am not sure if you would like this approach though
