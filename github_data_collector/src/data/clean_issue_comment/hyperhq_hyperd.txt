command argument to check hyperdhyperctl version not in the commands arguments here and not in hyperctl hyperd help Is it possible to make a Windows platform Hyperctl load command works good without r option while adding r aaa makes it fail We have many issues fixed since the last release it is time to release And the x will have the support of new kata containers as runtime Guys anyone had these

Linux Core CPE OS Name cpeocentoscentos Kernel Linux el x Architecture x Hi Guys Id like to set up small kubernetes clusters for a workshop and since were running hyperd I thought Id try an run the kubelet in a hyperd pod and let it start all its dependencies in there So my question is Is it possible to get the kubelet to run inside a hyperd VM The main challenge I see is getting Docker to run inside the VM so the Kubelet can start controllers apisurfaces etc Does anybody know if a thats possible and b has any advice on how it could be done Ive been struggling to debug an issue with the standard consul image when running on dockerrunv andor pure hyperctl stack First of all when running dockerrunc on the same fresh Ubuntu bare metal box for all these examples I also tried on centos bare metal and two other ubuntu bare metal boxes I get the following successful start bash roothyperdev docker run d name consul p h consul consul agent server bootstrap client a eddd dfceb b bbd d e

subsequently the consul server works as expected Now with dockerrunv I run the same docker run command as above but I get the following output in the docker logs and the container exits bash

Failed to start Raft invalid argument The first thing that I noticed is that when running with runv the PORTS in the docker ps command are missing So I have also tried running the container with nethost which doesnt seem to work with runv for whatever reason And then I also tried to just publish all of the ports that are exposed in the consullatest Dockerfile but that yielded the same error On a separate note itd be great to have some sort of a lookup tabledoc article with a list of known incompatabilitiesworkarounds for normal docker containers running on the runv stack Maybe this exists but I havent been able to uncover it Thanks PR fixed port mapping but was after the release of Therefore the latest available binaries cannot handle an example like hyperctl run d publish nginx without breaking on the iptables command fixed by Can we make a new release with the latest code so networking works out of the box and we dont have to build from source
