back to the dependency list resolves the build problem We are using typings v Crosspost of What this means for Typings users Dependencies turn into external modules but Typings wont be able to resolve any of the module dependencies as the dependency system on DefinitelyTyped uses reference tags Effectively if youre using Typings you may not need global in some places anymore You will probably need to jiggle with tsconfigjson typeRoots to get reference type instances to work properly eg typeRoots typingsglobal Typings can not install anything using export as namespace as it requires native compiler support to resolve modules while Typings uses a legacy workaround of declaring global modules for you There will be no disruption of existing modules using Typings as everything is keyed to a

the FAQ X Did you search open and closed issues to see if your issue has already been reported Description It looks like typings reads bowerjson dependencies and look for dts files on each component later it complains about the file is not found The components I use doesnt have dts files For that same reason I use typings I dont know how to stop this behavior or make things the right way Im missing something I use this library in another proyect and I have the same error when I include it as a bower dependency inside typingsjson of that another project Steps to Reproduce clone tag npm
