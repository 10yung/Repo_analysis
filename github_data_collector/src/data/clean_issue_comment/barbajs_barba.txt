experience However I have just shared the site via facebook mobile app on android When you click on the link the site automatically opens in facebooks own browser causing none of the links to work Is there a setting I need to put or something that can check whether barba should even run I am in the process of transitioning from v to v and have run into an issue creating separate transitions for when someone is moving from the home page to an interior page and viceversa Here is how my transitions are setup barbainit transitions name slideintransition from home to interior leave functiondata alertslidein var done thisasync TweenMaxtodatacurrentcontainer opacity onComplete done enter functiondata var done thisasync TweenMaxfromdatanextcontainer opacity onComplete done name slideouttransition from interior to home leave functiondata alertslideout var done thisasync TweenMaxtodatacurrentcontainer opacity onComplete done enter functiondata var done thisasync TweenMaxfromdatanextcontainer opacity onComplete done However in this example when making a transition from the databarbanamespacehome container to the databarbanamespaceinterior container and back they both use the slideouttransition Is there something incorrect with how I have these transitions setup Thanks in advance The problem I had barbacore working as expected Then I installed barbacss and ran into problems with fetched content being appended to my barba wrapper rather than replacing my barba container as I expected Description My markup looks like this ifissetSERVER HTTPXBARBA body div idapp databarbawrapper roledocument headerMy header contentheader endif main databarbacontainer databarbanamespace basename getpermalink yieldcontent main ifissetSERVER HTTPXBARBA footerMy footer contentfooter FETCHED CONTENT IS APPEARING HERE div body endif When I navigate to a new page without barbacss it works as expected When using barbacss however my new content appears where Ive indicated in the markup The previous page content is removed however I do not see duplicate content The javascript calling Barba is very simple I was originally running Barba with barbainit To use the CSS module I changed this to barbausebarbaCss barbainit BarbaCSS is installed and Ive verified this to be working by adding some simple opacity transitions between pages I dont see any console messages Environment Barba version that exhibits the issue barbacore barbacss Build used import from nodemodules Browser OSversion used Chrome on OS X Mojave Gday Thanks so much for Barba Big ups from down under I know this issue has been addressed in and elsewhere Ive tried my best to follow along with little success I am new to all of this so please forgive me Im attempting to use the namespace strategy outlined by luruke but I think my logic for waiting for NewContainerLoading to be resolved is flawed as Im not able to retrieve the BarbaHistoryManagerprevStatus inside my valid function I just get null when I consolelog it As a result the specific page transition only works on the first click after which it doesnt work My code is set up with just transitions at the moment Ive left out the GSAP timelines as they are irrelevant If anyone can help with setting up the valid function part Id be forever grateful Hopefully some more details about this type of set up could help some other noobs like me too Much love var TopDownTransition BarbaBaseTransitionextend start function Promise all thisnewContainerLoading thisfadeOut thenthisfadeInbindthis fadeOut function return

TopDownTransitionvalid return TopDownTransition if DownTopTransitionvalid return DownTopTransition Hello firstly thanks for this beautiful app How do I show the load percentage when loading a page and page transitions For example Logger can be used in some situation to improve code understanding in dev mode For example this code display the console message every time and doesnt throw any warning js barbainit transitions name default from home leave consolelogleaving the home page but in fact the from attribute is waiting for an object not a string This could mislead the user when using Barba if he is not properly reading the documentation It would be really handy for the documentation to contain a complete lifecycle diagram that includes both view and transition functions for both normal and appear cycles Currently I have to fill my functions with console logs to understand when say the views beforeEnter is called in relation to the transitions beforeEnter etc would be good to have a simple diagram to look at Hi I have a problem with the css and js files I would like to use different style sheets and scripts on the various pages when I open the page everything normally works but when I change the page using the transition it is not loaded How can I solve it for example in the contact page i want to use contactcss contactcss is used only in this page when I access the page directly the css works correctly but when i came from for example indexhtml that doesnt have contatticss the style doesnt load
