When processing a dataset it might be helpful to record in a file report the options used for processing for later reference See Whats your browser and operating system Chrome on Windows What is the problem I am generating GCP file using GCP interface of WebODM This is the output projutm zone ellpsWGS datumWGS unitsm nodefs DJI JPG gcp DJI JPG gcp DJI JPG gcp DJI JPG gcp DJI JPG gcp DJI JPG gcp DJI JPG gcp DJI JPG gcp DJI JPG gcp DJI JPG gcp DJI JPG gcp DJI JPG gcp DJI JPG gcp DJI JPG gcp DJI JPG gcp DJI JPG gcp I placed the gcplisttxt file containing the above output in the images folder of ODM and ran ODM with the command runsh OUTPUT As my images are in OUTPUT folder But there is no orthophoto produced and the D mesh is really bizarre and unusual What should I do to produce correct georeferenced D mesh file and orthophoto What should be the expected behavior A georeferenced D mesh file should be produced How can we reproduce this What steps did you do to trigger the problem What parameters are you using for processing Please include multiple screenshots of the problem If possible please include a copy of your dataset uploaded on Google Drive or Dropbox Be detailed My steps are Clone the project from Run sudo bash configuresh install Set projectpath in settingsyml file Run sudo pip install r requirementstxt Set environment variables in the bashrc file to appropriate paths Run runsh OUTPUT How did you install OpenDroneMap Docker natively Docker Whats your browser and operating system Copypaste the output of CentOS What is the problem I was using PyODM API with a NodeODM node to stitch drone images I found that I will get different output images if I just change the names of input images For example lets say I have images named as aaaxpng aaa png aaa png aaa png If I repeatedly call the PyODM API I will always get the same output which is as expected However if I just change their names to bbbxpng bbb png bbb png bbb png I will get a different output image The new output is similar to the old one of course they are similar because the input images are the same files but they are different in detail several different pixels in most cases in the worst case an ouput missed a corner What should be the expected behavior If this is a feature request please describe in detail the changes you think should be made to the code citing files and lines where changes should be made if possible The same input the same output How can we reproduce this What steps did you do to trigger the problem What parameters are you using for processing If possible please include a copy of your dataset uploaded on Google Drive or Dropbox Be detailed Not sure if this can be reproduced Opening a PR to invite very early feedback from courageous ones muscle Not stable bugs are expected Adds support for multispectral cameras TIFF support bit speeds up significantly the merge step of point clouds and orthophotos during splitmerge If youre on Linux you might also enjoy the new startdevenvsh script for easy hacking of the ODM codebase How did you install OpenDroneMap Docker natively Attempted natively under Alpine WSL Whats your browser and operating system Copypaste the output of Edge on Windows What is the problem Dockerfile configuresh configure sh and portableDockerfile still referencedepend upon liblas which by the projects own documentation recommends the usage of PDAL instead What should be the expected behavior If this is a feature request please describe in detail the changes you think should be made to the code citing files and lines where changes should be made if possible Making a clean break away from liblas would remove this deprecated dependency and allow easier portage to Alpine and other platforms How can we reproduce this What steps did you do to trigger the problem What parameters are you using for processing If possible please include a copy of your dataset uploaded on Google Drive or Dropbox Be detailed liblas is not compiled for Alpine but PDAL is Sometimes users are confused about how to create a GCP file which can lead to a GCP file with not sufficient entries or with entries that dont reference enough images ODM should be more forgiving and give some hints as how to fix the problem Hi All I have recently installed ODM in my ubuntu server CPU Core RAM G Previously i was using ODM ODM working fine with upto images it takes approx same time as ODM and GCP result is better But for large dataset like images it takes too much time This is what is measure while dataset was in process images ODM took approx hrs where ODM took hrs Most of processing time was happening on opensfm matchfeatures function Server has Core CPU and server load crosses when it runs match features it running Nno of cpu core number of python loky processes in backend which exhausted all CPU resources This service running in backend as part of match features usrbinpython m joblibexternalslokybackendpopenlokyposix processname LokyProcess pipe semaphore Tried to change maxprocesses for concurrency but still has approx same result If anyone faced this issue with ODM or any idea on that please let me know Thanks Relevant discussion By default using the split flag attempts an alignment step This makes sense when data is flown with low accuracy GPS When flown with better data the alignment step can reduce the quality of the output Suggest we add a flag like skipalign to skip the model alignment step in OpenSfM Its not working somehow Sub models are only distributed to local node even that ClusterODM has online nodes local remote And it fails with slightsmile WARNING LRE submodel failed with name verbose error Cannot convert a aa a f a be to boolean console output details summaryClick to expandsummary
