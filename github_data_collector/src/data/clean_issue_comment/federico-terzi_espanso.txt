Ive been dealing with this issue for about a month now I had Catalina and have reverted to Mojave due to Catalinas many issues The one issue that I was facing on Catalina that has resurfaced on Mojave is presented as a particular tool specifically the Hand tool used to grab the artwork and move it around shows stuckfrozen This also disables any other tool access specifically in Photoshop Other Adobe software is effected by this as well I spend a majority of my time in Photoshop but have used other Adobe applications After Effects Illustrator during the issue and certain functionalities in the other Adobe applications show the same disrupted behavior just in a different way Once this occurs I have to either restart my system or logout and login This is to reset the state of my applications on my system in any way to temporarily fix the issue to allow me the option to work on my projects Ive spent many hours having multiple different applications running all while stopping others to target a suspected application causing the issue I have recently determined that when I dont have espanso running the issue does not occur I would like to look into this further as I love using espanso and would like to continue using espanso Although if a solution to this problem is not possible then I can always work on building my own or finding an alternative I wanted to bring this to the surface to assist the possibility of others having the same issue I would love to be able to use espanso and Adobe applications simultaneously Im using Espanso on Windows bit In what seems to be random intervals my number keys at the top of my keyboard seem to stop working It is a software issue as I can change keyboards and even use the laptop keyboard itself and it still occurs Fortunately I found espanso because I had this issue with previous text expanders but I would love to get to the bottom of it What method does Espanso use to expand text maybe if I had a small understanding of what is happening I could start to troubleshoot my issue Hi and thank you alot for espanso I am using espanso under Windows and i would like to locale name of the day stored in A variable into slovak language Is it possible Please update your docs because I wasnt able to start espanso without it PopOS Gnome bit Hi federicoterzi Thanks for your hard work on espanso I think it has huge potential I have a sophisticated setup on PhraseExpress with hundreds of terms As a translator I have to use many words regularly and the easiest way to remember all the triggers is to apply a logic For me this logic has to be short to justify using a text expansion solution consistent to help remember every defined term easily So my logic was to use first and last letters of each word kr for kald r which means remove kadar which means up to kriter which means criteria kurtar which means recover and many more Now when I use this trigger PhraseExpress show me a dropdown menu to chose any of the entries associated to it But espanso just replaces the trigger with one of them It would be great to find a solution to solve this issue I really like how espanso is designed and Im looking forward to migrate to it as soon as I can find all the functuonality in it Thanks man As mentioned in Detected change current window has properties Title sudhanshu tmux client Yakuake Class yakuake Executable This is a feature Im missing from AutoKey To me it makes sense to add it to the word feature it could get its own key of course trigger foo replace bar word true foo bar Foo Bar FOO BAR I have been playing around with espanso on PopOS for a couple hours now trying to use it as a replacement for trusty AHK I am coming from Windows I am experiencing an issue with the trigger not always being fully replaced Sometimes the first character very rarely the first characters remain On other occasions a space is introduced before the replacement Eg my trigger is essr and the replacement is

Entschuldigen Sie bitte die sp te R ckmeldung I just installed espanso on PopOS according to the instructions for Ubuntu and was told after attempting to start espanso that notifysend command is needed for espanso to work correctly So I did some research and found that the required package is called libnotifybin It would be ideal if you could include that in the line sudo apt install libxtst libxdo xclip and change it to sudo apt install libxtst libxdo xclip libnotifybin Anyway nothing happens if the user already has that installed but it is good to have it in the instructions considering it is a prerequisite for your program to function correctly A decent solution could be delaying the clipboard restoration by a few milliseconds after a match expansion rust
