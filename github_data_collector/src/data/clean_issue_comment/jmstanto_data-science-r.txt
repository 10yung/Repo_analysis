 I thought you might appreciate a markdown version of your text which will make it viewable on Github and more likely to be used by Githubbers or whatever they are called Right now Ive only added spaces to your text and Ill spend a week or so adding markup Could you send me your images Ill make a folder and add them as links in the markup I can do it without the images but it would look sweet Also Im sure you would like the markup version to look similar to the PDF version Thanks for writing this and sharing it on Github
