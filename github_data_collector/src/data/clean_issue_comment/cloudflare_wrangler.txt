weve had a couple of requests to output upload artifacts to disk for debugging and custom ci solutions id like to do this for asset manifests because it has implications for our code as well as the user benefits mentioned above Fixes and This relies on this PR in rustwasmbinaryinstall Hey team Thanks for all the great work you and everyone else has done so far I have added support a custom URL to be passed to the preview command When either a URL is passed using the flag u or url to the preview command the browser will open to the URL specified Example usage bash wrangler preview url In the case where headless is also passed the server will output the response of the request to the URL When this flag is not specified the application will continue to use the default The protocol specified in the URL can be either HTTP or HTTPS In the case that neither protocol are used or the specified URL is not a valid URL the command will fallback to using the default as specified above I hope you can review and implement this ASAP as I know a number of developers would love this feature Thanks heaps ran cargo update which updates the Cargolock to the latest nonbreaking change So this works console wrangler dev JavaScript project found Skipping unnecessary build Listening on watching GET examplecom HTTP hello world i have not edited a file Detected changes JavaScript project found Skipping unnecessary build GET examplecom HTTP hello world i have edited a file Detected changes JavaScript project found Skipping unnecessary build GET examplecom HTTP unknown console event Script modified context reset hello world i have edited a file again The problem is that the console event Script modified context reset only occurs after I issue another curl command which makes me think that my thread logic is blocking somewhere that it shouldnt be Im not quite sure how that would be happening as I made sure to drop the mutex guards after i use them Our Cargotoml was getting a bit unruly theres a tool called cargo tomlfmt that will format the toml for us Bug Report Uploading Error Failed to upload file batch Error timed out Environment operating system Macos catalina output of rustc V zsh command not found rustc output of node v v output of wrangler V wrangler Steps to reproduce wrangler publish What did you expect to see Completed successfully What did you see instead Error Failed to upload file batch Error timed out Right now if you specify a kvnamespace binding in your wranglertoml and its id collides with an existing namespace configured for Sites wrangler will just kinda let it be This opens up some undesirable edge cases id like to button up but if there are users relying on it the fix will break them The above logic should be moved to Targetkvnamespaces and complain if any kv namespaces listed in the wranglertoml collide with the site namespace configured automatically by wrangler wrangler secret blah env staging Enter the secret text youd like assigned to blah sdfsf sdfsf Creating the secret for account b f c c bf f d fc Success Youve uploaded secret blah Binding secret to script myworkerstaging Success Youve bound the secret blah to myworkerstaging
