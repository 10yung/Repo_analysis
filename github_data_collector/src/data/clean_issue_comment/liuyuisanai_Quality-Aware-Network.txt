In the paper you release the performance in MARS How can I train on the MARS dataset Hi How can I test single Image Hi what is the possword of LPW DatasetBaidu Cloud thx In your CVPR paper Equation provides the gradient for weights correspongding to line in batchpoollayercpp I have a question that what is xij in Equation How is it calculated in the code The output of pools layer isnt used in the next why In this prototxt you choose the pool x s as the input of quality generation unit which is the different from the trainPQANimageprototxt Whats the difference between them convolution layer bottom pool x s top conv sss name conv sss type Convolution param lrmult decaymult param lrmult decaymult convolutionparam numoutput kernelsize stride pad weightfiller type gaussian std biasfiller type constant value layer bottom conv sss top conv sss name conv sss type Convolution param lrmult decaymult param lrmult decaymult convolutionparam numoutput kernelsize stride pad weightfiller type gaussian std biasfiller type constant value layer name pools type Pooling bottom conv sss top pools poolingparam pool AVE kernelh kernelw stride layer name fc s type InnerProduct bottom pool x s top fc s param lrmult decaymult param lrmult decaymult innerproductparam numoutput weightfiller type gaussian std weightfiller type xavier biasfiller type constant value Hello I m interested in Unsupervised Partial Quality Predictor for LargeScale Person Reidentification but I cant find the article on the Internet have you published it
