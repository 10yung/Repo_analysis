Hi Im working a continuous bayesian network with hidden variables can EM in bayesscala handle this case Thanks Kaiyang Would you mind release a cross version build for scala i use truncate function of Gaussian in basesscala but it seems not working the code val truncGaussian dkbayesmathgaussianGaussian truncate true fori until val d truncGaussiandraw printlnd i plot the hist of sampled data draw from truncGaussian and it is a Gaussian distribution with no truncation look here performance improvement Nguyen et al Automated Variational Inference for Gaussian Process Models Migrate a private walmart repo to bayesscala write a tutorial page Do it after competition is completed Hi Daniel Ive finally managed to create a visualization for Bayesian Networks constructed from Categoricals Check out the README of the Gist here Could you check if it runs on your machine If so we can think about how to maybe integrate this into bayesscala Best and thanks again for your help Martin I was having an issue with the common benchmarking Bayesian network B and so decided to test this with a much smaller network commonly used when learning what a Bayesian network is Grass Wet The code I am using to represent this network is shown below scala var loopyBP LoopyBP def loadNetwork var rain Var var sprinkler Var var grasswet Var var rainFac FactorArrayrain Array var sprinklerFac FactorArraysprinkler rain Array var grasswetFac FactorArraygrasswet sprinkler rain Array var clusterGraph GenericClusterGraph clusterGraphaddCluster rainFac clusterGraphaddCluster sprinklerFac clusterGraphaddCluster grasswetFac clusterGraphaddEdges loopyBP LoopyBPclusterGraph loopyBPcalibrate However when adding the edges the following error is obtained requirement failed Sepset must contain single variable only Which can be found within this code scala private def calcSepsetVariablecluster Cluster cluster Cluster Var val intersectVariables cluster getFactorgetVariablesintersectcluster getFactorgetVariables requireintersectVariablessize Sepset must contain single variable only val intersectVariable intersectVariableshead intersectVariable Essentially as far as I am aware this algorithm is saying the network is invalid when actually as a Bayesian network this should be fine I am wondering if there is some sort of mistake I am making or if BayesScala does not yet support this
