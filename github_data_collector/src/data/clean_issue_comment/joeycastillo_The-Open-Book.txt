Hi it doesnt look like this thing has wifi Would there be any big issues with switching the main chip to an ESP which would have built in wifi and bluetooth I love this concept but is this a design to hack upon or plans for a final product that is open hardware Hi Great project the motivation correct and is strategic and I would love to use the final version Some ideas some board to run Linux I guess that would mean much easier and fast development possible much easier to find developers to join on the software side why not Raspberry Pi Zero W that is very popular is very easy to source and should stay long on the market Includes Wifi and Bluetooth meaning possible wireless sync of ebooks in future to PC or mobile D print enclosure I think you just need to define it and someone on community will design test print and share the D files larger display I guess at least or inches Would be nice if user could decide the size and the changes could be mainly on display size D printed enclosure Hi great project idea and Im excited to contribute However Im not excited to use Eagle KiCad is mature enough to handle this project and is FOSS Would you consider moving to it Hi joeycastillo this is a great effort and idea It would be nice if you could put up a contribution guide for people like me wanting to work on this project Thanks Hey neat project I made it compatible with kitspaceorg by adding a bill of materials cribbed Digikey parts from plotting the gerbers one day Kitspace will do this automatically disappointed and adding a kitspaceyaml manifest file If you are up for adding it then just merge this Here is a preview of what it would look like It would make it easier for others to rebuild the PCB and the Kitspace page will be automatically kept up to date with this repo going forward though it can take up to hrs to propagate Hello i love your project but was a bit disapointed when i wanted some code to use I wanted to use an epaper to read ebook but cant find good tutorial to explain how to seems only ebook company manage to display pdf or epub on an epaper Maybe im wrong and that you know some already existing project which use custom epaper hardware to display ebook That you might use for your project Or maybe im right and you are currently developping one your project In any case i would be glad to have your answer anf maybe your tips
