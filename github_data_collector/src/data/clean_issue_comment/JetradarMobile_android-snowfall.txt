Starts falling again from top when orientation change i think in to the library project configurationwith screenlayout change isnt added in activity in manifest if I stop it on the onCreate the animation always continuous Hi Im getting the Failed to resolve comgithubjetradarmobileandroidsnowfall Error is this library still available I want to change snow flake image programmatically Please do something and let me know through email Above issues is the only missing in this library Thank you so much for this library I am trying to integrate this snowfall effect in recyclerview and it is looking quite good But without snowfall effect recyclerview is scrolling smoothly and integration of snowfall makes recyclerview scrolling hazy Do you know this is happening Any direction and guide will be really helpful Thanks xml configuration is too rigid public fun setSnowflakeImagesnowflakeImage Bitmap thissnowflakeImage snowflakeImage I have my Editext field and snow fall animations at the same page When i try to enter text in the edittext field it takes more time for the text to be show It is because of the animations in the page makes the text to appear slow Is there any way to view the text as soon as possible after it is being typed Thanks in Advance The code is not threadsafe There are two threads accessing the snowflake objects at the same time the main thread in onDraw and a background thread This can cause the snowflakes to be drawn at incorrect positions You should really do everything on the main thread if possible if not then you need to copy the array before passing it to the background thread then post it back to the main thread when the work is done so they dont interfere with each other source
