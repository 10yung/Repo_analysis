 I am having a problem when uploading the CSS it wont take any changes on the theme I have to refresh the page many times for the change to work it is not a cache problem as this is happening on many pc and different browsers any help would be appreciated Hi for some reason theres a conflict with the theme when using The Events Calendar Plugin in wordpress The Previous and Next navigation function dont work But when I use other wordpress themes the navigation function works Do anyone know how to fix this Thanks What do you think of using figure and figcaption tags instead wpcaption and wpcaptiontext classes Im new to all this so forgive me if this is obvious I dont get why theres an directory first and then js which has an ancient or supernew version of jquery in it and then inc js which has more js stuff in it And why in functionsjs does it use the old version of documentreadyfunction instead of function Ive been trying to find just your basic theme with no gimmicks and this looks mighty gimmicky Any help Ive seen that some clases that uses wordpress in the post like alignright wpcaption isnt in the CSS maybe aligns classes should be added Also is inc folder inside of it a customized version of the options framework plugin If so what was changed about it There was a pretty generic error posted about someone having issues loading jQuery with a specific plugin which could have been due to a standard request being blocked from a SSL enabled site By checking if WP is running in SSL mode we can be sure the user gets the right protocol queued Change submt to submit in stylecss basic typo the editor contentcss is getting bypassed because of the reset I wish there would be customeditorstylecss already set up to make both editor content in admin screen identical to what really looks like in the actual page content Just to eliminate confusion move the calls to the stylesheets and scripts all to the functionsphp file This has the benefit of having all your loading taking place in one location for reference Even better with the all the loading taking place in functionsphp you can take advantage of WordPress conditional functions for a rudimentary script loader
