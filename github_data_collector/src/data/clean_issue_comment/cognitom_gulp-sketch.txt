In the docs it says to run npm run installsketchtool and in that script it is looking for SketchappContentsResourcessketchtoolinstallsh which no longer exists in Sketch when you download it so it doesnt workdo anything You can see its not in there anymore in this screenshot screen shot at pm What can I do to fix this Recently Ive almost switched to Figma So its a bit difficult to maintain this repository actively If someone has interest to take care about gulpsketch let me know Thanks The clean option apparently removes fill attributes I do not really understand why At least in my use case this breaks the appearance of the exported SVG files The option compact seems to make no difference at all Would be awesome to have a reliable option to export SVG files which are mostly untouched but do simply not include stuff like this Generator sketchtool descCreated with sketchtooldesc Thanks gruntsketch apparently makes an option available to include symbols when exporting artboards I couldnt find the option for gulpsketch Might be great though Thanks Hi cognitom When gulpsketch exports images it does not use the original path of the sketch file when deciding where to save the exported versions This causes problems in a project which has its sketch files in various locations in a project So if we had this structure components component component sketch component component sketch component component sketch Then when the images are created if we set up gulpsketch to store exports in exports then they get saved like this exports component png component png component png when instead we would want this exports component component png component component png component component png As a workaround I set up our gulp task like this javascript const path requirepath const tap requiregulptap const gulp requiregulphelprequiregulp const sketch requiregulpsketch Export images from a sketch file gulptasksketch function let dest return gulpsrcsrcsketch pipetapfile gulpsketch strips out destination path dest pathdirnamepathjoinfilebase pathrelativefilebase filepath return file pipesketch export slices formats png pipegulpdestfile return destsketchexport The above task then requires the dest variable created during the flow to be able to achieve the same directory structure as our app I do this so that the exported images live in the same directory as the sketch file in a subdirectory called sketchexport It would be great if there was an option to allow maintainingrecreating the original directory structure in which the sketch files are located Hi I am trying to run an independent gulp task which will convert all my sketch files in a folder to pngs in another folder I am running the following task as per the given syntax gulptasksketch function return gulpsrcsketchfilessketch pipesketch export artboards formats png onerror gutillog pipegulpdestpreview The task starts but never ends and i am thrown out of the gulp task No pngs generated either I am using gulpsketch and sketch version Folder structure gulpfilejs sketchfiles preview all at the same level Terminal Output untitled Using nested artboard layer slice names like somedirsubdirasset throws the following error fsjs var r bindingreadfd buffer offset length position Error EISDIR illegal operation on a directory read at Error native at ObjectfsreadSync fsjs at ObjectfsreadFileSync fsjs at Socketanonymous UsersmatthewwagerfieldDropboxBusinessNativeVimpelCombeaconprototypesboilerplatenodemodulesgulpsketchindexjs at emitNone eventsjs at Socketemit eventsjs at endReadableNT streamreadablejs at nextTickCallbackWith Args nodejs at processtickCallback nodejs Investigating this it would appear that the issue is with fsreadFileSync attempting to read a directory in the example above this would be somedir Posibility to add source filename as additional folder to exported files Locally we can pass the tests but failed on Travis because of the version of Nodejs on Traviss osx environment Read buffer instead of direct file access x Use temp to avoid conflict Divide this module into two and make a new nodesketch module Ask to remove it from the blacklist There is a limitation of vinylfs The plugin couldnt read a directory This causes a problem if a plugin works with OSX packages or directories Some research about it is needed After ver Sketch file is just a file
