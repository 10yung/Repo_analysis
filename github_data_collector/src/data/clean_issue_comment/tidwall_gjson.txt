This modifier returns the current element asis and can be used to retrieve the JSON document itself It is equivalent to the JSON Pointer Closes The JSON Pointer specification allows to retrieve the root value of a JSON document using the pointer I was unable to figure out how to do that with GJSON paths Is this currently possible Ive tried several approaches but was unable to get the root element I know that this is jj and not gjson but since one uses the other I assume that the inputs would return the same output for gjson too echo namefirstTomlastSmith jj echo namefirstTomlastSmith jj echo namefirstTomlastSmith jj firstTomlastSmith I was unable to figure this out using the docs but maybe I missed it Hello Lets assume I have the following JSON This is a plain string which is a valid JSON What path should I use for gjsonGet to get exactly the same string as result In the example given go name gjsonGetjson programmerslastNameHunterfirstName printlnnameString prints Elliotte to grab a value from a nested array how can a parameter from a function be used ie instead of Hunter use any lastName to return the firstName So far I have been unsuccessful Ive been thinking of something like this go func getFirstName lName string string input err ioutilReadFilejsonFile if err nil fmtPrintlnerr jsonLookup stringinput fName gjsonGetjsonLookup programmerslastNamelNamefirstName return fNameString
