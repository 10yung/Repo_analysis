Hi I just wanted you to know that the blog post that relates to Sift which you use in Mailcheck has now moved to Thanks Siderite Hi Ive just released a similar library for PHP It uses the Levenshtein algorithm to find suggestions and uses a different strategy for suggesting unknown hostnames by suggesting just the TLDs I wrote it because I felt the Javascript version too buggy for my needs If you are willing to give the project a breeze and try to test and standardize the libraries I would love to get my repo added to the organization Otherwise I would prefer to maintain it myself I would love to hear your thoughts What is the simplest way to highlight the corrected part of the email Fixes Its generally good practice IMO to keep only the things consumers need to use your lib in npm In this case your specs folder references a vulnerable version of jquery which is fine since its not used at runtime but it causes false positives for vulnerability scanners like retireJS Keeping your npm bundle slim is also good for helping fight nodemodules cruft and slow installs RetireJS is failing with this homecirclewealthsimplenodemodulesmailcheckspeclibjqueryjs jquery has known vulnerabilities severity low CVE CVE summary jQuery before as used in Drupal Backdrop CMS and other products mishandles jQueryextendtrue because of Objectprototype pollution Looks like your use of JQuery here is for unit tests only correct If so how do you feel about excluding the spec folder from the files that get shipped to npm mailwcom is not close enough to suggest that the user entered the wrong domain name Are you going to correct mailacom thru mailzcom too Are you correcting mailcom which is a valid domain You should only be correcting some that looks like the domain Why wouldnt mailwcom be closer to mailcom Are you promoting Google I own mailwcom Support can be added for the pmme domain which is ProtonMails short email domain name See Steps to reproduce js Mailcheckrun email joeripmme suggested suggestion consolelogMailcheck doesnt know about pmme suggested suggestionfull empty consolelogMailcheck knows about the pmme domain What I expect to happen Mailcheck runs the empty callback The console shows Mailcheck knows about the pmme domain What actually happens Mailcheck runs the suggested callback The console shows Mailcheck doesnt know about pmme suggested joerigmxde This make it possible to use the package as a middleware so if the email checked is valid it will return the already valid value gouvfr is a top level domain used by french administration Examples The issue is that without this commit mailcheck will propose gov instead of gouvfr I dont think that members of french administration will be happy to be suggested to use american domain in case of a typo Before vs After
