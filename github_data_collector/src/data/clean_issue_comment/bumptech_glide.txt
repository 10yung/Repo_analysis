Device Xiaomi Redmi S Android LMY V with MIUI LHPCNDD Glide I am in a list screen that shows objects created and deleted by the user Each object is assigned an icon enter Glide selected by the user from local resources No networking is involved The user opens a new screen to create an object and when the user is done they return to the list screen and the object shows on the list Both screens are a fragment inside an activity of their own An activity with the list fragment opens an activity with the object creator fragment To reproduce the crash I do a series of adddelete operations The crash always happens after the creation of an object at the return to the list fragment I include a video of reproducing the crash I could reproduce it every time on Redmi S On Samsung SMG HN after many failed attempts to reproduce it I put the app in background while I was at the list screen and it immediately crashed with the same error I havent been able to reproduce that again The exception logged is EUncaughtException javalangIllegalStateException Cannot recycle a resource that has already been recycled at combumptechglideloadengineEngineResourcerecycleEngineResourcejava at

your private branches to make changes Please make sure there are no weird commits in the change set by rebasing to latest upstream Please squash typocheckstylereview fix commits into the base commit Description Please describe the changes you made on a high level Make sure you reference the GitHub issue here if this change is related to one This PR adds an option to request for ignoring the EXIF orientation parsing in Downsampler Motivation and Context Why is this change required What problem does it solve If its fixing a bug reference it or provide repro steps Addresses For some applications like ours the application keeps track of the orientation not stored as the EXIF data If you have any issues feel free to create the PR anyway well help to resolve them See I use glide to load bitmap

location of xy getPixelxy is not the same with bitmap decode from diskcache But when I set DiskCacheStrategy to DiskCacheStrategyDATA getPixelxy return same value I dont understandwhy DiskCacheStrategy change pixel of the image file When Bitmap or other image is ready can I insert the msg at the front of queue on main thread to make the image show immediately Is there any risk when
