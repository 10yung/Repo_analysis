shard reads the presentation of a captcha for LinkedIn as a false positive My current facebook password includes a bunch of very unusual characters For obvious reasons Ill just put a range of characters that might include additional characters not actually in my password Im not sure what the problem is the result to the post still includes login links Does facebook sometimes show captchas or something alike Im not sure if this should be handled in any way I wrote a test and used the above email to check to see if rejection would work Turned out that facebook and linkedin treat this specific email in a special way I dont know if this should be taken care of or not Just wanted to put it out there
