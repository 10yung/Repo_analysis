otherwise users are obliged to set the config values after sourcing the plugin Theyre not able to do it before Also resourcing the plugin will reset the values to the defaults again A similar change was done in zshautosuggestions in the past Ive skimmed some of the various issues here and I understand that theres no single way to set the keybindings up but I think the ones included in the README are fine and shouldnt conflict with anything else Can we add this or something similar as a default sh bindkey A historysubstringsearchup bindkey B historysubstringsearchdown Bind up and down keys zmodload F zshterminfo pterminfo if n terminfo kcuu n terminfo kcud then bindkey terminfo kcuu historysubstringsearchup bindkey terminfo kcud historysubstringsearchdown fi bindkey P historysubstringsearchup bindkey N historysubstringsearchdown bindkey M vicmd k historysubstringsearchup bindkey M vicmd j historysubstringsearchdown See for for some context although its probably not needed The plugin works fine with arrow keys However in normal mode pressing j and k just scrolls through history as if I didnt have the plugin Some configuration information if it helps pluginsvimode historysubstringsearch setopt vi autoload U editcommandline zle N editcommandline bindkey M vicmd editcommandline I have a zsh setup thats not reliant on ohmyzsh Can this plugin be used with just vanilla zsh If so what would be the correct installation method READMEmd says to add ohmyzsh plugin with name of historysubstringsearch However this is inconsistent with zshusers other plugins such as zshcompletions zshsyntaxhighlighting and zshautosuggestions which are all prefixed by zsh and have same name with their repositories And actually specifying its name as zshhistorysubstringsearch also works So why not change it Is it due to some historical reason Add a new optional config variable that will anchor history search to the beginning of the command Note that the default behavior does not change with this I thought disabling HISTORYSUBSTRINGSEARCHFUZZY would also disable search pattern abc but thats not the case local searchpatternjhistorysubstringsearchqueryparts m MATCH Pattern always starts with a Fuzzy searching as I imagined would leave the position of a substring the same in the query Search results for disabled fuzzy searching should always start with abc then match fuzzy abcd I set this value in zshrc like this in my zshrc HISTORYSUBSTRINGSEARCHFUZZYwhateveryouwant But no fuzzy search effect observed Eg I type this at first touch abdefchtxt After this command I type touch ab c and up arrow but no history command found has this feature
