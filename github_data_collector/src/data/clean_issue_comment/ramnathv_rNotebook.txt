whenever I put my gist id the code section appeared but its execution pane do not show anything I found a little display issue after first line in IE browser though with few knowledge about shinyjs and appjs I need to rewrite rNotebook to take advantage of recent advancements shinyAce OpenCPU The idea is to have a single column document with editable code cells just like an iPython notebook It should allow users to execute a single code chunk or the entire document I think this should not be very complicated In fact I already have an interactive single column version of the console with output below and I should be able to tweak it It makes a lot of sense to rewrite this app using AngularJS The major advantages I see are Simpler and easily maintainable code Two Way Data Binding This should make it really easy to add additional features As AngularJS already has an Ace directive it should be fairly simple to implement this livecodingio The JS code is currently all over the place split across multiple files and folders I would like to organize it better I want to keep the vendor libraries organized in their own folders and all application related code combined into a single minified file I want to check popular HTML applications to see how they organize custom assets and vendor code It would be good to follow an established convention rather than coming up with my own custom approach Eventually I want to move my app development workflow to use a JS package manager like Yeoman Jam Volo or Bower Just wanted to put that in here as well tooltip reads F to knit but code says CTRLe Also on Windows in Chrome CTRLe does not work Rather it goes to the address bar and says enter query For example should automatically load the contents of the gist I can extend this to load urls as well The code is already there in aceshinyjs but needs to be cleaned up a bit When uploading a file in mac os running rNotebook locally it shows the path as Cfakepath Anyway it seems to work skarmavbild kl The publish button doesnt work mac os chromefirefox if it is supposed to do that yet
