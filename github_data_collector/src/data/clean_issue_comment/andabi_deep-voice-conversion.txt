new to python having a heck of time getting this to work Was wondering if there is a prebuild windows release available for this kind of like the one there is for DeepFakeLab if not is anyone working on one loss I trained the net for almost days and the loss value was on arctic dataset Now when I am using the model the quality of the sound is not good and not clearly audible Can you please suggest what I can do to improve it andabi Who has the TIMIT daraset which this project use Please contact me emil qqcom Thanks a lot Using the Dockerfile in scripts folder I managed to start train py basepy Setup callbacks graph summarypy Maintain moving average summary of tensors basepy Creating the session I tensorflowcoreplatformcpufeatureguardcc Your CPU supports instructions that this TensorFlow binary was not compiled to use AVX FMA I tensorflowstreamexecutorcudacudagpuexecutorcc successful NUMA node read from SysFS had negative value but there must be at least one NUMA node so returning NUMA node zero I tensorflowcorecommonruntimegpugpudevicecc Found device with properties name TITAN X Pascal major minor memoryClockRateGHz pciBusID totalMemory GiB freeMemory GiB I tensorflowcorecommonruntimegpugpudevicecc Adding visible gpu devices I tensorflowcorecommonruntimegpugpudevicecc Device interconnect StreamExecutor with strength edge matrix I tensorflowcorecommonruntimegpugpudevicecc I tensorflowcorecommonruntimegpugpudevicecc N I tensorflowcorecommonruntimegpugpudevicecc Created TensorFlow device joblocalhostreplica task deviceGPU with MB memory physical GPU device name TITAN X Pascal pci bus id compute capability basepy Initializing the session basepy Graph Finalized W tensorflowcorekernelsqueuebasecc QueueInputinputqueue Skipping cancelled dequeue attempt with queue not closed concurrencypy Starting EnqueueThread QueueInputinputqueue graphpy Running Op syncvariablesfrommaintower basepy Start Epoch its However you can see how its extremely slow Even though my GPU is recognised and the memory allocated this is the actual usage from nvidiasmi NVIDIASMI Driver Version CUDA Version GPU Name PersistenceM BusId DispA Volatile Uncorr ECC Fan Temp Perf PwrUsageCap MemoryUsage GPUUtil Compute M TITAN X Pascal Off On NA C P W W MiB MiB Default ideas hello I wonder if default params is suitable for ljspeech dataset could anyone give some tips for other dataset training the result is really different between cmuslt and other dataset with default params When I Running train py using timit data encountered the following error InvalidArgumentError see above for traceback No OpKernel was registered to support Op NcclAllReduce with these attrs Registered devices CPU Registered kernels no registered kernels node AllReduceGradsNcclAllReduce NcclAllReduce TDTFLOAT numdevices reductionsum sharednamec devicedeviceGPU tower gradientstower net prenetdense Tensordottranspose gradtranspose the folloing the the command line python train py timit but how to register the kernel I am trying to see what an output might be like I have net weights and only need net weights so that I can put in my own choice of data and see what it would be like on the arctic slm set What format and directory layout are the samples in and do I need to provide a script too I am hoping to train Arnold Schwarzenegger venv vyshnavivyshnaviInspiron Desktopdeepvoiceconversionmaster python train py firsttrain homevyshnaviDesktopdeepvoiceconversionmasterhparampy YAMLLoadWarning calling yamlloadall without Loader is deprecated as the default Loader is unsafe Please read for full details for doc in docs Traceback most recent call last File train py line in module trainargs logdirlogdirtrain File train py line in train loggersetloggerdirlogdir File homevyshnavivenvlocallibpython sitepackagestensorpackutilsloggerpy line in setloggerdir mkdirpdirname File homevyshnavivenvlocallibpython sitepackagestensorpackutilsfspy line in mkdirp raise e OSError Errno Permission denied data I am not able to understand what the issue is over here
