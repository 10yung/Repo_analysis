With this you could write something like below and the password will be read from the env variable yaml servers addr ircfreenodenet port nicks meain pass FREENODEPASSWORD Is this possible to be able to enable clock at each line in conf file enable align and specified nb of char for nick place as align from ahub cest quoi ton client eoli n eoli n tinyircclientgit AUR eoli n je viens de linstaller ahub connais pas ahub cest quoi la diff rence avec un weechat ou autre eoli n je viens de decouvrir cest top eoli n ahub un simple fichier de conf pas besoin de plugin pour g rer les highlight et les notif ahub ho ahub ok ahub eoli n to ahub cest quoi ton client eoli n eoli n tinyircclientgit AUR eoli n je viens de linstaller ahub connais pas ahub cest quoi la diff rence avec un weechat ou autre eoli n je viens de decouvrir cest top eoli n ahub un simple fichier de conf pas besoin de plugin pour g rer les highlight et les notif ahub ho ahub ok ahub eoli n Keybind match qwerty keyboard alt switch to nth tab is for azerty altshift switch to nth tab Also is there anyway to add a keybind altupdown switch to leftright tab Or better a conf file to give ability to set our keybinds Is this possible to package this for nixos Currently libtinyclient only works with tokio as it uses tokios spawn functions I think itd be good to make it work with different executors using a spawn function passed on initialization for two reasons It would make the library more usable eg in an application that uses asyncstd you could still use libtinyclient without adding yet another executor to your app In I think itll be better if we use GTKGlibs event loop as executor instead of tokio I dont have a prototype yet but I think using glibMainContextspawnlocal would make the code simpler no need for messaging I think we could share widgets with the tasks and update them directly etc glibMainContextspawnlocal This close PS this is my first real PR ever I hope you review the code and I hope to see your feedback on basically everything I hope this gonna be acceptable and I hope I wont waste your time Configuration setting for enabling HHMMSS for each irc message Should the other commands such as clear move in alongside these This pull requests add a GUI Lots of stuff missing Some TODOs A lot of code related to tab handling is copied from TUI Im not sure how to refactor those so that both TUI and GUI can reuse the same tabhandling code Text view should automatically scroll when its currently scrolled to the bottom and a new message appears Implement a nick list Tab colors are not implemented the TabStyle stuff For some reason this doesnt work at all panics with a SendError when not run in VSCode debugger Wat Clients keep running after GUI exits more to come Heres a screenshot of how this looks as of d b c Screenshot Feature request for Vilike keybinds I love using Tridactyl in the browser to simulate Vi binds and sort of stay in the same mindset something similar for tiny would be great eg gt goto next tab gT goto prev tab etc
