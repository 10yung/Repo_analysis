Some time series data sets need to be added for examples BMI categories differ by population groupbmi function could have multiple options The readmothur phyloseq example is currently broken The instextdata datasets will need to be moved to a separate data package or tutorial I would like to perform a pairwise adonis test with phyloseq object and a unifrac distance matrix but I dont know how Example dataGlobalPatterns metadata assampledataGlobalPatterns dataframe distuf phyloseqdistanceGlobalPatterns method unifrac psadonis adonisdistuf SampleType data metadata perm SampleType e The adonis test showed that SampleType does explain part of the variation but I want to know which Samples are different from each other With betadisper paired test is easy to perform but I dont know how to do this within the adonis function with a uf distance matrix psdisper betadisperdistuf metadataSampleType permutestpsdisper pairTRUE Response Distances Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F NPerm PrF Groups Residuals Signif codes Pairwise comparisons The pairwiseadonis function does only include Braycurtis and Jaccard distance Thank you in advance I am having issues converting my phyloseq object to the correct format in order to run the association analysis If anyone can provide a workflow it would be greatly appreciated The plotlandscape and other functions fail if the named metadata variable is not present in the metadata for instance color nationality when the metadata does not have nationality This should generate an informative error message stating that the referred variable is not available in the data and perhaps show the available options Figure type of plots from the review Hi microbiome team Over in dada land we are interested in linking our package with other excellent Bioconductor microbiome packages The primary way we have done this so far is to integrate stubs into our tutorial which is by far our most accessed piece of documentation To date we have added brief examples and links to the DECIPHER package for their IDTaxa method and the phyloseq package for more general microbiome analysis Would the microbiome team be amenable to dada adding a microbiome package stub to our tutorial Do you have any suggestions on what sort of Rmarkdown code might be effective it should probably show importing of dada workflow data into microbiome and maybe the generation of a plot Im also interested in any other crosslinking ideas you might have I think you all are doing great work I am trying to run the aggregatetaxapseq Genus function on a phyloseq using the microbiome package version If I remove the phytree phytree NULL from the phyloseq object prior to running the function I remember this was in a tutorial I followed previously I get the following error running the aggregatetaxa function Error in tmp nam value colSumsmatrixd taxa ncol nsamplesmypseq subscript out of bounds When including the phytree aggregatetaxa works with the message The top parameter to be implemented when phytree is available but plotcomposition gives an error on dimnames psgen microbiomeaggregatetaxaps Genus top The top parameter to be implemented when phytree is available plotcompositionCountAbun plotcompositionpsgen samplesortDescription themelegendposition bottom scalefillbrewerGenus palette Paired themebw themeaxistextx elementtextangle ggtitleCount abundance guideitalics themelegendtitle elementtextsize Error in dimnamesx dn length of dimnames not equal to array extent Could anyone help me solve this issue Thanks in advance
