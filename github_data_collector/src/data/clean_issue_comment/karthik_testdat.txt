Since the project is no longer going forward but might attract people I thought this would be a nice and helpful addition Will testdat run like testthat I would really like it if you put a set of tests in a file and run all of them with the fine result of Checks No problems found Will provide some human friendly regular expression parsing and testing One thing I run into a bunch is a blank field most often with white space used as missing This is especially annoying with factors which then creates a level for the blank space Currently white space alone is not considered a NAaliases see here Should testna and fixna be updated to treat white space as missing or perhaps should there be a new function that tests for empty levels or blank fields and the fix modifies to NA Im happy to contribute to implement either This package does exactly what we need in terms of sanity checks that were already in the works Well just need to get this in as an import Theres a lot of duplication between the code in testNA and fixNA For example both functions have lists of NA strings like and it would be easy for these to get out of sync What do folks especially hilaryparker think of this division of labor between the functions testNA finds the missing values fixNA calls testNA to find where the missing values are and then replaces them If I get the goahead Im happy to make a pull request for it I asked at Etsy colleague how he normalizes data in the database sense Here was his response I believe what I did was to lowercase remove duplicate spaces stem and get rid of stop words all of these concepts are general Also Alyssa Ted and I were just discussing this can we clearly define the usecase for testdat The way I am envisioning it the testdat suite is something that youll want to run immediately after loading a dataset in order to understand it That is itll be dat readcsvdatacsv then testcontinuousdatdat etc Then in your documentation you might have a small section testing data where you display the results of these tests Should we write up documentation outlining this
