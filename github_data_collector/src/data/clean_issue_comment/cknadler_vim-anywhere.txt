I can open files in current window using context menu open with However pressing CtrlCmdV opens new windows I want to know how to open a new buffer in current MacVim window I added this feature by appending this line to binrun sh xdotool key ctrlv It does add a dependency but xdotool supports both linux and OSX There is no hotkey to set in services on macOS Looking under Servicesgeneral shows nothing c will dump the contents of the clipboard into the tempfile before it opens for editing The markdown file type is much more useful than a plain text file which is very useful for GitHub comments issues et cetera I understand that this doesnt solve the problem completely because different people might want different default file types This is a quick solution to improve upon the current state of using a plain text file which is much less useful than any specific file type If any user wants to change file type quickly I recommend setting up mappings in your vimrc for example On some macOS environments the OSTYPE environment variable is Darwin capitalized and not darwin This caused the install script to echo OS Darwin is not supported and exit even if everything was in fact in order This patch uses a caseinsensitive regex against a standard bash operator to allow any OSTYPE that starts with Darwin or darwin All other instances of conditional checks for darwin are also patched across the code base I found most of the time when I invoke vimanywhere I need to type something right away so I think it makes sense to put vim in insert mode automatically to save one keystroke the change should be real simple with startinsert option on vim invocation Are there any plans to port this project to windows for us that are stuck with Microsofts software suite in a work environment etc but still long for the sweet Vimbrace
