I would like to update the nfsserverprovisioner helm chart to have at least the nfsprovisioner v For that I would need the tag v to be released on quayiorepositorykubernetesincubatornfsprovisioner Additional Questions Whats the process for new tags to be released on the image repository Is this is something that anyone could do or does it has to be a core contributor of externalstorage I ran git grep l extensionsv beta xargs sed i sextensionsv beta appsv and then double checked each replacement dameonset is also under appsv psp is under policyv beta We can configure efsprovisioner with region and filesystemid and awsregion or dnsname I would expect that dnsname is the only required property but its not true If I will omit this property I will received W efsprovisionergo environment variable FILESYSTEMID is not set Please set it If i provide fake value i will received W efsprovisionergo couldnt confirm that the EFS file system exists FileSystemNotFound File system fs does not exist Latest image of rbdprovisioner on quayio is released at I want to create a Block PVC which is supported in PR THX issue issue issue When using the image quayioexternalstoragenfsclientprovisionerlatest we can specify parameters as PROVISIONERNAME NFSSERVER and NFSPATH In case my NFS export requires an usernamepassword authentication I am not be able to use that area Is there any reason for not providing this kind of function If not would it be possible to add to the roadmap or it is complicated and wouldnt bring advantages Thanks very much New ports have been added in f aba b e fca b e de f f and if you try to create nfsprovisioner deployment by following instructions youll end up with this error like this failed to provision volume with StorageClass error getting NFS server IP for volume service SERVICENAME is not valid check that it has for ports map TCPtrue UDPtrue TCPtrue TCPtrue exactly one endpoint this pods IP PODIP Thats because port endpoint validation uses reflectDeepEqual for validation and thus fails if there are all required ports AND MORE Ive ended up manually building latest tag from master to my private registry and using that as image I think that docs should at least reference that ports were changed and older versions of container including latest on quay need older versions of service Is it possible for the volumesnfsserver value to be read from configmap Or just use dnsname always
