Seven years old and now is meaningless Currently the solution crashes due to incorrect thread which can be easily solved by surrounding the UI interaction statements with invokeonmain The UI is not showing on the SirikitSample The app is building without any issueerror to the device but when the app starts the scree is just blank Regarding I have tried to run xamarin Refreshing and Maintaining Your App Using Background Tasks sample on iphone iOS using VS for mac But I am not getting any callback for BGAppRefreshTask or BGProcessingTask in background I have enabled UIbackground modes in Infoplistfetch and processing Added BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers key and uniques task ids to Infoplist Tried diffrent EarliestBeginDate intervals minutesUsed local notification to show the callback I tried with native swift sample code alsoThere I was able to receive the callbacks So do I need to add anything else for getting callback in xamarin Configuration OSCatalina iphone versioniphone iOS PortableBouncyCastle is the official portable version of the package The sample as written calls SetCategory and SetMode early on in StartRecording It needs to either save their initial values and set them back on completion or set them to defaults Playback and ModeDefault Failing to do so inhibits audio output on devices although it works in simulator Example code if error null isFinal audioSessionSetCategory AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback audioSessionSetMode AVAudioSessionModeDefault out err nodeRemoveTapOnBus audioEngineDispose recognitionRequestDispose recognitionTaskDispose recognitionRequest null recognitionTask null In ios ARKitSampleARKitSampleGameViewControllercs After running the code it works as expected until I tap on the screen the gesture recognize event is called and it works fine the first time I get a plane node with a snapshot of the screen But when this is called the second time instead of creating a new node at the location of the second tap it overlaps the initial child node The behaviour is different from the original version demoed here Example behaviour after a few screen taps IMG The Chat sample crash on iOS and above Also does not work correctly in regards to showinghiding keyboard updated assets recreated projects updated main and added launch storyboards updated screenshots and readme license metadata fixed iPhone X view all changes are related to the original sample
