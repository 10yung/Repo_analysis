This is personal taste but there could be an option where the oldstyle numbers and are a bit taller than the xheight xheight refers to the height of the lowercase a e o u x etc Would it be possible to create a simple APL ligation set consisting of squishing together and and and and similar to how other sets already treat whew i dont expect you to implement all of these but instead of making new issues im just going to rapidfire all of them here cheers PRETTY IMPORTANT TO ME maplet U A squiggly arrows and all their variants etc if you wanna go that far MEH ligatures with in them eg and open a hole between the angle and so it looks like a funnel rather than just the glyphs smushed together like turnstile but just reversed just for symmetrys sake and triple bars for differentiation between doublelength counterparts and and squish em together but still leave a gap so they arent just thin rectangles YOU REALLY DONT HAVE TO DO THIS inequals haskell for an equality operator i dont think the slash should be as tall as it is its not division also maybe bars of equals should extend to the side of the slash fancy haskell ligature where the ends of the S curve connect to the angle brackets adjust for stylistic sets more haskell squish everything together and emphasize the a tad so that it feels more operatory and similar to and Will there be stylistic sets to Iosevka Aile Like for example to Iosevka Extended So it would be useful to use this font in body copy Continuing this from the related Sarasa Gothic repo issue as the issue apparently belongs here instead I do not presently use Iosevka and while it is a very interestingconfigurable font it does not have an option to disable the symbols it provides This is necessary in order to replace those via fallback to a nd fontor more if a different style is preferred or consistency with a colour emoji font where certain symbols retain monochromatic text representation due to inclusion in this font Perhaps a variant without symbolsvariant optionally an array of blocks or array of unicode rangesparameters Is it OK to request a new stylistic set I suspect there is a limit on the number of stylistic sets a font can have If so then here is one where the characters are unambiguous as possible f shape cv j shape cv l shape cv m shape cv more readable t shape cv shape cv shape cv shape cv shape cv Adds a variant of the number nine glyph that is the number six glyph rotated on its head I also changed the default glyph variant of seven to use standard instead of normal to be more in line with other glyphs see r ps if you have any suggestions for a better name than six Im all for it I just couldnt think of a better one Your font version git latest master currently b ca a Your font variant Iosevka Term customized Your operating system name and version Linux Gentoo Your application using Iosevka terminals I love the tailed f you created some time ago and I also use the curly version of y Would it be possible to create curly versions of the letters k and z as used in IBM Plex Mono Italic and x as used in Overlock Please see the pictures below for illustration IBMPlexMonoItalick IBMPlexMonoItalicz OverlockRegularx Your font version Release or git version Your font variant Regular Your operating system name and version Linux Your application using Iosevka some Java applications may have problem in showing Iosevka properly It is a bug in Javas GUI components VsCode I think could create a better design for the arrow Because of the current font have mistake line height inside and Look example via your font and Pragmata Pro Ioveska Pragmata Pro Your font is awesome thanks But the arrow on the top should be improved Its my opinion Again thanks for your job Its awesome font for coding
