I am unable to find a tool to perform multilabel classificationfor instance a movie can be classified into action romance and epic I have however seen that of multiclass Can anyone please explain how to go about mltilabelling in matlab PS I have done this with Python but for some reason my employer wants it using MATLAB Thanks for answering In addition to basic Matlab which Matlab toolboxes are needed for running Matlab scripts of RenderForCNN Thanks CC Im looking at rundemopy but Im not sure on how I could modify this script in order to render images at specific angles Is there a way to do this One other question Is it possible to use this library to reconstruct a D model from D images When I ran runrenderpy it generated synthetic images and visible keypoints csv file The number of visible keypoints vary from to max But when I ran runcroppy its unable to find the keypoints and gave the following error Failed to find keypoints in crop mediadellSTORAGEdatasynimages c bf dff d b d bb c bf dff d b d bb a e t d png The synthetic image with the above name and corresponding keypoints file csv does exist in the synimages folder in rendermodelviewspy function camPosToQuaternioncx cy cz was defined twice why is that the second definition will overwrite the first one so there will be no meaning to define the first functionIs this a bug Or did it on purpose I try to run python demoviewrundemopy but I keep getting the error RuntimeError Could not open file RenderForCNNcaffemodelsrender cnn dviewcaffemodel This model doesnt seem to exist in the caffemodels folder so Im not sure why the code is looking for this file Hello Thanks for sharing this amazing tool May I ask can I get depth image from a randomspecified viewpoint by using your tool It can be done by meshlab which however does not support batch processing and thus is low efficient Best Joe I am trying to train own model as described in the Training your own models section but I have trouble making the cafferenderforcnn version probably due to dependency issues since I have newer CUDA and cuDNN versions and respectively Can you please specify the correct supported versions for CUDA and cuDNN on which the model was tested dose it can change this command command s s background python s s s s s s devnull
