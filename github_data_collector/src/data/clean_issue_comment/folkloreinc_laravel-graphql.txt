The latest tagged release as well as master depends on webonxygraphql This is quite an old version and is not compatible with PHP due this somewhere in the webonxy library PHP Warning continue targeting switch is equivalent to break Did you mean to use continue This code fragment does not even exist in the latest webonxy release so its clear only an upgrade of webonyx can make compatibility The underlying library supports metadata in for the types how do I use this So I am wondering is there a way to generate the queries and mutations and maybe even the types Mainly the mutations and queries are all the same queries get type get all types mutations createType updateType deleteType For example in a blog the Article and Comments are quite repetative in creating the same queries and mutations Even more idealitair is that of creating a type out of an eloquent model Just pass an array of models in which you want the default crud operations to be active There of course are some cases in which this does not cover the usecase EG authentication in which you want to write a custom type query and mutation I hope it already exists or if someone could explain why this isnt already a feature Great respect to all working on this repo maybe I could help on this feature if it does not already exists I thought that to add types Timestamp PaginationMeta Links etc in a simple and intuitive way was to create a class that has a static method for each type and that calls it by passing the value of the query in the resolve so that can be processed independently This allows me to call these methods staunchly and makes it easy to use them in multiple types What do you think UserTypephp with TimestampType for data queryqueryFetchUsersusersidnametimestampcreatedatupdatedat usertype TypeRegistry all method that return Contracts type with resolve function typeregistry TimestampType is type of time you can add field to fields array timestamptype schermata del I have written a middleware for authentication How can I set the middleware to intercept a graphql schema Is it possible to send some extra value from GraphQLControllerquery method to Folklore GraphQL Support Mutationresolve I need to be able to get file from request object in my resolve method of my mutation classes Is such a thing possible PHP php class ProductsQuery extends Query protected attributes name Products Query public function type return GraphQLpagination GraphQLtypeProduct public function resolveroot args return appProductRepositoryInterfaceclass paginate perpage Query products items name strid description
