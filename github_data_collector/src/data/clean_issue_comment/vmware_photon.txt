trying to logon to vrops appliance so I thought I would PR the fix in case someone else finds themselves in the same boat Best Regards Gary Hi all Forgive me if this is not the place to ask but I cannot find a forum somewhere that deals with photon support I have just deployed instances of photonhw uefi ova and when i configure the network card via creating a network file in the etcsystemdnetwork directory I get a route for via interface lo which ultimately causes the machine to lose network connectivity Am I doing something wrong following doco i found somewhere the network file is below match Nameeth Network DHCPno Address Gateway Domainsensatlocal DNS DNS To fix this I simply issue a route delete net command and it removes the lo default route and all is well again Hello Photon Team Happy New Year Could you kindly clarify the license for the Vivace SPEC files We would like to use the SPEC files and contribute fixes as needed Best Krishna Commands used after fresh boot tdnf upgrade tdnf update tdnf list grep docker tdnf install docker systemctl start docker A dependency job for dockerservice failed See journalctl xe for details journalctl xe grep docker Failed to resolve group docker No such process tdnf install docker systemctl start docker A dependency job for dockerservice failed See journalctl xe for details I figured since the documentation jumped from installing on RPi B to Deploying a Containerized Application in Photon OS with docker then docker wouldve been preinstalled Nope Thats fine Go ahead and install docker Docker group wasnt automatically created groupadd docker usermod aG docker USER systemctl enable docker systemctl start docker Everything works Suggestion Add the lines to create the docker group during install somehow My linuxfu isnt strong enough Also SSH to my machine straight after changing password doesnt work Using changeme also doesnt work Edit Seems like changing the password to xxxx reboot change the password again to changeme reboot change the password again to xxxx works This PR includes simple fixes to enhance the Photon OS platform They are photonrelease Remove arch mangling and add missing systemrelease Provides photonrepos Fix repo configs to not require archspecific mangling rpm Configure RPMCANONVENDOR to vmware For the rpm change I debated between setting it to either vmware or photon I expect vmware might be less surprising I try a PXEkickstart install of minimal Photon OS build d d The basic user and meta data files are copied into seednocloud by kickstart during install When the instance comes up cloudinit local starts and then I get a minute timeout of the systemdnetworkdwaitonline service When you login after the boot is finished the network is down and you can activate it using systemctl restart systemdnetworkd I tried with iptables service deactivated but no change I can see on the host using tcpdump that no dhcp requests are send by the instance In the log the error that kicks is sdnetlink callback failed Invalid argument Googled it not knowing more now When you reboot the machine a second time everything works as intended no network issues Cannot find out what cloud init local does that caused it Running cloudinit debug init local looks totally harmless and I dont know where to look Any ideas Attaching two logs one from the first boot that fails and one from the second that succeeds badlog goodlog Hello Harbor leverages photon base docker image There are use case that Harbor use AWS RDS as database service Im notified that the RDS CA certificate will be rotated May I confirm if the new CA is trusted by the photon image on docker hub file is Currently content is as Log all the mail messages in one place mail varlogmaillog whereas
