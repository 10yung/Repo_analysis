pxgamer Do you think you can start work on this I have collision larastan ready for laravel One of the deprecations in PHP was to deprecate the computation of invalid characters in base conversion functions This causes the Logo module test to fail on with a notice The PHP deprecation notes state Passing invalid characters to baseconvert bindec octdec and hexdec will now generate a deprecation notice This appears to occur when loading the font in the Zend Text Figlet class Im not quite sure if this is an issue with the Zend Text package or the bigflf font pack we provide with Laravel Zeros Logo component Ive now tested using the built in zendframeworkflf file that the Zend Text package provides and the text is successfully output So I think that this is an issue with the bigflf file we provide Ive also now tested a few others Not sure why there is an issue with bigflf specifically This doesnt seem to be clear but I think it should be addressed since its focused on being a consoleonly version of Laravel What are the speed comparisons with running Laravel Zero compared to running the standard Laravel framework or even Laravel lumen which already suggests its super fast A speed test found on Laravel Vs Lumen There was nothing in the docs on how the selfupdater gets the git location When i installed the self update the default search location for the update was filegetcontents How can i point it to the right private github location the name in composerjson is the github org and repo name Is there something i might be missing in the composer file or another settings file to set te location Hey My laravelpacker commandline tool is working fine but what if I can give an option to the user to set the application name while installing or after installing Like currently if you install a packer then you need to write packer to use this CLI but I want to give functionality to the user so that heshe can use any name like pkr or packr whatever they like So it is possible and if yes then how Thanks for this awesome framework Hello I cannot seem to find a way to test if a task output it generated in the tests I tried searching the issue section of the repo and googling my issue but I couldnt find any answer that is useful I hope you could help me out As requested hereby a gist with my files I hope that somebody can help me to figure this out This seems to be out of date with the current version of Laravel Zero There is no appDefaultCommandphp Creating one doesnt work so I moved it to appCommands php application rename weather is deprecated should be apprename When I ran php weather this error occurred Symfony Component Debug Exception FatalThrowableError Class NunoMaduro ZeroFramework Commands AbstractCommand not found After attempting to adapt to how I think its supposed work creating new command called WeatherCommand adding zttp use statement and running php weather weather I received this error BadMethodCallException Method App Commands WeatherCommandgetContainer does not exist I give up Hi I installed the barryvdhlaravelidehelper according to recommendations from issue I have dependencies require php barryvdhlaravelidehelper doctrinedbal illuminatedatabase illuminateview laravelzeroframework When I try run php myapp idehelpergenerate M I got error Call to undefined method Illuminate Support Facades Authguard Detail stderr Please tell me can I use idehelper Thanks Hello I installed laravel scout Then followed instructions here then php appname scoutimport gives me an error There are no commands defined in the config namespace Note When publishing php artisan vendorpublish providerLaravel Scout ScoutServiceProvider nothing happened although I got the message that it was successfully published Maybe I need to add something in my configappphp file Thanks If i run php application appbuild application I get the follwing in return Build version unreleased Moving application to production mode Compile into a single file ErrorException renameC Users Gebruiker Documents warror applicationpharC Users Gebruiker Documents warror builds application Het systeem kan het opgegeven bestand niet vinden code at C Users Gebruiker Documents warror vendor illuminate filesystem Filesystemphp return bool public function movepath target return renamepath target Copy a file to a new location Exception trace renameC Users Gebruiker Documents warror applicationphar C Users Gebruiker Documents warror builds application C Users Gebruiker Documents warror vendor illuminate filesystem Filesystemphp Illuminate Filesystem FilesystemmoveC Users Gebruiker Documents warror applicationphar C Users Gebruiker Documents warror builds application C Users Gebruiker Documents warror vendor illuminate support Facades Facadephp Please use the argument v to see more details
