mariobehling betterclever Hi Is this module being maintained in any way I see some old bugreports but no response Were compiling a list of MM modules over here Cheers WARNING Could not load config file Starting with default configuration Error found Error Cannot find module distmainindexjs after running codenpm installcodeit throws error codeERROR in atloader srcmainstateslisteningstatets TS Argument of type defaultEncoding string is not assignable to parameter of type string flags string encoding string fd number mode number autoClose boolean st Type defaultEncoding string has no properties in common with type flags string encoding string fd number mode number autoClose boolean start num npm ERR code ELIFECYCLE npm ERR errno npm ERR MMMSUSIAI webpack webpack config configwebpackmainjs progress profile bail displayerrordetails npm ERR Exit status npm ERR npm ERR Failed at the MMMSUSIAI webpack script npm ERR This is probably not a problem with npm There is likely additional logging output above npm ERR A complete log of this run can be found in npm ERR homenileshnpmlogs T Zdebuglog npm ERR code ELIFECYCLE npm ERR errno npm ERR MMMSUSIAI build rimraf dist npm run webpack npm run tsc npm ERR Exit status npm ERR npm ERR Failed at the MMMSUSIAI build script npm ERR This is probably not a problem with npm There is likely additional logging output above npm ERR A complete log of this run can be found in npm ERR homenileshnpmlogs T Zdebuglog npm ERR code ELIFECYCLE npm ERR errno npm ERR MMMSUSIAI postinstall npm run build npm ERR Exit status npm ERR npm ERR Failed at the MMMSUSIAI postinstall script npm ERR This is probably not a problem with npm There is likely additional logging output above code We can use React with Typescript to create UI for MagicMirror It will allow us to manage components like Animation UI Maps and RSS List more efficiently Google TTS can be added with the help of package It can be added as default TTS since web and android also use the same Currently the speech recognition is done in the following manner Record user voice and save it to a file Stop recording when silence detected or timeout Send Audio for speech recognition Display the transcribed text for audio and send it to SUSI Server This can be improved to support Live Speech recognition like Webchat Client and Android Client in which intermediate results are also show to the users I found some strategies to incorporate same feature in MagicMirror Webspeech API Webspeech API could be used for free just like in the webclient in electron app like our MagicMirror Module using However google recently has removed support for it and it could not be used anymore Google Cloud Speech API Google Cloud Speech API with streaming results is an alternative which can be used However free tier for Google Cloud Speech supports only minutes of usage which will be easily exhausted Microsoft Bing Speech API Microsoft Bing provides speech api with intermediate result support Its free tier support transactions per month around minutes which is more than sufficient In my opinion Microsoft Bing Speech API is the best choice for now We can add support for more services if it doesnt give satisfactory results Current Behavior Currently only Text Responses ie answer action type is being used Rest of the SUSI Response Action Types are ignored Expected Behavior Parse all the action types in SUSI Response from SUSI Server correctly Do you want to work on this Yes I am working on it
