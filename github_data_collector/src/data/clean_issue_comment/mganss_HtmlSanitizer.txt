Hi Im passing to the sanitizer some allowed tags sanitizerAllowedTagsAddDate sanitizerAllowedTagsAddTime After applying the sanitizer on self closed tags I have these results var content DateTime Default Format datetimetimedate XhtmlFormat datetime date This was the format I was expecting DateTime or DateDateTimeTime I tried the same string in both online tool as well as in the net fiddle both seems to give a different result html string img alt a src a title iframefoo quotscriptalertdocumentdomainscriptiframe online tool output img alt quota quot src quota quot title quot ltiframefoo quot gt fiddler output img alta srca title ltiframefoo quot gt ltscript gtalertdocumentdomain ltscript gt ltiframe gt using the dll in code is also not sanitizing the HTML like the onlinetool need some info what should be done in code to get an output as onlinetool When sanitizing an HTML string that contains an ampamp this is as expected unchanged However when the same thing is done for ampatilde the returned value is This is from what I can tell incorrect behavior I havent extensively tested this but it also seems to occur for ampdeg elements and probably for many more items i dont want to filter my uediter content but after used htnlsantizer ifram tag block by that Ive seen people discussing something similar in other issue posts but not exactly My question is whether it is safe particularly in regard to XSS to allow data URIs within img tags I believe Im going to allow imgs from http and https Are imgs from a Data URI any less safe than imgs from httphttps How would I go about enabling this behavior of data URIs in img tags Not sure why this causes a connection reset one the demo page username Cscript Ealert XSSmattINFOSEC C Fscript E For iframe img and others tags with URL to make allowed list of domens For example I need to allow only iframes pointed to youtube and block others Or to allow images only from MyDomain Please keep in mind that the old NET and Silverlight targets are dropped AngleSharp now targets NET Standard Also you might need to install AngleSharpCss package Migration guide hi i think just found the following issue in combination with a link and summernote visit if you dont know what summernote is the href in question is when you pass that href into summernote by clicking link in the toolbar summernote creates the following htmlelement a href targetblankevil linka after POSTing summernotes content to the server it seems like that link doesnt get sanitized by the GanssXSSHtmlSanitizerSanitizemethod thanks for HtmlSanitizer btw its a great tool love it Iam a bit sad that I have to open this issue see also AngleSharp was promising but Its still not stable Too many breaking changes IMO Too many issues related to AngleSharp the development of AngleSharp stalled Even critical fixes took ages So I propose to replace AngleSharp with eg Html Agility Pack please note they dont follow semver andor make the current implementation Parser independent so we could inject parsers like HAP or AngleSharp Just let me know what you think
