When you click the channel icon of the current video to show the channels video list without stopping the playing video the app goes to the home screen while the current videos audio is still going on No able to return to the video I need to close the app It happens randomly but always after some time from the app start eg after video viewed My TV is a Sony Bravia AG Note I am a developer so I can do some technical test if you need Hey if I start SmartYouTubeTV with the Alexa remote or use it to search something everything works fine with the additional helper tool But it doesnt work if I use my Amazon Echo which I prefer to control the Fire TV with Everytime I use the Echo Fire TV tries to start download the native YouTube app Hi I found this strange bug The sound where firestick TV k will not play sounds from app only and only when it uses an echo device as a bluetooth speaker I have tested this with other bluetooth devices and it works fine Important to notice that other apps within firestick dont face this problem Some background information I have a monitor with no speakers and I like watching YouTube videos to sleep the preferable setup for me includes no ads low brightness and low energy consumption Echo dot is a perfect speaker for this as I have to leave it on and it doesnt require batteries also I can adjust volume by voice control Videos buffer for a long time and do not play Any solution for this Thanks in advance Ive been trying to play my saved playlists but for some reason videos are just stuck buffering Initially I just skipped to the next episode and it would be ok but at this point even that doesnt guarantee anything Now I cant even play a full playlist without it buffering the videos although there are some within the playlist that can play I know itll eventually start trouble Ive tried resetting the app deleting my history restarting my Firestick checking my internet connection but nothings doing it I checked on my laptop to see if there was something going on but it worked perfectly I even updated it but its still having problems The most confusing thing is that it plays other playlists that I dont go to all that much but itll buffer with playlists that I usually watch Hi I am trying to build the APK using android studio but i keep getting errors First error i get is error incompatible types int cannot be converted to String in SmartPreferencesjava if i fix this i am getting another errors am i missing something thanks When playing videos like this one in HDR quality the picture is too bright or washedout The Googles YouTube application for Android TV currently does not offer an option to play videos in HDR quality at all despite the fact that it used to work correctly a few days ago Now it plays all videos only in SDR quality As a result I cannot compare the results directly I am not sure if the problem is with some video metadata not being recognized correctly or with those metadata not being present at all in the video When I try to switch to x vp quality I get the error androidmediaMediaCodecerror Tried it with both PRO Launcher the LITE Launcher crashes after start both Version with FireTV K Hi Im test your last version But exo player dont fix complete When I play video sound and picture not match Please fix it Thank a lot With the Pro Main and Alt version controlling the casted video from smartphone is not working The controlbar stopps after seconds With Lite its working fine but sadly there is no autoframerate
