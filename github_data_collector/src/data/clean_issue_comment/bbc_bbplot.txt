Hi Ive been using this package today to try it out and I am very happy with it I have a logo image that I want to add to my plot I used the logoimagepath option in the finaliseplot function The logo is added to the plot but it is not complete it is cutted on the right side Is there a way to have it complete without having to change the dimensions of the image Thank you Carlotta Cool book Just a suggestion here ggplotbardf aesx reordercountry lifeExp y lifeExp fill country Mauritius geomcol scalefillmanualvalues cdddddd A guide F geomhlineyintercept size colour bbcstyle coordflip labstitleReunion is highest subtitle Highest African life expectancy themepanelgridmajorx elementlinecolorcbcbcb panelgridmajory elementblank Downloading GitHub repo bbcbbplotmaster Error in untar tarfile files list exdir incomplete block on file Windows does not have its own Helvetica font which results in warnings when using bbcstyle on a typical windows computer Running windowsFontsHelvetica TT Arial at the start of the script will use the windows default of treating Helvetica as Arial and avoid the warnings This pull request is related to the issue It modifies the bbcstyle function in order to include two arguments Font it allows changing the font type This is especially relevant in Windows machines since Helvetica isnt a Windows core font Offset Due to size differences while changing the font type this argument add or subtract the offset amount to the current font size Windows machines do not support Helvetica font type so I had to make modifications to the bbcstyle in a separate ggplot function It would be cool to have maybe a font argument that defaults to Helvetica but would allow others to change the font name Once the font changes there may be some sizing differences so it would also be cool to create an offset size to do a plus or minus the current font sizes used in your function bbcstyle functionfont Helvetica offset which would allow me to use it like this bbcstyleArial When finalizing a plot it would be nice to be able to pull a logo from a URL This would make it easier to share code examples without first requiring users to download the logos if I use the function bbcstyle Chinese characters cannot show properly in the final graphic even when I add themetext elementtextfamily Kai Delete bbcstyle can work properly So I think there may be some problem with bbcstyle when using Chinese characters I was reading your and this is pretty great but theres an easy step that you could take that would add simplicity and consistency to the plot making process Take a look at RColorBrewer it lets you very simply to call out colors as per a variety of themes perhaps something like this could be done w BBC colours This way one would never have to read a theme sheet it would be built right in Helpful
