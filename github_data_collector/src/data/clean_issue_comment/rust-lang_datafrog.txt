 The compiler team is working on a standard policy around its external crates see we need to bring this crate into conformance though the policy is not yet finalized so its not clear what this means We dont presently have any unit testsfor anything I think we should create a base layer of unit tests where we generate some simple operations and some random inputs and check that they get the correct result using some kind of naive computation to act as an oracle Roughly as described here It could be interesting to have simple statistics for example behind a feature flag of the number of tuples and the time it took to merge and create them for Relations andof Variables There are commented out Drop impls in the code eg here as an example of the way to add the final tuple counts statistic Similarly a Duration could be added to the merged relations updating it in the operator functions to display the time it took to create those tuples as described a bit more here by Frank
