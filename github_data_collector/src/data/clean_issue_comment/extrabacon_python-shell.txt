Hi Greetings Thank you for making this awesome integration I have a need for using Python Does this package support that version of Python If so how would I point the node pythonshell to execute a specific interpreter to ensure I am not going to run Python My programming environment VScode nodejs v vuecli X and some pluginelectronbuildervuetify childprocess spawn is not a function when I face this problefirst of allI try to fix by myself I found that in es value different from function so I changed like thisin my testjs file let foo PythonShellrunpymyscriptpy null function err if err throw err consolelogfinished function foo consolelogthere is testjswelcome var a my name is xiaoming export foo a foo I ensured my es grammer then I try to do something python code in the myscriptpy which printhello python I get this picture I found this problem then fond this Spawn is a construct of nodejs React as a framework does not have the method This library is to be used in server side nodejs You can expose a http api which can be triggered via react The http api can then trigger the library in nodejs server I know Spawn cant run in Vuecli without nodejs Is there some ways to use Spawn in vuejs I need nodejs run in client and invoke python script I am trying to run the example found in the readme and I receive the following error eventsjs throw er Unhandled error event Error spawn py ENOENT at ProcessChildProcesshandleonexit internalchildprocessjs at onErrorNT internalchildprocessjs at processTicksAndRejections internalprocesstaskqueuesjs Emitted error event on ChildProcess

path is there a way to check if a python path is valid let PythonShell requirepythonshell let path requirepath PythonShellrunpathjoindirname pyengineviewpy null function errresult if err throw err consolelogfinished consolelogresult So here I can see the output of the Python script with consolelogresult I want to store this result which is coming from a Python script via print method and use it on NodeJS part Since this result is in runs scope how can I assign it to a variable Its not particularly about pythonshell but Ill be really glad if someone could help me Currently pythonshell is working in python But I need to import a package thats only available for Python how can I run pythonshell in python Thank You
