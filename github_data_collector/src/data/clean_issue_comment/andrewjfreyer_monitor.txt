RebecaiPhone Apple Inc What could be causing this This happens to me from time to time but restarting monitor fixes the problem Hi I am using monitorsh for home assistant For this I created a docker container out of monitorsh The scripts runs fine for a while then it just stops doing anything No further logging no updates within mqtt If I check the pids file and compare it with the running processes it looks that a few of the internal startet processes are no longer running Any idea what I can do Lukas The walkthrough should be updated to account for the buster version of rasbain Sorry I didnt know where to put this Hi Great tool Just starting to use it It would be awesome if you could support HA MQTT Discovery as outlined here Trying to get this set up with Cloud MQTT and keep getting the following error warning mqtt broker refused connection check username password and host address I have started the whole process from scratch twice have the correct username and password and still cannot have any luck Suggestions appreciated I have monitorsh working on a raspberry pi zero w and it is detecting my phone well Im running it with r a Now Id like to also have it recognize my electric bike which has a VESC that speaks BLE so this should work I got the MAC address and added it to knownstaticaddresses just like my phone but it does not seem to be picked up My knownstaticaddresses looks like this obfuscating actual MAC addresses phone ebike When I look at the log that monitorsh outputs the ebike is consistenly failed to recognize with confidence However whats weird is that when the ebike is off then I see the following output CMDNAME ebike Unknown But when I turn the ebike on ie its bluetooth module comes online I see CMDNAME VESC BLE UART Unknown Note that VESC BLE UART is the name of the BLE device in the electric bike eg when I connect to the ebike with my phone so somehow monitorsh must have learned that name However the confidence for ebike stays What am I doing wrong Hi there I installed the monitor service according to the manual If i do a manual search with hci tool I can see the TrackR But if I enter the device in knowndevices no results are found pipidsmrmonitor sudo hcitool lescan LE Scan D DD FDF unknown D DD FDF unknown DDBE A unknown DDBE A unknown FA D D BE tkr FA D D BE unknown FA D D BE tkr id FA D D BE confidence

what I want to achieve and from the readme I see youve done a he of a job creating this nice script I got this up and running on my RPi b currently pcs of Zero W on the way by DHL and got MQTT installed configured and finally up and running puuuh Im currently in a steep learning curve regarding both MQTT and Monitor at the same time and also trying to understand the readme correctly Still I have some questions which are unclear to me I want to detect any MAC address passing a Monitor station to know if and whom was in that particular room It should detect both macs fromknownstaticaddresses and unknownguests Can I do that and what switch do I need to run Monitor with Can I run the script with multiple switches If yes how spcifically do I update the script to boot up and run with these switches For presence of the family arriving and departing what switch is best for this And can this be combined with question In advance thanks for taking the time to answer my questions I havent dug into it enough to see how much effort it would be but Im hoping that we can have KNOWN DEVICE STATES push out messages about the known beacons in addition to the known static addresses Ive currently got home assistant pushing out a KNOWN DEVICE STATES when it starts up which makes it so that home assistant gets the current status of the known static addresses ie our phones but it doesnt report anything on our bluetooth trackers which are in the known beacon addresses our cheap bluetooth trackers Im not sure if its just because we are using cheap trackers or if its just normal for these type of devices but I couldnt get them working in the known static addresses because they dont respond to the name query like our phones do
