All of my images are removed after minify along with robotstxt Its not easy to manually transfer images because I have folder of images for each blog post All folders themself are missing after minify Is there option to keep them Adds more options to installsh mainly Bash completion directory pseudodetection Possibility to use custom bash completion directory Get completion file from a url always uptodate Enables static linking option using CGOENABLED when static is passed as first argument Strip binary after compilation Add binary minifiers for SFNT formats TTF OTF WOFF WOFF EOT and image formats PNG JPEG This issue is similar to but for fontawesome or similar icons Made with i classfa fahearti and i classfa facoffeei is converted to Made with i classfa faheartiand i classfa facoffeei How can I preserve the space between the hearticon and the word and Also see x delRename MinifyMimetype to MinifyBytes or similar and accept byte instead of ioReader make all other functions that explicitly convert to bufferNewReaderb to use this new function Keep the original MinifyMimetype but mark as deprecateddel unlikely due to insignificant performance gain x SVG paths use S Q T L or remove if some control points coincide for curved paths x CSS shorten dimensions for example grad deg But also ms s and ms s or s ms x CSS take care of comma separations in background x CSS filter declaration blocks for duplicate property definitions ie remove earlier backgroundposition if either background or backgroundposition is set afterwards CSS remove from where possible CSS minify aggregate declarations better such as grid transition CSS find where the initial value is shorter than initial CSS remove dimension for zero values if possible CSS check if remove duplicate property definitions can be removed see multiple background with mozlineargradient ielineargradient CSS add implementation for more functions and value types for example calc min max clamp transform related functions in with lineargradient ie the gradient type and more CSS find more optimizations from and x delcmd refactor and separate reusable codedel x delcmd allow options input from command line config file and environment variablesdel Hi I just noticed that if I have a Type field in my data struct and use minify for my go template files it lowercases Type So this html option value if eq Type selected end Foooption Becomes this html option value if eq type selected end Foooption And it seems like its not possible to use texttemplate and minify for a javascript file together does it I know thats probably quite an edge case EDIT Just tested this doesnt work unfortunately but I could still use minify as a package and minify the generates JS so thats not too much of a problem for my case Not sure if its on your road map but source maps would be nice Competing tools already support them Personally I dont care so much about CSS source maps but its pretty vital for Javascript debugging Unfortunately source map generation can be tricky especially when merging multiple files or going through several layers coffescript javascript merged javascript compressed javascript Write a JS parser to enable Usage of ASI automatic semicolon insertion to reduce newlines and semicolons Shorten variable names and function parameters when possible ie Closure Compiler simple mode prohibit eval and toString see Correct for Still keep the current fast JSMininspired version It would be awesome if youd consider donating through Patreon or PayPal so that I can free up time to implement a much improved JS minifier
