We would like icons for the different engines Basically small x px icons that can symbolize the engine in the selection screen The Audio Effects so far Reverb and Chorus soon also Delay are also shown in a different place so these have the highest priority We need graphics for the external input It is quite simple and should probably be dominated by some nonfunctional design Nevertheless it needs to convey some information It can operate in modes disabled stereo and dual mono Depending on the mode different controls are available as seen in the pictures below Where the active send in the last picture runs over L and R The icon design for the external input is a stylized jack which could serve as initial inspiration for the screen as well x Set ALSA output volume x Set ALSA input gain integrate ottoinput into the main software And with lower priority Wifi in Settings Set datetime in settings Still a work in progress I also cleaned up the enginemanager process call a bit Most important question is that it seems the external input from RtAudio is always mono I would expect it to be stereo whenever possible Right now we are using NanoVG which is not actively maintained We would like to change this to a more modern alternative such as Skia All calls to NanoVG is wrapped in the small wrapper NanoCanvas so it should be simple to change out the backend without having to rewrite any graphics code in OTTO We can then extend the wrapper to expose the more advanced features of Skia We need UI for our ARP Engine It is a fairly regular arpeggiator with the following features PlayModes up down updown downup updowninc downupinc manual chord random Octave modes boring unison fifth unison Note length percentage of time to hold notes Subdivision of master clock quarter quartertriplet eighth eighthtriplet sixteenth We probably want to visualize the notes in some way since some combinations of play modesoctave modes are quite complex Inspiration Source Abletons arpeggiator manual UIManager should have a stack of ScreenEnum which lets you push and pop momentary screens It will make mainly sends and master a bit nicer to work with in the EngineManager We need new graphics for the sends This is a screen that all things that make sound has synth line in drum channels etc and it determines how much volume to send to the dry output the dry pan as well as how much to send to each effect bus FX and FX These used to be set directly but we have decided to change the control scheme to DryWet mix Dry Pan Wet Balance between FX and FX Overall volume affecting everything else The colour used for each control is still undecided so we can go with something that looks good on the screen The screen used to be like this sends The mix label was dry before but this picture was taking while reimplementing the screen The screen accomplishes its task in a very functional but not very flashy way We need to change this to reflect the new controls Functional is probably the way to go with this screen but minimizing the use of numbers is always good For graphical elements I am thinking something that the mix between dry signal ans sends to the effect busses Then maybe an arrow the turns between the FX and FX logos for the Wat Balance If that is not too stupid The Dry Pan has remained the same so no reason to change it unless you think of something better The last element is something clearly understood as volume Id like to write a clangbased custom static analysis tool to add our own ottoattributes These should be to enforce things like Checking action handlers Make sure functions on the audio thread only do things functions on the audio thread are allowed to do And more This checker should then run on travis to be part of our regular CI It might make sense to wait for c to do this
