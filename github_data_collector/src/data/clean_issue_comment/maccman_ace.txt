maccman I was wondering if you could offer some comparison to express I asked TJ on IRC his thoughts kuhrt tjholowaychuk do you have an opinion on Ace PM tjholowaychuk i wouldnt recommend it because of the nodefiber stack sizes PM you would use a lot of memory PM if we had growable stacks then yeah sure PM kuhrt you dont mean this line do you PM Node v is required as well as npm Ace will run on older versions of Node but will crash under heavy load due to a bug in V now fixed PM tjholowaychuk no PM kuhrt ok PM tjholowaychuk just that stack sizes are pretty large PM i forget the exact number PM but basically youd run out of memory fast if you had a lot of concurrent users PM dylang has joined the channel PM tjholowaychuk well requests PM kuhrt I thought the project looked somewhat ineteresting fun to try maybe at least whats different than express concepts etc PM but the last commit was months agoo PM so it seems kind of dead PM tjholowaychuk stack per request is great but not unless the entire community embraces coroutines PM which has been killed off many times PM in the mailing list etc PM kuhrt hm PM TimeTurner has left IRC PM tjholowaychuk so basically its between using lots of memory sync or less memory async PM kuhrt ok PM tjholowaychuk and obviously other things like aces static file server being really poor but they could use send now PM to get all the features that connectstatic provides under the hood PM but yeah thats the fundamental tradeoff with multiple stacks unless you can grow like erlang PM kuhrt tjholowaychuk by grow you mean paralellize PM multicore stuff PM tjholowaychuk just grow like a byte stack can grow to k or k if it needs more room PM otherwise youre just wasting ram PM kuhrt does your critique extend to strata or was that design choice at the Acelevel or do you even know haha talking to you like youre the author PM tjholowaychuk the default stack size for them is kb PM so yeah tons of memory PM strata is the rack thing PM kuhrt yup PM tjholowaychuk more like connect PM and ace is more like express PM kuhrt yup PM tjholowaychuk so for concurrency requests PM kuhrt did you like anything in strata missing in connect PM tjholowaychuk you would use PM mb of ram PM on the stacks alone PM vs PM well vs nodes single stack PM which may or may not be a problem depending on the app Theres already a widelyused ACE in the JS world Now might be a good time to pick a different name
