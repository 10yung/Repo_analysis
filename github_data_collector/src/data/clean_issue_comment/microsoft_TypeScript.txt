also the Nightly version in the playground TypeScript Version Nightly Search Terms optional chaining default parameters a is not defined Code ts const a d unknown undefined undefined b ad Expected behavior This should run without error Actual behavior This throws an error ReferenceError a is not defined Playground Link link Related Issues na Heres the code it compiles to now for illustration js use strict const a undefined b a a null a void void ad var a This error happens because a is used before its defined TypeScript adds a var a inside the function body but because the assignment occurs in the parameter a is not in scope and the assignment fails Im not sure what the preferred solution would be here I solved it in decaffeinate by using a helper function though I never really liked that solution This is a dupe of but that issue was marked as closedfixed and locked why Its not It should be reopened and actually fixed Its also unrelated to npm link IMPORTANT my e work directory is

master branch Youve successfully run gulp runtests locally There are new or updated unit tests validating the change Refer to CONTRIBUTINGMD for more details Fixes Open issues How to handle interfaces that cant be implemented in JS for example those with index signatures Fix code fix that implements missing interface members currently it does not show up but it would be nice if it worked for JS as well Add more tests sandersn For I would suppress these errors for JS For do you think it is worth showing the fix Also maybe we could have a typescriptbot pack of this so TimvdLippe can maybe give it a try One issue unrelated to implements necessarily is that method in the classes used as interfaces in TimvdLippe example dont have any return statement so any return type will cause an error Support for abstract was taken out of the scope of but maybe adding support for abstract could be useful to suppress these errors Using tsignore might also be a simpler workaround Followup on and There are more to come
