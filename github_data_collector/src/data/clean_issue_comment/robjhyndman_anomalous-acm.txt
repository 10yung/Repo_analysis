Hi Is there a way to detect outliers taking in account more than the first PC For example PC PC PC PC if I realise that I need to use all of them to cover a good enough cumulated variance of my original dataset Would it be possible to modify your source code to make it work Tx Hi there I am trying to run the example stated in README file and got the results z tsmatrixrnorm ncol freq y tsmeasuresz biplotfeaturesy Error in pcaPPPCAprojnaomitx k scale sd center mean object CpcaProjup not found anomalyy Error in pcaPPPCAprojnaomitx k center mean scale sd object CpcaProjup not found Google indeed gave me quite strange results on that all pointing to fixing Win bugs etc Hi When using the anomalous package on a single time series the following error was encountered It requires at least two timeseries to work properly Error in applynay all dimX must have a positive length Thanks
