can we get some info where we put the JDE on a nonwindows environment since visual studio is available for other platforms such as Linux OSX Update bits so that they do not immediately call Registry on non windows systems and when resolving paths do not yield null because Windows Environment variables are not set I dont see any reference to decompile a silverlight xap file can you provide an example of the command It appears the reconstruction of foreach loops fails when there is a return statement inside the loop body This is only my best guess of what appears to cause the problem there may be other cases ie there might be a more general cause for this rather the return itself Repro case C private bool TestMethod Liststring moo new Liststring foreachstring s in moo if sStartsWithtest ConsoleWriteLinemoo return false return true Decompiler output note that reconstruction of foreach failed C private bool TestMethod bool flag ListstringEnumerator enumerator new ListstringGetEnumerator try while enumeratorMoveNext if enumeratorCurrentStartsWithtest continue ConsoleWriteLinemoo flag false return flag return true finally IDisposableenumeratorDispose return flag If we remove the return false line from the repro case and decompile again then the foreach is correctly recovered C private bool TestMethod foreach string str in new Liststring if strStartsWithtest continue ConsoleWriteLinemoo return true Is JustDecompiler able to batch decompile or decompile multiple net assemblies in parallel We have been noticing that occasionally JustDecompile is unable to decompile CCLI assemblies like WPFs PresentationCoredll Initially we thought that it might have been a compiler or a linker bug ILspy also had trouble decompiling the DLL see but turns out that a the DLL is fine and b the PDB is what JustDecompile seems to have a problem with and c the PDB is also well formed per folks in the C compilerlinker teams We also found that dotPeek is able to handle these assemblies ok Any ideas on what is going on The error we see is this JustDecompile supports only valid CLR assemblies Not supported files notbadpresentationcorezip Decompilation of a attribute with a Type parameter where the parameter value has one or more null elements causes a NullReferenceException The following code illustrates this issue csharp using System namespace ClassLibrary class FooAttribute Attribute public FooAttributeType types Foonew Type typeofstring null public class Class Opening the assembly produced by this code works okay but attempting to view the decompiled code for Class results in the following output in the code view panel csharp using System namespace ClassLibrary Foonew Type typeofString typeof Current member type ClassLibrary Class File path C Users andrewcooper source repos ClassLibrary ClassLibrary bin Debug netstandard ClassLibrary dll Product version Object reference not set to an instance of an object at Exception IMemberDefinition in C DeveloperToolingJDAgent work s OpenSource CecilDecompiler Languages BaseLanguageWritercsline at in C DeveloperToolingJDAgent work s OpenSource CecilDecompiler Languages BaseLanguageWritercsline at VisitICodeNode in C DeveloperToolingJDAgent work s OpenSource CecilDecompiler Ast BaseCodeVisitorcsline at TelerikJustDecompilerLanguagesBaseImperativeLanguageWritern ICodeNode at TelerikJustDecompilerLanguagesBaseImperativeLanguageWriter in C DeveloperToolingJDAgent work s OpenSource CecilDecompiler Languages BaseImperativeLanguageWritercsline at TelerikJustDecompilerLanguagesBaseImperativeLanguageWriter Action in C DeveloperToolingJDAgent work s OpenSource CecilDecompiler Languages BaseImperativeLanguageWritercsline at TelerikJustDecompilerLanguagesBaseImperativeLanguageWriterVisitICodeNode in C DeveloperToolingJDAgent work s OpenSource CecilDecompiler Languages BaseImperativeLanguageWritercsline at WriteInternalIMemberDefinition in C DeveloperToolingJDAgent work s OpenSource CecilDecompiler Languages BaseLanguageWritercsline at TypeDefinition in C DeveloperToolingJDAgent work s OpenSource CecilDecompiler Languages NamespaceImperativeLanguageWritercsline at TypeDefinition in C DeveloperToolingJDAgent work s OpenSource CecilDecompiler Languages NamespaceImperativeLanguageWritercsline at in C DeveloperToolingJDAgent work s UI JustDecompileCodeViewer Writers TypeDefinitionCodeWritercsline mailto JustDecompilePublicFeedbacktelerikcom its be great if the software can create the project inside folder based on the name of the binary Im using JustDecompiles command line interface to decompile an application with around interdependent assemblies It would be nice if I could generate one solution containing projects that depend on each other This would make browsing the generated code in Visual Studio easier
