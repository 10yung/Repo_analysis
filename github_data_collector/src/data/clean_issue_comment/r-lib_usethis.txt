Now that messaging routes through rlanginform the function name catline is somewhat misleading This is an internal matter but its something anyone developing in usethis might encounter So I recently learned that one can include a DESCRIPTION file outside of packages its something I perceive as good practice However to the best of my knowledge usethis does not currently support that r r usethisusedescription Error Path mycurrentdirectory does not appear to be inside a project or package In addition Warning message In pathfilebasepath restarting interrupted promise evaluation Would additional edit functions for configuration files be in scope for usethis I have in mind editodbcini editbashprofile editbashrc editnetrc Im happy to contribute the changes if they are Moving the test helpers scopedtemporarything and friends to R enables reuse of them by packages which build upon usethis to facilitate tests of these packages Because of their rather internal nature they are not exported which does not pose a problem for reuse by other since tests are allowed to use unexported functions closes So that if youve accidentally made some changes in the wrong branch but havent committed them you can switch to the correct branch without using the command line I am using the usethis package as a basis for another package it is btw a great and remarkably easy to extend usethis However as I started to write tests that involve testing whether files are created etc I had to copy the test helper from usethis teststestthathelperR into my package It would be great if you could export them as functions as they are really useful for extending usethis fixes usedevpackage can only handle dev packages installed from github remotes A simple change to the packageremote function would make usedevpackage work with any remote type that has a Remotes field of the form RemoteTypeRemoteUsernameRemoteRepo In particular this would cover package dependencies from GitLab and Bitbucket Something like this R packageremote functionpackage desc descdescpackage package remoteinfo descgetcRemoteType RemoteUsername RemoteRepo supportedremotes cgithub gitlab bitbucket isvalidremote rlangisstringremoteinfo RemoteType remoteinfo RemoteType in supportedremotes if isvalidremote uistopuivaluepackage was not installed from a supported remote type gluegluedataaslistremoteinfo RemoteTypeRemoteUsernameRemoteRepo I dont really see a reason to restrict the remotes to github gitlab and bitbucket though I would just check that RemoteType RemoteUsername and RemoteRepo are not NA The code above would add an explicit github prefix to github remotes but this could obviously be avoided IMO usethis is githubcentric enough as it is so I would leave the prefix for clarity This is related to to the extent that it is about extending the functionalities beyond github but this is a simpler and probably more common use case Functions that edit packages READMERmd like uselifecyclebadge result in garbled Unicode characters For example after running uselifecyclebadge a pronunciation guide fo na if in my package description became fo na if fixes Tested it on a case where the remote branch was already deleted but the local branch was still present worked
