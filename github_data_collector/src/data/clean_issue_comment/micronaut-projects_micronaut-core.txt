We are using this method in our custom swagger processor inspired on the openapi annotation processor provided out the box However the method always returns a JavaClassElement instance which breaks all the swagger annotation processing logic which performs instanceof EnumElement on the returned type Perhaps it is possible for this method to be made more intelligent to return instances of an appropriate type This likely affects the outthebox swagger annotation processor because I believe the piece of code that is failing to handle Enum types is from the original codebase Method from
