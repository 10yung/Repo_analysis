getssl Please consider adding SSHOPTS also to scp commands or something as SCPOPTS if not the same meaning It is very convenient necessary sometimes to be able to run scp as scp q i identityfile from to You could also add SCPOPTS to the defaults and Set SCPOPTS to use an alternate identity file for sshscp command SCPOPTSi rootsshidentityfile to the writedomaintemplate function Thank you Should probably be fixed up Ive only hacked up dkerr s version for acmesh to work on my local instance It assumes youre using curl I didnt bother stealing acmeshs whole library of functions
