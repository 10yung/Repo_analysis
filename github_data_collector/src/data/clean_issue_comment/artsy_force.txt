This is an automatically generated release PR This can be merged along with the Reaction bump from when were ready to launch eessex and I have been pairing on this This spike sets up a pattern for Cypressbased smoke tests within Force It grew out of this conversation at the very tail end of Hackathon in which we noted the frustrations of the current Nightmarebased workflow Note that while this approach avoids some of those pain points it does so partly by eschewing fixtures in favor of real network requests So tradeoffs But this would enable us to deprecate Nightmare and converge on Cypress which we seem to prefer though neither lib is currently included in our tech radar related Paired with eessex JIRA AUCT This WIP PR is an attempt to readd our sourcemapsendingtosentry script which may

trigger a request for Renovate to run again on this repository details API logs show mostly empty user agent values It would be helpful if Force identified itself in its requests to the API with the conventional UserAgent header While working on improving the default inquiry message for on loan works I discovered that there are two places where these messages come from The first I found was here in force so I made this PR But then when anandaroop and I went to go smoke test it we realized that it wasnt actually fixing the problem That lead us to discover that this default message was actually coming from MP and that lead me to make this PR Once that was merged and deployed we saw that the default message was working as expected I assumed the next step would be to nuke that dead code in force but mzikherman helped me see that its actually used on the mobile side of things so we ended up merging so that the default would be correct there as well This was the pragmatic thing to do but what would have been even better would have been to refactor the mobile side of thing to use MP as well so that there is only one code path for computing these messages Im opening this ticket to highlight this need cc katarinabatina
