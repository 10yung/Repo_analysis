First of all its a great application thanks for creating it How to create resource like namespace wo leaving k s I tried to type s to invoke shell but the screen flashes and nothing happened I am not about to find info in any doc Any pointers img src alignright width heightauto br br br Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Kubernetes YAML is often extremely verbose Describe the solution youd like The k s YAML viewer could have a shortcut to toggle Koki Short syntax view This goes handinhand with k s making kubernetes resource discovery more approachable Describe alternatives youve considered It would be nice to see this integrated I am not sure if the k s plugin system currently allows for shelling out the the short binary with YAML contents to then view the simplified version It seems that the force delete option introduced after got broken somewhere In x and the option to force delete is there but it has no effect I can force graceperiod delete with kubectl of course Let me know if I need to add more details logs I know that k s can log some of its events but I never tried it img src alignright width heightauto br br br Describe the bug It would appear this bug has arisen as a result of the most recent changes adding the logic for detecting connectivity with the k s API server More specifically this has to do with the DialTimeout call that is made It should be noted that currently for my setup communication is achieved to the k s APIserver via ranchers proxy Based on the code changes I cant imagine this has any impact but its worth noting nonetheless To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Open k s session Enter a pod shell Exit from the container Attempt to display the YAML or Describe the pod may take a few tries K s should terminate the current session Expected behavior The session should not be terminated as there was not a connection lost to the apiserver Screenshots Versions please complete the following information OS OSX Mojave K s K s K S is released very often It would be nice if release contains a static symbolic link to latest release For example would currently point or redirect download Include full Apache license it was chopped All rights reserved is not a license presumably without CLA contributors keep their copyrights Label filter on pods works fine Trying to use the label filter command l keyvalue on nodes resources it doesnt seem be working the full list of nodes are always displayed without filter honoured Can we add the label filter support on nodes too Thanks A great tool img src alignright width heightauto br br br Describe the bug Unable to use h to go left when viewing long logs It looks like it is bound to the toggle header and left navigation options A quick way to reset the log viewer is to enable word wrapping and disabling it Am I missing something to switch between general and navigation key bindings To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Go to a pod instance that produces long logs Click l to view logs within k s Use l to scroll right Try to scroll left with h only to see it toggle the headers Expected behavior Have a way to navigate left and toggle headers separately while viewing logs Maybe h for header toggle and h for left navigation Screenshots h is listed under both general and navigation Versions please complete the following information OS OSX K s K s I know to pronounce K s as kubernetes How do you pronounce K s I am curious But also think it should be put into the README
