The problem was first found and I found the same problem exists in Reflexil My referencing assembly has type in an attribute class Test FaultContracttypeofTypeInAnotherAssembly public TestMethod Compiles to IL as method public hidebysig instance class Test TestMethod cil managed custom instance void SystemServiceModel SystemServiceModelFaultContractAttributectorclass mscorlib SystemType full type name with assembly and public key token here This public key token stays without any changes after removing strong name from the referencing assemblies Preventing it from loading Hello guys I think it will be useful If the Method Definition window had a way to search for specific operand Since I was looking for specific operand which is a label text value and I had to read the whole instructions of the method to find it reflexil Many thanks Hi Ive been using your plugin for Net reflector for some time now and I really like it saved me a lot still Im not sure if current version has option to export and later to import methods for example I have two dll files same app but feature removed with same code except for one method which contains over instructions so copying and pasting instructions is very hard job to do and mistakes can slip anywhere So you get my point So far I only found out that I can inject new method into class copy instruction from old dll and paste them and configure operand references because they got reset when copying I hope you can help me which would save me a huge amount of time Thank you Regards One can currently V set operand display base Which affects both operand and offset columns I suggest to split that into two items in the configuration window Create a separate offset display base Offset in HEX and operand in DEC would speed up my workflow Similar to when trying to Replace all with code I get the error An assembly with the same identity mscorlib Version cultureneutral PublicKey Tokenb a c e has already been imported Try removing one of the duplicate references capture This is a unity DLL so I tried loading in the bundled mscorlibdll and Systemdll as suggested in but got the same error So I tried removing my systems versions of those dlls but still got the same error Could it have something to do with this reference capture capture Also how do you change the return type of a method I see the parameters tab and a new parameter can be given the isReturnValue property but what name should it be given Great tool by the way thanks in advance for any help Reflexil works with Net Core Thanks An assembly with the same identity mscorlib Version Cultureneutral PublicKeyTokenb a c e has already been imported Try removing one of the duplicate references This is the error message It happens to me always when i try to modify some dll twice After clicking on this field and browsing its info with Reflexil and then saving the assembly no changes made D array is replaced by D array Specifications for both fields are exactly the same Array Default Default Is there any way to fix this Dll is here The original dll has Debug Directory PE section but after editing and Save As its gone so we cannot generate pdb files for those dlls Im using ILSpy Reflexil v
