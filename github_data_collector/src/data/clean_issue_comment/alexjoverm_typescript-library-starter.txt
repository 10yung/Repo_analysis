palmtree Right after running npm install and entering the library name this is what I got added packages from contributors and audited packages in s found vulnerabilities low moderate high run npm audit fix to fix them or npm audit for details Running npm audit fix fixed of vulnerabilities but still vulnerabilities required manual review and could not be updated package updates for vulnerabilities involved breaking changes use npm audit fix force to install breaking changes or refer to npm audit for steps to fix these manually Would be great to have zero vulnerabilities from the start Fixes I suggest using the ISC license instead of MIT Fixes The year in the license file is almost now stuckouttongueclosedeyes Hi I got an error when npm run build the message shown has nothing
