Hi do you know of any Python equivalents for this project I presume the CasADi interpolant can already be used in OpenOCL If yes would it be possible to introduce an example where lookup tables are used in the definition of the dynamic system dae or ode and path constraints First draft of the language is presented here We might also want a parser in a standalone language like C python or javascript ocml github project not up to date r solvercheckConstraintsig r solvercheckOdeig r solvercheck function pathcostschxzup chaddcosttermname x chcosttermname x end gridpoints linspace x linspace solverigxsetgridpoints x function pointcostsch gridpoint x if gridpoint shaddxx end end x Basic feasibility study for code generation of RT models using Matlab symbolics code generation using CasADi x Implement functions in OpenOCL to create export use RTB models testing documentation CostHandler as a struct chname var eg chregularizationuu OCML for feedback control
