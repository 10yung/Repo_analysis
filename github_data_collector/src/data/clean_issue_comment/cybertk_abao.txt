My Abao tests are not running upon running the test I get the message Found Hookfiles testsramltestmachineshooksjs But none of the tests run as they did before Nothing has changed about the hookfiles or the RAML Please advise what could have caused this issue As the tv package no longer seems to get any love last updated in Sep Ive looked around for a replacement Benchmarks show the ajv package to be an excellent candidate its about times faster than tv and passes all tests except one which no JS implementation can It also supports JSON Schema draft While not a dropin replacement its API is very similar in many respects to tv so hopefully minimal changes will be needed for the migration Your FOSSA integration was successful Attached in this PR is a badge and license report to track scan status in your README Below are docs for integrating FOSSA license checks into your CI CircleCI TravisCI Jenkins Other Greenkeeper s updated Terms of Service will come into effect on April th Let s get started with automated dependency management for abao muscle This pull request updates all your dependencies to their latest version Having them all up to date really is the best starting point for keeping up with new releases Greenkeeper will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in realtime but only after you merge this pull request Important Greenkeeper will only start watching this repository s dependency updates after you merge this initial pull request details summary Tests on this branch are failing Here s how to proceedsummary To solve the issue first find out which of the dependency s updates is causing the problem Then fix your code to accomodate the changes in the updated dependency nextupdate is a really handy tool to help you with this Then push your changes to this branch and merge it details details summary How to check the status of this repositorysummary Greenkeeper adds a badge to your README which indicates the status of this repository This is what your badge looks like right now pointright Greenkeeper badge details details summary How to ignore certain dependenciessummary You may have good reasons for not wanting to update to a certain dependency right now In this case you can change the dependency s version string in the packagejson file back to whatever you prefer To make sure Greenkeeper doesn t nag you again on the next update add a greenkeeperignore field to your packagejson containing a list of dependencies you don t want to update js packagejson greenkeeper ignore packagenames

until everything works again git commit m chore adapt code to updated dependencies git push origin greenkeeperinitial details details summary How do dependency updates work with Greenkeepersummary After you merge this pull request Greenkeeper will create a new branch whenever a dependency is updated with the new version applied The branch creation should trigger your testing services and check whether your code still works with the new dependency version Depending on the the results of these tests Greenkeeper will try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues so your dependencies remain working and uptodate diff underscore underscore The above example shows an inrange update is included in the old range because of the caret character When the test services report success Greenkeeper will silently delete the branch again because no action needs to be taken everything is fine However should the tests fail Greenkeeper will create an issue to inform you about the problem immediately This way you ll never be surprised by a dependency breaking your code As long as everything still works Greenkeeper will stay out of your way and as soon as something goes wrong you ll be the first to know diff lodash lodash In this example the new version is not included in the old range For version updates like these let s call them out of range updates you ll receive a pull request This means that you no longer need to check for new versions manually Greenkeeper will keep you up to date automatically These pull requests not only serve as reminders to update If you have solid tests and good coverage and the pull requests passes those tests you can very likely just merge it and release a new version of your software straight away shipit To get a better idea of which ranges apply to which releases check out the extremely useful semver calculator provided by npm details details summaryFAQ and helpsummary There is a collection of frequently asked questions If those don t help you can always ask the humans behind Greenkeeper details Good luck with your project and see you soon sparkles Your Greenkeeper bot palmtree Using abao to test my REST API which is running in the default Docker machine me abao myapiraml server dockermachine ip Hangs for s then abao exits and Im back at my prompt nothing output or printed by abao Even when I run with just the names option me abao myapiraml names it exits with no output If its failing or throwing an error its doing so silently so I have no good way to troubleshoot Initially some of my JSON schema were invalid and abao was correctly complaining so I know abao is working to that degree and I have now confirmed that all my JSON and RAML is valid We ought to fix the dependency versions so that future fresh builds do not pull unwanted breaking change package updates The node community is pretty inconsistent in maintaining SEMVERwhich we should follow and as such relying on wildcards such as and will bite us in the long run We should establish contributing guidelines and place them in a CONTRIBUTING file Leaving this open for discussion We should add a CHANGELOGmd to the project as it is the idiomatic way of displaying changes in a repository The releases are great and should tie into it Open for discussion of course In an effort to keep the codebase manageable with numerous contributors it would be helpful if we had a linter in place The obvious choice is ESLint followed by the specific style guide that we can start with and then customize accordingly Ill make some propositions Airbnb styleguide Prettier alongside the airbnb guide As ES brings most of Coffee Script features its time to roll it
