 timer Issue when the main timer the black one is set to more than hours the coundown timer the red one resets and starts counting up from see the screenshot Even if this doesnt break the work of the timer this is confusing Suggestion remove the countdown timers hour display limit and let it display time intervals exceeding hours for example Can we have hour mode with an AMPM symbol Perhaps a setting which allows to toggle between hour hour mode I want to issue a command on the terminal like so timer and the timer starts or resets to minutes It took me a while to figure out what was going on in the view hierarchy causing the clock to not get displayed on Mojave Ideally Id like to move to an approach that puts the clock in a more standard location in the view hierarchy that would be more robust to OS updates such as contentView But after experimenting for a while I dont have any clear idea of how to do that while maintaining the visual design and behavior So instead I was able to adapt the approach for Mojave by simply making the clock view a sibling of the close button I also simplified a few lines of code and added comments Hey Anyone wants to add the possibility to choose the sound of the alarm A menu or preference would be enough Someone Ralph not sure if you want your full name here sent me sounds he created and its pretty sweet alertsound zip alertsound zip Hey michaelvillar Would it be possible to build a new release for the changes since If youre super busy Im willing to join the project and do basic stuff like making releases keeping a changelog and testing Hello guys first of all i love this app Thank you I switched to Mojave on Monday so I noticed this bug As soon as the timer window is no longer activefocused the watchface becomes transparent But if I click on the timer window and make it to my active current window everything looks good again Strange img width altbildschirmfoto um src Thank you Max I found its useful to use a timer for counting down before a calendar event eg a meeting event One possible way to create a new timer is by accepting a calendar file ics and create a new timer suggests naming a time This could be useful as well Dont know if this is a bug or feature but when I close a timer and dont quit the app it doesnt invalidate the timer and the timer goes off If you can confirm this isnt a feature then I can try and implement a solution to this
