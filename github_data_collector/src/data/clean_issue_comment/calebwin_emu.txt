Without quotes around version numbers in a TOML file ie em Cargo gives the error expected newline found a period at line column cratesio always uses quotes and adding the quotes solves the problem The usage instructions should be copypastable and thus should also use quotes I read about gpufs It has a capability to access files from within gpu kernel functions Are there any plans to provide file io apis from within emus gpu kernel functions ie open file create file writeread close Thank you for listening Are there any plans to provide string or byte array handling capability from within emu kernels I believe it would be feasible if there was more support for integer types within emu I understand both cudaopencl provide integer support within kernels Thank you for listening Hello Is there currently any way to manually list and select the OpenCL device Thanks Are you aware of Futhark They let the user write GPU code with highlevel functions in a dedicated language that are then optimized and compiled down to openCL or Cuda As a long term goal using a similar approach or integrating with their optimizer you could let the user use an iterator gpuiter and optimize the code at compile time Im trying to run the tests for the arithmetic example env RUSTBACKTRACE cargo test but am getting undefined behaviour In most cases a double free is detected and the program crashes running tests X server found dri connection failed X server found dri connection failed X server found dri connection failed X server found dri connection failed X server found dri connection failed X server found dri connection failed X server found dri connection failed X server found dri connection failed X server found dri connection failed X server found dri connection failed X server found dri connection failed X server found dri connection failed X server found dri connection failed double free or corruption top error process didnt exit successfully homecedwardsgitemuexamplesarithmetictargetdebugdepsarithmetic e e dd fd c signal SIGABRT process abort signal Hey is it planned to support binding to CUDA in the future It would be a great enhancement I think Best regards Chips Hi Your library is getting more and more popular Would you please use gitflow At least would you please protect master branch from pushing into it without pull requests even for administrators It will help people to track your progress and it will help you not to screw up undeliberately by pushing unwanted code into master branch Best regards The only things Emu functions can really accept right now are vectors technically arrayspointers and primitive data f or i Simple structures could be accepted with changes A change to the language so you can declare what kind of structs you accept and how to unpackage primitive data from them in the declaration of the Emu function A change to the build macro to generate a function that can accept structs of a certain type and unpackage them into primitive data to send to the Emu function Before these changes are implemented we should think about how the general interface to an Emu user should change How should they pass structs to functions in a way that is most seamless
