Dockerfile from a folder but had to override the COPY line as there was no option to add a custom one like Cmd I had to use the below r docker suppressWarningsdockerfiledeployfolder image

there be a Copy function exported to achieve similar to above Instead of our own R Dockerfilestring conversion use the dockerfilerpackage create a PR to dockerfiler to not use deprecated MAINTAINER

to add allowreleaseinfochange to the below worked aptget y update allowreleaseinfochange I am trying set up a container based on a script and then have that script run on startup using the CMDRScript command I can build the container but when I try to run it I get the error No such file or directory referencing the R script which I thought was supposed to be copied to the working directory in the container Ive gone back and tried using the simple example in the containRit help where I seem to get the same error at this point dont care about the script output Im just trying to see if the script
