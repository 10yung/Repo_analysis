 WARNING This is an issue tracker Before opening a new issue make sure you read Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above Context There are several issues such as undefined behavior memory leaks etc that arent being detected because we have not setup sanitizers and checks Setting them up in CI is difficult but using third party tools is easy Eg Possible Solution Enable good third party tools and keep monitoring them disable them if they stop giving us any benefits This requires organization ownership to manager jspricke Separating out since it failed tests and I couldnt debug the issue Created a PR to keep it on my todo list Im working on a changelist more cleanup is needed Needs docopt and dict xml python modules Operating System and version Linux Mint PCL Version latest version Im getting the following error message while trying to install PCL Built target pclpcd png Building CXX object surfaceCMakeFilespclsurfacedirsrc rdpartypoisson marchingcubespoissoncppo Built target pclply vtk Linking CXX executable binpcltiff pcd MakeFilespclsurfacedirsrc rdpartypoisson geometrycppo Built target pclpcd png Building CXX object surfaceCMakeFilespclsurfacedirsrc rdpartypoisson marchingcubespoissoncppo Built target pclply vtk Linking CXX executable binpcltiff pcd Building CXX object visualizationCMakeFilespclvisualizationdirsrccommonshapescppo Building CXX object visualizationCMakeFilespclvisualizationdirsrccommonrenwininteractmapcppo Building CXX object visualizationCMakeFilespclvisualizationdirsrccloudviewercppo CvisualizationCMakeFilespclvisualizationdirbuildmake recipe for target visualizationCMakeFilespclvisualizationdirsrccloudviewercppo failed sampleconsensusCMakeFilespclsampleconsensusdirbuildmake recipe for target sampleconsensusCMakeFilespclsampleconsensusdirsrcsacmodelregistrationcppo failed make visualizationCMakeFilespclvisualizationdirsrccloudviewercppo Interrupt make sampleconsensusCMakeFilespclsampleconsensusdirsrcsacmodelregistrationcppo Interrupt CMakeFilesMakefile recipe for target sampleconsensusCMakeFilespclsampleconsensusdirall failed make sampleconsensusCMakeFilespclsampleconsensusdirall Interrupt CMakeFilesMakefile recipe for target visualizationCMakeFilespclvisualizationdirall failed make visualizationCMakeFilespclvisualizationdirall Interrupt Makefile recipe for target all failed make all Interrupt when run example from here visual studio output pclfeaturesboardh No such file or directory Development Environment win bit Compiler vs PCL Version Allinone installers Provides a pclsharedptr Converts all references to boostsharedptr to pclsharedptr Fixes headers for successful compilation This PR will allow for PCL releases with boostsharedptr and with stdsharedptr with just commit in the changelog Results achieved by Provide the alias Copy the file in backup location for dir in ls d do grep boostsharedptr dir lr xargs sed sboostsharedptrsharedptr i done Copy the file back Fix compilation errors Fix the headers as per IncludeWhatYouUse Forgot to mark the PR as draft Sorry for the noise I work with a CropHull class and I would like to access to the removed point indices after filter But I cant access at the constructor inherited class FilterIndices to set the boolean extractremovedindice Is there a reason why in CropHull class the boolean is unavailable WARNING This is an issue tracker Before opening a new issue make sure you read Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above Context Some sanitizers need to be run using instrumented binaries like UBSan and creating workloads is difficult sort of This will provide additional benefits to any test added by making sure we dont introduce bad behaviors Related discussion comment Possible Solution CI could addresspointersubtractleakundefined in some job Might increase runtime and compile time CI could created instrumented binaries for express purpose of sanity checks Doesnt sound like it would scale since the workloads will be synthetic similar to tests
