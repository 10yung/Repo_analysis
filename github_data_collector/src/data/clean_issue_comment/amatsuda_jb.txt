In jbuilder one could reuse partials within the main template either for collections of just for better code organization Is this possible with jb I havent been able to find relevant info in the readme TIA Can you tell me why this works render commentscommenthidedeletejsonjb but this doesnt render commentscommenthidedelete and neither does this render partial commentscommenthidedeletejsonjb Hi I have a common situation index and show actions both should render an object partial When I place the code into the corresponding views indexjsonjb and showjsonjb everything is good but when I place there any modifications of render partial object collection objects it renders weird output begin appviewsapiv objectsobjectjsonjb from appviewsapiv objectsindexjsonjb n id name Name position description Test id name Name position description Test end appviewsapiv objectsobjectjsonjb from appviewsapiv objectsindexjsonjb Is it me doing something wrong or is it a bug Thank you Btw Im on Ruby Rails Hi First thank you for this gem I started to use this gem in my projects because the syntax is enjoyable I want to ask if there is jsonp support with this so the output can be wrapped in function defined by params callback for example Thank you Curently I have a template that has the following ruby Railscachefetch v assignment do id assignmentid description assignmentdescription start assignmentstart end assignmentend end And it caches out nicely But when I edit the template contents say add a new item there the cache does not invalidate I know that ActionViewHelpersCacheHelpers has functionality for this but how to take advantage of it Hello In ruby we use snakecase everywhere and I suffer when I have to camelCase in any place Is there any option to camelKeys automatically all keys right before spitting out the JSON I would use it so that my JSON api stays consistent with javascript notation It sometimes renders an empty string with status or sometimes just raises The app below reproduces the former though The demo is based on Rails but I have found this problem on my Rails app How to reproduce it Rails git clone the repo bundle install bundle exec rspec will shows bundle exec rspec F Failures FoosControllerindex should eq FailureError expectresponsebodyto eq expected got compared using speccontrollersfooscontrollerspecrb in block levels in top required Finished in seconds files took seconds to load example failure Failed examples rspec speccontrollersfooscontrollerspecrb FoosControllerindex should eq curl with rails server does return as expected This PR fixes it probably keeps the fast performance I am using rails Basically when I set id value to jb template file it says unknown keyword id Then I add tojson at and end of id hash expression But at this stage it produces bad JSONlike string which browsers do not understand json id n n n Due to the fact that there are special characters in this string browsers do not understand whether the string is JSON or not even if the server sends ContentType applicationjson header Maybe there is a proper way but as I read from the documentation I could not find any way Say I have in projectscontrollerindex action projects and I have viewsprojectsprojectjsonrb name projectname and viewsprojectsindexjsonrb render projects whenever projects I get null as the output json If however I modified indexjsonjb to render partial projectsproject collection projects as project it will output is this by design
