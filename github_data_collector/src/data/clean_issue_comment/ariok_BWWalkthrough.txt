Added walkthroughDidScroll method to BWWalkthroughViewControllerDelegate This brings the minimum version down from to to enable installation in projects that still support iOS I also improved the gitignore file since I saw a DSStore file there while committing Shouldnt happen It would be very helpful if Swift Package Manager was supported by including a Packageswift file If approved and merged please do the same since it enhances the readme file by providing a clear explanation about how to consume the library via Swift Package Manager I want to hide the pageControl in th page So I did like this func walkthroughPageDidChange pageNumber Int if pageNumber DispatchQueuemainasync selfpageControlisHidden true else DispatchQueuemainasync selfpageControlisHidden false selfpageControlisHidden true is called but selfpageControl is always nil and not being hidden How can I hide the pageControl Thank you in advance This PR contains a fix for an issue I discovered that occurs when instead of presenting a BWWalkthroughViewController pushing with a UINavigationController The way the code is structured you simply cant use the library without storyboard as the init is not public I made it public and created a helper method to setup the scrollView as it was While trying to implement the cocoa pod BWWalkthrough into my current project programmatically I ran into a problem with the init functionsinheritance I tried to subclass BWWalkThroughViewController in my own class GetStartedViewController where I define buttons and pagecontrollers Here is the code from BWWalkThroughViewController which is a subclass of UIViewController class BWWalkThroughViewController UIViewController required public initcoder aDecoder NSCoder Setup the scrollview scrollviewshowsHorizontalScrollIndicator false scrollviewshowsVerticalScrollIndicator false scrollviewisPagingEnabled true superinitcoder aDecoder override initnibName nibNameOrNil String bundle nibBundleOrNil Bundle superinitnibName nibNameOrNil bundle nibBundleOrNil But when I try and subclass BWWalkthroughViewController in my own class I get errors saying Ambiguous reference to member initcoder when calling superinitnibName bundle and another error Initializer does not override a designated initializer from its superclass when I try to override the initnibname bundle import BWWalkthrough class GetStartedViewController BWWalkthroughViewController required public initcoder aDecoder NSCoder fatalErrorinitcoder has not been implemented public init superinitnibName nil bundle nil ERROR Ambiguous reference to member initcoder override initnibName nibNameOrNil String bundle nibBundleOrNil Bundle ERROR Initializer does not override a designated initializer from its superclass superinitnibName nil bundle nil ERROR Ambiguous reference to member initcoder Ive tried different variations of containing just the public init or just the override init and not both so I included both to show the error Even when I use autocomplete to call superinit all that shows up is the function with parameters of nscoder rather than with nibName and bundle Can someone please help me understand why this error is happening and how to fix it I dont understand why I cant call superinitnibName bundle or override the function Also if anyone else has experience implementing BWWalkthrough programmatically andor subclassing BWWalkthroughViewController without this init bug any help would be appreciated Previously all child view controller had viewWillAppear called as soon as the walkthrough page appeared This commit fixes this by disabling the automatic forwarding of appearance information to all child views and instead handles it manually both for the programatic case calling gotoPage and for the manual case where the scrolls the scroll view Both appearance and disappearance are forwarded correctly in my testing and there were no runtime issues of unbalanced appearance calls
