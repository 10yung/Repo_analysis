Id like to be able to see logs of rtorrent which I define in my rc inside of journalctl for the unit that has launched it thanks to the daemonised option in the config Id prefer this option to use instead of logging to a specific file and have the log rotation etc handled by the rest of the system It would be great if the config would allow for sending logs to systemdcat or logger with the appropriate warnerrorinfo codes SPECS OS Debian rTorrent version libtorrent Hello rTorrent keeps crashing randomly with this error C Caught signal Nonexistent physical address DUMP Caught SIGBUS

f e d d f Error Success Signal code Nonexistent physical address Fault address x f The fault address is not part of any chunk END Background I use the web interface Flood and it uses a custom field to represent the timestamp for when I originally added a torrent file This value is only set by Flood when I add a torrent through its interface if a torrent is added by way of saving it to a WATCHDIR this custom field value is never set and the interface reads basically its way of saying null I played around with the pyrocore CLI tool lstor and searched Floods source code to find that it is calling dcustomsetaddtimeXXXXXXXXXX where XXXXXXXXXX is the UnixEpoch version of the current system time at that moment I want to accomplish the same thing via rtorrentrc when a torrent is added from a WATCHDIR Since the builtin systemtime is apparently static based on when rtorrent is started the only way I can figure out to capture the system time at any given moment is to execute a shell command so I have methodinsert systemcurrenttime simple executecapturebash c echo n dates And now I want to invoke dcustomset in my schedule line and pass in the result of that method as a value for a new custom field Heres my attempt schedule watchstart loadstartverbose cat cfgbasedir torrent dcustomsetaddtimesystemcurrenttime I have no idea if my syntax is right or if what I want to accomplish is even possible but this isnt working The torrent gets added but the Unix timestamp is not being assigned Instead the Flood interface shows Invalid Date which AFAIK is the return string of the ECMASCript standard ToDateString the tldr is whatever value systemcurrenttime resolves to is not recognized as a valid Unixstyle datetime value Is what I want to do pass in a dynamic variable value such as the current time at a given moment like when a torrent is added via the schedule to dcustomset possible If so What would be the correct syntax I have spent hours scouring all the rtorrent scripting documentation I can find and have not found a good example of this usecase Hello I guess its not exactly an issue but I figured it out this is the place where I could get some help and its pretty nonspecific so it could be useful to others Im using ext WD Red NAS HDD network drive through Mbit connection to store seed data and I have lots of torrents around k using around TB of hdd space Machine serving NFS is pretty weak its Atom Ghz with GB of RAM Machine that is running rtorrent is strong Core I Ghz GB RAM no problems there For almost hours now rtorrent is launching and torrents are in OPEN state I get constant to Mbit transfer on ethernet interface Most of the memory usage on Atom machine is around for cache for buffers and tiny amount that is actually used CPU is pretty chilled there floating around load average is going from to So its not actually usable because it seems that this state could last for days but my question is whether Gbit network would help here Its strange because it seems network here is not the bottleneck and I dont know if network upgrade makes any sense Actually Im just trying this out right now and it is supposed to be on Gbit network soon Edit torrents are not seeded on tracker yet rtorrent process is in disk sleep state Please help While idling rtorrent has cpu usage stuck in an epollwait loop identical to Ive tested libcurl and libcurl and they both exhibit this issue but libcurl is fine Im not sure which curl commit reregressed this but unfortunately I dont have time to bisect I am trying to configure RTorrent to run as a service without screenxtermetc I am using the new systemdaemon true flag in the rc configuration file as well as in ExecStart with o however it is not making any difference rTorrent
