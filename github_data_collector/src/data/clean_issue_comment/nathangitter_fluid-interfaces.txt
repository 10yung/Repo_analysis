Also made it cancelable you can adjust the parameters and animation with older settings is then cancelled Continuously animate between two states left and right using layout constraints to avoid the jumpiness of resetting the position Removing terms bounciness and speed I like these terms but they can be confusing because their ranges are opposite low damping high bounciness short response high speed Make value labels more clear by adding units damping s response instead of and Hello Nathan Here is my suggestion on how to detect a pause In particular if we use the absolute value of the sum of the velocities we can detect when there is no movement ie a pause For example I believe now if you move back and forth the app knows is not a pause and will not show the label You are free to reject the request of course
