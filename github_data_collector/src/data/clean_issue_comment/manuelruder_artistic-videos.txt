As you may noticed from the title Im completely new to programming Im absolutely amazed by this and Im willing to start learning Can I build this for Win or should I install Ubuntu Cheers Wondering if deepflow would be an issue to add Thanks Hi there in trying to run the actual artisticvideolua script the process appears to die rather quickly with a notterriblydescriptive error message conv fc fc fc Style image size x Setting up temporal consistency Setting up style layer relu Setting up style layer relu Killed The ffmpeg and deepFlow bit of things seems to work fine I have a sequence of frames and a sequence of flo files along with some reliablepgm files How might I troubleshoot this Hi can you tell me your ideal about how to calculate the confidence map of optical flow Im just fascinated by this technology your work your talent and competences I cant even install or run anything Im totally lost Is this project that has lots of potential I believe in the visual world would have a chance to go further with a friendly interface extensions portability etc I guess the development would be colossal Is there a future for this with PCintel machines while smartphones get new processors with AI and Neural processing capabilities like Kirin Prisma Lab gave up with videos on Prisma app Artisto from Mycom Im not sure Thanks for reading Little modest experiment for further video projects Sorry Im tired I post this on the wrong project I wanted to post it on your other github fast artistic videos My bad Hi Weve just released our music video and we mostly used your lib We have very good feedbacks so I just wanted to say thank you Ive mentionned your lib on a post I wrote about the making of Cheers Is there a way that I can make sure ArtisticVideos will make sure the final frame and starting frame of a looping video or GIF will seamlessly blend together Im using the default artisticvideos specific parameters from stylizeVideosh and a custom set of NeuralStyle parameters I suspect the default temporal coherence related parameters are to blame I run stylizeVideosh with my own input video about seconds mp video with GPU TITAN X Pascal GB hours later I havet get the output
