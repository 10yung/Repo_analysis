Hello Dears Thank you for a super good tuber package I love all of it Though one thing missing for my Christmas happiness is to find out how to make getcaptions function work Now I am getting these errors getcaptionsvideoidN PA D Error in getcaptionsvideoid N PA D Must specify a valid id getcaptionsid y ElXcEME lSISz izkWVT GvxjPu pA Autorefreshing stale OAuth token Error HTTP failure

getvideodetails When I try to save the video details to my workspace I am losing the information that I am interested eg video duration however when I just run the function without assigning to my

results limit can be extended I have subscriptions which I wanted to periodically back up using R and I thought tuber could do it but with the maxresults limit I see no way out Added ytauthorized for a logical check to get whether you have a token or not including extractingfetching the token with yttoken Also added readsbv for a way to read sbv captions and added an argument in getcaptions to return a character vector vs raw vector Maybe we should consider new gargle way of doing things If I include the query argument it throws an error below Error in finit x i isrequesty is not TRUE In my checking of the code the tuberGET is already using the argument query but exclusively for some specific things According to the docu the query q could be delivered through at the end of the argument list The original purpose of this function might not accommodate the keyword search But I think it should be necessary as the function only retrieves max playlists of the given channel Many channels are growing adding more than playlists Thanks for your contribution Hi I am having a problem with the listchannelresources function with the username filter I am interested in giving username and getting channel id The code is generating the desired result for some usernames but not others For some usernames tuber will return incomplete results omit channel id It does not seem that there is something wrong about the specific usernames I am giving however When I run the corresponding function of listchannelresources with the youtube provided python code I get results without NA values Following code is what I tried with Tuber and the csv file is attached below So the tuber command works for useridsuserid but not for useridsuserid or useridsuserid useridsuserid worked once but not for other attempts By not working I mean they give empty list for items in tmp unlike useridsuserid s result giving that consists of kind etag and id Both of them works in python code and gives me channel ids Usernamezip useridsreadcsvcleanuseridcsv userchannelidlist loop fori in kuseridsuserid i tmplistchannelresourcesfiltercusernamek partid userchannelid i tmp items id printi individual

file as my browser isnt able to redirect to my server via localhost But the first time I called the ytoauth function muscle memory kicked in and I selected option use the httroauth file instead of outofband option Somehow Im not able to find the possibility to enable option after I selected option I tried removing the httpuv package but tuber is dependent on it wether or not Ive selected option or I removed the existing httroauth file manually and with ytoathkeys removeoldoauth TRUE but I cant reselect option instead of Am I missing something Hi first of all thank you for your awesome R package to scrape for comments at youtube I am using your package to analyse some comments but I came up with the problem that not all comments can be collected I think the issue have been mentioned in other issues getcommentthreads as well but this problem focuses on the method getallcomments The original video has comments the function returns only records so approximately get lost The bigger problem in my opinion is the returning of the replies Looking at the user in top comment category it can be seen that the original video counts different replies the function returns only so the communication between different users will be lost comments getallcommentsvideoid zzRpiUFYI
