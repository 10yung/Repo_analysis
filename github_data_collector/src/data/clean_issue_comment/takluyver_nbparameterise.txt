Fixes Not being a Python expert I dont know if its possible to have nice inheritance between tests all my attempts have caused tests to be run in duplicate so Ive just copied and pasted the test Let me know if the PR is OK If my notebook contains something like matplotlib notebook in the first cell we get an ugly failure File optcondalibpython sitepackagesnbparameterisecodepy line in extractparameters params listdrvextractdefinitionsfirstcodecellnbsource File optcondalibpython sitepackagesnbparameterisecodedriverspythonpy line in extractdefinitions cellast astparsecell File optcondalibpython astpy line in parse return compilesource filename mode PyCFONLYAST File unknown line matplotlib notebook SyntaxError invalid syntax Maybe we could just remove these lines before sending them to parsing what do you think Bit of a pedantic request I know However I follow PEP String Quotes where it suggests to Pick a rule and stick to it In using this package I only see single quotes used in the parameters that are overloaded Is there an option to use double quotes If it could that would mean that my styling guide could be honoured Also on another note that is probably outside of what you expect to maintain if double quotes could be supported languages like Julia for example could be supported with almost no adjustment I tested it out by copying and pasting the pythonpy codedriver and renaming it to juliapy The only reason it fails is because of the single quotes newnb replacedefinitionsnb params Starting kernel event loops Traceback most recent call last File stdin line in module File appsrcnbparameterisecodepy line in replacedefinitions nb resources ExecutePreprocessorpreprocessnb resources File optcondalibpython sitepackagesnbconvertpreprocessorsexecutepy line in preprocess nb resources superExecutePreprocessor selfpreprocessnb resources File optcondalibpython sitepackagesnbconvertpreprocessorsbasepy line in preprocess nbcells index resources selfpreprocesscellcell resources index File optcondalibpython sitepackagesnbconvertpreprocessorsexecutepy line in preprocesscell raise CellExecutionErrorfromcellandmsgcell out nbconvertpreprocessorsexecuteCellExecutionError An error occurred while executing the following cell param dummy param dummy param dummy param dummy syntax invalid character literal LoadError syntax invalid character literal More and more users including me are using the crossplatform package manager conda to install our software dependencies I would like to install nbparameterise using conda Fortunately it is trivial to write a conda recipe that builds a condainstallable package of nbparameterise based on the nbparameterise github repositoryBUT a setuppy file in the nbparameterise project is required Heres one that works Hello I added support for lists which was something that I really needed in my fork I also had issues getting it to run with the python kernel or invoking examplesbatchpy so I fixed those by adding documentation or moving the file It occurs to me that perhaps these changes should have been in different commits Let me know if you want just some of the changes
