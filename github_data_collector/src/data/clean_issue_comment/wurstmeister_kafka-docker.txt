Hi Im new to Kafka so perhaps Im not understanding something First thanks for providing this dockerized Kafka image It works great I have the Kafka logs volume mounted and using dockercompose stop and dockercompose up d norecreate seem to be doing the trick I am curious how one should handle data persistence a container is torn down eg dockercompose down It seems that all of the necessary data is still there on the docker host but when starting the Kafka container runs into an issue where the Cluster ID does not match the id specified in metaproperties and the Kafka container exits Is there a way around this Perhaps more environment variables that need to be specified in the compose file Thanks in advance for any guidance andor suggestions you may have Hi I am running one jar file in Linux which has Kafka listeners spring boot annotation While I am running that jar no data is coming to the topic until I press any key from keyboard After pressing any key all the data is coming which are already there in that topic Can anyone please let me know what is the root cause if n KAFKAHEAPOPTS then sed r i sexport KAFKAHEAPOPTS KAFKAHEAPOPTSg KAFKAHOMEbinkafkaserverstartsh unset KAFKAHEAPOPTS fi Since the official script kafkaserverstartsh already checks and well handles the environment variable KAFKAHEAPOPTS the block above is redundant I think it should be removed Kafka supports now java As java brings better ergonomics when running in docker I think it would be useful to have java supported in this image I wanted to run kafkadocker in k s for testing purposes even a single node deployment is good enough Can we provide a guide for k s deployment see fixes Host ports should not be limited to I called command dockercompose up d to run zookeeper and kafka but I got error ERROR Service kafka failed to build The command binsh c apk add nocache bash curl jq docker chmod ax tmpsh mv tmpstartkafkash tmpbrokerlistsh tmpcreatetopicssh tmpversionssh usrbin sync tmpdownloadkafkash tar xfz tmpkafkaSCALAVERSIONKAFKAVERSIONtgz C opt rm tmpkafkaSCALAVERSIONKAFKAVERSIONtgz ln s optkafkaSCALAVERSIONKAFKAVERSION KAFKAHOME rm tmp wget apk add nocache allowuntrusted glibcGLIBCVERSIONapk rm glibcGLIBCVERSIONapk returned a nonzero code My dockercomposeyml file looks version services zookeeper image wurstmeisterzookeeper ports kafka build ports environment KAFKAADVERTISEDHOSTNAME kafka KAFKAZOOKEEPERCONNECT zookeeper volumes varrundockersockvarrundockersock Im using docker on Windows How can I fix it With this you will not need to remember to run dockercompose up after restarting Docker or the whole machine
