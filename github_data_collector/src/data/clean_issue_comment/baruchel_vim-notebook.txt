You mention this in the docs Im still seeing it despite using the suggested config let gnotebookcmd Applicationsj binjconsole let gnotebookstop exit let gnotebooksend let gnotebooksend VIMJNOTEBOOK let gnotebookdetect VIMJNOTEBOOK To clarify the issue the spaces before every prompt are collected and included with the output Therefore if I execute a code block with N lines the first line of the output will include N spaces at the start Eg x x x x The desired behavior would be x x x x Any suggestions Thanks Ive tried the following configuration attempt at node let gnotebookcmd NODEDISABLECOLORS node let gnotebookstop processexit let gnotebooksend let gnotebooksend VIMNODENOTEBOOK let gnotebookdetect VIMNODENOTEBOOK Note that the final two lines reflect the fact that node echoes back quotes when literal strings are entered Node REPL However when I NotebookStart vim just hangs and needs to be killed Do you know the correct settings for node If not any tips for debugging or what I might attempt to make it work Thanks
