Hi the chooseDataServer module will by default drop the ID column of an imported dataset The user needs to point and click to retain it Would it be possible to add an option to programmatically direct whether the ID column should be retained or not by default Thank you Id love to use esquisse more but linix systems seem to need some external dependencies that esquisse doesnt manage as part of the package installation These are libfontconfig dev which needs to be installed with sudo aptget install libfontconfig dev Cairo needs to be installed with sudo aptget install libcairo dev a Also do sudo aptget install libxtdev These need to be run before esquisse is useable Is it possible to incorporate these in to the package installation process Hi there when importing a data frame with some cells being empty esquisse does not turn these into NAs Later filters wont show empty cells as one of the possible levels of factor for filtering Dataframe rows where one of the cell is empty are automatically removed because empty is not a selectable level of a factor but it is not NA either Thanks esquisse wont work on my version of R ERROR lazy loading failed for package esquisse removing LibraryFrameworksRframeworkVersions Resourceslibraryesquisse restoring previous LibraryFrameworksRframeworkVersions Resourceslibraryesquisse installation of package varfolderslyzjdtnvqn j vwf wghrsm gqTRtmpSMcVFQfile dc c fdesquisse targz had nonzero exit status libraryesquisse Error package or namespace load failed for esquisse in dynloadfile DLLpath DLLpath unable to load shared object LibraryFrameworksRframeworkVersions Resourceslibrarysystemfontslibssystemfontsso dlopenLibraryFrameworksRframeworkVersions Resourceslibrarysystemfontslibssystemfontsso Library not loaded optX liblibfreetype dylib Referenced from LibraryFrameworksRframeworkVersions Resourceslibrarysystemfontslibssystemfontsso Reason image not found Are there any thoughts on providing calculated fields For example in the Select a dataset entry Select variables to keep carat color Calculate variable meancarat groupbycolor meancarat I have tried downloading the package using installpackagesesquisse and remotesinstallgithubdreamRsesquisse and i am getting the following error Error in dynloadfile DLLpath DLLpath unable to load shared object LibraryFrameworksRframeworkVersions Resourceslibrarysystemfontslibssystemfontsso dlopenLibraryFrameworksRframeworkVersions Resourceslibrarysystemfontslibssystemfontsso Library not loaded optX liblibfreetype dylib Referenced from LibraryFrameworksRframeworkVersions Resourceslibrarysystemfontslibssystemfontsso Reason image not found Calls Anonymous asNamespace loadNamespace librarydynam dynload Execution halted ERROR lazy loading failed for package esquisse removing LibraryFrameworksRframeworkVersions Resourceslibraryesquisse restoring previous LibraryFrameworksRframeworkVersions Resourceslibraryesquisse Error Failed to install esquisse from GitHub converted from warning installation of package varfoldersyzlk cq ln h fn jmq vsc gpTRtmpKTnj ffile a c feesquisse targz had nonzero exit status When launching esquisser from R markdown code chunk it is impossible to load variables from the chosen dataframe This is not an issue if esquisser is launched from the Rstudio console R sessionInfo R version Platform x appledarwin bit Running under macOS Mojave Matrix products default BLAS SystemLibraryFrameworksAccelerateframeworkVersionsAFrameworksvecLibframeworkVersionsAlibBLASdylib LAPACK LibraryFrameworksRframeworkVersions ResourcesliblibRlapackdylib locale enUSUTF enUSUTF enUSUTF CenUSUTF enUSUTF attached base packages stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base other attached packages ggplot scales shiny esquisse loaded via a namespace and not attached hrbrthemes tidyselect xfun remotes purrr ggthemes colorspace miniUI htmltools viridisLite yaml pkgbuild rlang pillar later withr glue gdtools RColorBrewer stringr munsell gtable evaluate labeling knitr callr extrafont ps httpuv curl shinyWidgets Rttf pt Rcpp xtable backports promises jsonlite mime systemfonts digest stringi processx dplyr rprojroot grid cli tools magrittr lazyeval tibble crayon extrafontdb pkgconfig prettyunits assertthat rmarkdown rstudioapi R compiler It would be great to use several simultaneous scaling options for the same axis for example reverse axis and log scaling Would it be possible to have the information of the point where the mouse cursor is as for plotly Hi with release of esquisse I get the following error while selecting any transformation apart from identity log log etc Error could not find function scalexcontinuous Screenshot from
