As the title suggests I wanted to open the project on newer version of unity compared to what was stated in the prerequisite section of this repo which demands us to use Unity f I already opened up the project using Unity but I am getting numerous errors with the packages So is it possible to open the FPS sample with newer versions of unity Hi I read the readme and I see that the original aim of this project is to help others learn but the Companion licence is hard to understand for me So my question is Can I use the assets from this project in my own game and can I make money by selling that game on any platform PC XBox PS If the answer is yes am I required to mention something in the credits or somewhere else about these assets If yes what should I write and where in the game credits readmetxt etc Thanks a lot In NetworkWriterL it appears that the position checking is incorrect if using a byte array While the NetworkWriter never uses WriteBytes in the code if you do attempt to use it you could potentially run into false positives on this assert The reason is that the WriteBytes takes a parameter of maxCount Thats the maximum number of bytes that can appear in the array When being passed to NetworkWriter as an arraySize parameter it is being added to mPosition which is the index of a uint array and comparing it also against mSize which is also in uint count Many of these errors occur during LFS downloads git c diffmnemonicprefixfalse c corequotepathfalse lfs pull LFS Get dial tcp lookup githubclouds amazonawscom getaddrinfow The requested name is valid but no data of the requested type was found LFS Get dial tcp lookup githubclouds amazonawscom getaddrinfow The requested name is valid but no data of the requested type was found How to resolve this error Build type release BuildID AutoBuild Cwd C Users shpark src FPSSample AutoBuild SimpleBundleManager initialized LevelManager initialized InputSystem initialized Loaded game config ProcessCommandLineArguments C Users shpark src FPSSample AutoBuild AutoBuildexe serve Level batchmode nographics cmd serve Level exec s usercfg exec s bootcfg serve Level Game loop ServerGameLoop requested Switching state null Idle Listening on on port SQP Initialized Listening on port GameWorld ServerWorld initializing Network server initialized Cannot add command load twice loadingAssetBundlesLevel ERR Unable to open archive file AssetBundlesLevel ERROR Cannot load level Level Server initialized EXCEPTION Object reference not set to an instance of an object at ServerGameLoopUpdateNetwork x be in a cc c d c af bd at ServerGameLoopUpdate x d in a cc c d c af bd at GameUpdate x e in a cc c d c af bd NullReferenceException Object reference not set to an instance of an object After building game using FPSSample Windows Project Tools Build game Start I got an NullReferenceException Could you give me some idea for troubleshooting From Unite LA talk the developers of FPSSample claim that they tried to remove hacks Could you elaborate more on this I want to know whether there are some references that describes your design choices for cheat prevention This function is technically incorrect However it is correct in the context of the only place its being used If you use this overload of MemCmp with uint arrays like below it is correct NetworkUtilsMemCmp However if youre looking for an actual return value then you need to cast the result back to a uint The problem lies with overflow var diff b bIndex a aIndex if diff return intdiff Notice that its casting diff to int and returning it claiming thats the difference Its not used this way anywhere in code but its misleading and Im not sure why it doesnt just return a uint straight You could also just rename the function to IsEquals and return a bool if the two values are not the same and skip the diff NetworkClientcsL and L both have bugs regarding the variable schemaSize schemaSize is in bytes infoprediction is an array of uints NetworkUtilsMemCmp will iterate over the array up to but if the schemaSize is larger than then it will crash despite a larger size being valid Same with NetworkUtilsSimpleHash a few lines later Since a uint is bytes a word then schemaSize needs to be divided by The resolution is just like the loops are doing right below it Just to say many thanks and how great it is to see a project of this complexity and how you guys have gone about tackling it As more and more features of Unity become available in ECSaware versions we will migrate to them With the current tag being v this is going to be great as Git based as not just a network and ECS demo but a really good example of how to migrate firstly to hybrid and then full blown It will be awesome to have the version tags to step through and be able to have such a strong and complex example Many thanks for all the effort you guys have put in and after that import Yes I did celebrate a bit
