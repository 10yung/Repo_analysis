 What does this PR do Adds unit test functionality in Kotlin in the codegen module This is required for the CLI Where should the reviewer start All changed files Why is it needed To eventually be able to generate new web j projects in kotlin What does this PR do Update version in README Where should the reviewer start README file Why is it needed release I got a broken test when updating from to Every types encodingdecoding is fine but not int passing a negative value to encode and then read it back is not working Example I got a smart contract with the method function passAndGetBackInt int value public view returns int return value When I call it I pass the value encoded and it must return the same decoded value It work for int int int and int but for a unknown reason it do not return anymore for int but it return Any ideafix on that can someone give a try I think something has break in the latest releases I made a wallet and try to subscribe like this Kotlin val address

When I run itI found that the others tag always log but my tag never showedOf course I start it before transfer test where I dit wrong PrivateTransactionReceipt declares new fields instead of inheriting them PrivateTransactionReceipt declares again the following fields instead of inheriting them private final String contractAddress private final String from private final String to private final List logs private final String transactionHash private final String status This creates two copies of the same field for the superclass TransactionReceipt subclass PrivateTransactionReceipt and creates various issues Steps To Reproduce Calling privateTransactionReceiptisStatusOk Expected behavior Result should be evaluated by the actual receipt status Actual behavior Result will always be true because superclasss status is always null even though subclass status is not Environment Running Besu Quickstart network geth version unstable solidity code pragma solidity pragma experimental
