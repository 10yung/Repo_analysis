EZBlocker Version Spotify Version It was working just fine yesterday and I saw no message that Spotify was updated EZBlocker Version Spotify Version The EZBlocker mute songs instead ads this happen usually when i change from a song to another or new artist not when i m just listening a playlist or full album Spotify is still broken after deleting C Usersuser AppData Roaming Spotify C Usersuser AppData Local Spotify and redownloading after Hey ive got the newest version of EZBlocker from Sometimes it did not unmute spotify after Ad Its really annoying Please fix thank you so mutch Ciao Ceytec After deleting EZBlocker from my PC I also deleted lines from host file Spotify wont play anything because all playlists are empty I tried reinstalling Spotify several times but that didnt helped Any solutions Have you stopped devolving this thing I wish you could make oen that blocks the ads EZBlocker mutes Spotify when its paused Spotifys title changes to Spotify Free and then because of the delay it stays paused for a second or so after unpausing sometimes even forever Possible solution Dont mute if the title is Spotify Free In Australia Spotify free users can skip ads It would be a really good feature if SpotifyAdBlocker could also attempt to skip the ads
