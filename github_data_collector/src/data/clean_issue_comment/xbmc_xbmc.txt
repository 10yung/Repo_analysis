is made we require you to update it with new information or Kodi versions should that be required Team Kodi will consider your problem report however we will not make any promises the problem will be solved Description While working on an InputStream Addon I noted an unexpected exception if the addon did not successfully initialize In AddonBaseh the addonInstance argument is not initialized to NULL and if the addon fails to also do so a segfault may occur attempting to access the mtype member variable Motivation and Context Failure to provide an initialization for addonInstance followed by a failed call to ADDONBASECreateInstanceEx can lead to an exception or unexpected results This variable is tested for NULL explicitly as part of the logic therefore it should be initialized to that value to avoid the segfaultAV How Has This Been Tested Tested on Windows Desktop x as part of preliminary unit testing for an InputStream addon that may be proposed for Kodi mainline Screenshots if

wiki I have updated the documentation accordingly X I have read the Contributing document I have added tests to cover my change All new and existing tests passed Description This adds an overload of IPlayerAddSubtitle which in addition to taken the path to the subtitle also takes the name of the subtitle and its language Only CVideoPlayer implements this interface method same as the existing AddSubtitle method Furthermore the Player class in the python addon API has also been extended with an addSubtitle method which makes use of the new IPlayerAddSubtitle method Motivation and Context While working on my media import stuff people requested support for external subtitles Media backends like Emby and Plex already look for external subtitles and determine metdata like name language codec etc Right now VideoPlayer only supports getting a file and then determining all of this metadata itself angelblue has come up with a workaround for this misfit in Emby for Kodi by manually downloading external subtitles from Emby to the local disk and then manually naming them based on the metadata from Emby and finally providing them to Kodi Im mainly interested in whether this would be accepted at all It doesnt have to merged now and I can keep it as part of my media import work but I dont want to further persue this if it has no chance to hit Kodi mainline Types of change What

Description Provide a general summary of your change in the Pull Request title above Describe your change in detail here Preferably use year infolabel in CVideoInfoTag if set and extract the year from premiered or aired infolabel as a fallback Motivation and Context Why is this change required What problem does it solve If it fixes an open issue please link to the issue here When a plugin sets the year infolabel on a ListItem using ListItemSetInfo it is not being used in ListItemYear infolabel and this causes DialogVideoInfoxml Information pane to show no or wrong information Instead it is always using the year extracted from the aired or premiered infolabel Since some plugins are listing content of tv catchup services the aired infoLabel actually contains the most recent rebroadcast date on a TV channel and not the production year This fixes How Has This Been Tested Please describe in detail how you tested your change Include details of your testing environment and the tests you ran to see how your change affects other areas of the code etc Tested on Linux x with Kodi with a minimal video plugin containing a ListItem with all date related infoLabels set Also compared the

PR tries to adapt PR on tvOS Call CPoweManager OnWake OnSleep through IPowerSyscall when tvOS activity lifecycle calls applicationWillEnterForeground applicationDidEnterBackground Maybe in the future we will be able to move this code in ioscommon to use it in both iOS and tvOS Important note I dont know if this problem comes from this commit but sometimes after move to foreground my last TV channel opens well but I have no sound I have to switch to another channel to fix the issue and re open last channel Also I am not sure about the OnAppFocusChange line Should we call this line before or after the power manager line I dont really understand this line fuzzard and kambaladecapitator if you can have a look please Thank you Motivation and Context Why is this change required What problem does it solve If it fixes an open issue please link to the issue here There are services inside kodi eg PVR EPG poll which should be deactivated when kodi is suspended Also this PR is just
