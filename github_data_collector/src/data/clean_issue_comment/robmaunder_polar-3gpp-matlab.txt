Can polar code be used with MIMO now Ive searched a lot it seems that in g nr polar code can not be used with MIMO theres only antenna port for polar code right When I directly call the PUCCHencoderm and PUCCHdecoderm only polar blocks can be encoded or decoded per second After reading the code I have found an interesting point that the path component will be added every time the encoding and decoding function is called After moving the corresponding codes to top file to make them be called only once the speed can be improved by up to times about blocks per second So I think this may be taken into consideration in your future revision
