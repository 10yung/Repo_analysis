I expect that exception handling is usually supported by a C program I wonder why your function main main function does not contain corresponding try and catch instructions Does it make sense to catch exceptions in the main so far How do you think about recommendations by Matthew Wilson in an article Quality Matters Exceptions for PracticallyUnrecoverable Conditions Would you like to adjust the implementation if you consider effects for uncaughtunhandled exceptions Description for exception handling Would you like to add more error handling for return values from functions like the following bindtextdomain Set directory containing message catalogs main strdup Duplicate a string gstpecrystalizerclassinit Would you like to wrap any pointers with the class template stduniqueptr Description for the usage of smart pointers Update candidates Filtercreatebandpasskernel readfile An extra null pointer check is not needed in functions Do I need to check for null before delete p like the following Filtercreatelowpasskernel Filtercreatelowpasskernel function gstpeconvolverfinishconvolver gstpeconvolverfinishconvolver function I would like to point out that an identifier like GstPeadapter Update candidate does not fit Do not declare an identifier which is reserved for the compiler implementation to the expected naming convention of the C language standard Would you like to adjust your selection for unique names wav file extension should be accepted for an impulse file If thats impossible then at least it should be noted somewhere in UI how exactly it wants you to rename your files it is not shown in file picker and you have to guess or search the web Hello there Im completely new to linux i use eOS and i instaled PulseEffets from FlatHub I clicked instal Capture d cran du And i dont know how to completely remove it Regards Two questions rather than issues currently I have the following sample rate sample format chain float le kHzF LE kHzs le kHz pulse In this scenario am I correct in assuming there is no resampling taking place as the sampling is the same at each step is it possible to change the output sample format method from s le I have looked around the GUI and source and cannot see anything obvious Thanks Pete Ive decided to move from to and i see a weird issue where output is too silent if i enable pulseeffects I dont know how its caused and why First off wwmm excellent work with this software package Youve really done something great for the Linux Audiophile community So when I register this in startup in Ubuntu pulseeffects gapplicationservice I am seeing lots of errors in syslog It looks like it starts with this updatenotifierdesktop Failed to register Unable to acquire bus name comgithubwwmmpulseeffects pulseeffectsservicedesktop Failed to register Unable to acquire bus name comgithubwwmmpulseeffects I also see another error that looks pretty serious pulseeffects pulseeffects Fatal IO error Resource temporarily unavailable on X server But Nautilus and everything works fine Is this an X issue Why do we see this if it is launching as a service and not presenting the GUI Then later gnomesession gnomesessionbinary WARNING Could not parse desktop file pulseeffectsdesktop or it references a not found TryExec binary I saw some bugs here related to this but they were never closed without resolution I think I also saw a segfault in dmesg so Ill see if I can find that and post it here too
