Content Artwork Summary A Replacement of the williwaws sprite to make the hai more unique Assets Hai Williwaw Assetszip hai williwaw x Content Artwork Missions Jobs Summary This PR changes the description of Calda The description is mostly unchanged but now the reason the carbon dioxide incident doesnt effect the economy is more due to the population forgetting about it rather than the Paradise Planets being cartoonishly egotistical This is a very small change but that part of the description is something thats annoyed me ever since I started playing the game Theres also a slight change in the wording of the spaceport to refer to merchant captains instead of a captain such as yourself since I dont know of any other instances it refers to you like that Feature This PR implements the feature request discussed in issue and in other tickets referenced from Feature Details This PR moves reading of the Shiftinput key from AIcpp to Commandcpp where all other keyboard inputs for flight are also read This PR also adds a fullstop command for the flagship using the shiftH input UI Screenshots NA Usage Examples Fly around then press shiftH to stop your ship Describe the bug before e b b c ca fb d d b fe f you could use the arrow keys while holding down the jump button which allowed you to move back and forth without disengaging autopilot After the change pressing any of the arrow keys disengages autopilot even while still holding the jump button so you have to let go of the jump button and press it again This also causes any escorts to stop waiting for you to release the jump button and start moving around again Cancelling a jump before e b b c ca fb d d b fe f worked by releasing the jump button while holding down the arrow keys and not by simply pressing

Ill be adding one additional intermediary mission so that it isnt quite as much a refuse once and you are dead thing And possibly reworking the choices a bit to give the player the chance to go back PR Checklist X I updated the copyright attributions or decline to claim copyright of any assets produced or modified x I uploaded the necessary image blend and texture assets here insert link to assets x I created a PR to the endlessskyhighdpi repo with the x versions of these art assets insert PR link PR Intention Im intending on building this up to the point where it has three missions and a repeatable job Depending on player choices Im envisioning three potential paths missionaccept missionaccept complete x jobs mission current outbreak contained missionrefuse missionaccept complete x jobs current outbreak contained but wider effect missionrefuse missionrefuse player killed Basically ensuring that the player gets at least two chances to prevent dying of the plague Theres also the potential of adding a fourth mission to the refuserefuse chain just to prolongue the agony over a couple missions Also potentially looking for a greyer th option Probably something to the effect of if the player goes the refuserefuse route they can decide to skip town and stay out of human space for a year or so until the plague timer runs out in which case a bunch of planets suffer but the player gets to avoid dying without getting vaccinated Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Its not an obvious problem in the base game But it does limit the possibilities of the type of content that can be created There are very limited ways of creating continuous modifiers What I mean by modifiers are things like damage hit force etc done by weapons Related Issue Links I may have seen an issue opened up months or years ago that addresses this issue partially However I cant find anything through the search feature Describe the solution youd like There are a few possible ways Ive thought of approaching this I want to lay them out to show the benefits and downsides of each Solution A Allow projectiles to continue living on after hitting an object Benefits Lets a projectile hit multiple targets linearly Gives the possibility of creating bleeding effects like constant shield damage or heat damage or even buffs for ally ships Downsides Obviously youd want to also limit the amount of times it hits one object and create something like a counter To allow the projectile to create things like continuous area effects youd have to also add in the ability to override the counter orand add in your own values ex counter would limit the amount of times the same object gets hit to Solution B Allow projectiles to apply a constant effect for amount of frames to an object Benefits Its easier to implement than Solution A There are examples of such effects already in the game like ion damage slowing damage etc Downsides You may have to add in an option for certain modifiers like Shield Damage etc to apply or override the effect for each modifier to allow for finer tweaking It all depends how complex you want it to be Another downside is that its not a real solution for things like continuous area effects as the projectile will have already died and applied its modifiers to the objects that were within the blast radius but none that enter after the trigger Solution C Implement both A B Benefits Gives more options for creating continuous modifiers Downsides Requires more additions and changes Solution D Implement a different solution that isnt shown here Describe alternatives youve considered I first thought of this when I was creating an area damage weapon that lasted for a number of frames I used submunitions to create a pseudo continuous effect but the longer I made the effect last the more submunitions I had to create which quickly became hundreds of lines It also meant that when a target object collided with the submunitions projectile it would instantly stop the area effect This is not a good way of implementing this since it quickly pollutes and clutters the text files The ability to have a constant rate reduces clutter and prevents small errors from having to duplicate frames Additional context I only thought of this issue while trying to make area modifiers that lasted for more than one frame and decided to expand this feature to encompass all modifiers Feature This PR implements the feature request detailed and discussed in issue Feature Details This PR makes the fastforward key configurable It does not make using Caps Lock for low framerate in debug mode configurable however This would be helpful for people using Caps Lock as a compose layout switch or second escape key It also makes the fastforward feature easier to discover The fact that Caps Lock still toggles low framerate in debug mode means that one can use fastforward in conjunction with it for example to reproduce a bug which occurs only after some time Note It would be nice if the keybinding is listed in the manual even if this PR is not merged UI Screenshots Before After Setting below Toggle Fullscreen Usage Examples NA Summary This PR adds a spaceport to Wormhole Alpha Enabling NPCs and fleets that spawn in Waypoint to land on the wormhole Thanks to Zitchas for suggesting this as I only thought of doing it for the Remnant wormholes in Describe the bug Landing immediately after takeoff gives correct Landing on planet output but the landing doesnt get executed To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Click depart on a planet with spaceport and fully fueled ship Immediately press Land as soon as the main flightscreen appears Notice that the Landing on planet message appears correctly Note that the ship is not landing Expected behavior I would expect either the landing to be executed as requested which seems to make most sense or the output message to be something different like Cannot start landing while taking off Screenshots Here is a screenshot just after the issue happened you can see the Landing on planet message but the ship is not turning for landing ignoredlandingduringtakeoff System please complete the following information OS Debian Linux Game Source selfcompiled Version recent master dabfe e d edd ffda d b b e Link to save file NA Can be reproduced on on nearly any takeoff Additional context I havent fully investigated the issue but I think it is related to this code in Shipcpp on line else iffuel attributesGetfuel capacity landingPlanet landingPlanetHasSpaceport zoom min f zoom f SetTargetStellarnullptr landingPlanet nullptr This code appears to be executed continuously during takeoff until zoom is f and appears to continuously clear the TargetStellar even if the player just sets a new one for landing After clearing TargetStellar then the autopilot for landing automatically gets aborted silently in AIcpp Impact This issue will have little to no impact on normalregular gameplay There are very few situations where a player wants to takeoff and then immediately wants to land again Players that encounter this issue might not even notice the issue when a landing fails due to this issue then pressing land again a little bit later results in a successful landing being executed Impact on fully automated tests like the tests in and scripted flights as proposed in is also minimal since this automationscripting should be able to work around this issue by waiting until zoom is f before giving commands Content Artwork Missions Jobs Summary This PR creates a new boarding mission which is offered in while assisting Merchants and Syndicate where an asteroid is going to hit the disabled ship you are boarding There are three versions of it where some of the choices you can make have a different endings There are two others however that either always fail or always succeed
