Ive logged a few reports of this line Throwing this error TypeError Cannot assign to read only property which of object KeyboardEvent I cant reproduce it myself and Im unsure which key was pressed to make that code path execute Happened on Chrome on both macOS and Windows ie set a shortcut for spacebar key if held for ms thx i like this repo there a list about all the result of navigatorplatform maybe we lost something about opera mini Pike v release Opera Mini on any iPhone Pike v release Opera Mini on any iPhone When mousetrap loads in a nondom environment it bails early and doesnt set the Mousetrap global Make the globalbind plugin detect that Mousetrap didnt initialize and bail itself Hi Were currently having an issue in Chrome where using MousetrapbindGlobal ctrlaltspace no longer works when it did previously We tested in Chrome and it still did not work This shortcut works on Firefox but not chrome Changing the shortcut to CTRLALTF fixes the issue but wed like to keep our original shortcut to keep our users muscle memory Demo here Any help would be appreciated thanks Need possibility to remove eventListeners from targetElement in reset method or in some one other Cause performance problems s At the moment it seems that bind only works with strings being able to bind from KeyboardEventcode would be nice too with probably a fallback for Edge and IE The use case is consistency between different keyboard layouts where the key property is different but code is the same because code is linked to the physicial key rather than its character A concrete example of this lets say you want to bind keys from the top keyboard row You could do Mousetrapbind function and it will work for pretty much all keyboard layouts except AZERTY the most common keyboard layout in Belgium and France While the numbers are on the top row there too you have to press Shift to get them The current best workaround is to bind the etc keys too ie the top row keys on AZERTY but this adds excess keyboard shortcuts for all users Being able to use the codes Digit Digit etc would make it way more clean Different layouts problem The MAIN problem with similar packages lets decide what is keyboard shortcuts Google keyboard shortcuts first link In computing a keyboard shortcut is a set of one or more keys that invoke a command in software or an operating system Keys What is the keys Google keyboard keys images So what is the key here maybe A or F C D maybe If you want to press ctrla what you should press Yes right the keys with ctrl and a inscriptions But what you should press here huh Where is the letters How can this be used at all It has no labels Maybe this Or this No you will press this Because it is on this place that the keys are located on the qwerty as most popular layout Azerty Qwertz Dvorak Colemak Maltron Jcuken and enter you keyboard layout here Exampe I have to press SHIFT C to do something On qwerty On dvorak Not so comfortable So heres the question why Why keyboard SHORTCUTS depends on users layout They are keyboard SHORTCUTS not the actual letters that i must press They are designed for ease of use Why do you use ewhich if its deprecated by the way keyCode is deprecated too Why dont you use ecode Browser support ok write a fallback for those who use IE or EDGE when im trying to do the shortcut for mod it activates the shortcut for modfn in electron app
