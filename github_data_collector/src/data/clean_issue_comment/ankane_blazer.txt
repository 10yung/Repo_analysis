What I am seeing is exactly what was showing under exactly the same circumstances He said it magically fixed itself but mine still hasnt Anybody else have this problem and any hints to fix will be appreciated Andy Galewsky The current implementation failed to retry queries that are in the QUEUED state prior to Instead of attempting to get the results of the query and retrying based on an error message which might change in the future this PR checks the status of the query via the AWS APIs to determine when it has succeeded and the results can be retrieved This also includes a minor change to perform the creation of the request token in a separate method that can be easily monkey patched for applications that always want to execute a query Currently if someone needs this behavior they must duplicate the entirety of the runstatement method to support this EDIT Note this was originally based on a version of Blazer prior to The change to poll for the status of the query is still an improvement to the general functionality of this adapter that should be considered Allows the credentials for the Athena adapter to be configured explicitly If the settings are not provided the AWS clients fallback to the normal process for resolving credentials that is currently used Hello So we have some queries that are way too big and heavy for browser rendering there is any chance that the result of the query on the view can crash the web browser in that process And what would it be your suggestion to surpass that problem We had an idea to avoid any problem like that that was creating an async process that would go to sidekiq and eventually send the generated csv to the users email The problem is that we tried to replicate the process of just running a query on the Rails Console and we were not able to do so Here are the step that we followed require securerandom runid SecureRandomuuid query BlazerQuerylast datasource Blazerdatasources querydatasource result datasourcerunresultsrunid We had a few queries saved so we used one of them Also just to make sure nothing was out of place we executed the rails server and executed the queries through the interface and worked just fine Regards Hi What do you think about having a limit setting that applies to all the queries if it is set The idea of this is to prevent the database or the server from having performance issues when executing queries that grab a large amount of data If you think that this can be helpful I can do a PR with the code Thanks After successfully connecting to a Redshift database I found that the Preview Table is blank We use Segmentcom for analytics which created a separate schema for every data source ex SELECT FROM mailchimpcampaigns Do you have any suggestions on how to preview the schemas and related tables when using Redshift Another implementation of Problem Unfortunately previous patch doesnt work When user push Download button it produces POST request with ready to fire query statement and already interpolated variables So there are no way to get variables in case of csv response Solution Adding query params to csv request explicitly Example The example name of downloaded file statistikapoofferuendtime t offerid periodweekstarttime t csv Hi I noticed myself downloading files changing variables then downloading more and needing to manually change the filename Curious if we could update this to include variable names and values As far as I can tell there is no map of vars to values theyre gsubed to create the statement within processvars Keeping track of the values in there might add some overhead you dont want but seems like a nicetohave This pull request is in reference to the add to dashboard from query page in the issue This PR allows the user to add the queries to multiple dashboards right from the query show page When the user adds the query this is appended to the end of the dashboard page with position n where n is the number of current queries on the dashboard When the user removes the query the query is deleted from the current position The dashboardquery positions are reset after removal of queries for each of the dashboards that were modified Below is a quick video for an overview of the functionality Play Video Blazer PR Hide Mastermind if userclass does not exist Below is the screenshot of the Add to Dashboard modal Hello Im using your project and its working very well now I would like to embed the dashboard view in a partial inside my main app is it possibile to do so Thanks
