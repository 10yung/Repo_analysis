So when you send an invite out to someone through the Plex interface it generates a direct accept URL were the server owner can give the person being referred the URL and heshe can go to the URL sign in and have the library automatically added So Im wondering if its possible to grab that url server side pass the login info the user provided when using the invite code for Organizr to Plex and auto accept that invite This would cut out the extra step of the individual accepting it through Plextv and then coming back to Organizr Especially useful for users who dont know how Plex works or for the lazies Im guessing this isnt gonna be possible but just throwing it out there Please Fill out as much information as possible Thanks Organizr Version V Official Docker Branch v Master WebServer Nginx

php Operating System CentOS hr Problem Description When using Plex oAuth for authentication I very often have to hit the login button more than once before oAuth connectivity is successfully established On firstsecond the Plex login popup window very briefly opens for less than a second and then immediately closes followed by a toast message on the Organizr page stating Error Connecting to oAuth Provider A second or third attempt allows the Plex oAuth login screen to open successfully and proceed with login as normal Its very inconsistent sometimes it will work fine on first attempt but mostly itll require hitting the login button times Clearly as all works fine on the second or third attempt this is very low priorityimpact However it would be interesting to understand more as to why this behaviour is happening and how it might be mitigated so that it consistently works the first time Are there any logs that might provide more details surrounding that error hr Reproduction Steps TYPE HERE Authentication Type Organizr DB Backend Authentication Backend Plex Enable Plex oAuth Enabled Minimal Login Screen Enabled All pagestabs of organizr configured to require minimum of User permissions to view Therefore when browsing to organizr while loggedout it defaults to the login page If any relevant config is missing here please let me know Browse to organizr while not logged in Defaults to login screen Select login with Plex auth Hit login button on organizr page onclickoAuthStartplex Often the firstsecond attempt results in error Error Connecting to oAuth Provider
