 Hi I upgraded my application from Swift to Swift and I get an error How do i fix this File GMStepperswift Error Argument labels stringInterpolationSegment do not match any available overloads Error is in areas Area else if isInteger labeltext StringstringInterpolationSegment Intvalue selfsuffixStringIntvalue else labeltext StringstringInterpolationSegment value selfsuffixStringvalue Area if selfshowIntegerIfDoubleIsInteger floorselfvalue selfvalue labeltext StringstringInterpolationSegment Intselfvalue selfsuffixString else labeltext StringstringInterpolationSegment Intselfvalue selfsuffixString I have to remove the right border of the left button and left a border of the right button How I can implement this Because I cant see any code of that Youre setting frames directly how can I have formatted text on the middle label when user clicks on the incrementer For an example Tag Tag will be incremented or decremented in a normal way func setup addSubviewleftButton addSubviewrightButton addSubviewlabel backgroundColor buttonsBackgroundColor layercornerRadius cornerRadius clipsToBounds true Commented this line out NotificationCenterdefaultaddObserverself selector selectorGMStepperreset name NSNotificationNameUIApplicationWillResignActive object nil Whenever the applicationWillResignActive AppDelegate function was being called the reset function would cause a found nil while unwrapping an optional value error Not sure why the steppers need to be reset when the application resigns honestly I commented the observer out and it seems to work fine If Im wrong in this or theres a better way to fix this error please do inform me Thanks First of all nice library I use it in my production app and i really enjoy it However today i noticed a strange behavior Lets say the step value is setted to Lets also say the stepper goes from to If autorepeat enabled and user presses on the stepper for long time the double gets rounded to for example This happens only when the maximum velocity of long pressing is reached I was able to solve it using a rounding functionto decimal place in my case worked great inside the value property Hope you gonna check this error and fix it Happy coding Hi Just I want to say it will be much better if it was a textfield not a label why because user can click on the textfield to change numbers using keyboard if the number hes want was bigger it will be useless clicking on button until reach it I use storyboard to create the stepper but it show me this error message Why screen shot at pm Hey It would be great if you would expose and make the var timerFireCountModulo Int into a property which we can change Currently its a getonly property Id like to remove the the longer you hold the faster itll change the value functionality and just make it increment based on my custom value which in this case would be From your comments sec sec That would be the ideal speed for me Thanks
