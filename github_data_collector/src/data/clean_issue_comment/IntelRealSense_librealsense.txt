Platform Raspberry Pi SDK Version legacy Language Segment Issue Description I have been trying for a long time to get the Poseapriltag example to work but I cant get the cpp to compile I have tried following the directions here but cant get it to compile at all Could someone help guide me through this process Hi everyone As reported on the official RealSense Twitter LIPS Corp have introduced a new RealSense powered product called the LIPSMetric Parcel Kiosk for measuring the dimensions and weight of a package and printing the label I need to merge rstrajectory and rssave to disk program also need to have multiple pipeline single device I have cameradevice connected and camera is on in video modenow i want to have image of that video which i can do using rssavetodisk codealso i need to find trajectory of the same video which i can find using rstrajectory code Now i want to merge this two codeproblem i am facing is rstrajectory uses cfg when we start pipelinebut rssavetodisk does not use cfg when we start pipelinehow can i do thisWhat I found is that I cannot use two pipelines for same cameradevice I guess please help me Thanks in advance Hii I am combining two realsense code ie rssavetodisk rstrajectory but when I run them together it gives error message RealSense error calling rs pipelinestartwithconfigpipe x config x ca No device connected Is there any way to solve this problem Hello I am working with the Tracking Camera T and i am facing problem when try to combine two programs together rssave to disk with rstrajectory it shows the error RealSense error calling rs pipelinestartwithconfigpipe x f config x e if anyone can help it would be greatful Thank you Warn users that try and fail to access frame metadata that they may be able to enable support for frame metadata by making OS level changes It took me quite a long time to figure this out and other users continue to run into this problem Required Info Camera Model D Firmware Version Operating System Version Linux Ubuntu Kernel Version Linux Only generic Platform DFI SDK Version Language C Segment Robot Issue Description We have a robot with Intel Realsense cameras connected to a DFI industrial computer We have observed during multiple incidents that either one or more cameras will disappear seamingly at random and it is not able to recover even after executing recovery behaviours such as hardwarereset through the SDK When this happens we are not able to query the cameras through rsenumeratedevices The only solution that is reliable is powering down the system completely for an extended time minutes or most of the times it works with physically replugging the cameras None of these is not a valid solution for us By reading associated issues we came across solutions that suggest bumping the firmware to the latest recommended version we did that recently solutions that suggest changing the USB cables we have tested many the provided ones and high end aftermarket but the issue persists We also tested the suggestion from to bindunbind the xhcihd driver but it does not help in our case Finally we have performed the test from We perform the test times with D cameras attached to a single DFI which resulted in cameras disappearing after a short while and they didnt recover even through shutting down the machine for minutes Ive attached the output of the beforementioned test in experimentlog and the output of dmesg after each experiment in sysloglog We also caught one of the random camera disconnectsreconnect after which it didnt work and we performed a hardware reset and it still didnt work Ive attached the syslog from that event and called it camerarandomlydisappearinglog sysloglog realsenselog experimentlog camerarandomlydisappearinglog Camera

registration happens before recordsensorhooksensorcallbacks is called which is to register stream callback The stream callback registration overwritten musernotificationcallback that has been registered as reloc notification callback That caused recursive call on onnotification and will crash App Fix register notification callback to base sensor before recordsensorhooksensorcallbacks is called which is to register stream callback
