The nodesourcereleaseel noarchrpm package provides a repo for source rpms but the base url value returns a Hi Was wondering what it would take to build and provide IBM Power ppc le RPM packages for nodesource here Node is already well supported on Power and I can help with any changes needed to build scripts and such please let me know Thanks and looking forward for your support The Nodejs RPM appears to be configured such that requests made with the http module print noisy debug messages to standard error and there is no way to suppress them I originally filed this bug as googleapisnodejslogging the Google Cloud Nodejs Logging module which uses the http module under the hood Steps to reproduce Install Nodejs x on Centos from the NodeSource repository consider starting from a cleanroom environment like the centoscentos dockerhub image bash curl sL bash sudo yum install y nodejs Note this also reproduces on the x stream Run the following Nodejs program from javascript const http requirehttp const client http connect clientonerror err consoleerrorerr const req clientrequest path reqonresponse headers flags for const name in headers consolelogname headers

to the READMEmd Supported Ubuntu versions NodeSource will maintain Ubuntu distributions in active support by Canonical including LTS and the intermediate releases Ubuntu LTS Trusty Tahr not available for Nodejs and later Ubuntu LTS Xenial Xerus Ubuntu LTS Bionic Beaver Ubuntu Cosmic Cuttlefish Ubuntu Disco Dingo Ubuntu Eoan Ermine However a Release file for Node on Trusty Tahr exists Is this intentional What is the support status for Node on Trusty Tahr Will the Release file be purged at some point yum install nodejs Nodejs Packages for Enterprise Linux x kBs kB Error Problem cannot install the best candidate for the job nothing provides usrbinpython needed by nodejs nodesourcex nothing provides python needed by nodejs nodesourcex try to add skipbroken to skip uninstallable packages or nobest to use not only best candidate packages But in CentOS there is no package provides usrbinpython you can install different versions and create symlink So is only way to install nodejs use rpm without deps rpm i nodejs nodesourcex rpm nodeps Related to Hey I have a Debian no DE machine and I need to install Node to get MineOS working Problem is that Im pretty sure it wont work I already had Debian installed two times and it didnt work these are the commands I used curl sL bash aptget y install nodejs node version and I got blah blah blah I got the commands from the official mineos wiki If anyone knows a workaround to get node on Debian please share your fix with me Im decently familiar with the Linux environment but I dont think Im great at troubleshooting lol Have a great day We use setup x on an Ubuntu VM hosted on Azure When this machine deploys we call the following code from a bash script bash curl sL sudo E bash sudo DEBIANFRONTENDnoninteractive aptget y install nodejs Sometimes the first script fails with the following output Installing the NodeSource Nodejs x repo Populating aptget cache aptget update Hit bionic InRelease Hit bionicupdates

sure the error is related to the setup x script but any help is appreciated Thanks When I install nodejs on an debian system debian buster with sama d processor and I start node afterward I got an illegal instruction immediately I tried with the official debian package dfsg and seval packages provided here x x and all show the identical behaviour I found a issue for buildroot that may be
