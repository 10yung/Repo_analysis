Create a stable Java D specific method to convert a Picture to a BufferedImage This will allow fun pixel art in conjunction with This should be a new kind of effect type class I think The Bitmap algebra provides some basic support for loading bitmaps I think it would be better to have support for working with BufferedImage utility methods to load BufferedImage from disk with various forms of error handling eg dont care return Either etc algebra to insert a BufferedImage into a Picture Filling with gradients is supported by both SVG and Java D I think It would be useful to expose this functionality within Doodle as it opens up more creative possibilities See what SVG and Java D support Model as an algebraic data type probably gradient linear radial Extend DrawingContext to allow gradient fills Implement in backends Basic support for charts exists on featureplotting This currently supports only scatter plots and D numeric data Id like to implement bar charts as the next chart type This requires supporting categorical data Longer term well need more complex data types Part of the work here is exploring different representations A nongoal at this point is to support multiple plots series per chart Here are some of the tasks Extend Series to support categorical data Factor chart interpreter into reusable components Implement bar charts Text layout on both Java D and SVG seems wrong see eg BoxesAndArrowsflatMapdraw Investigate this and resolve if possible Text in SVG supports separate stroke and fill They way we currently draw text on Java D uses the stroke color as the fill We can get more control over text rendering using the TextLayout API and in particular either the draw or getOuline methods on TextLayout
