Hi Im experiencing some strange issue with my Nsynth build I already spent hours to troubleshoot but couldnt source the problem I am very desperate Everything seems to be working fine except the OLED screen doesnt work remains totally black there is no sound at all since there is no sound I dont know if midi signals get processed or not I already checked for any soldering bridges and checked for the right polarity of all components Even though Im quite confident in my soldering skills out of pure desperation I decided to build a second unit with a second set of components including a new screen As for the second unit I followed this advice and left a tiny gap between the PCB to avoid any solder bridges To my surprise the finished build shows EXACTLY the same issue as the first one I used Elecrow to produce the PCB according to the build instructions I sourced and soldered all components myself including SMD I have a raspberry B with the gb image I also tried it with a raspberry B but still the same problem Nsynth starts up normally I logged in and successfully flashed the board When I connect the Nsynth to a monitor via HDMI the miniscreen appears on the upper left corner I can see on the monitor that the encoders the pots and the touch panel work completely fine All pins on the OLED PCB have voltage So unlike this user it doesnt seem that bad solder joint are the cause of the problem I bridged both the SJ and SJ on the OLED PCB Running i cdetect y shows MCU at x the display at x d and a device at x c Please help Hi I have a PI B and it seemed to be the default option a while ago But today when I tried the latest image onss full it appeared to be nonfunctional on my Pi What is the image compatible with PI B and how can I download it Or is the only option now to switch to PI B Thanks Hello I just finished my build using the original PCB layout As I did not get the encoders without momentary switch I use encoders with switch but I did not cut off the unnecessary legs I just bent them upwards so they are lying on top of the PCB If I read the current version of the schematics correctly the switches for using the new feature to store patches are connected between ground and GPIO pins So would it be possible to use some thin wire to connect one pin of each encoder to ground and the other one to the correct GPIO pin or are there other changes to the schematics to make this feature work Regards Danyel Hello I got an SMT presoldered PCB from ebay really cheap and just finished building my NSynth Super It is working all pots and encoders functioning correctly The only issue I have so far is that the contents on the OLED display seem to be too far left just one pixel I think so the first column is cut off Perhaps the OLED is buggy but as it is quite expensive and I don t want to order a new one is there a way to change the position of the displays contents so I could move everything just this one pixel to the right Regards Danyel Hello I just finished an d print enclosure for the nsynth It worked quiet well without support and Ethernet still accessible I am currently unable to run bazel build magentatoolspipbuildpippackage I am receiving the error ERROR magentaWORKSPACE name newhttparchive is not defined ERROR Error evaluating WORKSPACE file ERROR error loading package Encountered error while reading extension file

got my unit All controls runs fine But no sound at jack Is there any command line to test the sound Thank you the cleanfilespy script converts from wav to mp and then back to wav again whats the
