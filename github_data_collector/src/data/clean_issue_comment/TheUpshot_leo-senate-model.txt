I was interested in using this code for a project but as it stands Im stumped on how to get it up and running When I run the basic code this is the output I get Does anyone have any suggestions issue Trying to run the script returns an error The last lines are hi buddy just fyi im not using any Q fec data because i think you dont have it yet in Error in dataframetmp pie value replacement has row data has Calls source eval eval pollPredict dataframe Execution halted The problem is within the forecastobj pollPredict d newpolls newraces line in the senatemodel R file I had successfully run the model only once on July nd Would be great to get a daily dump of the poll data Otherwise its hard to replicate the NYTs own math follow along at home or explore alternate assumptions Im imagining this is mainly an individualized problem since I dont see any other error postings on here but if its not heres a screenshot of my output when the simulation starts It might be a good idea to fix the random seed used for the realizations of the simulation in case readers are interested in reproducing exactly the numbers reported on the NYT Upshot Web site I have tried with todays data and cannot quite match the figures on the Web site For example even after trying several times I cant get up to for New Hampshire The public figure is But there is some runtorun slop that comes from the randomness and it would be easier to debug if I knew I was using the same random seed as the public figures
