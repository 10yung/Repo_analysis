I want to get the same shape for the input and output frame by using the TLDdemo where should I do modification Hi I am trying to use TLD for the first time I changed the path in compilem file based on the instruction on page In Original TLD opencv was used I modified my libpath to include files libopencvso The compile file ran without any errors However I try to run runTLDm I get the following error Invalid MEXfile homeITSabshindeDownloadsOpenTLDmastermexlkmexa libopencvcalib dso cannot open shared object file No such file or directory Error in tldInit at lk Error in tldExample at tld tldInitopt train initial detector and initialize the tld structure Error in runTLD at bbconf tldExampleopt I tried searching on forums but could not get relevant info Can you point me in right direction How would I go about retraining the classifier Hi there Im trying to run the TLD algorithm on Ubuntu bit and MatLAB R b I have not installed openCV but rather the libraries as stated in the installation guide by sudo aptget install libcvdev When running compilem from within MatLAB I get the error s Error using mex tmpmex lko In function normCrossCorrelationIplImage IplImage CvPoint D f

mex link of lkmexa failed compile line eval mex lkcpp O include lib so I hope to know what is the problem Thank you I ran some video containing human moving and want to tracking that human I run example video motor bike with a good result But when I run on my video it produces lousy results Yellow bounding box sometimes does not move Is there anyone supported this project pls have a discussion Can anybody help me I ran the Open TLD and it is working fine Now I just want to use my own video and track the object For that I need to resize the yellow box and move the coordinates Could you tell me which m file I should be updating to achieve this an abs function has added the original expression will make a mistake in the casebb I got this error when i tried to compile TLD windows bit VS matlab b bit opencv PC lkcpp lkcpp fatal error C Cannot open include file cvh No such file or directory C PROGRA MATLAB R B BIN MEXPL Error Compile of lkcpp failed Error using mex at
