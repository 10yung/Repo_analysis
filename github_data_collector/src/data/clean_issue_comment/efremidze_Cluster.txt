X I updated Cluster to the latest version X I read the Contribution Guidelines X I read the documentation X I searched for existing GitHub issues Hi Would it be possible to add a SwiftUI Example of how to incorporate Cluster into a project in SwiftUI project in Xcode Thanks a lot Provide a short summary of your issue in the Title above With a minimum interaction it reclusters the spots also the groups are different each time when the map comes back to same location and same zoom level it should always do the same groupings There should be a variable for sensitivity which should control the clustering sensitivity on zoom change algorithm should be updated so that it should do groups same each time for same location and same zoom level New Issue Checklist Before you submit your issue

standard updating blue dot while using Cluster on a mapview but I cannot figure out how to do this I have tried to figure it out in the example app as a base solution but checking the User Location box for the map in the storyboard doesnt add it I have also tried to programmatically add it using mapViewshowsUserLocation true but this doesnt work either though I may have put it in the wrong place I am guessing this is a simple fix that I am just not seeing any help would be much appreciated Environment iOS Version Devices iPhone Description Calling MKMapViewshowAnnotationsMKAnnotation will zoom the map appropriately to show the annotations passed in however the cluster manager will never cluster those annotations again even after calling reload I tried using the function in ways When a cluster is clicked mapViewshowAnnotationsclusterAnnotationannotations animated true When the annotations are initially created mapViewshowAnnotationsnewAnnotations animated true In the first case the annotations from the cluster are never clustered again In the second case no annotations are ever clustered Smartphone Device iPhone XR iPhone OS iOS Version Checklist I updated Cluster to the latest
