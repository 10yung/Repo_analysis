In order to get a similar result as the base graphics xspline function the base proto class has to be a path and not a line In most cases there will be no difference although in all the cases when the order of the control points has not an increasing x variable the result with a line will be a jittered output see bug report for details Fixes issue There is a bug in the implementation of geomxspline that produce a jittered line Looks like the result is rendered similarly to a geomline rather than a geompath r libraryggplot libraryggalt dtest dataframeGDP c L L L L L GINI c p

the ggalt to replace an existing geomline in my ggplot object When using ggarrange and geomxspline a blank screen was output and no other plots could be passed through RStudio until the session was restarted I left a similar post on the ggpubr GitHub page however I believe the source of the bug resides in ggalt Working Code wo geomxspline r libraryggplot libraryggpubr myplot ggplotdata mtcars

in RStudio There is also a proposed solution to address the issue by making adjustments to geomxspline I am not sure if this is a feasible solution to add to ggalt on CRAN but it appears to work with

cool btw to plot values on the xaxis to compare the distances between them Because it only takes x and xend args im using geomdumbbell twice efectively solving my problem However since my data changes everytime i run the plot sometimes the line connecting x and xend of the last plot being created goes over one of the points Can you see a way around this or another way of plotting values using geomdumbbell example attached dumbbell I just had a request for the algorithm used by geomencircle This is what I sent I ought to flesh this out slightly and add it to the docs finds the convex hull of the points if desired based on the expand argument moves the points defining the convex hull outward away from the centroid constructs an xspline through these points the details of this and a literature citation are given in gridxsplineGrob Hello I was wondering if a feature for geomdumbbell that would allow the user to select the linetype used to connect the ends of each point has been considered Or perhaps I am missing something in the documentation I looked through past issues that may be related to this request but the closest I found was a thread asking for a parameter for arrowsdirection Thank you I think that the function comma has been changed and now by default number get rounded to the nearest integer The pull request adds the parameter to restore the original behavior that was to print one decimal digit Without PR r byteformat Gb with PR r byteformat Gb
