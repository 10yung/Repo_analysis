Is RoughJS support WebGL Or maybe sometimes it will support webgl context Is it possible to output an individual path to represent the hature pattern as opposed to the pattern fill that currently exists The current form causes problems for SVG parsing and plotting software Is this library supposed to work with node Ive been developing an imagemorph application with it It works great in the browser but when I try to recreate the steps in backend for async generation or batches the fill doesnt cover the paths in whole I use svg I have tried using canvas instead and it doesnt work I think its because of getBBox Is there any hackworkaround you already know for it to work img height src height src height src images are original browser and node respectively Thanks I am having issues with Rough SVG and importing the created SVG into inkscape The svg looks like this in chrome firefox Inkscape shows the file like this with some bizzarre clipping The reason why I would like this in inkscape is because I would like to plot the SVG using an AxiDraw The following code below is how I am creating the SVG I m thinking that because I m using roughCanvaspath it creates a SVG pattern and not individual paths per line Any help would be hugely appreciated function setup let roughSvg roughsvgdocumentgetElementByIdsvg const roughCanvas roughsvgsvg drawpathroughCanvas M l M L M l M L M l M l M l M l M l M l M l M l M l M l M l M l M l M l M l M L M l M l M L M l M l M l M l M l M L M l M l M L M L M l M l M l M l M l M l M l M l M L M l M l M l M l M l M l M l M l hatchpathroughCanvas M style hachure gap hatchpathroughCanvas M style hachure gap angle hatchpathroughCanvas M style hachure gap hatchpathroughCanvas M style hachure gap hatchpathroughCanvas M style hachure gap hatchpathroughCanvas M style hachure gap hatchpathroughCanvas M style hachure gap angle hatchpathroughCanvas M style hachure gap hatchpathroughCanvas M style hachure gap hatchpathroughCanvas M style hachure gap angle hatchpathroughCanvas M style hachure gap hatchpathroughCanvas M style hachure gap hatchpathroughCanvas M style hachure gap hatchpathroughCanvas M style hachure gap angle hatchpathroughCanvas M style hachure gap angle saveSvgsvg blockstestsvg function draw function hatchpathroughCanvas path style crosshatch gap angle roughness bowing svgappendChildroughCanvaspathpath roughness roughness bowing bowing hachureAngle angle hachureGap gap fillStyle style fillWeight fill black strokeWidth function drawpathroughCanvas path roughness bowing svgappendChildroughCanvaspathpath roughness roughness bowing bowing strokeWidth function saveSvgsvgEl name svgElsetAttributexmlns var svgData svgElouterHTML var preface xml version standaloneno r n var svgBlob new Blob preface svgData type imagesvgxmlcharsetutf var svgUrl URLcreateObjectURLsvgBlob var downloadLink documentcreateElementa downloadLinkhref svgUrl downloadLinkdownload name documentbodyappendChilddownloadLink downloadLinkclick documentbodyremoveChilddownloadLink When trying to update Semiotic to use a version of Rough that was not my own ES tenderized version I get the following error Failed to minify the code from this file nodemodulesroughjsdistroughumdjs Are there certain settings for babel and rollup necessary to build Rough in a project const rough requireroughjs works with but with consolelog on rough just gives I wanna add drag and drop on canvas items via konvajs Seems that roughgenerator is not capable Implement dashed lines for canvas setLineDash js const rc roughcanvasdocumentgetElementByIdcanvas rcrectangle lineDash for svg strokedasharray js const rc roughsvgsvg let node rcrectangle lineDash svgappendChildnode This would be a great addition I think I experienced an odd error when trying to test an app using this library The apps written in Typescript using React using Jest and Enzyme for testing I have a component that imports this library with import rough from roughjs then tries to use it to draw with this code const rc roughcanvasthiscanvasRef rcline However when running tests using reactscriptsts envjsdom this code errors out with Error Uncaught TypeError Cannot read property canvas of undefined This happens even if canvas or canvasprebuilt is installed in the project I can fix the problem by checking if rough before drawing which would seem to indicate that the rough object doesnt exist in the test environment
