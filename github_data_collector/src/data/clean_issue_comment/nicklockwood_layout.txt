Hi After upgrading my operating system to Catalina macOS my application that is using Layout gets stuck on the launch screen I dont have any compilation errors or warnings and I dont get any crash at runtime There is nothing new shown in debug logs as well It worked fine in the previous macOS version High Sierra My other applications that are not using this Pod dont get stuck on the launch screen Has anyone a similar problem Layout version Xcode Swift The setStringValueforExpression method on UIView can set any value from a string just like Layout does when looking at the XML attributes for a View This expands the possibilities of the setValueforExpression which needs the value to be of the right type Hi nicklockwood Layout is really great at creating completely custom and dynamically serverside created GUIs However I would like to alter the GUI appearance at runtime based on a serverside implementation To do so in my ViewController which hosts a mounted LayoutNode I created a method that will be called after receiving a message from the network func setViewValuetag Int valueName String newValue String guard let baseView selfview else return if let v baseViewviewWithTagtag try vsetValuenewValue forExpressionvalueName This already works flawlessly for String properties like title However I would like to set any property type just as Layout does in XML I dont need to handle complicated expressions just be able to specify a UIColor falsetrue geometry or number values It seems to me that the steps would be search in the layoutNode expressionTypes dictionary for the right type create a LayoutExpression object with the expression name value type and the layoutNode evaluate the expression call setValueForExpression with the result of the evaluation However many of these methods or even entire structs LayoutExpression are declared internal Is there a readymade method for doing this Am I missing something Or a major rework would be needed to do this If yes can you point me in the right direction I can come back with a pull request once I have this finished Thanks We have a custom view and we overrode layoutSubviews as recommended open override func layoutSubviews superlayoutSubviews Ensure layout is updated after screen rotation etc selflayoutNodeviewframe selfbounds Update frame to match layout selfframesize selfintrinsicContentSize and it would appear the app is stuck in some kind of infinite loop our custom view layoutSubviews and layoutlayoutSubviews being called forever and blocking the main thread extension UIView fileprivate static func swizzle guard viewSwizzled else return replaceselectorlayoutSubviews of self with selectorlayoutlayoutSubviews viewSwizzled true Swizzled layoutSubviews implementation objc private func layoutlayoutSubviews layoutlayoutSubviews layoutNodeupdateLayout When adding arranged subviews to a Layout stack view programmatically it doesnt update its height from the initial so all the subviews get placed at However when I add the subviews to the stack view XML they stack up correctly theyre probably calculating their childrens heights in that case So does anyone know what Im missing I guess I want to confirm before I spend more time banging my head against the rock whether or not theres an obvious method to solve this problem or if I need to look into calculating the heights myself Edit I do need to mention that setting the stack views frame to a new CGRect doesnt have any effect Reading out its frameheight value confirms that its still at after something like stackViewframe CGRectx y width height All of this is happening in my UIViewControllers viewDidLoad method Add capabiilty to load XML from Data in LayoutLoading protocol New pull request tested against version Everything else seems to work fine except when tapping away on focused UITextField the app become unresponsive It is reproducible using SampleApp project provided in the repository Details Xcode Beta M q iOS Simulator iPhone XR iOS Steps to reproduce Simply add the UI component as such in Textxml xml UITextField topSPACING width height backgroundColorwhite Run the SampleApp scheme Go to Text tab Tap on the textfield type something and tap somewhere else to defocus Result App become unresponsive In console it shows atos atos cannot examine process SampleApp for unknown reasons even though it appears to exist try running with sudo WARNING Cant read from symbolizer at fd However in my own project it showed different error nwconnectionreceiveinternalblockinvoke C Receive reply failed with error Operation canceled Thread info Is there a way to achieve that When Im trying something like this swift class MyTableViewCell UITableViewCell LayoutLoading Im getting the following error Type MyTableViewCell does not conform to protocol LayoutLoading My original problem is that I want to use a library like Kingfisher or SDWebImage to load an image inside my cell layoutNodesetState doesnt allow that so it looks like I need an outlet but I dont know how to create an outlet for a view in a Layoutbased UITableViewCell I can create a custom view for my cell contents and then manually put it into a UITableViewCell subclass but is there a better way to do it Could you please tell me how I can create a dynamic height collectionviewcell xml using this library
