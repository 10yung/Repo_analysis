Can this be installed via Carthage in an ObjectiveC app I received this warning when I recently submitted an app that uses ClusterPrePermissions from the app store This app attempts to access privacysensitive data without a usage description The apps Infoplist must contain an NSCalendarsUsageDescription key with a string value explaining to the user how the app uses this data Im not using the Calendar permissions at all Im only using microphone permissions In my project running I imported ClusterPrePermissions but I got dozens of warnings of deprecations UIAlertView ALAuthorizationStatus ALAssetsLibrary etc Im not sure how open source code is supposed to deal with OS version changes so what is the best way to deal with this and does this warrant an issue in the future Thanks I am using showPushNotificationPermissionsWithType method for a prevalidation of the push notifications The first time the method is executed works fine But if I request again the permission check then the result is always false I changed the completionHandlerstatus ClusterAuthorizationStatusUnDetermined to completionHandlerstatus ClusterAuthorizationStatusAuthorized and worked for me ClusterPrePermissions now supported Photo LibraryCameraMicrophoneContacts ListEventsLocation did you have a plan to support Bluetooth permissions If user denies access in system dialog and then tries to use the function that requires permission ClisterPermissions will not show dialog and return a negative result without interaction It is logical in this situation to show the prepermission dialog and if user tap Give access open Settings UIApplicationOpenSettingsURLString Developer wont have to implement whole opening of UIApplicationOpenSettingsURLString and leave it to ClusterPermissions With Xcode no longer supporting iOS simulators I think the writing is on the wall for iOS support Also since June we have been required to submit our apps with at least the iOS SDK Is there a way to customize the permission dialog the first dialog not the system dialog
