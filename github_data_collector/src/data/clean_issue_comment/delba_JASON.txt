Running the benchmark with SwiftyJSON currently the latest shows a perf gain with JASON ondevice with a C Just wanted to make a note for others who might be searching for ondevice benchmarks feel free to close the issue Related the following test case shows a x speed improvement with JASON over SwiftyJSON in what I have found to be the most frequent bottleneck in my projects large NSDictionary data objects The issue comes up if I use JASONJSONKeyswift included in my project From what I gather by reading the recommended practice is to copypaste source code instead of using a package manager if you want any of the extensions Perhaps the extensions could be supplied through subspecs in CocoaPods It is how PromiseKit handles extensions Carthage does not support subspecs but you can emulate the behavior by having a separate repository for the optional dependencies You can still have keep them in one repository by using git submodules
