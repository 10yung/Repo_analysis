fixed Because an ingress into a cluster can vary wildly in their desired configuration a new setting in the Kiali CR is being introduced to allow the user to override complete portions of the ingress resource configuration Ingress on Kubernetes and Route on OpenShift See the new setting in the Kiali CR for an example and the docs commenting the new setting For users that use these overrides they are required to make sure the new configuration is valid the operator will just blindly copy those settings into the resource no validation is performed other than the validation the k s master performs when it applies the new config to the resource tillig can you see if this provides what you need Based on your comments in the issue you will want something like this in your Kiali CR spec deployment overrideingressyaml metadata annotations kubernetesioingressclass nginx spec tls your tls settings rules host yourhosthere http paths path kiali backend serviceName kiali servicePort I think it is a bit weird to see the Istio Config status text and success icon on namespaces where istio isnt enabled no sidecar on any of the pods Capture d cran de Maybe we should either show a not available grey icon or maybe just remove the whole text icon in this situation cc xeviknal lucasponce Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe We have a Kubernetes cluster with both the Istio ingress and nginx ingress enabled The nginx ingress has a specific IP address and routes traffic based on host header along with IP address The ingress configuration in the Kiali CR only allows me to enable or disable the ingress I have no ability to add a host entry to the ingress specify that the ingress should be nginx vs Istio eg kubernetesioingressclass nginx or provide any other guiding annotations You also cant specify any tls settings to get LetsEncrypt or certmanager into the mix Describe the solution youd like Ability to control the ingress annotations specruleshost spectls etc at a more granular level or more guidance on writing a custom ingress definition where to get the service nameport where to deploy the ingress what things in the CR YAML correspond to things that show up in the ingress Describe alternatives youve considered Im currently exporting the existing ingress setting the CR to disable the ingress and deploying a custom ingress thats based on what the operator generates but has proper markup for our environment Fixes In a case that we have problems getting information from a service Use Case that we found apithreescalenamespacesbookinfoservicesproductpage the information returned is json errorrulesconfigistioio threescalebookinfoproductpage not found Problems found We cant see this error in KialiUi messageCenter So the user cant know what is happening Should this error block all the information about the service Can we create somekind of errorfound in the json and return the information that we found ErrorTraces Icon is hidden because there is not information about them because kiali return this information in the same call and the user could see error Traces in the chart Impact cc xeviknal lucasponce jotak hhovsepy Describe the change Removing all the outdated validations that Galley takes care of Adding one warning validation for the following scenario yaml kind VirtualService apiVersion networkingistioiov alpha metadata name reviews namespace bookinfo spec hosts reviews http route destination host reviews subset v weight This is the scenario where there is only one destinationRouteWeight but there is a weight different to In this case Istio assumes the weight to be Independently the value set in the weight field The validation message is the following The weight is assumed to be because there is only one route destination Issue reference Relates to Screeeenshot Screenshot of localhost apinamespacesbookinfoistiovirtualservicesreviewsvalidatetrue Spans in metrics page have a span id and iirc trace id associated with So when clicking on it we could open the Traces page focused on that trace id What Im unsure is if its ok to abruptly switch to trace view might be too abrupt or if we should display a contextual menu with a View trace option I think when Albertos work is done this is the next logical step in our Metrics Traces work cc lucasponce aljesusg Related to When auto enabling display options on graph as needed by the desired graph findhide expression there is a message generated to user explaining about auto enabling those options This seems to be the correct approach except that the message is displayed in red and with X and it should be instead informational The version of k s cluster is v and istio is v After I installed istioI try to get graph and the result as follows the logs show but when the k s is v everything is ok If it is the version issue Happens on Kiali UI b a a fb e c b f f Kiali Server v SNAPSHOT b f dec
