Im getting an error when trying to look up some functions from the scater Bioconductor package Its giving me an error about BiocInstaller which shouldnt be an issue since thats been replaced with BiocManager lookuplookupscatercalculateQCMetrics Error in loadNamespacename there is no package called BiocInstaller sessionInfo R version Platform x pclinuxgnu bit Running under Ubuntu LTS Matrix products default BLAS usrlibx linuxgnublaslibblasso LAPACK hometsundokuanaconda liblibmklrtso locale LCCTYPEenCAUTF LCNUMERICC LCTIMEenCAUTF LCCOLLATEenCAUTF LCMONETARYenCAUTF LCMESSAGESenCAUTF LCPAPERenCAUTF LCNAMEC LCADDRESSC LCTELEPHONEC LCMEASUREMENTenCAUTF LCIDENTIFICATIONC attached base packages parallel stats stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base other attached packages scater SingleCellExperiment SummarizedExperiment DelayedArray BiocParallel matrixStats Biobase GenomicRanges GenomeInfoDb IRanges S Vectors BiocGenerics ggplot rlang lookup Seurat dplyr loaded via a namespace and not attached ggbeeswarm Rtsne colorspace ggridges XVector BiocNeighbors rstudioapi leiden listenv npsurv ggrepel codetools splines RmethodsS lsei zeallot jsonlite ica cluster png Roo uwot sctransform BiocManager compiler httr backports assertthat Matrix lazyeval BiocSingular htmltools tools rsvd igraph gtable glue GenomeInfoDbData RANN reshape Rcpp vctrs gdata ape nlme DelayedMatrixStats gbRd lmtest stringr globals lifecycle irlba gtools future MASS zlibbioc zoo scales RColorBrewer memoise reticulate pbapply gridExtra stringi highlite caTools bibtex Rdpack SDMTools pkgconfig bitops lattice ROCR purrr htmlwidgets labeling cowplot tidyselect RcppAnnoy plyr magrittr R gplots pillar withr fitdistrplus survival RCurl tibble futureapply tsne crayon KernSmooth plotly viridis grid datatable metap digest tidyr Rutils RcppParallel munsell beeswarm viridisLite vipor The temp directory would be kept around so its only unwrapped once per session Then ESS and RStudio can use this to jump to source for all packages with dangling srcrefs eg packages installed from CRAN when RKEEPPKGSOURCE is set Might be worth writing in pure base R and proposed for inclusion in the utils package Since it isnt needed by most users who use RStudio and development status is uncertain Maybe in RStudio it would be simply better to use the viewer providing GitHub pages embedded in a tabset with iframes So that when I print a function the source appears in RStudio ie Id rather open source links in github since Im typically looking for Rs C sources and would like to share with others It would be nice to do that in one step instead of too lookup lookupbrowse ie when youre looking for the default method of an internal generic I discovered this bug From clean R session r librarylookup lookupmean basemeanDate basemeandefault basemeandifftime basemeanPOSIXct basemeanPOSIXlt Which S methods A ll A Error m must be the result of regexpr with perl TRUE A side note Can I use your package to figure out what happened here So you can easily share with others r methodsplot requirelookup lookupplotdataframe getS methodplot classdataframe I m happy to fix this one later when I have time Thanks for a great package
