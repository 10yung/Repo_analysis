Sorry I missed this case Should work better now Platform Chrome Raspberry Pi Node Version MagicMirror Version v recently updated Description Events that I have declined are still being displayed Steps to Reproduce Add calendar Make a recurring event Decline them Expected Results Declined event are usually showed with overstrike but I would like to have the option to hide them completely Actual Results There is no difference between declined events and coming events Hi I have two issues with the new of MM have added a th ICS and I cant get it to show the dates in the calendars the other ICS is working fine The last link is the link in the and is not showed calendars symbol calendar url LINK TO WORKING GOOGLE ICS symbol birthdaycake url LINK TO WORKING GOOGLE ICS symbol calendar url LINK TO WORKING GOOGLE ICS symbol calendar url Im using fullDayEventDateFormat DD MMM but appears as Do MMM jan maybe for every second lines and MMM Do Jan maybe for the others in between config fullDayEventDateFormat DD MMM timeFormat abdolute urgency calendars Can someone help with Why the th ICS link is not showed Why i get the two datetypes Do MMM and MMM Do when I im my configjs file have DD MMM UPDATE Have tried this but with no luck Since I open sourced MagicMirror I have received many awesome pull requests adding a lot of nice features to the Magic Mirror core I am very grateful for that Unfortunately this comes with a downside the application gets a lot more complicated The reason I open sourced MagicMirror was because it is a perfect starter project for newcomers Getting their feet wet in javascript and software development in general see manifesto With the current complexity this project is slowly moving away from this I also noted that the amount of bash code is increasing while the main intention of version was to try to do everything in program language javascript Opposed to v which was a combination of languages like PHP Javascript en in some cases Python Looking at other OS projects there are some beautiful examples on how the project can be focused at what it does best One example I like to mention is OctoPrintOctoPi Software to control your D printer While foosel does a great job to maintain the core application OctoPrint the packaged Rasberry Pi image OctoPi is maintained in a different repo by a different user GuySoft If we use that same approach there are a lot of things we can take out the core repo and let other users start their own repos to accomplish the same features while separating concerns In my opinion the following parts could initially be taken out of the core repo and taken over by other repos Installer script Update script Start Script PM integration Docker Package Of course we wont take out these features as long as no other solutions are in place As an install and update replacement we need to write a good manual The added benefit of this approach is that the release schedule of the above features is no longer tied to the quarterly release schedule of MagicMirror With the new approach I think its good to set a few guidelines to which the future versions should adhere Javascript HTML CSS only No compile scripts ie webpack sass less Focus only on Raspberry support InstallRunUpdate using default commands npm install git pull etc Which will help people to learn and understand these commands Since this project would have never been such a success without the help of the community I want to discuss this approach before taking any action So Im looking forward to your input Please let me know what you think with an open mind Thanks Michael EDIT Provisional TO DO List Based on the discussion below I made a provisional to do list which could be the base for the simplification of this repository The to do list is not set in stone and could change based on the feedback in this issue Remove installer scripts make sure an external repository is available as a replacement Remove update scripts Remove start script Separate Client Serveronly commands as regular npm commands npm run start npm run server Cleanup folders remove installers splashscreen and remove all root sh files Where necessary replace shell code with javascript code Implement handler for incompatible modules X Create separate documentation site and repo Improve documentation on how to install and update This should reflect the procedure without an installerupdater but it should also mention the available third party installersupdaters Make an overview of the hard and software requirements Make an overview of the supported tested hardware and operating systems Feel free to share your ideas and feedback when running the automated tests e e there is a section to verify that all the used terms are

Since the time shift in Germany last sunday reocurring events are in the old time zone h in Google Calendar they are displayed correctly but on the mirror itself they are displayed wrong Steps to Reproduce make new calendar with reocurring event not whole day event and try to display it Expected Results the right time Actual Results the time h Configuration Do you have any idea how to fix this The timezones on the raspberry itself is correct Ive been using Magic Mirror and want to store secrets eg OpenWeather API keys outside of my configuration file so I can commit the file to source control This would also allow for easier Docker image creation where you could poke in some environment variables rather than full config files Doing this has been a challenge The configjs is used in both a server and a client context That is instead of the Electron client app retrieving configuration from the config endpoint of the server the configjs is used directly This means any references to processenv dont work because Electron doesnt provide the process environment on the server to the running client This issue shows an example of that process doesnt exist by default and even if you enable nodeIntegration the process that Electron is running under isnt the same as the process the server started under Instead you need to requireelectron and access the electronremoteprocessenv to get those variables marshaled over But Electron nodeIntegration is off by default Its also turned off in the main electronjs This can be overridden by config There is a discussion where I raised this over in the forum A working configjs with environment variables looks like this js const owApiKeyName OPENWEATHERAPIKEY var remote null if typeof window undefined remote windowrequireelectronremote var readEnvironment function name if typeof process undefined processenv name process is undefined in the Electron app return processenv name if remote remoteprocessenv name remote is null if the Electron nodeIntegration value isnt set to true return remoteprocessenv name var config address localhost port ipWhitelist ffff language en timeFormat units imperial electronOptions webPreferences

broadcastNewsUpdates true DO NOT EDIT THE LINE BELOW if typeof module undefined moduleexports config The idea is that you have to fall back from process to remoteprocess before you can get to the environment Id like to propose a couple things that would make environment variable usage easier Separate client and server configuration such that The client only needs the endpoint to query and the Electron options The server has the endpoint to serve on and the module configuration Change the Electron app to query module configurations from the server rather than directly using configjs From a backwards compatibility perspective you could treat configjs as something that both use and the difference would be that the module settings on the Electron side that are read from configjs would be ignored in favor of retrieved settings lease only submit re When submitting a new issue please supply the following information Platform Raspberry Pi MagicMirror Version latest version pulled from git Description The calendar plugin shows items on wrong date Im connected to two iCloud calendars An Item which is scheduled for tomorrow appears to be due for the day after tomorrow All other plugins like the clock are showing correct date time Additional Notes this problem occurred once I updated the installation Previously I was running a version dating back to April Problem occurred without touching the configjs EDIT I did some more digging and changed the timeFormat to date headers interestingly the plugin shows actually a wrong date For example a item which is in the ical file for the
