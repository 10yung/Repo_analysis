Show and hide animation not implemented Use Vue transitiongroup animation but not compatible Hi Ive prepared Angular integration for your project It would be nice to add it to Usage with Frameworks section next to Vue and Ract Link When I add a custom style to an element with JS like nodestyletransform rotate MathfloorMathrandom toString deg and then do an action that animates the grid the previous rotation is lost I guess this is due to the fact that the animation mechanism uses transform for itself and just overwrites everything that was there before Is it possible to keep all previously defined styles and only add the transforms for the animation of the grid Hello first let me thank you a lot for providing and supporting such an easy to use library Id like to use it within one of my Gatsby projects Gatsby compiles a static version of each pageroute and therefore the build fails if the code tries to access window Usually we can come around this issue by checking for typeof window undefined before it is used anywhere but that doesnt work in this case It seems window is accessedrequired right after importing Can you follow me Sadly Im not really sure how to resolve this problem but Im trying to investigate the webpack build Great library We have implemented this library to our website but are having some problems with animation jankiness on lower end smartphones As you can see in the header uses this library to animate a collapsingexpanding effect during scroll Do you have some suggestions we could add in order to make animations smoother We have already tried the willchange transform rule however this resulted in more not less jankinness cant find in docs the answer In the app Im building I have a CSS grid layout with a side panel and a main content container I want to be able to toggle this panel ie hide it by clicking on a handle Im trying this library in order to be able to animate the CSS grid changes What I do is adding a class that sets the first grid column to scss layoutlandscape display grid gridtemplatecolumns minmax px auto layoutlandscapecollapsed gridtemplatecolumns auto The desired effect is that the panel slides offscreen The result of using this library is that it looks like it shrinksexpands ie panel content doesnt move to the left of the screen it remains in place while the panel shrinks I wanted to ask if its possible to achieve the desired outcome of having the left panel slide offscreen Also a possible bug while the panel is shrinking the content disappears When the panel expands the content is visible and as I mentioned remains fixed in place while the container expands I am very new in CSS I am using react with your library I am rendering some text inside the grid cell on click But I want to render it after the cell got bigger But I am unable to do that It gets rendered instantaneously after the click Is there any way in your library to achieve this First off This library is awesome and ridiculously easy to use Im noticing that when i add elements to the grid in React they simply pop into existence rather than animating in in some way Is this as expected or is there some way to get an animation in this case As an example ive modified the codepen from the readme to add new elements to the grid whenever you click somewhere within the grid like on an element Thanks Edit Just looked at the vanilla codepen and noticed this is also how it works with the add card button so i suppose this is as expected So this is more of a feature request than a bug i suppose
