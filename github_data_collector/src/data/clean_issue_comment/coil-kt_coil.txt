Describe the bug When you try to render a recycler with a lot of images and some of them dont exist the performance of the view is seriously affected Expected behavior The performance of the view shouldnt be affected As an example the performance for this scenario with Glide works right To Reproduce Create a list of urls pointing to a non existing link create an adapter for a recycler and try to scroll the recyclerview You will see a problem with the performance LogsScreenshots Not applicable Version Hi first off thanks for the great work on this library Were facing one issue when using Coil for loading images with Exif rotation which are saved on the device using the loadUri function The Exif rotation is not applied at all This was reproducible on of our test devices an LG G and an LG G Mini both API Im assuming its the same on other devices with API though I dont know for sure The ExifInterfacegetRotationDegrees call used in BitmapFactoryDecoderdecode always returns on these devices Heres a small sample app demonstrating the issue Some of my favorite candidates for fix are in RealBitmapPool if SDKINT O configs BitmapConfigRGBAF requireSDKINT O config BitmapConfigHARDWARE Cannot create a mutable hardware Bitmap Using actual API level values will promote readability ie nobody will have to ponder for minutes why the hell do we check whether SDKINT is less than greater than or equal to zero See for discussion Main points JWh Just use the numbers They already convey what you want RequiresApi minSdkVersion setWhateverApiLevel CANUSETHINGAPILEVEL JWa Agree though this doesnt solve the practical issue of being unable to find APIspecific code reliably Searching for two digits in a large project is still painful Searching for RequiresApi SdkSuppress BuildVERSIONSDKINT and comments is less painful but not obvious JWh True Although I rarely need to find all of those at once Usually its just one and you always need to use the annotationfield because someone may have used a number or a semantic constant like FINGERPRINTENABLED Describe the bug After updating coil to version icons downloaded from network are not loading anymore Expected behavior Icons should be loading normally instead just a transparent element is left icons targets are not ImageViews but CircularImageViews instead here the library inside a RecyclerView To Reproduce Try loading URL images inside a RecyclerView using a CircularImageView LogsScreenshots Im not able to report any logs yet but I will be following up with more details Version Android OxygenOS Describe the bug When using Chris Banes PhotoView library with Coil crossfade the pinchtozoom is broken This appears to be due to CrossfadeDrawable updating the loaded drawables bounds Unless Im mistaken I only see two options to get around this Either disable crossfade for PhotoView or create my own transition Expected behavior Pinchtozoom continues to function with crossfade enabled and without creating custom transition To Reproduce Load an image into a PhotoView using Coil with crossfade enabled Version This is with version of Coil Signedoffby YuHsuan Lin b gmailcom Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Right now I want to use coils coil gif extension together with transformations it seems that Gif extension is ignoring them I did CoilsetDefaultImageLoaderImageLoaderthis componentRegistry addGifDecoder and load image with imageViewloadRdrawablesomegifimage placeholderRdrawableplaceholder transformationsCircleCropTransformation repeatCount Describe the solution youd like Gid extension should apply transformations Hi all Had a look at the new Transition API earlier today and added a draft PR here Overall I liked the API and it achieves what I needed it to smile Some small API feedback Is the Event class really an event Looking at the items in it maybe LoadResult is a better name Similarly the naming of TransitionAdapter isnt obvious to me Maybe just TransitionTarget which extends Target The naming of EventCACHED could be clearer imo The term cached is a very overloaded term especially for image loading libraries Maybe be more specific and call it CACHEDMEMORY Hope that helps I am using the code below to load images from a URL into the target imageview When i try to load the images without internet connectionthe error image is displayedthen if i turn on internet connectionunlike Glide Coil doesnt try to reload the images from the URL fun loadImageWithCoil target ImageView imgUrl String placeHolder Int Rdrawableprofilepicplaceholder errorImgIntRdrawableicterrainblack dp targetloadimgUrl placeholderplaceHolder crossfadetrue errorerrorImg Is this currently not possible or Im not doing it right Whats the state of this PR MediaMetadataRetriever requires the ability to read forwardbackwards anywhere in the video file For large video files this isnt feasible to buffer into memory Also we cant rely on having a backing file This isnt feasible to add to Coil since the Decoder intentionally has no knowledge of the backing data source If you have an idea of how to implement this with no breaking changes please let me know or comment on this PR
