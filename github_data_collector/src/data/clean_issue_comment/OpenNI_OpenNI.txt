an issue possibly its not the best place to do this but I couldnt find anywhere else to do it Many tutorials for using OpenNI with the Kinect mention needing the branch Unstable in order to work with the KinectSensor module This branch no longer seems to exist does anybody know where I can get a copy of this version of OpenNI Could anyone help to understand the reason of the build failure Im trying to build android samples from the orbbecdev branch using the following versions jdk apacheant Python androidndkr d Using latest Build Tools Project Target Android API level They seem to be correct as I get it from the README file But I still get the following error which might be related to version mismatch dex dex input D projects OpenNI Samples SimpleReadAndroid bin classes dex input

detection in ROS Kinetic im stuck like a hell on my kinect i tried to install it via Freenect OpenNi followed all tutorials but still no device connected message i also cant see it in lsusb my kinect is working Green Led when its plugged can anyone give me a fixed and updated tutorial or any issue please Thanks for help Error acquiring depth from kinect due to the different device arrangement presented in this version than that of version Since C there has existed stderrorcategoryequivalent OpenNI defines a macro equivalent During header inclusion a GCC header calls the function equivalent but that symbol is hidden by the name clash with the macro equivalent leading to In file included from SamplesNiViewerglhglhobsh from SamplesNiViewerNiViewercpp usrlibgccx pclinuxgnu includegv
