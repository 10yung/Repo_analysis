I would like to be wrong but it looks like Amethyst has no functionality similar to XMonad toggleWS from XMonadActionsCycleWS toggleWS allows quickly return back without thinking where you have been so it would be nice to have such ability System Amethyst version macOS version C Whats the problem Firefox window doesnt have same behavior as other windows when resizing Its being animated Im quite sure its a problem with firefox and not Amethyst as I also experience similar behavior with Spectacle or Rectangle When applying a layout such as Tall Fullscreen or anything else if Firefox didnt have the full size before applying the layout its not being resized properly Also the animation is kinda slow I wish I could disable it but I didnt find the right settings in Firefox searched through aboutconfig with no luck How can it be reproduced Download firefox resize the window to a smaller window apply a layout lie down try not to cry cry a lot What applications are involved Firefox Has anything fixed it even temporarily Applying the layout multiple times until window gets the right size resize manually or use Spectacle or Rectangle multiple times dotfile if you have one I dont have a dotfile shouldI Screenshots gif tada System Amethyst version macOS version G Whats the problem I am unable to float the Android Emulator I believe its related to because the window title is empty when it is first created I also tried to create custom floating rule in settings with no success Screen Shot at Note that I added an empty bundleID because the qemu application has no bundleID set as I can see from the output of lsappinfo qemusystemx ASN x x a a bundleID NULL bundle pathUserspaoloLibraryAndroidsdkemulator executable pathUserspaoloLibraryAndroidsdkemulatorqemudarwinx qemusystemx pid typeForeground flavor Version NULL fileTypeBNDL creator Archx originalExecutablePathUserspaoloLibraryAndroidsdkemulatoremulator originalPid checkin time minutes seconds ago System Amethyst version macOS version Whats the problem Trying to switch layout to Binary Space Partitioning does nothing Switching to Binary Space Partitioning keeps the same layout as whatever I had previous to BSP Additionally sometimes below the popup window when I switch layouts it may see things like Optional numbers or nil or sometimes nothing below the popup I have tried using the shortcut to forcereevaluate the layout and defined specific shortcuts to switch to BSP to no avail How can it be reproduced Switch to BSP What applications are involved All Has anything fixed it even temporarily No dotfile if you have one Amethyst has a dot file How do I use it Screenshots img width altScreen Shot at PM src img width altScreen Shot at PM src Feature Would it be possible to add keyboard shortcuts to increase or decrease screen padding I work on a large monitor at home and I constantly need to change the padding in settings to push the windows away from the edges System Amethyst version macOS version Whats the problem Im using my laptop with external monitors while at my desk but unplug from them times a day to go to meetings which usually mess around my tiles and shuffles them all into one screen How can it be reproduced Set different tiling configuration on multiple monitors then unplug those monitors Has anything fixed it even temporarily When Im motivated enough I switch back the windows from external screens to dedicated spaces and reapply the tiling configuration that I had Suggested improvement Could we have an option in Amethyst that automatically transfer any windows from Screen X into Space X if Screen X is unplugged This would allow to virtually keep those screens and therefore leave the tiling configurations untouched When a user would go back to his desk and plug back his screen the opposite would happen moving Space X back to Screen X as if nothing happened Only conflict I could think of is if people use both Multiple Screens AND multiple Spaces but if this stays an option and can be opt out that would allow those users to stay unaffected I had a quick look at other Issues and it seems could benefit from this approach as well EDIT I kept reading past issues and it looks also very similar to request since we already have mod Throw focused window to space mod Throw focused window to space mod Throw focused window to space would be nice with we have to mod Focus space mod Focus space mod Focus space
