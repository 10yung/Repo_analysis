Im getting difflibjs Uncaught TypeError Cannot assign to read only property name of function function SequenceMatcherisjunk a b autojunk for SequenceMatcher function SequenceMatchername SequenceMatcher here The current version version being used of clicolor does not have a license The NPM page for this package show it as having no license From the project its pretty clear that the license is actually MIT This will show the right license on the NPM package As youre no doubt familiar with Githubs diffs show not only which lines have changed but also frequently which bits of the line changed when you make changes to an already existing line Im not sure exactly how this is implemented but I imagine it would be something like perform the usual diff algorithm using lines as atoms Then if the resulting diff would have a followed by perform a charbychar diff of these two lines If the lines are at least n similar highlight the charbychar diff in a stronger formatting to emphasize which bits of the line changed I think something similar for string values in the JSON data would be very handy In the particular JSON data Ive worked with Im importing data from a source and from one import to the next there mightve been typo fixes or small changes to description strings in the data It would be very convenient to be able to tell at a glance exactly which bits were addedremoved So I think it would be nice to perform a standard charbychar diff of string values if there is a of a string value followed by a of a string value Collapse five or more lines into one that looks like entries or similar The added example is illustrative diff movies entries directors Terry Gilliam Terry Jones This is particularly useful when working with things like API responses where you might expect arrays of similarly structured objects with all but a select few being identical It helps emphasize exactly what the difference between the JSON objects are which is after all what you want to know Currently when diffing arrays elements that are objects and equivalent on both sides get elided with a However the fact that the elision marker is there is important to highlight the position of the differences in the array In some cases especially when diffing API responses and similar the arrays might be very long and the output gets rather tedious Instead of one elision marker for each elided object I suggest to replace repetated elision with a single line Eg diff jsondiff echo hello echo hello hello would instead become diff jsondiff echo hello echo hello hello entries For smaller arrays it would get noisy and reduce clarity to use the elisions everywhere Therefore I think it makes sense to by default only collapse eg or more elisions into one line Probably makes sense to provide a commandline flag to set this threshold though Hi I need to diff JSON files which contain large numbers Even though your module is generally very useful for comparing JSON files it is unable to create proper diffs for JSON files containting large numbers as it parses them by the ordinary JSONparse function As a result when comparing two files having the following JSON objects the diff will not be recognized by this module file value e file value e However I added optional BigNumber support So if you now compare these two files and add the parameter b you will get the following diff value e value e I know this is a very special use case as JSON objects usually do not have big numbers but this feature is still useful as it extends the use of this module It also should not break anything as my changes will only be activated if the options object contains the property bigNumberSupport Moreover all previous test cases are still running I also added some additional test cases to check if this feature works and I am willing to add some more if desired Please let me know soon if you are intersted in merging this pull request as I also personally need this feature Otherwise I at least would like to publish the fork to npm by myself if you dont mind Looking forward for some response If I change a value from true to false it gives me this output alive true It does not recognize that false was added only that true is gone Adds a new sorts option that will sort arrays and objects by keys before comparing Please add an option to filter out certain keys Like diff maybe use the capital i as parameter For example jsondiff I id I createdat I updatedat I randomobjectid ajson bjson Or maybe read a json file with an array of keys to be ignored jsondiff ignorefile ignorekeysjson So those keys will be ignored in the comparison It would be a great help in comparing json files across a production and test environment
