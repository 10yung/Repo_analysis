 Ive added in the same for a header in Contributingmd Let me know if you want to change the name of the PR title or anything similar to maybe look at how much work would be required to switch away from go ask types README Instructions for make appear to be incorrect I needed to run SPREADVERSIONv make build instead of make buildspread Why are the binaries not available to download directly for the latest release README Instructions for installation from brew are also outdated brew install spreadversioning should be replaced with brew install spread Documentation has the same outdated instructions Ive installed libgit Ive setup LDLIBRARYPATH and running ld v lgit tells me the compiler is able to find it at usrlocalliblibgit so But when I run make buildgitlab or buildspreadlinuxstatic gcc seems to fail Ive not meddled around with Go before so I might be missing something obvious here GOOSlinux go build o buildspreadlinuxstatic i v ldflags X mainVersionv extldflags static s w rsprdcomspreadcmdspread rsprdcomspreadcmdspread rsprdcomspreadcmdspread usrlocalgopkgtoollinuxamd link running gcc failed exit status usrbinld cannot find lgit tmpgolink o In function mygetgrouplist tmpworkdirgosrcosusergetgrouplistunixgo warning Using getgrouplist in statically linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking tmpgolink o In function mygetgrgidr tmpworkdirgosrcosuserlookupunixgo warning Using getgrgidr in statically linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking tmpgolink o In function mygetgrnamr tmpworkdirgosrcosuserlookupunixgo warning Using getgrnamr in statically linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking tmpgolink o In function mygetpwnamr tmpworkdirgosrcosuserlookupunixgo warning Using getpwnamr in statically linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking tmpgolink o In function mygetpwuidr tmpworkdirgosrcosuserlookupunixgo warning Using getpwuidr in statically linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking tmpgolink o In function cgo a d f a C funcgetaddrinfo tmpworkdirgosrcnetcgounixgo warning Using getaddrinfo in statically linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries from the glibc version used for linking collect error ld returned exit status Makefile recipe for target buildspreadlinuxstatic failed make buildspreadlinuxstatic Error When deploying with Gitlab CI a lot of projects use conditional statements within their script definition In combination with the Gitlab CI triggers and their variables its possible to only execute the deploy based on these variables Good example is a repo thats made of multiple microservices and its most efficient to only run the builddeploy scripts of the microservices that have actually changed their versions Currently this image runs the deploy command straight from the entrypointsh but flexibility would be much improved if we are able to run the command ourselves from the script section in our build definition using this image This way we could conditionally trigger the actual deploy with spread when all requirements are met I discovered I had to install cmake to build libgit and update my PKGCONFIGPATH along with my LDLIBRARYPATH in order to build on my Fedora workstation
