Hi Is there a way to create bin dex files out of LFW train file pairsDevTraintxt Thanks Hi I have questions concerning the connection between the alignment pipeline and its influence on the recognition performance Which pipeline are you using for the FRVT submission Training on MTCNN aligned images with Resnet Arcface loss and using Retina Face only in the inference step It seems that you only provide MTCNNaligned training DBs wouldn t it make sense to use Retina Face alignment also for the training DBs not only at the testproduction stage Are there benchmarks showing the influence of the alignment pipeline on the overall recognition performance Kind regards Christian Im running Python in Google Colab and downloaded the pretrained model as well from the model zoo While running the verificationpy file Im getting the following error IOErrorTraceback most recent call last contentinsightfacesrcevalverificationpy in module args parserparseargs prop faceimageloadpropertyargsdatadir imagesize propimagesize printimagesize imagesize contentinsightfacesrcevalcommonfaceimagepy in loadpropertydatadir def loadpropertydatadir prop edict for line in openospathjoindatadir property vec linestripsplit assert lenvec IOError Errno No such file or directory property Im new to Insightface Can anyone help me out or tell me what additional info is needed to solve the problem modelzoo pretrained model checkpoint model checkpoint pretrained model checkpoint mxnetbaseMXNetError Userstravisbuilddmlcmxnetdistromxnetbuild rdpartytvmnnvmincludennvmgraphh Check failed it attrsend Cannot find attribute shape in the graph Stack trace bt libmxnetso x c mxnetopNDArrayOpPropNDArrayOpProp bt libmxnetso x c d mxnetopNDArrayOpPropNDArrayOpProp bt libmxnetso x c a df mxnetexecGraphExecutorBackwardstd vectormxnetNDArray std allocatormxnetNDArray const bool bt libmxnetso x c a b c std unorderedmapstd basicstringchar std chartraitschar std allocatorchar mxnetNDArray std hashstd basicstringchar std chartraitschar std allocatorchar std equaltostd basicstringchar std chartraitschar std allocatorchar std allocatorstd pairstd basicstringchar std chartraitschar std allocatorchar const mxnetNDArray unorderedmap bt libmxnetso x c a f e MXExecutorForward bt libffi dylib x fficallunix bt x e x The code is not clear Hi Is there a way to adjust the accuracy of facial recognition so that no faces are detected in the examples Ive attached sample And sample Thank you very much The training speed is mentioned in paper it samplessi really want to know the training time with the class number ranging from k to MHow long does it take to convergeDo you use pretrained model Looking for your replay EvaluationMegaface runsh reading mf runsh line cd raid datadplearnmegafacedevkitexperiments No such file or di python cant open file runexperimentpy Errno No such file or directory runsh line cd OLDPWD not set runexperimentpy
