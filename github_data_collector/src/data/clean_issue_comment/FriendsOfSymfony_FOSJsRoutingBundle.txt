Hi Ive encountered an issue with the release after upgrading it from If were generating an URL the returned URL is missing the leading HTTPHTTPS scheme With that the generated URL will be appended to the current URL from the browser instead of correctly redirect to the generated URL Example url Routinggeneratebase itemId consolelogurl testdomaindebase instead of If I set the generated URL to a link or just redirect via javascript windowlocationhref url The browser will try to reach this url Reverting back to release to or manually add the missing schema fixed the issue for now windowlocationhref schema url Thank you for creating and maintaining this bundle its highly appreciated See it should probably be fixed by overriding the host when it is not configured but it needs a bit of study When I generate a JSON file of routes binconsole fosjsroutingdump formatjson targetpublicjsfosjsroutesjson I got an issue with the scheme When i set a global scheme in my parameter the scheme is not in my json file configservicesyaml parameters routerrequestcontextscheme https assetrequestcontextsecure true When i force the scheme in the annotations file for all controlles or one specific controller the scheme is not in my json file configroutesannotationsyaml controllers resource srcController type annotation defaults schemes https If i specify the scheme in the Route annotation Routelogin namelogin schemeshttps it does works and the scheme is in my json file The thing is i do not want to specify scheme route by route id rather do it globally in parametersyaml or annotationsyaml becauce it allow me to set different scheme by env http in local https in production Is there a way to set a global scheme in my dump json My FOSJSRouting version is Symfony version

purpose of this variable at all Hey there I just figured out that calling the fosjsroutingjs will trigger a cache write in the kernelprojectdirvarcachekernelenvironmentfosJsRouting directory which doesnt exist in case of a cache miss This has drawbacks Routes have to be computed during the users request which can impact performance even if it should be done only time per deployment The system user running the PHP SAPI may not have writing permissions on the cache directory Why not implementing a Symfony Component HttpKernel CacheWarmer WarmableInterface service which would hook on the cacheclear and the cachewarmup commands to write everything needed during deployment andor cache clearwarmup Prerequisites are prior knowledge of all the locales used but this can be achieved through the bundle configuration What are your thoughts Solution proposed in no longer works It works as expected until i configure babel with runtime generator and corejs to support asyncawait and generators
