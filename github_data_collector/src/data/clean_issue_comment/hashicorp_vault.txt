I just set up AzureAD authentication via OIDC with External Groups and found the docs somewhat confusingmultiple places to look and pieces of information to pull together Would it be worth having a central place for that maybe adding some additional details to the jwtoidcproviders page I also got the AzureAD piece working with UPN which is more standard for us anyway than email and requires a few additional steps that Im happy to document if people think itd be helpful cc jescalan Reported by a user on twitter hi there is a bug that i cant see password in vault default ui mode but when i switch to json mode password will show up checkout this screenShots Environment Key Value Seal Type shamir Initialized true Sealed false Total Shares Threshold Version Cluster Name vaultclustere Cluster ID e a f edd bbc d HA Enabled false Instead of calling SetBarrierConfig in this updates the logic in adjustCoreForSealMigration to correctly set the barrier and recovery configs I think this fixes the issue in and another issue where autoauto migrations were not getting the correct config move duplicated names to constants improve error handling for test I was not able to get correctly merged after the new website update so opening a separate PR for this Closes Updated docs to show that the Oracle DB plugin now supports static roles Note that this should not be released until the Oracle DB plugin is released DO NOT MERGE UNTIL Released We have a requirement where we need to know the OIDC JWT clientid before we provision identityoidcrolename in Vault Currently the clientid JWT aud field is set to a uniquerandom value This PR is to allow admins to specifyoverride the clientid when they create a role For example vault write identityoidcroletest keytest templatetesttmpl clientidLGRQlm PNl EmETRuMIiXGw Gi Also tried with overriding the aud field in template file but that field is not allowed to be overridden
