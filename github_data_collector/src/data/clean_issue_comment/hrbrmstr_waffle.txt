Hi Thanks for making this awesome package I am still a beginner so I may be missing something obvious On Windows I am unable to create any of the carts that Font Awesome glyphs I did some digging and in the extrafontsdbfontmapfonttablecsv the font name and font table for the Font Awesome fonts do not match what has been specified in the waffleR file glyphfont Font Awesome Free Solidglyphfontfamily FontAwesome FreeSolid Are you sure this is correct In the fonttablecsv it seems to be flipped I want to understand if there is something wrong with the way I installed these font Thanks The waffle bar chart feature is awesome but it seems limited to vertical bars only Is there any way to make a horizontal bar chart Currently the code requires coordequal which cannot be combined with coordflip needed for the horizontal chart Thanks Using the waffle package it seems the code does not respond when factors are reordered using for example factordata levelsc From my testing the order is based on order of factor appearance in data frame Thanks for this package I ran into a layout issue with a data set of mine which is shown in the following example r parts tapplyirisSepalLength irisSpecies mean waffleparts rows which results in waffle I provided a fix by sorting the even rows of the expanded grid in the opposite direction of the odd rows snakesort resulting in contiguous parts waffle I suppose this is related to issue When I try the following see below example from github from the R console in RStudio the plot is right however I got only empty squares when I try the same example in an RStudio Notebook rmarkdown I am working on MacOS R and RStudio p xdf countparts wt vals ggplotaeslabel parts values n geompictogramnrows aescolour parts flip TRUE makeproportional TRUE scalecolormanual name NULL values ca c ae labels cFruit Sammich Pizza scalelabelpictogram name NULL values capplealt breadslice pizzaslice labels cFruit Sammich Pizza coordequal themeipsumrcgrid themeenhancewaffle themelegendkeyheight unit line themelegendtext elementtextsize hjust vjust While facetwrap works like a charm facetgrid leads to an error when used with a second or more faceting variable I attached a reprex below Thanks for a great package r libraryhrbrthemes librarywaffle Loading required package ggplot librarytidyverse tibble parts factorrepmonthabb levelsmonthabb values c fct crepThing repThing repThing fct crepa repb xdf ggplotxdf aesfillparts valuesvalues geomwafflecolor white size nrows makeproportional TRUE facetwrapfct fct scalexdiscreteexpandc scaleydiscreteexpandc ggthemesscalefilltableaunameNULL coordequal labs title Faceted Waffle Geoms themeipsumrcgrid themeenhancewaffle r libraryhrbrthemes librarywaffle librarytidyverse tibble parts factorrepmonthabb levelsmonthabb values c fct crepThing repThing repThing fct crepa repb xdf ggplotxdf aesfillparts valuesvalues geomwafflecolor white size nrows makeproportional TRUE facetgridfct fct scalexdiscreteexpandc scaleydiscreteexpandc ggthemesscalefilltableaunameNULL coordequal labs title Faceted Waffle Geoms themeipsumrcgrid themeenhancewaffle Error in repascharacterx use i x values i invalid times argument supCreated on by the reprex package v sup I want to make the waffle plot arranged in rowlike this How can I do Is waffle compatible with plotly Thanks When I create a waffle with only two parts ie partsc the plot forces a rd color to exist to completely fill the grid why would it do this Hi Thanks for creating this lovely package m attempting to use iron to stack hundreds of individual waffle plots Each of my waffle plots is currently an element in a list For example mylistwaffle mylistwaffle etc I cant figure out how to supply this long list of waffles to iron in a simple automated way ironmylistwaffle mylistwaffle etc works but I have no success in inputting a list of waffle plots to iron or hacking it through unlist or by generating a characterversion of the commadelimited list Any ideas Thank you
