I feel like thematically Id really like it if legit sync also included fetch prune since postsync seeing branches that have actually been removed doesnt feel very synced to me Otherwise Im stuck always calling git sync git fetch prune and the main appeal of legit to me is to avoid having long git commands with a ton of options Yeah I know I can alias this if I really want to When i try to download the legitexe from release chrome stop downloading and Windows Defender warns about the file being malware Details in brazilian portuguese Is there a way to change the color legit is using for black I know allowblackforeground is a boolean to use either black which doesnt show up on black bgs or white which blends in with regular text Id like to customize the appearance to be a grey or something this is especially useful when working with githubs hub to submit a pull request git clone gitgithubcomkennethreitzlegitgit git checkout b mybranch code git commit am my changes git fork git publish glehmann git pullrequest Explain usage If a stash pop merge fails Legit stops Id like to add checking for a merge failure and undo the command with friendly error reporting what do you mean with Legit stops i think legit could grow some sort of submodule support perhaps legit sync would update all submodules or maybe a dedicated command to work with submodules
