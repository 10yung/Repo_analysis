hi i see in the time analysis which I believe is the th report down the Request column is too small to be useful I cant tell which method is taking all the time bc its truncated Is there a setting to allow expanding a column width of the overall report width Looks like this article is outdated as many of the table and column names have changed since it was written Not sure if this is already logged but could you provide some insights into this error Requestloganalyzer by Willem van Bergen and Bart ten Brinke version Website Cproductionlog Time Caught interrupt Stopping parsing

source table This forces the data to be stored as a limit integer instead of a limit integer I couldnt get the specs working before I made any changes but I am seeing the same failures after making the changes These were ran using ruby and I believe AR First off this gem is awesome and a great tool I am running into an issue when parsing a log file that is gb though and when DatabaseInserternewsourcechange gets called it hits a database column limitation gemsactiverecord libactiverecordtypeintegerrb in ensureinrange is out of range for ActiveRecordTypeInteger with limit RangeError Maybe you should explicitly set the limit to It seems as though its trying to store it as a byte integer but should really be stored as an byte integer in

haproxy log format The log entry has some captured request headers which are enclosed with braces Delivery Map CFNetwork Darwin To catch that part I use the following regexp check capturedrequestheaders line def selfcomposeregexpmillisecs backends counters connections queues r ipaddress d s clientip clientport timestampdbYHMSmillisecs s acceptdate S s frontendname backends counters w w w w s terminationstate connections queues s httprequest d s statuscode S s capturedrequestcookie w W s capturedrequestheaders S s capturedresponsecookie S s capturedresponseheaders ireqsize d s bytessent respsize d s bytesread x end Online regexp checker successfully works for that part But your app throws an exception optrhruby rootusrlocalbinrequestloganalyzer test f myhaproxy

While trying to support the Solr metric inside the Completed lines I had to extend the Rails format So I have created the class Rails Solr and I have used the new method extendlinedefinition to override the line definition for completed of Rails format This also allows the munin plugin to pick them up Is there a way to aggregate the same controller and action that gets called with different content types such as EdibleSuggestionsControllercreate EdibleSuggestionsControllercreateJSON We would like all metrics for EdibleSuggestionsControllercreate to be rolled up regardless of the method in which it is being called
