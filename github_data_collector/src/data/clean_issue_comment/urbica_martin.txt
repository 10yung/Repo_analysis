Any plans on allowing ondisk caching of tiles So basically iftileondiskexists runsql savetodisk return tile else return tileondisk Hello Thank you for the superbe work I am wondering if we could expose only a entire schema instead of exposing one table at a time Thank you I would like your thoughts on how to generate multilayer tiles My idea is to allow requests like schemanametablenameschemanametablenamezxypbf and use binary concatenation of STAsMVT statements to produce the tile see I believe the only way to do this now is via function source for example PLpgSQL CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION publicassetsz integer x integer y integer queryparams json RETURNS bytea AS Prefer zxy inputs over zxy table columns variableconflict usevariable DECLARE polesmvt bytea metersmvt bytea BEGIN SELECT INTO polesmvt STAsMVTtile publicpoles geom FROM SELECT STAsMVTGeomshape TileBBoxz x y true AS geom polenumber FROM publicswitches WHERE shape TileBBoxz x y AS tile WHERE geom IS NOT NULL SELECT INTO metersmvt STAsMVTtile publicmeters geom FROM SELECT STAsMVTGeomshape TileBBoxz x y true AS geom meternumber FROM publicmeters WHERE shape TileBBoxz x y AS tile WHERE geom IS NOT NULL RETURN polesmvt metersmvt END LANGUAGE plpgsql IMMUTABLE STRICT PARALLEL SAFE I have never developed in Rust but Martins codebase is so clean I could probably make these changes and issue a decent PR What do you think The openmaptiles project also supports postgisbased tile generation it can generate giant SQL statement as either prepared statement query or function creation that produces MVT from zxy Would it be possible to add support for the openmaptiles layer format in martin as well See the postgis server simple test server for testing purposes Running in some internal issue Im running a local docker docker run p e DATABASEURLpostgrespostgreshostdockerinternaldb urbicamartin on my Mac OS Ive added a table with points I made a website with mapbox GL and followed the directions in the README The website is running on localhost Looks like I am running into a CORS issue and need help to solve img width altScreen Shot at PM src Looks like the table is loading but when it fetched the pbf files is unreachable Ill appreciate the help Thanks Can we storemap raster data using postgis martin to speed up rendering on the client side Edit And if it does not how can that be achieved So Actix added SSL a while back marginal benefit really and recently HTTP Ive confirmed that both work behind nginx or whichever other reverse proxy you care to use though it would be nice for dev purposes to be able to run it standalone with HTTP given the noticeable queueing effect incurred by HTTP irrespective of load on the database workers Ill tinker with it over the coming weekend should be relatively straightforward would you mind if I submit a PR to that effect
