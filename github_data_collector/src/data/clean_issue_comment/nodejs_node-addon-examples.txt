when building example with nan I get CXXtarget Releaseobjtargetaddonmyobjecto myobjectcc warning ignoring return value of function declared with warnunusedresult attribute Wunusedresult exportsSetcontext warning generated Same comment as before the real dependency is NAPI version which is supported by some version of X as well In any case this is still a good step Originally posted by mhdawson in See Reading the readme files in the repository and the first HelloWorld example didnt clarify how I should structure this example properly so I hope you could help me do it right in case I made a mistake Hi anyone reading this The file nodeaddonexamples functionfactorynode addoncc contains a function factory thats all well and good but when I do something similiar instead of using a global function Im using an instance function sorry bad C vocab Im only new a function thats a private member of a class and I want to use that as the function body where the example uses void MyFunctionconst FunctionCallbackInfoValue args Isolate isolate IsolateGetCurrent HandleScope scopeisolate argsGetReturnValueSetStringNewFromUtf isolate hello world as the body The issue is I get an error when doing this the error is as follows error C ClassSampleFunction nonstandard syntax use to create a pointer to member and I have no idea what to do about it I built the Hello World addon using the nodeaddonapi successfully but this is what happened when I tried to run it E programming nodeaddonapiexamplehelloworldnode hellojs internalmodulescjsloaderjs throw err Error Cannot find module bindings Require stack E programming nodeaddonapiexamplehelloworld hellojs m at FunctionModuleresolveFilename internalmodulescjsloaderjs m m at FunctionModuleload internalmodulescjsloaderjs m m at Modulerequire internalmodulescjsloaderjs m m at require internalmodulescjshelpersjs m at Objectanonymous E programming nodeaddonapiexamplehelloworld hellojs m at Modulecompile internalmodulescjsloaderjs m m at ObjectModuleextensionsjs internalmodulescjsloaderjs m m at Moduleload internalmodulescjsloaderjs m m at FunctionModuleload internalmodulescjsloaderjs m m at FunctionModulerunMain internalmodulescjsloaderjs m code mMODULENOTFOUND m requireStack mE programming nodeaddonapiexamplehelloworld hellojs m The module user code is js const addon requirebindingshello consolelogaddonhello I just hope the problem isnt the use of doublequotes instead of singlequotes And I need a good place where I can go to learn about how to use the API and the C wrapper in more depth As title it would be great if this repository has an explicit license Have a piece of code that works on node but will need to be converted to for node return staticcastext filsys info ToObjectAsv ExternalValue I couldnt see any examples for v External in conversion ie Im guessing using it with NanTov Object What would be an example of using such v External cases Hello Please provide me the full steps to live debug node addon codes using Visual Studio code IDE on Windows OS environment Thanks and regards Sunny Even if javascript makes no difference V can distinguish integers from double for performance reason looping with a double is a huge loss because the looping variable cant be a cpu register I could create numbers that are integers in C but now with NAPI I see no way to create integers but just doubles Isnt this a performance problem Is there any way to hint the API to use integers instead
