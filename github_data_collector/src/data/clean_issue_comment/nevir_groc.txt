Upgraded jade to pug added vuejs extention Hey Guys when I use groc for doc generation it does not add a new line at the end of file This is a big hassle for us as we push those files to git Is there an easy way to add that No longer always points to master This patch adds support for the subject file types if the current file is of type markdown md dont show the wide source div but use all space in the browser for the documentation The implementation adds a dataextensionextension attribute to the html body and has some minor additions in libstylesdefaultstylesass to get rid of the twocolumn layout for md files hey fellas i added support for the Stylus css preprocessor language Did I miss something or glob parameter do not support negative paths as exclude from array into grocjson Some example to clear minds glob srccoffee srcspeccoffee gulpcoffee gulpspeccoffee READMEmd This adds support for the Gherkin language used by Cucumber Is there a way to use HighlightJS styles out of the box or do I have to create an entire groc skin Thanks for a great library
