Once is merged in these features remain to do for full svg support Add support for images I didnt know how to do this with the imageCache stuff Support css filter stuff if thats possible important Have bounds xMin xMax etc in EditorexportSvgString populated in the same way that the hypothetical artboard feature populates the web export bounds Add an export button to the UI Also allow customization of the dpi Perhaps dpi is also related to web export concerns Reordering variables feels so nice Would be good to do the same for the symbols on the left hand side as you develop similar kinds of dependency orders for these Text just uses the bounding box But when I added Image I included fancy hitdetection which doesnt recognizes hits from transparent parts of the image This seems needlessly inconsistent Which should we use See how wide the vertical blue line is img width altscreen shot at pm src See errors in console which occur when the Y expression is completed screen shot at pm Uncaught TypeError Cannot read property a of undefined at Matrixcoffee Ive had trouble reproducing sometimes This is unpredictable It looks like was caused by a recursive structure which I accidentally created and then deleted but which remains in the object network and which is still serialized along with everything else This diagram isnt very complex But for some reason successive mouse clicks are processed over ms apart so doubleclicks cannot be registered Ill poke around EDIT Profiling suggests theres a big lag from serialization Possible solutions Make doubleclick a single event rather than a pair of events selection doubleclick selection Fix something serializationschedulingrelated Check if theres some reason serialization of this particular diagram is problematic I guess the file is unusually large electronicwhisper I wanted to play around with adding more pointlike elements so as a warmup I added support for selecting dragging anchor points PTAL Things that seemed sort of funky to me but eventually turned out to make perfect sense You still need to doubleclick your way down to the anchor from the path I didnt expect this before implementing the feature But I should have since it fits with Apparatuss general selection method Since anchor points are children of the parent path their highlights will show up when the parent is highlighted That means putting your mouse near one anchor results in all the fellow anchors being highlighted But again this fits with how Apparatuss visualizes single and doubleclick targets doubleclick targets are never visualized This is an interesting point to revisit is there a good way to signify the doubleclick affordance Some diagrams which used to work OK now take dozens of seconds to load Profiling suggests that of these diagrams render time is spent in Attributevalues call to AttributecircularReferencePath so Im guessing this is s fault Example of a very slow drawing Fieldjsontxt Im not sure exactly what property of a drawing makes it susceptible to this slowdown But the Field drawing has a large spread It makes sense that not caching the circularreference check would cause especially big problems for drawings like that
