I hve tested this following code into the online editor and mermaid does not recognize it Maybe updating the plugin should resolve the issue mermaid classDiagram class Serie Serie serieID Serie titre Serie annee Hi I found mermaidjs has new version I thought we can upgrade it Signedoffby Amin Wang lagunawanggmailcom It will be very cool to integrate mind map function Example This is really annoying when I copy a URL such as it pastes the whole thing as Just leave it alone It already will turn URLs into links without the brackets and this interferes when writing markdown for hyperlinks Is there a way to disable this Diagrams of type classDiagram in the StackEdit app do not render img width altScreen Shot at PM src Example taken from mermaidjs There are several mermaidjs issues that deal with this functionality but none here in the StackEdit issue queue I have not spun up a local instance to check into this but I do see that the classRenderer is imported and configured in mermaidExtensionjs Not sure what else is missing Has anyone successfully gotten StackEdit to work in Angular Ive been doing research on different jsbased markdown editors and StackEdit is the nicest one Ive seen Im surprised that its such an active project with no real information anywhere on getting it to work with Angular I looked at StackEditjs but I dont necessarily want it hosted elsewhere I suppose I could run a simple nonAngular StackEdit site separately and point StackEditjs to that Is that the best way or has anyone had any success getting StackEdit to run natively with Angular Thank you Hello I would like the ability to upload a LaTeX and or Word template Most conferences such as HCI International ACL ICAD and every other conference or journal has a LaTeX and or word document they ask that you provide your paper in When I introduce the idea of using StackEdit to my colleagues they love the idea of Markdown but will not use StackEdit until they can upload the template they need for the conference I know pandoc allows both doc and LaTeX templates so an option would be to allow these templates just for Pandoc export Ideally we could view the paper in the viewer in realtime but at the moment there is no support for these templates and that makes StackEdit a nogo for my colleagues If we could use either a Word or LaTeX template that would go a long way in having StackEdit accepted in the academic community along with bibtex citations Hello I would like support for bibtex citations I would like to have a citation list and a set of csl files as well as the link citation option I see that there is pandoc support There could be three options You pay for adding bibtex citations similar to what you do with pandoc and when the markdown renders in the viewer you can choose to have it rendered with pandoc Have a button that says render with citations and when you press that the viewer will show the rendered markdown with citations Just have the bibtex citation work with pandoc exports and no viewer Talked about this issue and if pandoc is not an option then there is a js biblatex csl converter There is citeprocjs There is citationjs Im sure there will soon be pandoc using emscrypten but that hasnt happened yet Actually the extension does add the blank attribute the attribute is there if I inspect the source code in the right window iFrame But it seems that the blank attribute is stripped away when I click the HTMLcode button or publish the HTML on a file Is there anything that I can modify Thanks in advance Originally posted by franzau in After permitting StackEdit to access Google Drive files but using Restrict access to files opened by Stackedit the following happens I am on MacOs Mojave using uptodate chrome Version Official Build bit
