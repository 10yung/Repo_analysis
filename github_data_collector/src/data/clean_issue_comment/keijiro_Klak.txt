 caused by AddComponentMenunull The patcher missed feature to edit patches inside prefabs Since Unity there is a new prefabs workflow that loads prefabs into isolated preview scene which operates almost as play scene This pull request extends patcher to edit prefabs based on the new workflow The feuture is conditioned under UNITY ORNEWER Colorisation for nodes Does not break previous savings The same as but for upm branch e b c f d e ab ccbc Allows to have different Brownian motions possibilities and desynchronize the Brownian motions of different objects What As a Klak output set a Scene in the UnityEditor and it will be loaded on the bang event Why I needed to change scene from a OSC message sometime we just need a constant Sometime we just need a constant made quick and dirty integer output to address Using klak wiring as it without extra coding is there any easy way to change materials or textures directly in runtime by events
