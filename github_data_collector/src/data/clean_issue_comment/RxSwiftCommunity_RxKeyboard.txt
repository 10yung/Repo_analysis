When you run the sample project hiding the keyboard exposes the message below It also has a negative impact on keyboard disappearing animations Can you see why RxKeyboardRxKeyboardExample UIWindow endDisablingInterfaceAutorotationAnimated called on UITextEffectsWindow x a b frame opaque NO autoresize WH layer UIWindowLayer x c ce without matching beginDisablingInterfaceAutorotation Ignoring Ive realised that on iPhone XS Max you can get height of the hidden keyboard So better compare keyboard height with epsilon nether than Problems on the iPad also affecting the RxKeyboard observer applied to other views when calling the keyboard from pageSheet Is there a way to solve this problem Update UITextViewPlaceholder version to prevent crashing at iOS References At RxKeyboardswift following error occured in line and shared is unavailable in application extensions for iOS Use view controller based solutions where appropriate instead A simple instance of UIScrollView with UITextField in contentView I can attach a sample project if its needed swift RxKeyboardinstancevisibleHeight debugRxKeyboard driveonNext scrollView in scrollViewcontentInsetbottom disposedby disposeBag scrollViewrxobserveUIEdgeInsetsself contentInset debugScrollView subscribe disposedby disposeBag After assigning zero keyboard hides it reverts back to previous value Output RxKeyboard Event next ScrollView Event nextOptionalCUIEdgeInsetstop left bottom right ScrollView Event nextOptionalCUIEdgeInsetstop left bottom right Maybe its not RxKeyboard problem however implementing it with raw NotificationCenter resolves the issue Changing RxKeyboardsubscription code to async code smell also resolves the issue swift RxKeyboardinstancevisibleHeight asObservable observeOnMainSchedulerasyncInstance bind scrollView in scrollViewcontentInsetbottom disposedby disposeBag Maybe I just dont understand something Could u please share your thoughts Is it correct use first window in multi window app UIApplicationsharedwindowsfirstaddGestureRecognizerselfpanRecognizer Hi guys I use Carthage And when I try to fetch dependencies I get this error Downloading RxKeyboardframework binary at Skipped installing RxKeyboardframework binary due to the error Incompatible Swift version framework was built with swiftlang clang and the local version is swiftlang clang Falling back to building from the source and then below Skipped building RxKeyboard due to the error Dependency RxKeyboard has no shared framework schemes for any of the platforms iOS If you believe this to be an error please file an issue with the maintainers at Could you release a new version with a binary compatibly with Swift Right now I just added the sources directly in my project and everything works But Thanks Hello On iPhone X Xr Xs in the example when you tap the search bar and the keyboard appear there is a gap between the bar and the keyboard The reason is because its constrained to the safe area in MessageListViewController if availableiOS makebottomequalToselfviewsafeAreaLayoutGuidesnpbottomoffsetkeyboardVisibleHeight else makebottomequalToselfbottomLayoutGuidesnptopoffsetkeyboardVisibleHeight While this is intended behaviour when there is no keyboard this doesnt work when it open Im gonna try to fix it but if someone as a nice way to do it it would be great to have it in the example I try to hide keyboard by tap on tableview but its not work any hint please Thanks
