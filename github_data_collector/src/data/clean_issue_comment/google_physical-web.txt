The code may throw an exception before the resource is closed you should use trycatchfinally or trywithresource to close resource The resource is not closed can this still be used I run it with the latest gradle but there is an error I have problems using to validate some urls from my domain proximoatiinfo I have a big amount of urls already validated using my url shortener otherproximoatiurlsuccess but now Im getting a Fetch timeout trying to validate new urls for example proximoatiurlfail The workaround that I found is use another shortener service to encapsulate my short url googleurlsuccess but Im unavailable to change all my beacons urls to use the google url shortener service Seems like my domain is in a blacklist or if I reach some rate limit Would really appreciate your thoughts After configuring a eddystone beacon I can see the unregistered EddystoneURL in the Android Beacon Tool but not as nearby notification I found the following lines in the

our experiments we found a lot of Nearby notifications without a Favicon even though the configured URLs use Favicons which are shown by browsers Our customers find this branding very important hence I m opening this report here Additionally Ive send a bug report as described here Here s a list of example URLs If you try these URLs for yourselves you will notice that no Favicon will be shown We haven t been able to see a clear pattern why this doesn t work for some websites We don t know the heuristics used by Nearby Notifications and we cannot ask these website owners to change their implementations So there s not much we can do from our side Did you have similar issues and can confirm this problem We have multiple beacons which were sending our notifications previously without an issue then all of a sudden they no longer send any notifications via UID we have tried new beacons we have put into debug mode and the notification shows up but when live the notification does not broadcast to our phones Does anyone have any idea what could be wrong We use the nowsquare platform Im leaving my accumulated intentionally opinionated and now slightly edited comments and questions here as I couldnt find any better place for them They mainly concern EddystoneURL as thats the only thing I bother with right now except iBeacon of course and its primarily addressed to Google I call Nearby Eddystone Physical Web together as NEPW below as the name confusion is an issue in itself which is very hard to explain to customers Adding support in Chrome and then removing it shortly after is another confusing thing but understandable due to integration of Nearby in Google Play Services and considering very few any iOS users have Chrome installed anyway It seems Google has moved away from promoting NEPW Its a viable alternative and competitor to iBeacon both as an analogue via UIDEID and due to the conceptual simplicity of EddystoneURL Ive found that the only ones still posting any fresh information about NEPW are providers of proximity marketing solutions that try to promote use of beacons to their customers Well I do too Setting up UID or EID the Nearby way seems way too complicated and dependent for most and almost all shortterm scenarios In my opinion the whole point of Eddystone is EddystoneURL without use of Googles central configuration but rather directly linking to a CMS without further intervention Analogues QR codes and NFC tags For NEPW to be a viable generic option theres need for a reliable and uptodate iOS app too and from Google so theres a chance users have it installed or care about installing it The smartphone market is still very much iOS and Android not only Android It would be very unwise to run a campaign or any other use of beacons for only Android users The Physical Web app for iOS is old but luckily still works despite now mandatory usage descriptions in plist etc Ive seen a few other providers making analogous applications like MobStac and Bleesk and potentially my own company as well its working but barely A few questions At what distance is NEPW considering being within a beacons region My experience when it comes to EddystoneURL is that it seems to be when the mobile device is at all receiving any pings which makes for little possibility to pinpoint indoor locations iBeacon has the option of farnearimmediate and for most cases Ive found near to be the best option eg within shops What method is used to avoid insideoutside region flickering Timers on both entering and exiting a region Does NEPW use both TX and RSSI to calculate distance My app does that right now just TX RSSI with moving average to enable the user to configure when to get notified At what intervals does NEPW scan for advertisements Doing it constantly drains the battery but on the other hand doing it too seldomly might miss beacons I currently scan constantly for quick response well aware that wont do
