 Description of the Issue The string User defined is sometimes used in the UI while Userdefined is used in other places Userdefined is the typical preference I was going to submit a quick PR to fix this but I see from CONTRIBUTINGmd it is preferred to submit an issue report first So here it is Also in Open User Defined Language folder the singular for Language is used in the UI instead of Languages I can fix that in the same PR or submit a separate issue if you prefer Finally there are numerous inconsistencies between using initialcaps and not using them within the menuitems I can fix those inconsistencies in this issue as well or file a separate issue report if you prefer The last tab in the Preferences dialog box is MISC all caps I recommend we simply change it to Miscellaneous
