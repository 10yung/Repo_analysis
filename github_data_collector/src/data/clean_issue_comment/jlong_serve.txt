can disable automated security fix PRs for this repo from the Security Alerts page details Hi jlong I revamped getserve website to look like this getserve So I hope if I can get access to upload the new code and I am managing to release a new version soon Hi I had to move a serve project to a new folder with new name Now it needs a few minutes to start Is there a way to find out whats causing this Thanks Hi I created an empty folder with indexslim page is rendered properly but when I try to convert serve convert I get a file htmlindexslim which contains html The only problem is the extension Unfortunately with Ruby and ActiveSupport used in latest Gem release or used on Github master branch the following warning is shown with Ruby rbenvversions librubygems gemsactivesupport libactivesupportvaluestimezonerb warning circular argument reference now It would be great to get this warning removed by upgrading to a later version of ActiveSupport if possible As described in issues adding an indexcss file will fail the following specs Failed examples rspec specrouterspecrb ServeRouter should resolve directory indexes rspec specrouterspecrb ServeRouter should resolve directories without case sensitivity If both indexhtml and indexcss files are present within a directory the CSS file will be served as directory index Would be a nice idea to support Apachestyle serverside includes That way its super easy to migrate projects that use SSI from forcing my fellow developers to install and config Apache or nginx which uses an almost identical syntax to having them type serve Example for good measure include virtualincbottomhtml This would include incbottomhtml relative to the file being processed Actually I believe there is an activelybeingdeveloped module for NPM and a gem no idea about the status that handle resolving these SSI I successfully installed and ran serve under ruby p Using Ruby I get an an error ruby v ruby p revision x darwin gem v serve
