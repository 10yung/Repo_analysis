Hello I am a complete noob on anything that has to do with R Studio I tried mirroring some YouTube videos to therefore allow me gather Twitter data for a project I have created a Twitter app that has given me the respective API keys and have also downloaded the twitteR package on the software Despite the efforts when I try to run the line to set up the keys it gives me an error Any ideas on how I can make it work Thanks in advance On the bottom right hand corner its a video that I am trying to follow help i have collected some tweets around a few hashtags through streaming API and would like to separate the file based on hashtags I am wondering if anyone has code for saving tweets file as a separate dataframe based on hashtags and willing share hey I erased the size limit for dmSend which is deprecated That function is still absent from rtweet I think therefore my use of this repo I have implemented a twitter application on my website based on OAuth But I got the error Whoa there There is no request token for this page That s the special key we need from applications asking to use your Twitter account Please go back to the site or application that sent you here and try again it was probably just a mistake i reseted the costumery key secret key but nothing I also reseted my token but still nothing My code is as follows connect all libraries librarytwitteR libraryROAuth

appears Using browser based authentication Nothing happens after this so I dont know whether the authentication has taken place or not Hi Im trying to get the friends for some users but encountered a weird problem img width altscreen shot at src Basically it looks like the RetryOnRateLimit number is automatically reset after or trials and Im not sure why it cannot return the friend list after over trials the Twitter api rate limit has a min window but trials equals about minutes that definitely should move into the next window Using the same code Ive successfully pulled friend list for some users so Im not sure if this problem is caused by some specific issues on this particular user The user id is for purpose to reproduce the issue Does anyone have any idea whats going on Hi I have this issue Whenever I download tweets statistics using lookupStatuses or making a loop for showStatus favoritecount always seems to be even though the tweet has been favorited many times and it also seems that the number of favorites sums with retweetscount For example a tweet had RTs and Fav and when I download data it appears that this same tweet has had RTs and Fav I dont know if Im doing something wrong Ive tried everything TweetDataasdataframecbindtweet TweetText date TweetDate lat TweetLat lon TweetLon isretweet isretweet retweeted retweeted retweetcount retweetcount favoritecount favoritecount favorited favorited When I try to download the tweets with the abovementioned attributes it showing as Rate limited blocking for a minute and retrying up to times Its taking too long and Im not sure how can I resolve this issue installgithubgeoffjentrytwitteR When I use the above command I get following warning Downloading GitHub repo geoffjentrytwitteRmaster from URL Installing
