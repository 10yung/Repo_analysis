Enjoy Describe the bug Uploading a file attachment or inline image fails on my IIS site When inspecting the network traffic using the browsers developer tools all requests fail specifically with a HTTP error Workaround Edit file app Uploads AttachmentServicephp Find line attachmentData filegetcontentsuploadedFilegetRealPath and replace with attachmentData filegetcontentsuploadedFilegetPathname Edit file app Uploads ImageServicephp Find line imageData filegetcontentsuploadedFilegetRealPath and replace with imageData filegetcontentsuploadedFilegetPathname Your Configuration please complete the following information Exact BookStack Version Found in settings v PHP Version Hosting Method NginxApacheDocker IIS Describe the feature youd like The ability to see changes in page tags in revision history Describe the benefits this feature would bring to BookStack users See the full history of page including the metadata Additional context We had a tag somehow be accidentally removed and it was not possible to see when this happened Furthermore when a revision is made to a page to change a tag and nothing else it shows a blank diff I am trying to connect BookStack to my existing LDAP server The server is configured so that anonymous connections cannot be done I do not have a dedicated system user to configure LDAPDN and LDAPPASS in the env file How do I make LDAP authentication work under these circumstances Thanks in advance Describe the feature youd like Currently if I edit a page and save it without making any changes a new revision is created I think that such action shouldnt create a new revision Describe the benefits this feature would bring to BookStack users This change would make it easier to keep the page versions tidy Currently I have to manually remove any empty revisions which is time consuming and its easy to make a mistake and delete the wrong one Thanks to this change in the revisions page users would only see actual changes made Another solution for this could be somehow marking the empty revisions on the revision page In relation to This adds a simple close icon to all notification panes Here is an example of how it looks Per the comments on the bottom of the issue thread it doesnt actually do anything besides provide the user a visual cue reminding users to click to dismiss the notification Currently BookStack has a very neat Entity Selection tool that lets you link to another page within the same bookstack installation Unfortunately once that link is created it is hardcoded into the page being edited In most cases that is probably sufficient However I am currently in a situation where I need to change the domain name upon which bookstack is hosted While changing the appropriate setting in the env file does update the general assets correctly the internal links do not change This means that after I update the domain I will need to go through every single page and update every single internal link Suggested Feature Have any links created by the Entity Selector link generator be a dynamicallycreated link This will allow migrating to a new domain to work without manual intervention Additional Comments I suspect this feature would also affect links that point to pages which later have their names changed Finally the comment regarding APPURL in the env file states All URLs in BookStack will be generated using this value Given that internal links are not dynamic this is at best misleading and at worst incorrect Hello I had version and I liked very much the aspect of it very vivid colors I have upgraded to the last version and it looks worse for me because the colors are darker and the book icon is different Is there any way of getting back the colorsaspect of while maintaining the new features of Thank you very much the user styles specified in the settings do not work on the settings page On other pages styles work Application Version Latest DEV Sometimes under very strange circumstances when creating a page and saving it after trying to edit the created page the page is not saved the first version of the page always remains While deleting this page is also not possible I did not find the patterns of such behavior in the Mariadb database the page and all its fields look similar to the other page that is being edited In order for the page to start editing in the same place in the database you need to change the text for example to and the page starts to be edited using bookstack tools Bookstack latest version
