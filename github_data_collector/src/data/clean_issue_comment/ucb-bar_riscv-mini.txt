Current riscvmini implements RV I of the Userlevel ISA Version and the Machinelevel ISA of the Privileged Architecture Version This requires the users to build and install RISCV tools for priv If we upgrade the implement to userlevel ISA to version and privileged architecture to version users could download latest prebuilt compiler from xpackdevtools and generate the executable much easier Major Userlevel Base ISA Changes Changes from v to v Rearranged chapters to put all extensions first in canonical order Improvements to the description and commentary Modified implicit hinting suggestion on JALR to support more efficient macroop fusion of LUIJALR and AUIPCJALR pairs Clarification of constraints on loadreservedstoreconditional sequences A new table of control and status register CSR mappings Clarified purpose and behavior of highorder bits of fcsr Specified behavior of narrower FLEN floatingpoint values held in wider f registers using NaNboxing model Defined the exception behavior of FMA qNaN Changes from v to v Modification to long instruction encodings bits to avoid moving the rd specifier in very long instruction formats CSR instructions are now described in the base integer format where the counter registers are introduced as opposed to only being introduced later in the floatingpoint section and the companion privileged architecture manual The SCALL and SBREAK instructions have been renamed to ECALL and EBREAK re spectively Their encoding and functionality are unchanged Clarification of LRSC allowed successes and required failures including use of compressed instructions in the sequence Major Privileged Architecture Changes Changes from v to v The explicit convention on shadow CSR addresses has been removed to reclaim CSR space Shadow CSRs can still be added as needed The mvendorid register now contains the JEDEC code of the core provider as opposed to a code supplied by the Foundation This avoids redundancy and offloads work from the Foundation The interruptenable stack discipline has been simplified An optional mechanism to change the base ISA used by supervisor and user modes has been added to the mstatus CSR and the field previously called Base in misa has been renamed to MXL for consistency Clarified expected use of XS to summarize additional extension state status fields in mstatus Optional vectored interrupt support has been added to the mtvec and stvec CSRs The SEIP and UEIP bits in the mip CSR have been redefined to support software injection of external interrupts The mbadaddr register has been subsumed by a more general mtval register that can now capture bad instruction bits on an illegal instruction fault to speed instruction emulation The machinemode baseandbounds translation and protection schemes have been removed from the specification as part of moving the virtual memory configuration to sptbr now satp Some of the motivation for the base and bound schemes are now covered by the PMP registers but space remains available in mstatus to add these back at a later date if deemed useful In systems with only Mmode or with both Mmode and Umode but without Umode trap support the medeleg and mideleg registers now do not exist whereas previously they returned zero Virtualmemory page faults now have mcause values distinct from physicalmemory access exceptions Pagefault exceptions can now be delegated to Smode without delegating excep tions generated by PMA and PMP checks An optional physicalmemory protection PMP scheme has been proposed The supervisor virtual memory configuration has been moved from the mstatus register to the sptbr register Accordingly the sptbr register has been renamed to satp Supervisor Address Translation and Protection to reflect is broadened role The SFENCEVM instruction has been removed in favor of the improved SFENCEVMA instruction The mstatus bit MXR has been exposed to Smode via sstatus The polarity of the PUM bit in sstatus has been inverted to shorten code sequences involving MXR The bit has been renamed to SUM Hardware management of pagetable entry Accessed and Dirty bits has been made optional simpler implementations may trap to software to set them The counterenable scheme has changed so that Smode can control availability of counters to Umode Hmode has been removed as we are focusing on recursive virtualization support in Smode The encoding space has been reserved and may be repurposed at a later date A mechanism to improve virtualization performance by trapping Smode virtualmemory management operations has been added The Supervisor Binary Interface SBI chapter has been removed so that it can be maintained as a separate specification Changes from v to v Numerous additions and improvements to the commentary sections Change configuration string proposal to be use a search process that supports various formats including Device Tree String and flattened Device Tree Made misa optionally writable to support modifying base and supported ISA extensions CSR address of misa changed Added description of debug mode and debug CSRs Added a hardware performance monitoring scheme Simplified the handling of existing hard ware counters removing privileged versions of the counters and the corresponding delta reg isters Fixed description of SPIE in presence of userlevel interrupts Changes from v to v Not yet available For more details please refer to the documents here Please leave your comments TesterDriver execute was separated into executeVerilog and executeTreadle The default backend remains verilog One can change comment on default backend to make all tests run in Treadle Or this can be done by adding a backend annotation to most tests Directory naming is changed Tests have a fixed unique name Rerunning test keeps the same name as before this makes it easier to reload vcd files in debugging the same direct CacheTests There a couple of treadle problems uncovered here Some naming changes were made in the GoldCache to make debugging easier Currently this is the only test that explicitly uses Treadle Fixed typo in TestUtils Reformatted table for chisel style Hi Ive started coding Chisel the past few weeks and I have to work on the risc v mini processor I am having troubles following which signal is used for what in code I also do not understand how is the freechipsrocketchipconfig suppose to work So my question is do you have a report or a commented version of the code that contains the description of the intern signals of each module Thank you Id like to propose the following Make the current master branch become the release branch Make release be the default branch in this repo It will for now continue to point to its desired version of chisel This would allow us to work on master buffering existing users After the above change master branch Point to current SNAPSHOT Fix all code to be compliant and as warning free as possible with Chisel put all code in main and tests into a mini package This will bring it in line with standard Scala conventions Change master to depend on chiseltesters instead of chisel This would allow us to develop some testers style unit tests This would help test out testers capabilities Provide alternative examples of unit testing facilities under chisel Hello I made sure everything is setup The VTilev is generated I also got the HEX precompiled tests working now I want to create some additional software benchmarks So I tried to build the priv toolchain The build process fails here bash In file included from home
