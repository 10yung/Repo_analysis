Describe the bug Im trying to track down a crash on Fedora using Cinnamon desktop In particular Im trying to use some additional compiler flags to identify the cause of the crash The problem is my CXXFLAGS are ignored To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior configure debug CXXFLAGSg O fsanitizeaddress make j Expected behavior The makefiles should honor my CXXFLAGS The user always owns the well known variables like CFLAGS CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS Also see Makefile Conventions and Variables for Specifying Commands in the GNU Coding Standards Here is what the default recipe should look like give or take in a Makefile Notepadqq owns its flags and the user owns their flags Users dont mess with Notepadqqs flags and Notepadqq should not mess with the users flags The users flags always trumps the projects flags for situations like these makefile o cpp CXX CPPFLAGS NOTEPADQQCXXFLAGS CXXFLAGS c Screenshots If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem Environment please complete the following information OS Fedora x Installation type Notepadqq GitHub Qt version Notepadqq version Master Additional context None Heres what it looks like Notice all of my flags have been ignored

notepadq qcpp Im submitting a check one with x X bug report search github for a similar issue or PR before submitting feature request support request Please do not submit support request here instead see Current behavior The application crashes on MacOS Catalina after opening and running for cca seconds Minimal reproduction of the problem with instructions Build the app from cloning the current repository on MacOS Catalina Then run the notepadqq it will run and continue running not more that seconds tops after that it will crash MacOS will offer to reopen the program after that it will reopen Notapadqq and it will crash again after a short while Please tell us about your environment MacOS Catalina Qt Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I have a laptop with a high density display running linux mint cinnamon bit I can change the text font size to display fine but the icons toolbars menus window titles and so forth arent adjusted or scaled to HD display size and are too small Describe the solution youd like In preferences allow a large icon menu font window title options for HD displays Describe alternatives youve considered Some other apps autoadjust but Im not clear if that is app logic or if they are based on system settings I couldnt find an internet workaround or a system setting that positively affected the sizes Additional context Notepadqq isnt the worst offender so I expect it is picking up some defaults but I would prefer to have more control and be able to select a larger interface font icon size for allday use Notepadqq version I had some files in tabCache from a previous install Tried to merge into current install and opened Notepadqq Without warning Notepadqq simply decided to delete the entire contents of tabCache Like fine there was probably something more needed beyond copying the files over but why is deleting everything the response Notepadqq went with While notepadqq otherwise does a great job as being my troubleshooter theres this eg body input typeradio checked body body and the checked will be colored red even tho this is perfectly valid doesnt recognize ejs either but thats more of a feature request Update snap instructions Remove deprecated ppa information including debian Remove deprecated stable AUR Hi all Describe the bug notepadqq beta is compiled on Fedora but does not run due to a segmentation fault To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Run notepadqq by its script After some seconds it freezes Environment Fedora x Compiled from sources Qt version Notepadqq version beta
