Hello everyone I am using socketIOobjc in my project using XCode I am trying to paring or connect with hardware device with using particular IP Address and Port which connect successfully I am using below code create socketio client instance socketIO SocketIO alloc initWithDelegateself socketIO connectToHostmyHost onPortport and then I am getting response from void connectionNSURLConnection connection didReceiveDataNSData data in SocketIOm class Now data coming in every seconds It is working well But when I lock my iPhone then connection getting break This is the main issue So how I can use socket connection in background Please guide me I stuck from last many days Thanks I am using this library in iOS for communication with our back end server via websockets I need to check on the client side if the socket is already connected or not Is there a way to do the sameThis is more to handle when app goes into background or app gets auto lock enabled on idle time Since NSURLConnection has been deprecated in iOS will this useful library be updated I think NSURLConnection should be replaced by NSURLSession so that NSURLConnection dependency can be removed Hello I have an issue my server has a HAProxy loadbalancer and I need to send the cookies in the headers and in the connect When I add the cookies I can see that the cookies are sent in the request but in socketRocket did connect upgrade I can see that the cookies in the parameter requestcookies cant be found Im using pod socketIO pod SocketRocket My setup is socketIOcookies NSHTTPCookieStoragesharedHTTPCookieStoragecookiesForURLNSURLstring ConstantsapiHost socketIOconnectToHosthost onPort withParams nil withNamespace NS Do you have any idea if I have a bad config or if I should make a PR and add the cookies in the WS request My regards Francisco I have tried lots but not getting success please suggest me how to send messages event from iOS client to server Nodejs I have used below code for Client side Connect host working proper socketIO SocketIO alloc initWithDelegateself socketIO connectToHostHOSTURL onPortPORT Send messageevent not working Event NSMutableDictionary dict NSMutableDictionary dictionary dict setObject forKeyid socketIO sendEventmessage withDatadict Message socketIO sendMessageHello abc Server side code Nodejs var app requirehttpcreateServerhandler var io requiresocketioapp var fs requirefs var users var clients function handler req res var filePath requrl fsreadFilefilePathdirname indexhtml function err data consolelogconnnected from ios if err reswriteHead return resendError loading indexhtml reswriteHead resenddata appaddListenerrequest functionreqres consolelogreqheaders applisten ioonconnection function socket socketonmessage function data consolelog message data socketondisconnect function consolelogDisconnected socketid Thanks Lokesh Patel Hi If I connect to the socket server via a webpage with JS everything works as expected Correct data handling the whole deal As soon as I attempt to do the same via socketIOobjc i get bad data in debug log and cannot handle data Maybe something to do with sure how to handle line breaks in packet data I try looking for n r r n but nothing seems to work In addition I always get ERROR data that has arrived wasnt valid My JS script works successfully looking for n Thanks John Need to add libicucoredylib library in Xcode in order to use socketio The problem that I am stuck into is very simple yet complicated for me I would like to know how can I add a different path of the service that is being used I have a service running on server which is listening to port ie localhost and I have another service which is listening request on port but on a different path localhost Chat How do I change the path I am working for chat app and using SocketIO library for establishing socket connection in iOS Below is my response coming in source I am not sure why my connection is disconnected SocketTesterARC Connecting to socket with URL SocketTesterARC didReceiveResponse SocketTesterARC connectionDidFinishLoading sidRhe weXyVLjtbaYAAAcupgrades websocket pingInterval pingTimeout SocketTesterARC sid SocketTesterARC heartbeatTimeout SocketTesterARC transports websocket pingInterval SocketTesterARC no transport found that is supported fail SocketTesterARC onError Error DomainSocketIOError Code The operation couldn t be completed SocketIOError error SocketTesterARC onDisconnect SocketTesterARC socketio disconnected did error occur Error DomainSocketIOError Code The operation couldn t be completed SocketIOError error
