 We use Github issues for bug reports feature requests general support and questions about the library Please fill out this template when filing an issue What did you do I have three major problems When presentingdismissing my ViewController there seems to be this white background behind my nd ViewController but I would like to just cover my first ViewController with the nd without any white views My image disappears after the user starts swiping down behind my views when instead it should not change its position preferred dismiss animation until the view actually dismisses Same things goes for the addButton in the bottom right corner Like in the preferred dismiss animation my the backgroundViewlightGray View in the nd video should dismiss a bit fast then the other subviews I tried using the cascademodifier but couldnt get that effect What did you expect to happen This is how I would like my animation to look like What happened instead The problem is that it looks like this General Information Hero Version iOS Versions Swift Version DevicesSimulators Reproducible in Examples YesNo Demo Project I also have this question on Stackoverflow with my code and bounty JoeMatt What did you do I present a modal with vcmodalPresentationStyle overCurrentContext The presentingVC is a chat app VC with a list of chats The chatCells have a titleLabel whos heroId is the same as the Modal VCs navigationBar titleLabel The presentation animation works beautifully theres no problem here What did you expect to happen When I dismiss I dont want the same match animation that was used to present the modal Instead I want it to dismiss normally with the default iOS modal dismiss animation To achieve this I set heroisEnabled false in my modal VC right before calling dismissanimated true What happened instead Instead what happens is the modal will dismiss I briefly see the my presenting VC with the cell that was tapped having its subviews out of position Then the view goes black I debug the view hierarchy and it appears as if even my root viewController is dismissed so theres literally no rootVC in my viewhierachy How do I fix this to have a normal dismiss without Hero match animation General Information Hero Version iOS Versions Swift Version DevicesSimulators Device Demo Project Please link to or upload a project we can download that reproduces the issue What did you do Using Heros progress update functionality when dismissing a VC on a pan gesture causes many issues If you use the code in the example project see below the first issue is that on a fast pan the screen freezes because the snapshot stays on the screen Some people suggested that explicitly putting Herosharedcancel and Herosharedfinish on the main thread fixes this issue This is partly true but it introduces an other issue now the screen wont freeze on a fast pan gesture but the animations are skipped On fast pans the modifiers are ignored and the panned view snaps to its place in the parent VC in a strange buggy way The only fix that solves these problems is to put finish and cancel to the main thread and also detect fast pans and delay the dismissal manually which is a really ugly hacky adhoccy solution What did you expect to happen Using the code below should be able to handle pan gesture based VC dismissal even when pan gestures are really fast General Information Hero Version iOS

out on my own Send help Hello I used hero transition in my application to match view from one view controller to another view controller unfortunately I forced an issue with visible views both views in first and second view controllers have a background color with alpha component so after open the second view controller the first one still visible under the second view controller please note that second view controller has a clear background and these properties modalTransitionStyle coverVertical modalPresentationStyle overFullScreen To solve this issue we should change the opacity for first view controller to be Please check the attached SS img width altScreen Shot at PM src img width altScreen Shot at PM src img width altScreen Shot at PM src GitHub test action was failing to run because iOSlegacy job got duplicated somehow in a previous PR merge Swift Upgrade What did you do I have a ViewController that has a subview with an AVPlayerLayer playing a video To this ViewController I add a NavigationController as a child view controller containing a rootViewController that has a view with an heroID I have set the navigation controller heroNavigationAnimationType to fade and have set isHeroEnabled to true The backgroundColor of the NavigationController and its rootViewController are clear so that I can see the video playing behind the NavigationViewController The her animation works as expected however during the animation the video turns black until the animation finishes I have tried all possible combinations of setting noSnapshot on the views however nothing seems to be working I suspect there is something with snapshotting going on thats the cause of this issue How can I keep the video playing during a transition of the NavigationViewController Screenshot at What did you expect to happen I expect the video to continue playing What happened instead The video shows black when I push a ViewController on the NavigationController When the animation finishes the video is playing again I suspect snapshotting is the cause of the issue however this is pure assumption General Information Hero Version iOS Versions Swift Version
