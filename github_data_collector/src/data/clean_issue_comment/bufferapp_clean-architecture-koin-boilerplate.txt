Cached repository not used because setLastCacheTime not called Where can I called that App cant load data from the URL gives Why didnt use directly AndroidSchedulers and Schedulers from RxAndroid Hello the build fails with cleanarchitecturekoinboilerplatedatasrcmainjavaorgbufferandroidboilerplatedataBufferooDataRepositorykt Unresolved reference Completable I like your example a lot and I want to take it as a template for my own app that fetches board game infos I was wondering with regard to clean architecture and tier architecture whether there is no domain layer presdomaindata or if you just didnt highlight it specifically like in your first cleanandroidarchitecture example Thank you very much Christian Could you please update to the lasted version of koin Thanks in advance Hello I will use your template for a new project at work and we have decided to update its dependencies I have updated all library versions and migrate everything to AndroidX including tests There is a changelog file with all the changes and I have added a plugin for checking dependency updates I hope you find it useful Xavi Hello I want to say wow really good boilerplate code But it would be awesome if you could make it as online generator because refactoring packages can be tedious The current configurations for Travis CI causes the build to fail since the SDKs specified different from the ones being used in the project Hello can the app use Kotlin Extension Functions to map the data in the Remote and Cache modules instead of using a Mapper interface Maybe this will not be clean in some way since the function will only apply to the Data Models that have been specified but in my opinion its one less object we have to create or mock Your thoughts hitherejoe
