Can we extend the badge generation functionality to generate different some different stylings Im looking for something more simple like what shieldsio has If the C project is large it is possible that some logic is placed header files and this files are used from different source files As a result the coverageinfo lcov output contains multiple SN entrances for the same header files Lcov parser doesnt recognize this situation and creates duplicates of the same class file name in assembly This leads to two effects The html report contains duplicated entrances for such header files History throws exception because of the key duplication The proposed changes could be var class new ClassfileName assembly thisProcessClassclass fileName lines ref i var exClass assemblyClassesFistOrDefault cl clName fileName ifexClass nulptr exClassMergeclass else assemblyAddClassclass At private void ProcessAssemblyAssembly assembly string lines When using verbosityError I only expect to get any output if something goes wrong but reportgenerator still outputs a list of all received arguments I would not expecct that sort of output at any level lower than Verbose
