Cordial saludo de forma atenta me comunico porque estoy estudiando temas de big data con R studioSpark y presento problemas para instalar el paquete dbplot es posible puedas ayudarme con este error Por su amable atenci n y pronta respuesta gracias It is not possible to add a legend to a boxplot with dbplot How can I use this after a call to make a JDBC connection with DBIdbConnect I would love to have an example vignette that I can follow Thanks Thanks for the work on this project Ive noticed that the calculation of the histogram bins is done using rlang and sparlyrdbplyr verbs Have you considered using the histogramnumeric function from hive For some reasons summarisehistrogramnumericcolumnname nbins doesnt work However it should be possible to encode this as a SQL statement directly Thank you very much for developing this package it looks very interesting I can reproduce the examples in the documentation however when I try the function on real data I get the following spark error Error orgapachesparkSparkException Job cancelled because SparkContext was shut down The table I am trying to plot is quite big but even after trying head compute or head coalesce the error remain Do you have any suggestion on how to debug this or which parameters could be adjusted Thanks edgararuiz I very much enjoyed your webinar on Best practices for working with databases Using SQL server isnt that convenient for many of our students however so I wanted to adapt your databasesandRRmd file to work with SQLite Unfortunately lots of errors popped up with dbplot and for example the sampling example I just wanted to check with you if that is expected I know that SQLite is more limited as a database so perhaps this is expected r dbflights filterisnaarrdelay dbplothistogramarrdelay r Error in newresultconnectionptr statement nanodbcnanodbccpp HY SQLite near OVER syntax error stopstructurelistmessage nanodbcnanodbccpp HY SQLite near OVER syntax error call newresultconnectionptr statement cppstack NULL class cnanodbcdatabaseerror CError error condition newresultconnectionptr statement OdbcResultconnection conn statement statement dbSendQuerycon sql dbSendQuerycon sql dbcollectDBIConnectionxsrccon sql n n warnincomplete warnincomplete dbcollectxsrccon sql n n warnincomplete warnincomplete stopstructurelistmessage nanodbcnanodbccpp HY SQLite near OVER syntax error call newresultconnectionptr statement cppstack NULL class cnanodbcdatabaseerror CError error condition r eval FALSE flightssample dbflights filtercancelled year arrangedayofmonth mutaterow rownumber head collect r Error in newresultconnectionptr statement nanodbcnanodbccpp HY SQLite near syntax error stopstructurelistmessage nanodbcnanodbccpp HY SQLite near syntax error call newresultconnectionptr statement cppstack NULL class cnanodbcdatabaseerror CError error condition newresultconnectionptr statement OdbcResultconnection conn statement statement dbSendQuerycon sql dbSendQuerycon sql dbcollectDBIConnectionxsrccon sql n n warnincomplete warnincomplete Great package It would be nice to be able to facet plots computed in the database eg via facetwrap or on a grouped table Or is there a straightforward approach already that I am missing In the Calculation functions section you show a histogram with a scale on the left and a color legend on the right This color legend is not needed and is not conventional with histograms IMHO The color legend doesnt add any information thats not in the scale at the left But how can I change the bars in the histogram to some constant color Why doesnt something like fillred work
