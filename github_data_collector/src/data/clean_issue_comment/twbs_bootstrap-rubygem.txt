give more detail Hi I tried to use this GEM in distinct SO Windows and Linux tried to look at google but Im not able to resolve I create a dropdown menu its showed in Browser but Im not able to open Im running rails ruby p Ubuntu LTS An example that Im using div classdropdown button classbtn btnsecondary dropdowntoggle typebutton iddropdownMenuButton datatoggledropdown ariahaspopuptrue

hrefSomething else herea div div Thank you Why the gem doesnt add viewport to the applicationhtmlerb page meta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth initialscale More on this is also written on the medium Using Bootstrap from CDN requires an exact version number that is not tied to gem releases Although historically BootstrapVERSION has mirrored the official Bootstrap version number this might not always be the case Therefore this patch adds BootstrapVENDORVERSION which is updated by the updater task Additionally it is best practice to employ subresource integrity hashes when using any public CDN To support this this patch adds BootstrapVENDORINTEGRITY which is a Hash mapping asset names to their properlyencoded integrity hashes This Hash is also updated by the updater task Here is an example of usage htmlerb script src BootstrapVENDORVERSION jsbootstrapbundleminjs integrity BootstrapVENDORINTEGRITY bootstrapbundleminjs crossoriginanonymousscript It would be nice to wrap that up in a helper method like Bootstrapjscdntagbundle true but I wasnt sure if that would be considered outside the scope of this gem It would endorse a specific CDN but perhaps thats acceptable since it is the official Bootstrap CDN Also the helper method should probably include something akin to tryhtmlsafe which might feel out of place Either way I can add mention of this to the README if desired I dont think the bootstrap gem is communicating well with the bootsnap gem As a result of this the bootstrap gem cant be loaded However everything was working find before I updated to Before I was using bootstrap but I updated because of the XSS vulnerability Heres the error I get from Usersusernamervmgemsruby gemsactivesupport libactivesupportdependenciesrb in block in require
