After run the tool some files will be deleted This is something expected It is expected that we manually copy again the deleted files in the remaining steps Sometimes we have users who have filenames in different case from index in their local copies To find all files in wrong case and make them as they are in index I have added new option osrename it doesnt make any changes in index but rename files in filesystem And I also make some performance optimizations its good for big repositories It gives about times processing speed boost on my repository
