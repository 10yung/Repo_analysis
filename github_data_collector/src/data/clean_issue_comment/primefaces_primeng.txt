states Enable Inbetween Disable On Inbetween Off The implementation would still be the input tag with the checkbox type with using of its Indeterminate property as the Inbetween state The visual appearance can be something like the following The primary use case is the situation where a user has a group of checkboxesswitches which should be all checkedswitched onoff by one clickoperation but which should also allow individual selectiondeselection that leads to the intermediate state The intermediate state represents the state in the middle It should also be possible to set it only programmatically and not allow a user to do it manually because a user creates it by himself by selectingdeselecting of individual checkboxesswitches But then a user can choose to switch the tristate switch to onoff state which selectsdeselects all checkboxesswitches in the group on one click again BrowserAnimationModule export BrowserModule according to Defect Fixes When submitting a PR please
