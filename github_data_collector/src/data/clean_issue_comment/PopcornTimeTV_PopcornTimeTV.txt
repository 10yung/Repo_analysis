take to find the same bug that you found Its my first time trying to compile a version of PT myself I figured out how to get a signed version of the app on my apple tv but now Im having an issue whereas when I select a movie or show to play the quality selector briefly appears and then disappears thus being unable to play any movie or show Since its my first time doing this and I aspirate to dig in deeper into development I was wondering If this is because I did something wrong when compiling the app or because of a known error Any help would be appreciated
