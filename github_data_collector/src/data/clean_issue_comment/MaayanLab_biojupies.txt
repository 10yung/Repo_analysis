Hi is there a way to rename individual samples after uploading the fastq files and aligining them Also is there a way to merge datasets I needed about a full day to upload all my samples and it would have been nice if I could upload only a few files at a time and then merge all the subsets instead of having to upload all the samples in one go Thanks in advance Biojupies is really a great tool Omer Hi BioJupies team Thanks for this great program For a BioJupies experiment is it possible to upload and analyze both single and pairedend fastqs at the same time Thanks Kris Bumps notebook from to

genesets differentially expressed genes for the enrichment and small molecule analysis only So instead of using RNAseq data one can use the differential expression results for example from scRNA seq to generate these I just love these notebooks and itll be so much convenient compared to using the enrichment tools individually Are there any issues with the platform recently Having a lot of problems loading tables and when they do I cant assign groups nor can I move on to the next step Used to work fine The link to export images to plotlly disappeared With the old version there was the link to plotlys dashboard on the bottom right to each plot Notebooks can not be modified locally using Docker When running a notebook with Docker as sudo docker run it v HOMEdockerdatadata p e

Davide Hi Would it be possible to implement the option for searching for multiple rows ie genes at a time in Clustergrammer At present this option is not available but I believe it could be quite useful Thanks a lot Davide
