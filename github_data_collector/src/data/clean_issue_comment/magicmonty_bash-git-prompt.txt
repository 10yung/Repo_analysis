I am not entirely sure what might be going on here I have a server set up with ssh access and I have a key for it in ssh I did have to add a host entry in sshconfig so maybe that setting is ignored but either way I keep getting password prompts from bashgitprompt in the middle of my prompts I would be happy to help debugging if you have any specific questions I am using bashgitprompt stable and it is slow but only when i open directory with git repository in it The lag is around seconds after any command for example ls How to debug what causes this lag Not every repository affected but some does Private index was tried to create in nonexistent location no error was ever displayed and then unconditionally GITINDEXFILE variable was set pointing to nonexistent path Git used this location and reported many changed files Additionally in case of nonexistent index file most of files were marked with D in second loop pass of gitstatussh which was wrongly identified as Stashed It is common on Android devices there is no tmp directory Termux creates one and sets TMPDIR variable which is commonly honoured by most of unix utilities If any script saved in PROMPTCOMMAND wants to know last command exit status without using GITPROMPTLASTCOMMANDSTATE but based on shell variable after installing bashgitprompt it stopped working because variable was set to success after assigning GITPROMPTLASTCOMMANDSTATE variable This PR fixes it Reopening again PR under new name as need master branch in my forked repository Additional fix when GITPROMPTPREFIX or GITPROMPTSUFFIX contain color sequences gitprompthelps formatting was wrong Add ability to place virtual environment infos between prompt and git status instead of left to the prompt Ive done a fresh Mac installed and enabled bashgitprompt as Ive done many times before however it is not detecting a Git folder ie no change in prompt Ive checked my bashprofile many times to no avail If I rerun gitpromptsh in the terminal it magically starts working so its something thats going on in my bashprofile but I dont see what in fact the bashprofile is copied from another machine that is working Im guessing Bash versions or Git version Im on the latest of both what else can I do to debug this I can see gitpromptsh is called and loads up its just not detecting the Git folder Ive tried multiple folders too I had to add export in front of in order for it to work Presumably other variables in that stack should also be exported as well but I didnt test those This is on MacOS I want to remove the branch name from the prompt I am using iTerm status bar to display the branch name and Id like to remove it from the prompt Is there a way to do this
