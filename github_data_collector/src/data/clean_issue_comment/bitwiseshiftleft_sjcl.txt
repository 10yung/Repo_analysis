Are there any plans to add Argon to SJCL Thx Added support for reactnative The eval expression was required for the bundler Could perhaps optimize later The link here is out of date InverseMods parameter is needed to be odd How to implement sqrt Implementing conditional move for constanttime coding The constructor takes arguments but the documentation only lists b is missing Construct an elliptic curve Most users will not use this and instead start with one of the NIST curves defined below constructor param bigInt p The prime modulus param bigInt r The prime order of the curve param bigInt a The constant a in the equation of the curve y x ax b for NIST curves a is always param bigInt x The x coordinate of a base point of the curve param bigInt y The y coordinate of a base point of the curve sjclecccurve functionField r a b x y I am not sure this is accurate anymore hello this is not an issue but rather a question I would like to keep only what I need i e pbkdf hmac and sha how to rebuild the library with only these components regards const sjclrequiresjclall var keys sjcleccelGamalgenerateKeys provsionerKeykeys pubIxtoStringslice keys pubIytoStringslice
