I was looking forward to trying wisp but after importing the project into Intellij IDEA and launching the console when I type import comquantifiedchartsHighcharts I get an error error object quantified is not a member of package com Really a cat image for the logo I have successfully added Wisp dependency on my All Spark Notebook In other words I am able to import the following apis without any problems import comquantifindchartshighchartsHighchart import comquantifindchartshighchartsHighchart import comquantifindchartsHighcharts In addition the following command works fine for me val myplot areasplineList List myplottoJson In fact it generates something like series data x y x y x y x y x y typeareaspline exportingfilenamechartyAxis titletext plotOptionsareasplineturboThreshold creditshreftextchartzoomTypexytitletextxAxis titletext However it is not obvious to me how to tell Jupyter to convert the above JSON into a real plot I realize this project is no longer under active development but could you release artifacts on the maven central repository The current version is Please and thanks Suppose I plot sth eg the following scala Highchartsareasplinerecall precision HighchartsxAxisRecall HighchartsyAxisPrecision It starts running the server and hangs in there info INFO orgeclipsejettyserverServer jetty v info INFO oejettyserverAbstractConnector Started SocketConnector info Server started info Output written to CMD Click link in Mac OSX info Output written to CMD Click link in Mac OSX info Output written to CMD Click link in Mac OSX How can I stop the plot server without restarting sbt I am trying to plot scatter chart and I am setting a label for every Data object def createSeriesclusterName String wordPoints List WordPoint Series data wordPointsmap point Datapointx pointy name Somepointword chart Somescatter name SomeclusterName But label Data name is not showing If I am using another chart fe spline I can see labels By manually editing the generated html and changing script typetextjavascriptajaxurl check dataType jsonp complete functionlocationreloadscript to script typetextjavascriptajaxurl check dataType jsonp complete functionscript It worked Seems like a while since the last release Currently BoxplotData has fields specifically for min q median q max but another popular boxplot gives the mean and a confidence interval based on t distribution for sample mean Or sometimes standard deviations etc Ideally boxplot would allow a selection of alternatives for generating the box and the midline Currently the xy bounds of the plot seem to be set automatically and I cant change them It looks like that may require some tweaks to the javascript as well as the scala layer
