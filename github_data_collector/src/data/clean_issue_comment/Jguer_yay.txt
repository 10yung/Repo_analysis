files from cache fatal not a git repository or any of the parent directories git Affected Version yay v r g fcfbf libalpm v Issue Hi this is probably a feature request and not a bug I have a devel package git version more specifically faisscudagit which allows setting GPU architecture of your hardware in order to speedup builds without being set it builds for all GPU architectures supported by said package not your hardware When I perform install using editmenu flag and edit it to specific architecture the edit is saved for the current build as should be However next time I update the package using yay Syu devel and dont edit PKGBUILD since I expect the edit on clean install to be persistent it uses stock PKGBUILD douwnloaded from AUR I believe it would be beneficial to use this edited PKGBUILD since the version in AUR did not change and the update is happening solely due to original git repo being updated It is entirely possible that yay has a switch to do so and I have not discovered it yet If that is the case please point me to it Steps to reproduce Install devel package and edit PKGBUILD using yay facilities Perform devel update sometime in the future when the package is NOT updated in AUR however the underlying repo is updated and therefore update is triggered Do not invoke the editmenu because it is believed in fact known I am maintainer of the aforementioned package that PKGBUILD was not updated Current behavior Step uses stock PKGBUILD form AUR Expected behavior Step should use edited PKGBUILD from building the package the first time Config details

Version Please ensure you are using the latest yaygit package Use yay V to get installed version Example yay v r g ac ab libalpm v yay V yay v libalpm v Issue yay Syu should show the upgrademenu when the upgrademenu option is true Currently Im only able to make it show on the yay Syuw which is not much useful since the upgrade install will download the unselected package in any case On another note I find it strange that the upgrade menu is shown after downloading all the packages and not before In particular when doing a large upgrade kde it can take a long time between starting the upgrade command and getting the upgrade menu to show If it was shown before the only delay would be the repo update and after doing our selection the upgrade can complete unatended until the end

V to get installed version Example yay v r g ac ab libalpm v yay v r g e e libalpm v Issue Hi This is not an issue per se but more of a suggestion The natron package along with its dependencies openfxarena openfxgmic openfxio and openfxmisc have recently been updated from v RC to RC Yay however fails to see the the RC as an update because the version string does not follow the same exact formatting RC is written as rc whereas RC is rc notice the missing dot between rc and the following number I understand perfectly that this makes sense in a string comparison rc rc but IMO that does not make sense in a version number comparison Would it be possible to do the comparison on a canonical form of the version number string that would be robust to small typographic changes like this The following sections may be left out if not relevant Steps to reproduce Use exact commands where applicable have natron v rc installed yay Syu Output Include the FULL output Include any relevant
