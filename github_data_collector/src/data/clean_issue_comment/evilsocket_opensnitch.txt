opensnitch uses high cpu while qbittorrent running Im using Arch Linux and installed opensnitch through the AUR package The opensnitchd daemon starts and runs just fine Whenever an application tries to access the network the notification window pops up However I cannot launch the ui that shows all the connections made When I run opensnitchui I get the following message Attribute QtAAEnableHighDpiScaling must be set before QCoreApplication is created and the terminal hangs there My gui has grown and there is no option to resize it see Does OpenSnitch manage only the outcoming connections I dont see any option to manage incoming connections too like GUFW does Fix requirementstxt for fresh install using python and update makeadsrulespy to python If the daemon exits due to an unexpected reason segfault etc the iptables rules are not deleted When it starts again the iptables rules are added without deleting the existing ones Chain OUTPUT policy ACCEPT packets bytes pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination K NFQUEUE all ctstate NEW NFQUEUE num bypass NFQUEUE all ctstate NEW NFQUEUE num bypass Chain OUTPUT policy ACCEPT packets bytes pkts bytes target prot opt in out source destination DROP all mark match x ba DROP all mark match x ba Each connection will be filtered by one rule the first match it seems that the order of rules is based off the name of the rule So for example if I had the following rules Block some advertising domain Allow port If the port rule had a name that sorted earlier than the blocking rule then it would still permit http requests to the domain I cant be sure whether its the rule name or the filename of the rule that controls that ordering If Im reading the golang code correctly it supports the use of an operator type list but there is no example in the README of that I think that it would be something like json created T updated T name allowfirefox enabled true action allow duration always operator type list operand ignored data ignored list type simple operand destport data list type simple operand processpath data usrlibfirefoxfirefox list This feels like it should be the default setting process and port Hi simple question how to uninstall Thank you in advance When adding a new permanent rule the temporary ones are deleted so the user is prompted again to allowdeny connections fixes
