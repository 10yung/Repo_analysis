Due to how Lerna works and refuses to change when a patch changes it publishes all dependents with patches also This creates a lot of release noise Need to investigate how this could either be eliminated or bundled into a single release for simpler documenting of the change For now the convention Ill follow is that undocumented releases were only patches and do not contain any note worthy changes First off thanks for the lib its fantastic So leading underscores are not preserved even with snakeCase js changeCasesnakeCaseprivate private changeCasesnakeCaseprivate private changeCasesnakeCaseprivatekey privatekey changeCasesnakeCaseprivatekey privatekey changeCasesnakeCaseprivateKey privatekey changeCasesnakeCaseprivateKey privatekey changeCasecamelCaseprivatekey privateKey changeCasecamelCaseprivatekey privateKey Theres a strong argument to be made that this is expected behavior for camelCase specifically but I think for snakeCase it is arguably not expected behavior leading underscores are pretty widely used as a convention to denote privacy and the presence of a leading underscore doesnt conflict with the rules of snake case unless Im mistaken Thoughts If this is intended behaviorwontfix would you consider an option parameter to preserve leading underscores I just ran into a situation where I had a bunch of lowercase snakecase symbols and needed each word to be in title case Sadly changecase does not handle this flavor For example I want to be able to transform something into SomeThing I know this is a little uncommon but it would have been very helpful just now I am using changecase via the VSCode extension and it is tremendously useful Thanks for the great library At the moment snakeCase doesnt insert an underscore before numbers I would expect it to do that Current behaviour changeCasesnakeCasepricePer Km returns priceper km Expected behaviour changeCasesnakeCasepricePer Km returns priceper km If this is not a bug then I would suggest making it an option through a possible argument Maybe like this changeCasesnakeCasepricePer Km handleNumbers true returns priceper km
