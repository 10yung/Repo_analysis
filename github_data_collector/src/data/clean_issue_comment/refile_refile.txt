This patch adds support for the credentials feature introduced in rails The code patch has been updated to also check that the secretkeybase is also actually set This is more inline with the logic of configsecretkeybase in Rails and whit what other gems like Devise do We cant use configsecretkeybase since it doesnt exist on Rails versions before Replaces Closes This patch adds support for a new quality parameter that will be forwarded to the image processor This patch requires Specs Specs are missing since I couldnt find any information on how to run them and I was also not sure how the specs are build up I can see that there are some dummy processors used that work with strings rather than images I would love to get some help and add specs for the new parameter Version Requirements Since this change requires a specific version of the refileminimagick gem we would need to somehow ensure that the correct version is present Since the gem dependency points from refileminimagick to refile Im not sure how we would enforce this Other processors would also now need to support this option which might makes no sense for nonimage based processors Maybe another patch is needed first that exposes the supported options on each image processor Ill love to hear your thoughts on how to solve this problem I believe rails has switched to credentials ie Railsapplicationcredentialssecretkeybase any plans to update this code Thanks I tried upload using internet explorer firefox or chrome into windows xp using files of extensions xlsx zip and pptx And into the parameters the contenttype its empty Just with windows When creating any object with an attachment the tempfile is closed before it can be read My temporary fix is to add this the first line of the create method in the controller where Subscriber is the model and file is the attachment field params subscriber file tempfileopen What might be causing the file to close prematurely Refile version rails version We are using refile for video upload and storage The problem is that on download refile streams the data through the application and it fills up the servers tmp space and create more strain on the system Is there a way to download the file directly from S This would close out if it gets pulled in I published this for testing purposes so you can try it out with npm install save testingrefiletristanoneil The package only includes refilejs in addition to READMEmd Historymd LICENSEtxt and packagejson npm publishes these files by default It does appear that refile is already taken on NPM so the package name would likely have to be changed Ill leave that up to the maintainer though as to what it should be In my project Im not using the Rails asset pipeline Im trying to use presigned for my s uploads but realized it requires the presence of the Javascript library Itd be nice to import this as an NPM package in my entry file I know in paperclip it is built in as of that Base encoded images will upload without any extra work Does refile have any built in support for uploading Base images Leaving out autosave will only save the attachments when the parent record is created
