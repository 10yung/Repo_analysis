The same logic for ignoring a temprelated filesystem event in handleEvents from commandshugogo is now used to ignore files when rebuilding the site Fixes Please answer these questions before submitting your issue Thanks What version of Hugo are you using hugo version v E extended linuxamd Does this issue reproduce with the latest release Yes I wasnt sure why Id often be seeing the live preview of my site break on saves when the state on the filesystem was fine Digging into the no such file or directory message I see this has to do with Emacs lock files being followed where I dont believe they should be The full message is in the form of Error add site dependencies load resources loading templates walk Readdir decorate lstat SITEROOTlayoutspartialsUSERMACHINEPIDBOOT no such file or directory Of course the lock file is a symlink pointing to this path with the prefix added to the file name in an unsaved modified buffer This is true for both content and templating files as long as a buffer is open with a modified version This happens for both hugo and hugo server commands Its easiest to reproduce by triggering a rebuild running hugo or saving a change to a different file with hugo server running and having a file open in emacs with a modified state so the lock symlink exists It seems to also happen as a race condition when editing only a single file with hugo server running where the rebuild reaches the lock symlink before emacs removes it I believe hugo server ignores events around temporary files so a rebuild isnt triggered but does not ignore these files in the building of a site I further believe that well thats the wrong behavior I have a fix that solves my issue see imminent pull request The example blog had not been updated for some time and I had to restructure it a little bit Fixes Changed tag and category directory structure The issue here is that when there are only comments in a indexmd file like below title Reference docs overview mainmenu true weight Much of the Kubernetes reference documentation is generated from Kubernetes source code using scripts The topics in this section document how to generate this type of content There also will be an item for the indexmd file with empty content Screen Shot at PM Please answer these questions before submitting your issue Thanks What version of Hugo are you using hugo version
