What versions of vs and should i use Thanks to anyone who answers I get this error when trying to compile the solution file what can I do Thx Screenshot Is there any option or method for checking things on the marketable in the tradeoffer I was looking for but it seems that Steam webapi doesn t even have one On the other hand there is such a check in the bot on nodejs Hi my bot waits for trade offers and then accepts or declines them Usually the bot handles them automatically when the trade offers come in But sometimes its like the bot is stuck until you press enter Then the bot realizes oh there are trade offers still open and then handles them Have you seen this problem before Is there any fixworkaround where this does not happen Let me know your thoughts A while ago SteamAuth was updated and removed the field Description and it was replaced with ConfType Obviously when SteamAuth was installed it would cause an error ConfType acts the same as Description he type or namespace name SteamAuth could not be found vs nuget actived and i tried reinstalling the package Hey I cant start it Edited the settingsjson but i have no clue where i need to paste my sharedsecret etc so i think the bot cant log in yea c d b e db e The last time SessionAccept Trade Offer Id began to return Null For a long time the bot worked and recently broke What could possibly be the matter Updating SteamAuth SteamKit and Jsonnet versions not using the latest SteamKit because there was a major version bump We should update for that Fix bug causing trade offer confirmations to break Fix bug causing bot to crash when loading some inventories Make BotloadTask public so bots can wait until load is complete Fix bug causing login to not work in some regions Sorry I didnt pull these into separate PRs also sorry for being too lazy to rebase so theres lots of old empty merge commits steambot seems to be unable to connect to steam in the current version bringing up error server unavailable in SteamWebcs on line whenever the bot is launched
