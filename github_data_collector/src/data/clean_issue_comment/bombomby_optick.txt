Studio When I try to launch a standalone game on a dedicated server through Unreal Engine I immediately get the following error after installing Optick The profiler doesnt have to actually be running for this it always fails and Im unable to launch my game I have it setup to launch a dedicated server and clients The client launch in the end but are unable to connect to the server which crashed on

form to create charts For example a list of functions with their average times in the recorded session It would be incredibly helpful for my research project in which I will be recording many different sessions to compare the results Thanks In the picture below the tag pathCost is incorrectly associated with an event that is already out of scope optickbadtagassociation Pseudocode c void

OPTICKTAGpathCost a number OPTICKTAGpathNodes a number Tested with commit tagged It took several attempts to make it happen so I guess it is some sort of a race condition Im using throughout my code and am trying to integrate Optick into the application Previously I was using the OPTICKTHREAD macro when the worker threads started but Optick seems to get confused when you resume a function on another thread after a switch where there is an OPTICKEVENT at the beginning of that function eg the scoped event starts and stops on two different threads This prompted me to go looking and I found OptickRegisterFiber but there is no documentation on this function How should one use this Should it be used in addition to OPTICKTHREAD on the workers What about combined with OPTICKEVENT OPTICKCATEGORY and OPTICKTAG Hi We recently started integrating optick in our engine and figured that the optick viewer would provide a good framework for integratingvisualizing the snapshots generated by our memory allocation tracker Are there any plans to add instrumentation of memory allocations Assuming someone would be willing to contribute would you be interested in this feature If so would you be be willing to provide suggestions for what the API should look like as well as a few pointers regarding the integration Thanks OptickEventDescriptionCreateShared link d d eff c b b da cbeaaf d fcf Accepting the fact that the application is only capable of working with few hundred frames it would be nice to have an option to run the profiler continuously and discard frames older than some configuration time frames or MB This would allow to monitor the game for a long time and after experiencing problems to quickly stop the recording In the current setup I have to start recording and hope that something bad happens in the game in the next few seconds only I hope this feature suggestion makes sense D Hi the wiki page makes no mention of OPTICKFRAME which is rather unfortunate since this is the one required macro to make the profiler work Also what is the difference between OPTICKTHREAD and OPTICKFRAME I have multiple threads each dedicated to a specific task I know that this does not scale but lets leave that aside for now One thread is rendering as fast as possible One thread updates sound buffers at a fixed rate and one thread updates game logic and passes the state to be used by other threads How should I use the two aforementioned macros in such situation How do I control which of the frame sequences will be shown in the upper timeline When I use just one OPTICKFRAME I cannot see details from other threads When I use one OPTICKFRAME in each of the threads I cannot control which of the threads should be in the upper timeline Thanks
