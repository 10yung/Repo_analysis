I tried audiocloverALC command installation in OSX and did not work Kindly requesting upgrade May I ask If its is already working on because its say in the update but when i look on the supported alc is not yet listed The script assumes EFICLOVERconfigbackupplist is ok to delete not ok if user ie me happens to have EFICLOVERconfigbackupplist already Not work on H MDS Motherboard already add kext patch configplistzip Will be any support to Mac OS Mojave Is anyway that I can edit the file to force the script to fun on my Mojave Beta installation Drivers are not supported on AMD X chipset motherboard Threadripper runs on x motherboard VoodooHDA audio works but with lot of crackle sounds any plans to support for x codec Realtek ALC S A Channel High Definition Audio CODEC Not work on B Motherboard already add kext patch for coffeeLake B M PRO zip I apologize if the format is not correct as the problem reporting section of the readme no longer exists On a fresh install of and CloverALC master branch as of yesterday getting audio from the digital output is infrequent at best Yesterday I was able to hear sound from it by restarting however today that only makes it work for a minute or so screen shot at am The Kext does exist but Im guessing the problem is more from the audio ID that im injecting using the script In earlier versions of the script it always suggested audio ID which made my sound work of the time As of commits made either this month or last it says that ID is now invalid and suggests the ID of which I chose this time Any ideas And if there are any logs or files I can upload for you please let me know I found that the archive of the A Codec is corrupted Could Toleda confirm it Terminal Output attached file Output di Terminale salvatozip The EFI partition is attached to the apfs container disk but the script is looking for the EFI attached to the system disk which is a synthesized disk Any way to tell it where to find the correct EFI I have mounted the correct EFI and can see the clover installation but the script cannot Thanks
