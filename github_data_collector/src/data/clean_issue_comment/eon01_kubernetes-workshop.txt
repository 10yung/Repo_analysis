 Access the list of pods should not use the command with HOSTNAME The command with HOSTNAME needs verbs get not list so causes Forbidden fix docker run arg typo it is not valid Needs to be it or interactive tty using shorter version When I apply it I still get the when I run the curl command When I check Cluster Roles in the dashboard the role seems to be defined Thanks for an otherwise great resource Got me up and running with most of the stuff I need without too much trouble Im still quite new to Kubernetes but Ive read that Kubernetes secrets provide a way to securely pass credentials etc to containers In kubernetesapideploymentyaml CLIENTID etc are hardcoded which is probably not a good practice since those files are mentioned to be committed to VCS Id like to have the workshop being extended in a way that it should how to properly handle such confidential variables In READMEmd there is the following command bash docker run it name tgr p e CLIENTIDxxxxxxx e CLIENTSECRETxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx e DEBUGTrue tgr There is two issues with that It should be it rather than it since the first one is invalid You also need to specify e HOST and e PORT in order for the app to start Additionally you might want to add rm flag When not explicitly passing a value for the env parameters eg just e CLIENTID the values from the users local environment are being used which might be preferable because easier since the user sourced the env file before anyway stsits skubecltkubectl
