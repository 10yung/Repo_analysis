flow Hi there Such a robust looking editor Wow I was looking into possibly using HyperMD as an Atom package to handle Markdown files there and even allow Atom to be used thereby as a kind of general purpose editor As such Id be interested in providing a WYSIWYG that may by default be less intimidating to nontechnical users who might be confused by why the marks appear when clicking a heading etc Although I doubt this would be easily possible just in case this is somehow feasible or of interest I wanted to suggest allowing a pure WYSIWYG mode which avoided the ability to introspect albeit in a WYSIWYGish fashion on the Markdown and only appeared something like CKEditorsuch a word processor maybe with an Advanced mode button to add the informative Markdown indicators In any case thanks for the excellent looking tool When the cursor leaves the editor the edited element does not rerender to html img width altScreen Shot at am src Is there a function to call so that the document will do a refresh on blur img width altScreen Shot at am src Great project Ive been looking for something like this to fork for a while Any chance youll add multicaret editing This is one of the main functionalities I miss in most MD editors It is ok to upload image via drag but when i Upload Images and files via clipboard it dont work And I got imagepng error var HyperMD requirehypermd hypermd codemirror css requirecodemirrormodehtmlmixedhtmlmixed Markdown HTML requirecodemirrormodestexstex TeX requirecodemirrormodeyamlyaml Front Matter HyperMD PowerPacks requirehypermdpowerpackfoldmathwithkatex katex requirehypermdpowerpackhoverwithmarked marked power packs Power packs var myTextarea documentgetElementByIdmyTextarea var cm HyperMDfromTextAreamyTextarea hmdModeLoader false html smms ajaxupload First thank you for such an innovative library Currently the markdown support is amazing and for those of us that know markdown syntax well this library works really well However for those not familiar with markdown they may feel lost A toolbar can be as simple as the toolbar in Github or something like Notionio where you type in the symbol to reveal a list of options to add although the list of options doesnt work that great with marking up existing text I have found that some Github Flavored Mode GFW features are not supported Automatic linking for URLs SHA references Some emojis are not displayed Are these known issues
