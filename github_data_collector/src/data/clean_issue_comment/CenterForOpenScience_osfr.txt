I believe based on my use of the osfupload function that there is a typo in the docs Line of gives the example code osfuploadiriscsv overwrite TRUE but I believe it should be osfuploadiriscsv conflicts overwrite Thank you for this package it has been extremely helpful for automating processes in my lab provide a function to duplicate filesdirectories in same location The API provides endpoints for generating and listing external IDs currently limited to DOIs We could implement something like r osfgenerateidproj type doi which would return a modified version of proj with a new doi column The generic name provides for the possibility of being able to generate other IDs generate is annoyingly long might need a different verb Should it verify a node is public Is that a requirement Would also need osflsids to list previously generated IDs since they arent returned by default Commentssuggestions cboettig Add multifile transfer functionality to README and vignettes Add logging instructions to CONTRIBUTING Is osfrms recursive argument still necessary on hold When using the osfupload function in combination with purrrwalk I received an inconsistent error I could upload files with no problems Later when trying the same basic code with a much larger directory files only files uploaded before I received this message Error Encountered an unexpected error with the OSF API Please report this at Status code Request Code that failed with error above osfretrievenode r nw osfmkdir path tetramer with amylose in KCl walkfiles osfupload x I adjusted the code figuring it was a timeout issue and tried to complete the upload with osfretrievenode r nw osflsfiles filtername tetramer with amylose in KCl walkfiles osfupload x overwrite TRUE and got this error Error Internal Server Error HTTP status code Note overwrite FALSE failed to work which is why overwrite is set to TRUE As I stated originally the same basic code worked for files but larger uploads failed to fully complete Have enjoyed using the package and this wont stop me from using it just files is a standard size project for me so batch uploads without having to use the web interface is really useful This would be useful for my codebook package A tweet suggested to add preprint search in the fulltext package which might also perfectly fit here sckott would you consider it preferable to add it here or in fulltext I am planning and have been for too long to submit this package to rOpenSci for review anyway when its somewhat more fleshed out so would value your input to prevent redundancy
