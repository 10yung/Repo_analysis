Hi Im using bolt framework I need to open a modal to display some data without any action so how can i remove the submit button without getting errors Regards Marwa A brief description of your feature request goes here If you open a request for comment or RFC for short please prefix your title with RFC It is expected that you are willing to help out in the implementation of said feature request Other appropiate labels will be applied by the Bolt team when assessing issues How can you help The resources read available time and effort of Bolts core team is limited If were going to consider your request please describe how you are willing to help out to see the new feature become a reality If we can not work on your suggestion please dont take it personally Most likely its either We think your idea is valid but we cant find the time to work on it Your idea might be better suited as an extension if its not suitable for the majority of users again as in Bolt doesnt rename tag from taxonomy If I want to rename a tag with lowercaseuppercase Bolt do nothing Details Question Answer Relevant Bolt Version Install type Composer install PHP version Web server Apache Reproduction Bug summary When we create a tag from Taxonomies tab in content type if tag already exist lowercaseuppercasemix bolt get this tag from bolttaxonomies from slug Steps to reproduce Add taxonomy tags to content type Add new tag in content type eg TeSt Save Delete old tag TeSt and create new tag TesT Save Bolt find tag by slug but the name isnt the same Bug Summary Stored CrossSite Scripting CrossSite Scripting XSS attacks are a type of injection in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code generally in the form of a browser side script to a different end user Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it Scenario When an end user is searching for any results logs are being generated in admin panel an enduser inputs malicious payload such as URLEncoded Cimg src Dx onerror Djavascript Aconfirm E Decoded img srcx onerrorjavascriptconfirm Javascript is being executed on Database page of the admin panel and unauthenticated attacker can use such malicious payloads to perform various exploits and phishingImplement keylogger CSRF Token StealthSession Aware Keyloggeretc Steps to Reproduce Navigate to Click on Search Input payload from above enduserpayload To validate the finding login to admin console and navigate to and select the log with payload navigate to database Selecting Logs adminlogs Navigating to Database

interpreted as active content Depending on the output context this might require applying combinations of HTML URL JavaScript and CSS encoding Filter input on arrival At the point where user input is received filter as strictly as possible based on what is expected or valid input Content Security Policy As a last line of defense you can use Content Security Policy CSP to reduce the severity of any XSS vulnerabilities that still occur References labelheading true false In I managed to fix the breaking error that occurred during exports However as it stands exports still wont always work for all cases If your setup has a contenttype with a select field that pulls content from another contenttype those values will be stored by ID by default Its optional to use a different field for storage That means this content might break during exportimport since those IDs might not stay the same The ways around this as I see them Actually store the IDs in the export and use them when importing too Pro makes the whole process more predictable and safe Con Will bork things up when importing into a database when theres already content there On export do a special song and dance for select content where the linking field is ID and use that for the export data Pro retain the functionality of importing into an existing database Con hell of a lot more work and it feels a bit kludgy to me Just not support it and notify export users of this giving them the hint to maybe use another field for the link if they are going to use exportimport in the future Pro least work of all the options no changes to possibly already used workflows so no BC break for anyone Con not user friendly Personally Im leaning towards the first option but Id like some input on the matter or maybe some insight that I mightve missed Hi We use the maintenancemode true often to block a site from visibility from the public eg when its still under development Up until recently i didnt notice but if you have a maintenance site and you trigger a examplesiteorghfhfhf you see the template instead of the maintenance notice I would expect the maintenance mode to block any views to any pages whatsoever but probably since the routing is different you see the template instead Steps to reproduce Set site config to maintenancemode true Refresh homepage you get the maintenance notice Trigger a you get the template Expected result Triggering the would still show me the maintenance notice Thanks for listening See A brief description of the issue goes here On a clean install of Bolt it keeps complaining about the database tables being out of date Running the update DB command does nothing Running the suggested SQL directly on the DB does nothing either suggested structure is the same as the actual structure Details Looking at the proposed changes theyre all like this changedColumns array userid ColumnDiff oldColumnName userid column Column default null changedProperties array default fromColumn Column default NULL As you can see it wishes to changes the default from null to NULL Probably some change in how MariaDB reports datatypes Question Answer Relevant Bolt Version Install type Composer install BC Break no PHP version Web server Nginx version For UXUI issues Browser name and version Reproduction If youre filing a bug please describe how to reproduce it Include as much relevant information as possible such as Bug summary Install Bolt with a MariaDB database Specifics Bug can be seen when accessing the backend Steps to reproduce Install Bolt Expected result I expect the database schema to be correct and Bolt not to show any warnings Actual result Bolt shows a message to update the DB structure Hello I think adding FA support would significantly improve the security of websites hosted with Bolt I dont know for sure how complicated it is to integrate
