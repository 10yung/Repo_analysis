Greetings Binnavi or Zynamics developers and contributors We re reaching out because your project is an important part of the open source ecosystem and we d like to invite you to integrate with our fuzzing service OSSFuzz OSSFuzz is a free fuzzing infrastructure you can use to identify security vulnerabilities and stability bugs in your project like XXX and YYY OSSFuzz will Continuously run at scale all the fuzzers you write Alert you when it finds issues Automatically close issues after they ve been fixed by a commit Many widely used open source projects like OpenSSL FFmpeg LibreOffice and ImageMagick are fuzzing via OSSFuzz which helps them find and remediate critical issues Even though typical integrations can be done in LoC we have a reward program in place which aims to recognize folks who are not just contributing to open source but are also working hard to make it more secure We want to stress that anyone who meets the eligibility criteria and integrates a project with OSSFuzz is eligible for a reward To help you getting started we can attach our internal fuzzer for your project that you are welcome to use directly or to use it as a starting point If youre not interested in integrating with OSSFuzz it would be helpful for us to understand why lack of interest lack of time or something else so we can better support projects like yours in the future If we ve missed your question in our FAQ feel free to reply or reach out to us at ossfuzzoutreachgooglegroupscom Thanks Tommy OSSFuzz Team the gradle wrapper is really old I thought maybe it would be good to upgrade Looks like youre not using any errorchecking in your Java build This pull requests adds a static analysis tool Error Prone created by Google to find common errors in Java code For example running mvn compile on the following code java public boolean validateString s return s thisusername would identify this error ERROR srcmainjavaHelloWorldjava error StringEquality String comparison using reference equality instead of value equality ERROR see If you think you might want to try out this plugin you can just merge this pull request Please feel free to add any comments below explaining why you did or did not find this recommendation useful the bug message is that in binNavi The IDB file C Users Administrator Desktop npp Installerx i could not be imported Please check the stack trace for more information Possible causes Database connection problems Bug in the IDB exporter Problem impact The IDB file was imported partially A raw module in an incosistent state was created This raw module should be deleted and the bug message is thatin cmd Reason Could not start IDA Pro Importing project failed comgooglesecurityzynamicsbinnaviLogNaviLogger severe comgooglesecurityzynamicsbinnaviImportersCImporterFactoryimportIdbFileInternalCImporterFactoryjava comgooglesecurityzynamicsbinnaviImportersCImporterFactoryaccess CImporterFactoryjava comgooglesecurityzynamicsbinnaviImportersCImporterFactory callCImporterFactoryjava comgooglesecurityzynamicsbinnaviImportersCImporterFactory callCImporterFactoryjava javautilconcurrentFutureTaskrunUnknown Source javautilconcurrentThreadPoolExecutorrunWorkerUnknown Source javautilconcurrentThreadPoolExecutorWorkerrunUnknown Source javalangThreadrunUnknown Source When I use a pluginI found it use comgooglesecurityzynamicsbinnaviAPIdisassemblyGlobalVariable class and GlobalVariablesManager calssbut I cant find them in packagecould you tell me how to solve thisThanks The UI for adding comments to flowgraph edges is currently broken Clicking on Add a new comment only allows adding a single character at a time In the current trunk even if the export is successful the GUI throws an error message that the IDB was not imported correctly Upon importing an IDA db I get a violates foreign key constraint message Did I miss a step screenshot from This is with IDA thank you Ive found a code smell and a possibly bug in a recent snapshot Path srcmainjavacomgooglesecurityzynamicsbinnavidisassemblyCFunctionjava java Override public boolean inSameDatabasefinal SQLProvider provider return providerequalsprovider As Line always return true should it be thisproviderequalsprovider java Override public boolean inSameDatabasefinal SQLProvider provider return thisproviderequalsprovider Hi Weve checked your project with AppChecker static analyzer and found a couple of possible defects In srcmainjavacomgooglesecurityzynamicsbinnavidisassemblyCNaviViewEdgejavaL if getSource instanceof IAddressNode getSource instanceof IAddressNode getSource is checked twice maybe getTargen should be checked like its done in The same thiing is in All possible defects were found by Echelon team with AppChecker static analyzer
