It would be nice to have a few more folders especially in the Scripts folder to find things faster At the moment utility scripts are in the same folder as visualeffect scripts for example Not a bug but would be nice Really amazing project by the way I learned a lot Thank you for sharing it Plus minor fixes proposal Does anyone know when year that the solar system begins in the animation Route touchgestureinput events from desktopslatephone to the application Implement equivalent of the appbar menu for Reset and About Ensure the backbutton affordance is still available After zooming andor tiling my view of our solar system and then transitioningclicking to a planet view or galaxy view and then coming back to the solar system view the zoom and tilt has been reset Customizing any view and browsing away and then returing causes the view to reset We should add Spectator View to Galaxy Explorer Instead of having each contributor narrate it might be better to have a single default narrator preferably Cortana Since I dont have a HoloLens unit yet But thinking that UWP apps should work across Windows Would it be a lot of work to convert GalaxyExplorer to XB Has anyone given this a shot
