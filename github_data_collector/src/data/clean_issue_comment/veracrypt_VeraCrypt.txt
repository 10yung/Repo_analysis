Hello Since version Veracrypt can encrypt the keys and passwords in the RAM on Windows I think this nice feature is helpful on other platforms too Is it possible to implement this nice feature for Linux MacOS etc Thank you very much It seems that Windows update from yesterday broke the boot loader Is above mentioned problem related to following Veracrypt shows perfectly useful with encrypted devices or partitions formated winbtrfs however to unleash btrfs software raid potential its necessary to show mounted devices or partition as PNP device which Veracrypt unfortunately doesnt I thought this to be an issue within winbtrfs rather than Veracrypt however I find maharmstones explanation quite convincing Do you share his view This has already been posted but the sourceforge bugtracker doesnt seem to be getting much attention As the description implies handling of memory disks has changed on recent FreeBSD versions which hasnt been corrected in Veracrypt yet I havent tested if this actually works with FAT partitions as described by the original reporter Still i need this for work and would be willing to look into it I would appreciate some guidance though where to look for the thing that went wrong here If someone would have access to my pc unlocked would a memory dump of just the veracryptexe process be enough to recover the master keys or is a full memory dump needed Recently I switched my Bitlocker encryption to VeraCrypt VeraCrypt version Update Multiboot with ubuntu MATE which worked after I got GRUB to list the VeraCrypt bootloader Now I created a new WindowsRE recovery partition see attached screenshot with information partition info Afterwards I try to enable the WinRE recovery partition via reagentc setreimage path R Recovery WindowsRE which fails with an error and which is logged in C Windows Logs ReAgent ReAgentlog Info ReAgentcexe Info ReAgentcexe Executing command line reagentc setreimage path R Recovery WindowsRE Info ReAgentcexe

winreGetDiskSignature andor pEnumeratePartitions I found a helpful entry in another forum where a person is observing a similar problem well reagentc info is working for me idrassi Could this be related to some IOCTLXYZ stuff eg IOCTLSTORAGEQUERYPROPERTY that is missing in VeraCrypt The VeraCrypt Expander v supports only integer value as size In addition an entered value in KB MB GB or TB for the size is not automatically converted when the unit is changed Im on Linux with the latest VeraCrypt Ive used a TB USB HDD and tried to create a hidden volume First the outer volume got created and then VeraCrypt asks me for the size of the hidden volume I tells me that I can use GiB When I enter GiB Next is grayed out Next is greyed out for every value bigger than GiB What am I doing wrong or is this a bug firefoxBMuK KsxyJ LXrunoffline does not work on Veracrypt due to lack of support for IOCTLMOUNTDEVQUERYSTABLEGUID implemented very promising new quick format functionality thank you As discussed the process will still take time for the operating system to reserve the filespace which can still take multiple days for a large external drive which can now be at least TB mine is still ongoing after hours However one new negative to the new functionality is that there is no status displayed during this process At present during this process it appears the Volume Format screen shows Done but with the only button not disabled being an Abort button Is it possible to getdisplay any additional information about the status when VeraCrypt tells Windows to create a file with a given size eg GB VeraCrypt do this by calling a single function but Windows will need a lot of time depending on the filesystem users because Windows will have to reserve the physical space on the disk and deal with disk fragmentation This explains why this simple operation can take a lot of time
