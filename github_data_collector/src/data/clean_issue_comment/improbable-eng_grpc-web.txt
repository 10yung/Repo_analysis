switch to another markdown generator Keep PR title verbose enough and add prefix telling about what components it touches eg query or Changes on gogrpcweb Change the error returned by webSocketWrappedReaderRead when the frame is a single byte of value which indicates the client has finished sending from ioEOF to nil Rationale When a stream request is made using a websocket handleWebSocket wrappergo is called This function run serverServeHTTP to proxy the stream Aside of forwarding messages from the server to the client it reads messages coming from the websocket using the webSocketWrappedReaderRead method websocketwrappergo but this method was returning an ioEOF error when a endofmessage frame was received The fact is that the grpcServer reads on the websocket until an error is returned by the read So when the wrapper was reading the end of the first message received by the client the initial stream request it was returning EOF and the grpcServerHTTP reader routine was stopped Then nobody was reading on the websocket after the first message was sent from the client so when the closed event was sent from the frontend on a refresh or tab closed ie it could not detect it and close the entire stream Verification I tested with my project which open infinite streams and I runned the go test but more test could be done
