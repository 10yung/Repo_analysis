Im using but the type for ImagePickerResponsefileName in the current version has not changed export interface ImagePickerResponse other things fileName string At least in the old version Im using fileName is sometimes null which goes against filename string because it is neither absent undefined nor a string If I upgrade to the most recent version will this be fixed by fileName being undefined instead of null If so feel free to close this right away Or is this type still incorrect The snippet above is TypeScript but I believe that indexjsflow in the npm package is generated from that file I noticed there was another ticket on this that was closed a while back But is there anyway to disable the video compression that happens in iOS I noticed it runs so slow on longer videos and I need to be handling videos that are seconds or less Bug After upgrading reactnativeimagepicker from version to the launchCamera method returns the error Couldnt get file path for photo This happens only when the WRITEEXTERNALSTORAGE permission was not yet given by the user After the user gave permissions for WRITEEXTERNALSTORAGE and the Photo Library was opened I can open the camera without any problems Since version introduced splitting the permissions on Android I expect that the camera still needs WRITEEXTERNALSTORAGE permissions to open at least on the Android Simulator Ive tried using all suggestions given in other issues These suggestions mainly point at adding paths to appsrcmainresxmlfilePathsxml but all these things dont help Be aware that I tested this situation in the Android

return to Portrait mode First of all thanks for this great library It is very useful Feature Request Option to define the not only the path also the file name to be save on storage This issue should serve for you to present or pitch an idea to the maintainers but remember that it would be better if you were to submit a PR instead Why it is needed When it is need to store a profile picture we can use the user ID Therefore it will be easy to find the foto desired among the other photos Please tell us a bit more of why you want this feature to be added whats its origin Regards I ri Thanks for submitting a PR Please read these instructions carefully x Explain the motivation for making this change x Provide a test plan demonstrating that the code is solid x Match the code formatting of the rest of the codebase x Target the master branch NOT a stable branch Motivation required UIKit complains when ImagePickerController not being called from main thread To fix this Ive added this method recommended in the docs What existing problem does the pull request solve updated Test Plan required Not need no business logic changed all test pass Description I am using ReactNativeImagePicker to
