I think it would be useful for fbadrequest to be exported This will aid in debugging and offer some flexibility in using endpoints of the API that are not supported by the package eg adstudies Its one line of code adding an export statement before the function in fbinitR and using document to update the NAMESPACE With appropriate permissions I can push a new branch and then make a pull request Thanks Im using the fbadlistad function to get the active ads of a list of adsets ids but for some reason I get an error of duplicate rownames This only happens when getting the ads of different adsets at the same time testads fbadlistadid c statuses ACTIVE fields ccampaignid adsetid name creative Error in rownamesdataframetmp value value duplicate rownames are not allowed In addition Warning message nonunique values when setting rownames Any idea on how to solve it Thanks and sorry for the trouble Hi I have access to an ad account with a lot going on weve got hundreds of fb ads and thus hundreds of ad creatives After running fbadreadcreative Im getting only results I initialized our main ad account which definitely has a lot of ads associated with it Is there a kind of default where it only pulls the last months newest creatives or something I went through the Marketing API documentation but I didnt see any limits mentioned on the Read section of the creatives portion I might be unpacking it wrong Im fairly new at this entire thing and Im using unlist and matrix to turn the results into a data frame Thanks I am using the command reachestimate v esti fbadreachestimatetargetingspec targetingspec currency EUR optimizefor REACH esti users previously the call returned much more information Also return data looks different in this post There is a problem with campaignid in the function fbadcreatead In the version available on CRAN you had campaignid as an argument But in the latest GitHub version you dont I think it might be because its deprecated Anyhow not having campaignid as an argument is causing problems I get an error that says r Error in missingcampaignid missing can only be used for arguments I might try to do a fix and make a pull request Facebook developed a new ad format It creates leads from fb users can the package read those leads
