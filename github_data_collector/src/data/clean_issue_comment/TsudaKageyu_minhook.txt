 Needs pTarget in MHCreateHook point to function address where code execution appeared after jump or call or it can be some random address in codetext segment of process memory My guess is that it can not be cause Detour could mess up some registers which are in use But thanks to my very noobish knowledge of Assembly I can not say if your code handle this or not D Not a breaking problem but I noticed the MEMORYBLOCK struct is not even half cache byte aligned If you at minimal align it make the header size then you will guarantee each allocation block used by trampolines to be at minimal align as well Notice that Window compilelinker tools like MSVC align functions to at least align by default padding with xCC or x as you know You can see for your self in a debugger or using a dissembler like IDA Pro Maybe less of an performance gain on current generation CPUs but the last time I did profiling admittedly a long time ago the difference was just a handful of cycles for aligned vs over a hundred cycles for misaligned branch targets Also when it comes to math calculating a block slot address its a simple power of for aligned vs the instructions need to multiply or divide the odd sizes of or bytes for bit and bit mode respectively You can either just add adding compile switch padding bytes for bit mode to round to or to round up to bytes for bit mode or use a compiler specific construct that will automatically pad the structure length for you Note also in either case of fixing the alignment you dont even loose a slot IE slots regardless if sizeMEMORYBLOCK is or bytes for bit mode example I have tried with Aspnet web application hosted in IIS server After many attempt i couldnt succeed Is there any way to do that Fixes Im trying to build minhook fda f fed dc cd e e b c with my project under MSVC compiler unfortunately the compiler compain that movsb is undefined FAILED contentdll contentdlllib contentdllpdb ninja t msvc e environmentx thirdpartyllvmbuildReleaseAssertsbinlldlinkexe nologo IMPLIBcontentdlllib DLL OUTcontentdll PDBcontentdllpdb contentdllrsp lldlink error undefined symbol movsb referenced by F haltonwork redcore src thirdparty minhook src trampolinec objcontentcommoncommontrampolineobjCreateTrampolineFunction referenced by F haltonwork redcore src thirdparty minhook src trampolinec objcontentcommoncommontrampolineobjCreateTrampolineFunction ninja build stopped subcommand failed Hi I came across this library about couple days ago Its great and I thought it could be even better if there are supports for languages other than CC So I just wrote my extremely simple Go Golang version of minhook while trying to figure out how to utilize it in Go I think it might be a good example for how this library can be used in different languages If anyones interested please visit Any issues or suggestions are welcome xD the makefile in buildMinGW is a bit hard to use and needs to be ran with the bat so I made a simple one It also outputs a static library cuz I think that would be more helpful anyway its only kb after strip For example this thread Is there any way for the API to allow some kind of voidfuncPtr or something instead that would be kosher in standard C
