inspeqtor amd deb Im not an expert in mysql but I tried to run show status in mysql and found no field like Slaverunning I wonder how can I fix it or what can I do about it Thanks in advance P Hi I am finding this project quite interesting to build it on embedded devices ARMMIPS so on Unluckily I hit a wall as there are some dependencies that requires native compiling tools and they fail with short or no debug message I am trying to do this inside a docker container for reproducibility will paste it below FROM alpine as build ENV RELEASEVERSION ENV RELEASEURL RUN apk add qU go git make gcc libcdev curl unzip WORKDIR app RUN curl o inspeqtorzip L RELEASEURL unzip inspeqtorzip cd inspeqtorRELEASEVERSION make prepare make Can someone help me in producing a working Docker image Moreover I am hoping the project dependencies dont hinder it when trying to cross compile for exotic platforms did anyone try compiling for armmips It would be great if Inspeqtor supported CGroup based metrics for CPU and memory usage The current method for totalcpu and totalrss is flawed since a systemd service represents a CGroup but the total metrics only account for the main PID of the service and its children However there are cases where multiple parent processes exist in a single CGroup For example if you use NGINX and Passenger the nginx process forks the Passenger watchdog and the nginx master process and then exits which causes both processes to be adopted by init PID This causes Inspegtor to only count memory and cpu usage for the nginx master and the workers it spawns and completely ignores Passenger Inspeqtor could either use CGroup CPU and Memory accounting to get the metrics or just get the list of PIDs in the CGroup and use it with the existing methods Using CGroup accounting should be more efficient since it doesnt require recursively walking the pid tree like the current totalrss implementation for Linux Documentation for the different cgroup controllers mounted in sysfscgroups can be found here While Amazon SES can be used via SMTP it would be great to use the Amazon SES API via awssdk so that outbound SMTP isnt needed I just upgraded our staging environment to the latest Inspeqtor version and swap is always under inspeqtor when in fact its actually screen shot at I suspect this commit could have broke something I dont want to send any alerts as I am already doing that using datadog but when I remove the send alert config and restart inspeqtor it wont start the log says this Please configure a send alerts statement in inspeqtorconf is there any way to skip this When something breaks its often the case that several rules will break at the same time Each cycles email should summarize all the rules that are broken and not a single email per rule This summary allows the reader to see everything broken at a glance and possibly understand the root cause
