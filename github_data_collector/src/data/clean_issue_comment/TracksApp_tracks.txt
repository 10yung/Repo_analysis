One of the Rails upgrades changed the way we handle static files with the built in server Instead of using the value in configsiteyml Tracks now requires the following environment variable to be set RAILSSERVESTATICFILES At this point I think Id rather follow the Rails default so we need to update the documentation and remove the setting from configsiteymltmpl so that its no longer misleading for our users DB field todosdescription was type string which defaults to length in MySQL Model allows field to be up to characters which could cause a DB error if user saved a description of between and characters Fixes Bumps yard from to details summaryRelease notessummary pemSourced from a href releasesaemp blockquote h Release v h ul liAdd YARDCodeObjectsNamespaceMapperoninvalidate callback when

lockfile updates if desired Security updates receive only security updates if desired details Hi Discovered the following issue when analyzing the tracks app as part of a research project The field description in the object todos is limited to max length in the model but in DB So if a user creates a description greater than but less than it seems they may encounter a problem Model validation class Todo ApplicationRecord MAXDESCRIPTIONLENGTH validatespresenceof description validateslengthof description maximum MAXDESCRIPTIONLENGTH DB field which defaults to for string fields in mysql MariaDB tracks describe todos Field Type Null Key Default Extra id bigint NO PRI NULL autoincrement description varchar NO NULL I think the best solution may be to limit the length in the model to and shouldnt create any conflicts since the field cannot be greater than length in MySQL Assuming you agree this is an issue I can create a pull request if that is helpful Thanks
