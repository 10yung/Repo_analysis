Hi Ive been working on a similar project but here is a problem that I faced and it seems to be present in your code as well and When you overwrite the unencrypted data with crypted data you are not sure that the OS or the HDDSSD hardware writes it at the same place on the disk on the same blocks sectors of the disk Result the unencrypted data plain text can stay on your disk and be easily recovered with a simple Undelete tool HEX viewer A software like Recuva and wxHexEditor will be able to see your files without the master password What do you think Ive been thinking about this problem for a long time too Evernote and other note providers offer mobile apps for Android and iOS so you can readwrite your notes on your smartphone Itd be more convenient to most of ST users Org mode is for keeping notes maintaining TODO lists planning projects and authoring documents with a fast and effective plaintext system is code formatting and Display No really CintaNotes and the rest do not recognize Python JavaScript HTML etc Use to Store lots of Code snip its Took a while to sink in Duh Oh I get it
