I have two basically identicallysetup laptops here and for some reason ssh keeps failing after a few gigabytes of data I want to try shoop and installed it on both devices but when I try to transfer any file in either direction I am only asked to give the password for the ssh connection two times and then shoop immediately exits with code without creating the file locally How do I debug this debug only shows establishing SSH session right now it just crashes and causes an SSH error Really Id like to have an interface kind of similar to hashcat where you can hit q at any time during the transfer to quit r to forcereinitialize the session connection until we make the connection detection good enough to not need it Hi I tested shoop on my environment and see that it x times slower than scp My environment Client Core i with Gb RAM Debian with latest updates Rust from rustup be libsodium from debian repos shoop prealpha Server Digital Ocean Mb droplet Debian with latest updates Rust from rustup be libsodium from debian repos shoop prealpha Network and test file Broadband connection speed is around Mbits Ping and speed to the USA Test file is a GB sample downloaded from SCP strangemanstrangebooktmp time scp root root GBzip GBzip MB MBs real m s user m s sys m s SHOOP strangemanstrangebooktmp time shoop root root GBzip downloading GBzip MB M M avg MBs shooped it all up in m s real m s user m s sys m s Why Did shoop optimised only for slow and unstable connections Depending on how advanced we want to be this could be as easy as having the client request starting at the existing size of a file defeats the purpose of connection resumption silly mcginty opening UDT connection E errrrrrrr connecting to UdtError errcode errmsg Connection setup failure connection time out which makes sense as the client is not inside the LAN But it should make the UDT connection to the same ip as the original ssh did Hey Jake Just wanted to let you know that I got shoop up and running on my server Great stuff The one bit of feedback that I have is regarding the ports that shoop uses It was kind of annoying having to manually open those ports so it would be nice to have UPnP support or something Any solution that involves not having to manually open ports would be nice Feel free to close this issue if you dont think its worthwhile Snappy or LZ comes to mind
