Im having trouble running differentialGeneTest on my data This is the line I used difftestres differentialGeneTestmonoclecds expressedgenes fullModelFormulaStr Media I got the following error Error in dataframepd i undefined columns selected Going through other issues people have posted I tried reducing dimensions by DDRTree using monoclecds reduceDimensionmonoclecds maxcomponents method DDRTree and that still gave me the same error Hi I am quite new to Bioinfomatics but I was wondering if its normal that the genes identified with PCA using Seurat are different from the genes shown by the heatmap generated using the BEAM function Shouldnt they be the same to some extent Best Sara When monocle was used to calculate the pseudotime of cells cds learngraphcdswas run but after calculating a few rounds the error message was displayed as R caught segfault address x b ae f c cause memory not mapped Traceback CallReuclideandist c If I run a small number of cells I will not have this error but every time I run a large number of cells an error will be reported Is this a software bug or is my operation error How can I handle this error Hi I am using the BEAM function monocle to test for branch dependent changes in in gene expression with the default settings The function completes and the structure of the output makes sense but I get the warning BEAMres BEAMwtfilteredcds the condition has length and only the first element will be usedthe condition has length and only the first element will be used where wtfilteredcds is a valid CellDataSet object that successfully produces results for other analyses It looks there are two warnings stacked together I am unsure what might be causing these warnings but it could easily change results if the function is considering different input than I expect for example The learned cell trajectory plot has branch point I get the BEAM warning no matter what the cell trajectory plot looks like Any ideas would be appreciated Cheers Hi Perhaps a very silly question but I am very new to the field of scRNAseq analysis and R in general I am currently getting familiar with Monocle after having worked with Seurat mainly to be able to link my index sort files with my scRNAseq data Now I am also doing the rest of the analysis in Monocle as well and have done clustering and differential gene expression analysis by using the vignette online However I cannot seem to find anywhere how to export files with the DEGs per cluster I have clusters and am very curious to the lists of genes that are differentially higher expressed in those clusters compared to the other ones In Seurat this was very straightforward to do perhaps in Monocle as well but I have not managed to find out how Hope someone can help me out with this supposedly easy problem Kind regards Florencia Want to use monocle to show the trajectory But in the plotpcvarianceexplained it showed the warning and I can not make sure how many pc are explained So I set the parameter numdim in the run of reduceDimension and I confront the error as the following But when numdim was setted it can run Anyway I want to know whether there is a error in the upstream analysis Or never mind plotpcvarianceexplainedmonoclemalignant returnall F Warning message Removed rows containing missing values geompoint monoclemalignant reduceDimensionmonoclemalignant

Monocle generates pseudotime based on UMAP Can we use the UMAP of Seurat Thanks Hi I have some very na ve questions that despite the intensive search on web material you provided including your great tutorials from to version I was unable to answer by myself Surely it is my fault but I also saw other notyetcommented posts which directly or indirectly linked to my doubts then probably mine are queries of more general interest In e Monocle tutorial versions you clearly say to users Dont normalise data yourself since Monocle will do all needed normalisation steps internally Im actually using Monocle About this internal normalisation i which normalisation are you using and at which step you applied it to the data considering ie the workflow suggested in the constructingsinglecelltrajectories ii is it possible to retrieved these normalise data and how I will really appreciate a comment from you Thank you very much in advance for your attention Lu monocle Hi I m using data from BDs Rhapsody platform for WTA BD s data view platform produces both UMIs and normalized data I was wondering if you ve used these data in monocle before or have any advice about using prenormalized data Thanks Colin Hi Im trying for the first time to run Monocle on a human dataset of cells and genes prefiltered using Seurat I accurately followed the instructions here but when I try to cluster cells the following error occurs mycds clusterCellscds numclusters Distance cutoff calculated to caught segfault address xfffffffe b cause memory not mapped Traceback

to run monocle on a toy subset of cells around and it works perfectly I suppose my dataset is too big I also tried to run it on a cluster using cores but without success Can anyone help me please
