specintegration contains a lot of files that were used for integration tests They stopped were disabled in and havent been working since Removing because those tests dont run dont work and are outdated The plan is to reintroduce integration tests sometime in the future Hi The scope of this pull request is to allow annotatemodels to generate models documentation using YARD This is the first step ill add more features later Sometime gems have their own models in their own namespace and these are not present in the appmodels directory of your app In these situations it would be very handy to have the annotate gem create a document someplace which annotates all those models Hi love this gem been using it for years Recently I started using the solargraph ruby language server in my editor which uses YARD documentation to provide intellisense like features for ruby projects Is there any interest in adding support for this to annotatemodels If not do you have any recommendations on the best approach to build an extension to this gem to assist with generating that documentation Cheers I refactored and structuralized RSpec test cases of AnnotateModels for readability and scalability
