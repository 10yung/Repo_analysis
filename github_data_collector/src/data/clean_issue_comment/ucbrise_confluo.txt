 Context Last green jenkins on master build was It seems that later builds are failing because of pytest x is used and it dropped support for python see What changes were proposed in this pull request remove pytestcov as this is maybe not essential for the build How was this patch tested We will test this using jenkins build pipeline Describe the bug Loading multilog after multiple restarts fails How to reproduce the bug The test case is start confluo using data path eg datapathvardb create multilog and write to it java RpcClient client new RpcClientHOST PORT clientcreateAtomicMultilogMULTILOGNAME msg STRING StorageModeDURABLE clientappendabcdefgh clientdisconnect stop the confluo server start confluo server using same data path as in step check count of items outputs java RpcClient client new RpcClientHOST PORT clientloadAtomicMultilogMULTILOGNAME SystemoutprintlnclientnumRecords clientdisconnect stop the confluo server start confluo server using same data path as in step retry step it fails with Floating point exception Expected behavior Step should not fail and should output Detailed logs Error log Floating point exception Dear professor I have pasted the code I write for testing performace such as ops and throughput I test the ops about packet per second The packet size is about bytes I want to seek your help for testing the performance Thanks GC data log buckets after archiving them for durable and durable relaxed modes so that were not using x the disk space What changes were proposed in this pull request provide a producer and consumer implement for confluo as a pubsub system in java also include a simple produceconsume benchmark test How was this patch tested TestPubSub class provide unit tests related issue An extra null pointer check is not needed in functions Do I need to check for null before delete p like the following bytestring Destructor for bytestring deltaencodedarray Destructor for deltaencodedarray stringmap Destructor for stringmap Initial sketchrelated API additions to atomicmultilog C void addsketchsketchname str fieldname str filtername Optional str void removesketchsketchname str sizet estimatefrequencysketchname str value str mapval freq getheavyhitterssketchname str double evaluatemetricsketchname str metric enum How was this patch tested WIP We are interesting at the performance of Confluo especially the comparison with Kafka Can confluo provide detailed test example to help user better understanding of that so we can make better use of confluo Or is there any suggestion for the comparison testing with Kafka doese confluo support HA Thanks a lot Hi there I see theres been some activity in a branch called chainreplication but itd be nice to know what you folks have in mind for scaleout architecture The User Guide at could use a full Python version At this time its completely unclear how to use Confluo from Python
