breaking changes INSTRUCTION Inform the issue number that this PR closes or remove the line below Closes The requests were being sent to the server instantaneously as the checkbox was clicked for making the reset button I stored all the requests in an array and made calls to the server only if the save button was clicked and reloaded the page if the reset was clicked I know many improvements can be done to this it would be good if anyone can guide me on how to reload a page using reactiveVar and not locationreload I have read the documentation but want able to implement it Another improvement would be to only send the requests to the server if that particular checkbox is clicked an odd number of times as even number of clicks would make the checkbox the same as it was at the start I tried to implement it using the array wherein after every click I was checking if the element was already present and increased the count Then when save was clicked I only sent those requests to the server whose count was odd But in implementing this I was unable to increase the count as whenever I checked for an elements presence in the array it reported false and thus count could not be updated Please help me and suggest changes to the pr INSTRUCTION Link to a PR with addedupdated documentation or an update to the missingoutdated documentation list see INSTRUCTION Tell us more about
