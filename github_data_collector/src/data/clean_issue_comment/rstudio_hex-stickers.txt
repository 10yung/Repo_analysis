When I added the googlesheets logo I realized that for example googledrive doesnt have this meta json file Do we care about those In any case I took a look more broadly at the overlap between the PNG SVG and meta directories in case we want to encourage rationalization Reveals that theres an errant SVGtidypredictssvg file note the s in tidypredictS Thanks for sharing these Would you be opposed to me creating a hexbin PR for the newer stickers that arent there yet
