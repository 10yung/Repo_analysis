Is there a way to prevent a Pagination from publishing all fields in a collection Apart from the hit to the database it is not good to publish all users sensitive information such as emails when displaying a paginated list of users Im using pages to create a form where I can select one of multiple rows the data context of a raw itemTemplate at the moment is just the data from a single record from the collection Im paginating This is ok in general but sometimes I need to access the data context of the parent template templateName I could climb the blaze hierarchy but this is super cumbersome and at the moment Im using a session variable to get this information I feel this is super hacky Is there a way to pass the parent data context to each item so to have an easy access to it Im not sure why this is the case but Im not able to use this package with the latest coffeescript release simply bumping the dependency to coffeescript to solves the problem But Im not sure this is the right way to go as it will make incompatible to older version of coffeescript without a real reason meteor update allpackages This project is already at Meteor the latest release Errors while upgrading packages While selecting package versions error Conflict Constraint coffeescript is not satisfied by coffeescript Constraints on package coffeescript coffeescript alethespages Since upgrading Meteor from to my client filters are not working reliably When I change the filters often the displayed list of items does not change If I run the following in the browser console then it updates correctly MyPaginationObjectreload However if I run reload in the code it only works if I leave about second delay MyPaginationObjectset filters Meteormyfunctionssetfilternumberofthingslt gt

work around a known issue with more than about paginations TemplatemypageonRenderedfunction MyPaginationObjectrequestPage I dont know if this is a related issue or not Has anybody had a similar
