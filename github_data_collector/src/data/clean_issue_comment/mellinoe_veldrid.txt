Hi mellinoe Ive added in a RenderTest as you suggested which can reproduce the bug on the D D backend Ive also given you access to modify the branch so feel free to change whatever you feel like no need to check with me first I loaded the details into the issue here Hi mellinoe this is the bug that I was talking about on Gitter the other day where using a render target as a texture view binding doesnt always work on D D backend Tldr of the bug as far as I can see is First render pass writes to render target and has render target as a texture view binding A second render pass runs writing to render target with a different shader which has no texture bindings this implicitly unbinds render target from the first shader A third render pass runs writing back to render target with render target as a texture view binding again this time the texture view binding doesnt get bound back to the shader properly Ive done a little digging and it looks like when render target gets unbound it isnt removed from the list of bound texture views in D D CommandList therefore in the third pass it thinks it is already bound and doesnt actually bind it properly I could be way off here though Let me know if you have any questions PR for the repro test is here As the title says this will update ImageSharp to the latest released version and makes some minor adjustments to the changes in this version This will fix issue Issue Creating texture arrays with layer is impossible as implemented here I need the latest Imagesharp because of a bugfix When I upgrade it to beta the following code throws an exception var texPath PathCombineAppContextBaseDirectory Assets imageName var imTex new ImageSharpTexturetexPath false The exception is SystemMissingMethodException Method not found SixLaborsImageSharpImage SixLaborsImageSharpPixelFormatsRgba SixLaborsImageSharpImageLoadSystemString at VeldridImageSharpImageSharpTexturectorString path Boolean mipmap at EngineImageManagerLoadString imageName The issue is not present with ImageSharp beta I am using Veldrid NET Core Any plans for OpenXR support As far as I know Oculus already has preliminary support Hi I wanted to check in on the hi dpi support branch It looks like it hasnt been merged in yet what are the plans for this Thanks All in title Looks like imgui itself supports those platforms but veldrid does not Is that planned to be addressed and fixed I dont think theres anything in Veldrids D D backend that prevents it from supporting older GPUs Just tested my project on a laptop with an NVIDIA M GT which is a D D era GPU and this is all I had to change in Veldrid in order for it to work Note that I had to remove the HResult check Thats because on my old laptop Im getting a different error code when the debug runtime is missing x which can mean pretty much anything Theres also one thing Im wondering about What is the point of trying to create a D D device twice in a row with the exact same arguments Could it be that the second call was supposed to have different arguments and this is just a bug I write a project on my Windows machine There everything works well with GraphicsBackendDirect D Now I try to get this project to run on LinuxUbuntu and get this error Unhandled Exception SystemNullReferenceException Object reference not set to an instance of an object at VeldridVkVkCommandListGetStagingBufferUInt size in C projects veldrid src Veldrid Vk VkCommandListcsline at VeldridVkVkCommandListUpdateBufferCoreDeviceBuffer buffer UInt bufferOffsetInBytes IntPtr source UInt sizeInBytes in C projects veldrid src Veldrid Vk VkCommandListcsline at VeldridCommandListUpdateBuffer T DeviceBuffer buffer UInt bufferOffsetInBytes T source in C projects veldrid src Veldrid CommandListcsline I first tried GraphicsBackendOpenGL and then I installed GraphicsBackendVulkan Every time the same error GraphicsDevice and Window seem to work and a black window opens up to this error when i try to update the first Buffer clUpdateBuffervb svertices vb and svertices are not null Is it maybe a permission thing Would be really great if someone could help me thanks
