Apologies if posting here is inappropriate This has also been posted at Ive developed a web application for interactive visual editing of graphs described in the DOT language that Im looking for beta tester for A few feature highlights Insert node shapes by click or draganddrop Draw edges between nodes Select nodes and edges by click or by area drag and mark them in the text editor Delete selected nodes and edges CutCopyandpaste a selected node Try it live at See the README for more features Any feedback in the form of bug reports or enhancement requests is welcome as issues For questions discussion and other feedback please contact me at the d graphviz Slack channel graphvizviseditor Has anyone used Graphviz to produce railroad diagrams from BNF I do turn the BNF into a tree using Graphviz via Perl but thats not quite what I want On the web I found things like and this discussion The latter refers to JS code and Wikipedia refers to these sorts of packages too of course Executing the dotexe testnotokdot command results in the following error message Error syntax error in line However executing the dotexe testokdot command results in no error The difference between the testokdot and the testnotokdot files is the additional white space in line screenshot I am using Graphviz version on Windows graphviz version is installed as a macos high sierra brew bottle

subgraph structures to do these computations and manipulations This often has the following form Create a subgraph that contains the entire graph Remove some nodes Perform some domain specific graph search algorithms Remove the temporary subgraph again This is done very often The results are aggregated into a new graph which is then being layedout by dot According to some profiling the major performance bottleneck is caused by step The next most critical bottleneck is step I currently use the following code to create such a subgraph Are there faster ways to do it Agrapht

following warning when I try to drawconnect objects Warning Unable to reclaim box space in spline routing for edge managetesttransafep jax testtransafep jax Something is probably seriously wrong Line is the problem line currently commented out Ive attached the dot code Is this a bug or am I just missing something really simple Rob It is stated in the CGraph manual that the library is not threadsafe To what extent is this true Suppose a graph structure has been created If then multiple threads are accessing this graph but without making any modifications to the graph would this give any problems The following graph gives a segfault when doing a dot layout tested with windows dot digraph Graph b d f c dad f d c graph nodesep node shapepoint subgraph ranktarget graph ranksame A B X

Something is probably seriously wrong According to the minimum value is only Id like to contribute an output format that produces ASCII diagrams However Im not really sure where to begin with the Graphviz codebase or what to use as an example or starting point Would someone be able to point me in the right direction
