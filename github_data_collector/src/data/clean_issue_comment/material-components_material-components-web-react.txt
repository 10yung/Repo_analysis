Hi All Is it possible to get fullscreen dialog is there any prop should we need to set I tried to use maxheight width it did not work Please let me know how we can get Fullscreen dialog for mobile It would be great if we could have some react componentcomponents to support the mdcdatatable I have myself resorting to using lists in places where I actually need tables When setting tabIndex on a Switch in the final rendered DOM the tabindex attribute ends up being placed on the outermost divmdcswitch instead of the inner input element it needs to be on to have any effect This makes it kind of impossible without getting hacky to set the tab order for a Switch Bumps eslint from to details summaryRelease notessummary Sourced from eslints releases v b fd Fix table because needs ajv Mathieu
