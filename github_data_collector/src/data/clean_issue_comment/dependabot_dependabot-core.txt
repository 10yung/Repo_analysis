 Probably linked to In my project Dependabot is not updating some dependencies for an unknown reason Here are the deps without updates by dependabot in my root folder list provided by npmcheckupdates

recently with using GitHub Package Registry for my Java maven gradle dependencies I couldnt make Dependabot see those releases though Do you have any hints how should I set it up It looks like GitHub Package Registry ignores mavenmetadataxml even though deployment says it has been uploaded successfully I would be grateful for some sort of stepbystep guide example on how to use Dependabot Java Gradle with packages stored on GitHub Package Registry Thanks Even in these modern ages I do have this gem in a git repository that does not support HTTPS yet Currently the uriwithauth always adds which makes the service pack URI invalid This change makes sure it uses http if and only if the original scheme is HTTP One of our Python repositories has both a setupcfg and Pipfilelock The Dependabot UI shows that it is monitoring both files However on closer inspection I find that the dependencies are out of sync Dependabot continually updates the Pipfilelock making us think we were uptodate but never touches setupcfg From setupcfg options installrequires setuptools click PyInstaller pyppyn From Pipfilelock json pyinstaller hashes sha fa d f bb d eb cbb ddb cf f a c c b index pypi version pyppyn hashes sha f faaea a d c fe b c b bcc fe fe b b sha d a e c f f f cd ee a e b a de f fa a c ea b index pypi version Would be nice being able to configure a specific file to be inspected by dependabot In my repository theres a setuppy and a requirementsdev folder with additional dev dependencies only used locally Even though my configuration looks like version updateconfigs packagemanager python directory updateschedule daily the bot is also inspecting files in requirementsdev which I would expect to be inspected if my configuration looked rather like version updateconfigs packagemanager python directory requirementsdev updateschedule daily At the same time as Im using piptools Id like dependabot to inspect only the ini file as the txt is automatically

the properties via string substitution instead of editing the dom with nokogiri we can fail to update valid POMs that dont dont match what we expect for example POMs where properties have attributes This will result in no substitution being performed which then triggers an assertion uriMacBookPro gddependabotcore bindryrunrb maven canvacanva dir parent fetching dependency files dumping fetched

changed RuntimeError This PR adds support for properties with attributes though it still uses string substitution so it will still fail if the properties are not formatted as expected for example if theyre broken over multiple lines To stay backwards compatible as much as possible it will still attempt to substitute using the regular expression first and still fall back to not performing any substitution if neither the regular expression or the node matches Bumps phpstanphpstan from to details summaryRelease notessummary pemSourced from a href releasesaemp blockquote h h h Improvements h
