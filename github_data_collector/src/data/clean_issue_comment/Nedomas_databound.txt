I tried to use databound to implement simple CRUD After adding validation to model I expected to have basic way to obtain information about error while creating new record I found nothing about it in docs and do not know how to do it Unfortunately the fail promise callback is never used result always goes to done How is one supposed to handle validation errors Any plan to make databound offline capable with Service Worker and indexedDB Maybe it is a better idea to create another repo for offline capability Do you plan to support associations among models
