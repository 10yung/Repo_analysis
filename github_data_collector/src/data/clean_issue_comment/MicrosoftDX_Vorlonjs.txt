Security Alerts page details I tested with the documentation of this repository but it doesnt work for me Please How can I write a log file in hard disk Thanks I am trying to debug and troubleshoot an outlook addin on android outlook app using vorlon Shouldnt it show android on dashboard or it only shows the device if its using a browser I used ip address instead of localhost and I configured vorlon to use HTTPS instead of HTTP But when I try to test the addin on android it doesnt show on the dashboard what am I missing I read that it runs the same way in a browser as it does in an Android App or in this case inside an Office Addin meulta please can you help thanks in advance When i try to debug using hosted verlonjs i am getting the following error websocketerror probeerrorErrorwebsocketerror Vorlon URL Please see the attached screenshot screenshot at pm I had used the following js code to add the debugger to the site instead of including the script javascript var script documentcreateElementscript scripttype textjavascript scriptsrc documentheadappendChildscript This pull request attempts to make the console plugin behave like a regular browser console We call an alias of eval which does the same thing but evaluates in the global scope see last example Otherwise I think if you try to define a variable its just defined in the local scope of evalOrderFromDashboard We call consolelog on the command were about to execute This is just to leave a log of it in the console log Again to make it look like a normal console I removed the isLoggable logic and decided that all responses should be logged Removed unable to execute order just show the error in the console Dont pass boolean or undefined types to inspect just pass back as string Think this should fix Replace codeplexs repository url with the one migrated to github
