I am using Swift Location Library and setting the interval as minutes and Continuous However I am not getting the location as per the specified interval Instead it is inconsisent and gives multiple locations within the time interval Any help would be appreciated A sample implementation code would be of great help Thanks Badari I want to send location to my server every hs during hs but have many questions Can I combine significant subscription with dataFrequency If I call locateFromGPSoneshot after calling with significant because want to force sending current location when receive a notification will it override significant listener What if I call locateFromGPSsignificant twice when app is open in foreground Thanks Hi Team I am looking for helpguidance in using the SwiftLocation library I implemented background location tracking The problem is the location is not updated as per the given minimum interval The locations that I am getting are inconsistent eg If my minimum interval is seconds then the location event happens randomly within minutes I am getting locations with every seconds of time intervals I tried it for different intervals and accuracy but I still see inconsistent behavior Has anybody experienced similar behavior Please let me know My code snippet let request LocationManagersharedlocateFromGPScontinous accuracy house data in switch data case failurelet error printLocation error error case successlet location printNew Location location requestdataFrequency fixedminInterval minDistance I am using pod SwiftLocation If i call locateFromGPS with accuracy customkCLLocationAccuracyBest aka every location event is skipped because locationSatisfyRequest function checking following condition guard locationhorizontalAccuracy accuracyvalue else return false accuracy is not enough meanwhile i getting location with m accuracy Hi guys Thanks for making and still maintenance this awesome library Save tons of time I am having an issue that can not figure out why I am trying to request oneShot current location It works most of the time But after putting the app in background or turning off device screen when app is in foreground for a while it can not get the location anymore I try to set the timeout for seconds and after seconds it return errors Have anyone been into the same issue static func currentLocation ObservableCLLocation return Observablecreate observer in let req LocationManagersharedlocateFromGPSoneShot accuracy block timeout delayed result in switch result case successlet location printLOCATION location observeronNextlocation case failurelet error printFAILED error errorlocalizedDescription var message Something went wrong when getting your location Please try again switch error case genericlet genericMessage message n genericMessage default break let newError NSErrordomain LocationManager code userInfo NSLocalizedDescriptionKey message observeronErrornewError reqstart return Disposablescreate reqstop By the way I am using RxSwift Thanks for your time IMG Updated This is the error message Hey guys Im getting a No such module SwiftLocation after importing the library using cocoa pods which finishes successfully Xcode version Version platform ios SwiftLocation Thanks Support region monitoring in background and foreground Apple Watch Series has its own gps module Would you add watch os support We are going to use Apple Watch in independent mode Since of this is usable on both iOS and macOS could you create a macOS target
