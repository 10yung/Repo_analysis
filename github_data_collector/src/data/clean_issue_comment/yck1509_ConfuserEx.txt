How to set the file name of the encrypted software to be different from that of the original software If my software is D exe How to set up the crproj file can let the new encrypted software in the original software not subfolders but the name of the new encrypted software changed to D exe If my crproj file add protection idrename then canot runing if del protection idrename then all ok what is then protection idrename meaning why make bug THX Hi Im try to protect my console app file EXE in NET CORE and Im giving this error INFO ConfuserEx v custom Copyright C Ki INFO Running on Microsoft

necessary to provide a patch for obfuscated software Having different obfuscation applied to patched version comparing with the released one effectively means the patched version cannot be deployed without replacing every obfuscated assembly This change makes it possible to provide a symbol map from a previous obfuscation and preserves the renames specified there When I press the Protect button I get a virus warning Trojan Win FuerboosACl And Trojan Win FuerboosCCl from Windows Defender And the program can not continue Im using this on a project in which Ive used MahAppsMetro for styling Some elements dissapear even when using the minimum encryption Like the DataGrid headers are not visible This is without using confuser without And this is with minimum level of encryption with The problem happens irrespective of whether Im using packer or not How to resolve this Hello Weve been using ConfuserEx to obfuscate our WPF applications before we deploy externally for a while now Recently weve encountered the need to build an application in the bit platform to accommodate for higher memory usage Weve automated obfuscating as part of the build process using the settings defined below for our application I decided to try to start disabling other protections one by one to see if I could get it to ever run and got lucky on the first try by disabling the anti dump protection Do you have any idea why this protection would cause the application to crash I even tried putting a trycatch around the main entry point but even that doesnt get hit to provide me an idea of what the underlying issue is rule patterntrue presetmaximum inherittrue protection idanti debug actionremove protection idref proxy actionremove protection idresources actionremove protection idrename
