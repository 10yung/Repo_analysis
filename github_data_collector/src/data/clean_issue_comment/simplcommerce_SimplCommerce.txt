How can i fix this to modify the view I have to recompile the whole solution again Work with vs on mac and its a bit chaotic im using this but no work thanks Enter as administrator user select an order press dowload invoice button an ERROR HTTP appears I am trying to add some changes for a Delivery Service and When I add the classesDomain Models and Inherit either EntityBase or EntityBaseWithTypedIdlong for the ones with F Keys Entity framework is throwing a multitude of errors I make the changes build then I run AddMigrations in the Package Manager console If the migration is successfulabout in times I get prompted to Update the database as I should But the I get the error that the objects are already in the database If the Migration is unsuccessful then I get the error that the migration failed because it was unable to ready the parameter of typekey in verbose logging that error directs me to a country Id that is a string in the configuration but EF thinks that it is not a string I am very stuck I need to keep working on what I am doing but this not being able to migrate is holding me up when you try to add products to a warehouse a red window appears but no error message is shown so you do not know the reason why product can not be added It has a less restrictive license and you can use it completely for free unlike SQL Server It suits more to opensource projects and it has a great JSON support too better than mariadbmysql The community is also much more active I can open a PR if you agree every time when i create a new module and have some entitys according dotnet ef commond dotnet ef migrations add XXXX for new modules at last when the framework statrup it will check new migrations and then update database Hi According to Getting started docs PM UpdateDatabase Build started Build succeeded The specified depsjson C Users SimplCommerce src SimplCommerceWebHost SimplCommerceWebHostdepsjson does not exist Where can I get this file Currently in the checkoutshipping view you have to fill the form in order to select the shipping method It doesnt always work like that Different shipping providers require different types of addresses or no addresses at all and just a specific code unique to that provider The shipping provider should be able to specify if the address is required or not and be able to save a custom address format somewhere like location id specific to that provider So maybe adding a property like IsShippingAddressRequired to ShippingProvider would suffice and validating only if the shipping address is required for the chosen method Then custom fields could be specified with some kind of JSON schema stored in another column like FormSchema see Theres already AdditionalSettings in ShippingProvider which is good Example of such shipping provider is where you just select a locker location instead of an address More providers with parcel lockers eg UPS access points too Ideas UPS offers many ways to access the API JSON XML SOAP the easiest way would be to use included WSDL schemas and that should generate the client using Connected Service Im not sure if such generation tools exist for JSON so using JSON could be more work but could be more performant due to more lightweight data format More info Its a very popular shipping carrier Im currently looking at ways to implement this Any guidance would be helpful
