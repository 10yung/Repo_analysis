git version Git coreautocrlf no Your shell is ready to swim I was installed vimod and fzf plugins with omf but dont work at all I was getting an error while trying to update omf so I tried a reinstall and got the following Updating master There is no tracking information for the current branch Please specify which branch you want to merge with See gitpull for details git pull remote branch If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with git branch setupstreamtoremotebranch master Error It looks like the installer is using git pull instead of git clone to me but I havent been able to find where the repository is stored in localshareomf so I cant resolve it I havent been able to reproduce the error on any other computer omf installs normally on my laptop and raspberry pi Environment report Oh My Fish version OS type Linux Fish version fish version Git version git version Git coreautocrlf no Your shell is ready to swim Im using tmuxinator to open tmux sessions with a specific layout of panes Each pane runs a different command eg one could be vim another starts a server up etc The issue is that tmuxinator is trying to run a command which relies on a fish plugin nvm but i get an intermittent error that fnm is not defined because the plugins havent loaded and im not sure how to prevent whatever race condition is causing this Environment report I havent provided an Environment report as the command is being run before omf has finished loading Happy to provide debug information but just not sure where to start I installed the lambda theme but
