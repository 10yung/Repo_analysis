I was looking through some project regex and found this one here It seems to use the Z notation for an anchor but this is not a supported feature in the JS regex dialect This regex will match Z which I does not seem intended Hello keybase d encrypt Adjorr twitter m Testing this out on you my friend gpg encrypted I hope I get the following error when I post or track to usernametwitter debug Full reply statuscode descinvalid namefieldsusernameinvalid namenameINPUTERROR debug request to merklepath KeybaseError invalid name error error invalid name error Config is filled out user email jimweasynet name weasy salt blah id blah I was able to push my key and able to prove my twitter account Suggestions Jim Culbreath Almost every subcommand fails with this error libnodemoduleskeybaselibmerkleclientjs pathcheck TypeError pathcheck is not a function I think it happens whenever keybase calls gpg The rest of the log is here Im using keybase with GnuPG on NixOS nkb push secret make Nothing to be done for default info Public key already uploaded pushing only secret key bufferjs throw new TypeErrormust start with number buffer array or string TypeError must start with number buffer array or string at new Buffer bufferjs at KeyManagerexportsKeyManagerKeyManagergettsenc homejackonodeclientlibkeymanagerjs at homejackonodeclientlibkeymanagerjs at homejackonodeclientlibkeymanagerjs at DeferralsexportsDeferralsDeferralscall homejackonodeclientnodemodulesicedruntimelibruntimejs at homejackonodeclientnodemodulesicedruntimelibruntimejs at exportstrampolinetrampoline homejackonodeclientnodemodulesicedruntimelibruntimejs at DeferralsexportsDeferralsDeferralsfulfill homejackonodeclientnodemodulesicedruntimelibruntimejs at ret homejackonodeclientnodemodulesicedruntimelibruntimejs at homejackonodeclientnodemodulesicederrorindexjs SimonSIMONPC C Users Simon gpg gpg Go ahead and type your message C SimonSIMONPC C Users Simon gpg gpg Go ahead and type your message C SimonSIMONPC C Users Simon keybase update error Could not find GPG command tried gpg and gpg If I pass a nondetached nonclearsign signature to keybase verify it checks the signature for me but does not tell me the content It appears that Keybase inherits GPGs tradition of calling this operation decrypt even though the content is not actually encrypted The keybase decrypt command does what I want Unfortunately though this command refuses to operate if my private key is not present even though my private key should not be needed to verify a signature Its also unintuitive to use decrypt for this every time I tell someone to use it for signature verification they get confused and ask me if I meant verify Therefore it seems best for keybase verify to print the content or provide a switch to print it Requires keybaseproofs db a ec c c f c f ef e d or later Decrypted output should include additional newlines to make it more user friendly An unsigned message decrypted outputs this This is a testdanielshadowbox A signed message outputs like this This is a testinfo Valid signature from you info Signed minutes ago Mon Aug GMT CDT see keybasekeybaseissues As per keybaseclient and same as keybaseclient
