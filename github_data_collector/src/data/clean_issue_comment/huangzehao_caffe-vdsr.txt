 Hi Zehao I dont quite understand the usage instructions Place the Train folder into CaffeDirexamples and rename Train to VDSR What is CaffeDir Is it caffe or caffe I am a bit confused about your directory structures in the usage section To train VDSR run buildtoolscaffe train solver examplesVDSRVDSRsolverprototxt What is buildtoolscaffe Is caffe an executable Where is this directory I thought by based on caffe you mean python code written in caffe but I didnt find any python code file Thanks for your clarification Hi Huangthanks your sharing But I have some question The relation of Training image data and the image I want to rebuildI mean if i want to rebuild some low resolution images of human face Do you think my Training data should be all the human face images Or I should make my Training data the more types the better The Size of the cutting image in the file generatetrain I mean you choose the size to cut the training data cause most paper choose the or images And the training data all about size If my training data all about should I make my cutting size larger If I do it larger cutting size would learn more or less features About the Multiscale In the paper of VDSR the writer said theScale augmentation during training is a key technique to equip a network with superresolution machines of multiple scales I could not understand that because in FSRCNN they also used the aug I think VDSR make the multi scale because of the files generatetrain and generatetest These two files have a for scale So I want to ask that which is the most important reason to achieve the multi scale rebuild The most important reason that The VDSR is better the the SRCNN I did a lot of trying But I still dont know the key skill of VDSR What do you think the most important change of VDSR to make a better PSNR to the SRCNN Maybe the reason is sum in the end of the net make it only learn the difference between low and high resolution images Or the deeper net layers I tried layers but a little little better rebuild effect So many questions to ask you A little ashame Could I ask you a question I trained a network and then used this network to process the image sequence and the Caffe framework is adopted When I started one task GPU load is but when I ran two independent tasks at the same time the GPU load is only The processing speed of each road is almost half that of the original that is it cost two times time to process each task The utilization rate of CPU is not high and there is plenty of memory And there are no other tasks taking up GPU My GPU is not full but processing speed is downdo you know why Do anyone have the test code without matconvnet I tried using python interface and I am not able to get good results I am able to get good results using matconvnet and the given test code But not for python interface Seems like I have done something wrong in the data preprocessing It would be great if anyone has done it already Hi guys The codes of multiscale implementation and data argumentation have been updated The model trained by myself yields similar performance with original paper
