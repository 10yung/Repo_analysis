template available Current behaviour TabView does not bounce on iOS that effect that happens when you overscroll when scrolling past the views edge Expected behaviour TabView should support bouncing on iOS Perhaps it should expose a bounces prop like TabBar and ScrollView do What I have tried In earlier versions of this library I was able to add bouncing by creating a fork and exposing the bounces prop of TabViewPagerScroll This cannot be done with the new pager because it does not use ScrollView Is there a way to achieve the same effect with the current Pager via PanGestureHandler and
