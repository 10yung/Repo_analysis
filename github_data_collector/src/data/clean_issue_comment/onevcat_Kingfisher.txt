with the URL because it stores on the local device It would be nice if the JPEG compression quality could be parametric Id be happy to fix this issue but Im not sure wheres the best place to add the parameter Hi everyone Kingfisher is an awesome library but I cant seem to implement the following In order to resolve a slowjittery UICollectionView on initial scrolling I checked out Time Profiler and I believe the jitter comes from UIImageViewkfsetImage which would make sense I am already using the kingfisher prefetch method with cacheMemoryOnly to prefetch the images used in the cells of my collectionview long before actually reaching the view where the uicollectionview resides Then when I populate the cells I use UIImageViewkfsetImage with the fromMemoryCacheOrRefresh option since I believe the lag is caused because it is loading the image from Disk and not fro Memory However when I print out the valuecacheType in the setImage completionHandler the first results are none not memory as expected It is only after scrolling up and down a couple of times that the cache type indeed becomes memory So my question is the folloying am I correct in assuming that loading my cells images from memory instead of disk will improve performance of my UICollectionView if so how can I force KingFisher to not use Disk or Networkfetching but simply prefetch all the images in memory and load them from memory when the time comes I simply cannot find the correct settings to achieve this behaviour Thank you Check List Thanks for considering to open an issue Before you submit your issue

report a problem instead of asking a question Itd better to use kingfisher tag in Stack Overflow to ask a question Issue Description What First of all I would like to thank you for your work on this awesome library Thank you for opensourcing it and for your continuous contribution I have started experiencing issues when setting a fade transition for the images that I display inside a UICollectionView cell Basically I see different issues Whenever I set the options to transitionfade the fade transition is visible but there is a glitch A millisecond before the fade in kicks in a tiny version of the image that is about to fade in is displayed in the top left corner of the UIImageView and it is on top of the placeholder if set This is the code that leads to this behavior swift imageViewkfsetImage with profilePictureUrl placeholder UIImagenamed placeholder options transitionfade If I apply multiple options that also include a DownsamplingImageProcessor and a transition the fade in never happens This is the the options part of the code that I am using as seen in the Cheat Sheet swift processorDownsamplingImageProcessorsize imageSize scaleFactorUIScreenmainscale cacheOriginalImage transitionfade I dont believe I have experienced these issues in the past and I am not sure about the version that introduced this for me but I can say that its been like this since v including the latest one v Reproduce This should be reproducible with the code samples that I added above Other Comment Please let me know if you need any additional info I would be more than happy to help Thanks in advance Cheers Love Kingfisher Please consider supporting our collective use this code to set image cellimageViewkfsetImagewith URLinitstring icon but imageView show image just before setted when i set image like below cellimageViewimage uiimagenamed string cellimageViewimage nil by the way this happened a few times what should i do to clean image when the cell reused Hello When I turn off the network then turn on the network the pictures still cant be downloaded for a short time Does anyone have the same problem tableCell This is just a reminder that the issue described in still persists and since it was closed I thought I ping it and give some extra information The problem about the URLRequest timeout Task CEFC CFF BABD B F EFC finished with error code happens in my macOS program where I have a basic tableview which shows a thumbnail for every entry which I load via Kingfisher from a server After a certain amount of fine and fast loads the displaying of new images just stops and after the timeout expires no matter how long I set it the above error code is logged for each new image no Kingfisher completion handler error btw It at that point can only show the already loaded and cached entries The error code indicates a timeout on the request but if I load the URL manually in a browser it loads fine in a few milliseconds and when I restart the app and start loading from where it stopped last time all images load fine until the next error arises So I dont think it is a server issue The debugging is hard for me because as soon as I get to the point where the URLRequest is made in Kingfisher the timeout is in effect and after that time the debugger crashes on me Oddly enough the fix commented in with setting the activity indicator on the imageview only seems to push this threshold after which loading fails again a little bit further back without after ca images and with after ca images Note The images are fairly large around k since thumbnails do not exist but I dont think that that is the key issue maybe just causes the error to appear sooner Hello I have checked many issue regarding this with ref and But I am not getting any solution for this Some Cell are resize correctly after I scroll also if image is too small then it should be aspect fit to width height will be scale automaticallly Also cell are not resize with setNeedsLayout or layoutIfNeede function Thank you
