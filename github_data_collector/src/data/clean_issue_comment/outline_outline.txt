After added CloudFront on my self hosted outline installation Im redirected to undefined over and over undefineddone undefineddone undefineddone Looks like is something related to subdomains Everything is working good before CloudFront thinking Anyone who face it could help me out haircutman Share one item isnt enough Im considering to implement the shareable collection link How to start this implementation Could some one help Is possible to implement this on fast ring Enable easy documentation creation on the fly from the editor link menu Some policies especially admin ones are effectively duplicated across the primary domain and the team domain For example whether to allow a user to invite new members to the team We need to do this in order to expose the policy on the frontend because every policy must be tied to an entity object Policies for domains like Users rather than specific records dont get serialized in the normal process It would be more DRY to keep the policy definitions in their domain and just attach them to the Team entity Hi guys Im trying to use nested document structure but facing weird issue When i click on nested doc I could see location url changing in browser but page is not rendering On refresh i could see my doc Please help I would like to add two new visual treatments to the document list views to help surface information On teams were document updates are happening regularly it can be more difficult to find new and relevant docs that are being added A subtle tweak in visual treatment when the current user has not read the document perhaps bolder A New badge when the above is true and the document was created in last hours To achieve this we would need to query views for the user whenever a document is returned and set a new property on the document Note Im mildly concerned about performance of adding a join on the views table need to sure it doesnt regress in any measurable way It would be nice if email notifications included a summary of the changes made to the document ala other tools Right now we just tell them that the document changed with a summary of the document itself rather than the changes For this to work I think well need to introduce a method to semantically diff markdown or possibly the rendered HTML document Allows Outline to work on heroku and other hosting provider subdomains closes Im trying to use the deploy to heroku button and run an instance of outline on the default herokuapp subdomain The URL looks like I think the outline code makes some assumptions that any subdomain is teamspecific and not part of the base application URL Because the subdomain is stripped the cookie attempts to be set on herokuappcom which is actually blacklisted by browser vendors due to its status as a hosting platform Therefore the cookie is unavailable to the myapp subdomain and the result is a state mismatch error Instead of using the stripped domain could we instead use the env var BASEURL I would imagine a similar issue would occur for the URL myappcouk so its not just a herokuspecific problem Allow for sharing of a document plus all child documents in a share link Add an option in the share dialog to support this Add breadcrumbs to the shared view when viewing a nested document Display nested documents footer when sharing a document tree
