I have a problem with html options with multiple select When I pass one argument to be selected as variable it works but when I pass array which printsr Array Selection doesnt work How to make it work Recently updated to PHP and Smarty and noticed that foreachelse is not executed when the data count is I think this is because needTotal parameter in smartyinternalruntimeforeachphp is false and total will always be so function will not return null if total items in arrayIterator is smartyinternalruntimeforeachphp if issettotal total emptyfrom needTotal countfrom if total from null should return if foreachelse is used else To fix this smartyinternalcompileforeachphp should check if total is needed andor foreachelse tag is present I have added true so it will always do a count on the supplied array Not best fix but I dont know how to check if a foreachelse tag is present smartyinternalcompileforeachphp needTotal issetitemAttr total true check if foreachelse tag is present instead of true php join Passing glue string after array is deprecated Swap the parameters Hi I updated to V today but I get error of undefined property Smartysmarty at line when reading a configvariable that doesnt exist Changed line if datasmartyerrorunassigned errorEnable to if issetdatasmarty datasmartynull datasmartyerrorunassigned errorEnable Hello I would like to know the equivalent of the Smartysmartyinclude method which is present in version but no more in version maybe SmartyInternalResourceFile Thank you Hey there dear Smarty team by accident i found out that your in your current dev version date format sets the varriable and not just format it So if you would dateformat it a second time you will get an error Is it a bugg or a feature best regards FS If there is any in the template file smarty is removing the end of line after the closing tag even when isnt their own ie xml version encodingUTF root childchild root is changed to xml version encodingUTF root childchild root Hi We upgraded from Smarty to Apparently if you have a php variable defined as follows definemyvar My var value It can be accessed in the template as myvar Can we stop this behavior In our app we have a php constant defined named assign which breaks the smarty template when the assign tag is used There should be a way to not directly see these keywords as constants since anyone can break smarty by defining a php variable having the same smarty tag name And btw the generated exception doesnt say much it was hard to find Thanks I see that Smarty hasnt had any updates in is it dead If yes then maybe someone could post an alternative php templating engine so we can start migrating Thank you The Smarty code foreach as ii iforeach compiles into php php from smartytplsmartyextforeachinitsmartytpl array i if from null foreach from as smartytpltplvars i value i php echo smartytpltplvars i value obstart smartytplsmartyextforeachrestoresmartytpl prefixVariable obgetclean echo prefixVariable Which has a very obvious issue of creating uncontrollable amount of output buffers
