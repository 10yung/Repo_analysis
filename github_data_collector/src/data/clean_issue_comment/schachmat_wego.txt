Im working using wego as a module for where I need to use formatCond in frontendsasciiarttable Adding a new method in ifacefrontend interface which return the rendered text would be a nice addition Heres my attempt to fix Fully tested and functional on my machine If an old config ie one utilizing forecastio is used the user is provided a warning and the application closes gracefully I personally dont think any other special handling is needed as mentioned and postponed on in Doing so would require extra modifications to the functionality of to allow flag migration I was surprised that along with Unicode thunders unsightly ASCII quotes are used instead of macrons Shouldnt this be fixed Originally I posted this as a response in chubinwttrin but then I realize chubin was using wego So as I stated in that report Im using KiTTY to access SSH to my Raspberry Pi B because I like being a complicated person As great as Unicode has blessed us with ASCII symbol and then Emojis they almost have not business being in ASCII Art and from the link I provided there have been some complications with using the lightning bolt symbol in the forecast ASCII art of which I can verify that and my raspberry Pi still has a little bit of an issue rendering some of the Nerdfont symbols as that square in the red are should actually be the Raspberry Pi logo so this screenshot is probably the best view I can get on a nonLinux system over SSH But heres the thing The representation of thunderstorms with lightning feels cheap Take example this screenshot for the weather report and forecast in Jackson Mississippi today The lightning symbol works great if you are trying to pull up the small version of the forcast to fit it on the status line in TMUX or some other text console app but for the ACSII representation of weather it looks bad When you render here on Github it looks like this Weather report Jackson MS Thunderstorm In Vicinity F mph mi in So I though about something better A short Google Search for lightning ASCII Art yielded this example at the bottom of the page Since that was too big I tried shrinking it down a bit and came up with these logos For all the following case the lightning bolt would be colored yellow to differentiate that from rain which would use similar characters It would be wise that the color of the characters that make up the lightning bolt take precedence over the colors making the clouds or precipitation Lightning bolt raw no clouds or precip Thunderstorm small cloud no precip Thunderstorm small cloud no precip with sun Thunderstorm small cloud light rain with sun Thunderstorm small cloud light moderateheavy rain with sun Thundersnow small cloud snow with sun In the above version I made the small cloud a little wider to better define the lightning bolts appearance This next set would apply the ASCII art lightning bolt a little better Thunderstorm large cloud no precip lightning more centered Thunderstorm large cloud light rain lightning more centered Thunderstorm large cloud heavymoderate rain lightning more centered Thundersnow large cloud snow lightning more centered Overall I think these would look better especially once they are colored that the current art I didnt include an art for the various types of winter weather but I would be interesting to see what that looks like Im also think of how to better represent duststorms which dont really have lightning in them all the time but could smoke haze fire danger and windy weather While I applaud the color coding of temperature and wind speeds Some terminals do support bold and italic fonts Why those arent used by default is something the Linux and SSH folks should really look into but is beyond the scope of this project Other than that I really like this project and would love to help make some contributions to it Keep up the good work I think maybe my pull request introduced an issue The wind speed line is misaligned on all terminals now The weird thing is it was working earlier just fine and now its suddenly broken I didnt change anything so Im not sure whats going on I tried it in urxvt xterm and xfce terminal What it looked like before my changes photo What it looked like after but before my pull request this screenshot is from my changes before uploading them photo And now it looks like this xscreenshot Id like to update the version in Void Linuxs tree to support the new backends but I need a release to do this Would you consider releasing a new version This implements a simple image frontend that generates a PNG image This uses the font of the Weather Icons project The path to the weathericonsregularwebfontttf must be configured in the wegorc configuration file before using this frontend the other files are not used so it is possible to download only this single file from the repository The sizes and colors are currently not configurable as I choose them to fit my current use This adds support for Weatherbitio as a backend based on the Forecastio backend because I had an API key laying around This adds basic support for their days hours forecast I could also use their daysdaily forecast when the number of days asked is greater than days if someone is interested I would like to be able to further customize units I prefer wind speed in Beaufort since its a more useful scale to tell me how the wind actually feels Also it would be nice to display both Celsius and Fahrenheit at the same time so I can more easily tell friends in other countries about the weather
