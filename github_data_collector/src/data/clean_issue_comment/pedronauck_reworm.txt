Does this library support server side render If you use Provider pattern why no props to support SSR If you dont support SSR why use Provider pattern Provider pattern is the way to support SSR so two different http requests in one nodejs backend program will not share their global state js appget req res in Provider pattern store is created in handler rather than in module top level which is in fact global resendrenderToStringProvider storecreateStoreApp Provider pedronauck Is this library supposed to also be usable in React Native projects right Seems like you are using the library ulid for generating a unique id for each store But in a React Native project the library is trying to import the crypto module then breaking Am I missing something From the readme I get the impression that Reworm is for use with React projects only Has it been successfully tested with alternatives like Angular or Vue
