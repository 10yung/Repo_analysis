ToDo Validate PasswordBox Windows Build with Chromium update Describe your feature request Its a bit weird that you can view the IP address at the Information tab but need to go to Configure tab to renew the IP And after youve done that you need to go back to Information to see the current values I would personally even opt for merging these tabs entirely Add option to do DNS look up to show name as well as IP address for the Remote IP Address in a separate column This will make tool so much more useful in a big network as can quickly see devices connected by name rather than then having to look up the IP myself each time Hopefully as DNS look up integrated in lots of other places this wont be too add Show process ID and process name for each connection where relevant Basically in same way as netstat abo does eg example output below Active Connections Proto Local Address Foreign Address State PID TCP XPSDESKTOP LISTENING mDNSResponderexe TCP XPSDESKTOP LISTENING TeamViewerServiceexe TCP XPSDESKTOP LISTENING Can not obtain ownership information TCP bthub TIMEWAIT TCP GalaxyA CLOSEWAIT CDPSvc svchostexe TCP GalaxyA CLOSEWAIT TCP https ESTABLISHED OneDriveexe TCP https ESTABLISHED TCP https ESTABLISHED onenoteimexe Add some templates for portsrangescommon ports Webserver etc Windows Mail etc Currently the ip scanner only uses icmp ping Hi Getting odd results from Port Scanner scanning my whole network of for ports as a test and getting odd results Basically it is showing ports like being open for IP addresses which dont even exist on my network home See screenshots showing some of the results for one address and also showing my connected devices on my router where that address is not used and I cant ping it either So why is it finding open ports for something which doesnt even exist Any thoughts or tests I can do please Move translation from converter to LocationManager
