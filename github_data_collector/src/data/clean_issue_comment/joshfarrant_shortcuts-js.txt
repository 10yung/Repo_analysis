PR Checks X Ive checked there are no linting errors X Ive checked the code is still at test coverage Added Actions if relevant addToDo Are you happy to be listed as a contributor on Shortcutsfun Yes Any other information comments I love that you ask here about how it was to contribute Before seeing this I made an issue here This is from my experience contributing for the first time here I tried adding an action Here is what I had difficulties with maybe it could be a point of possible improvement npm test is ran on every commit This causes the commits to take forever to happen The tests should be ran ideally on the PR not per commit interfacesWF and interfacesWFWFWorkflowActionParametersts need some docs and coordination I had trouble understanding if I need to reuse stuff in there if I should add more how to name them where to put them I think these two need some kind of rules to know when we need to add them and how to name them tslint autofix I got some complaints for things that tslint could actually fix for me Maybe a script in the packagejson for autofixing would be useful Also an editorconfig file for the spacing would be useful as I have mine with tabs by default so I had to fix the spacing on the new file I made dont use default exports With export default commentts const comment export default comment indexts import comment from comment export comment With export commentts export const comment indexts export comment from comment Without default we get fewer lines less verbosity and now the editor can autoimport by just typing the name of the function we want to use Inconsistent types with and I think I saw some files using type A bla boolean foo string and some using interface B bla boolean foo string It would be nice to be consistent I think tslint has a rule for this in types I saw types like type A foo bla blu A better way to write this is type A foo bla blu Its easier to read understand and easier to run a sort func like in vim I hope some of these make sense These are just my suggestions take for here what you like Im happy to discuss more about any of these Thanks These actions arent already listed in the All Actions to be implemented issue here These actions havent already been requested in another issue Fill out the information below deleting the examples in italics What is the name of the app these actions are a part of Bear Is this a free or paid app Free Please list all of the actions this app exposes Search in Bear Create Bear Note etc Provide a link to download a shortcut file containing as many of these actions as possible iCloud I guess thats it then The contribution guide assumes some knowledge of the node ecosystem which can be a barrier to those who ve not worked with node and npm before It could be useful to add a bit of information to the guide on how to installbuildrun the project locally subSent with a href This json file contains information about every default action in shortcuts it was extracted
