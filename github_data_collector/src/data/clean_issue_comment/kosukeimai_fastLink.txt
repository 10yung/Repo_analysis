Please add Matthews correlation coefficient MCC as an additional statistic for the confusion table TP TN FP FN MCC TP FP FN TN FP TN TP FN The MCC is useful as an overall measure of the linkage quality The MCC is better than Accuracy and the F score for imbalanced data because it adjusts for the balance ratios of the four confusion table categories TP TN FP and FN In practice I find that most linkage data are imbalanced by having mostly TN Wikipedia Matthews article Matthew page A correlation of C indicates perfect agreement C is expected for a prediction no better than random and C indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation Mentioned in Tharwats article Recommended by Luque et al Anders Hey I have tried to replicate the examples form the vignette and I got stuck at Blocking part I cannot find the gender variable in the dfA and dfB datasets provided by the library Could you add the variable in the data Best regards Mateusz Najsztub Hi developers Thank you so much for this package it is grreaattt I was wondering if theres a way to match multiple datasets dfA dfB dfC etc Hey guys Thank you for developing this package I think it will be really useful to me It seems like the default behavior for fastLinkfastLink is to return the indices and posterior probabilities for matching rows only Is there a way to view the posterior probabilities for ALL pairs of rows Im interested in knowing if there were any pairs that were NOT matched but should be Thank you Brad Hi I have a question about how youd suggest implementing links using geocoded records Ive considered doing the latitude and longitude numeric comparisons or perhaps reweighting the posterior probability based on the geodesic distance Just spitballing Thanks Stewart Hi Ted and fastLink developers Thank you for creating this amazing package and answering my previous questions My team is wondering if you have written or have plans to write fastLink in other languages especially Python Java or Scala Would you shed some light Thanks Katie hi this package seems great and much needed i had questions whose answers could strengthen the documentation articles vignettes It seems like the workflow is designed to separate the blocking step from the later estimation step Is this correct This would be a point to highlight as a strength one pain point in using the other package RecordLinkage is that the blocking step was tied to the estimation step in a single overarching function When I was using the record linkage package i wish it was broken out into two functions formblocks estimateparams Are the performance metrics output by the summary method conditional or unconditional In the sense that do the metrics apply on cases after blocking or do the metrics apply on cases unconditional on the blocking Sensitivity Specificity Positive Predicted Value False Positive Rate False Negative Rate Correctly Clasified This was another pain point of RecordLinkage in that the performance metrics only applied to conditional cases after blocking Faster implementation of stringdist Precalculate string distances of common first and last names Remove as much of duplication between tableCounts and matchesLink as possible Solved Add a userfriendly warning for Solved Add a userfriendly warning for Solved Add a userfriendly warning for Solved
