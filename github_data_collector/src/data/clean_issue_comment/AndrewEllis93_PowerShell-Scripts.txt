I added an optional parameter to the SendAllNotices called ADTargetOU This string accepts a CN and will limit the user object search down to that OU and all subsequent OUs in the subtree It uses the SearchBase parameter of GetADUser This combined with the exclusion list should broaden the targeting ability of the script enough for most use cases
