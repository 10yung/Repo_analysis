 function J computeCostX y theta COMPUTECOST Compute cost for linear regression J COMPUTECOSTX y theta computes the cost of using theta as the parameter for linear regression to fit the data points in X and y Initialize some useful values m lengthy number of training examples You need to return the following variables correctly J YOUR CODE HERE Instructions Compute the cost of a particular choice of theta You should set J to the cost Loop implementation for i m J J Xi theta yi end Vectorized implementation J sumX theta y why it is X theta and not theta X J m J end grad changed to grad
