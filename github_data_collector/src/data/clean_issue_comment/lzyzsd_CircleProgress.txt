 Sir I want to slow down animation of ArcProgress and I am using this code ObjectAnimator animation ObjectAnimatorofIntarcprogress progress animationsetDuration for a fast but not to fast animation animationsetInterpolatornew DecelerateInterpolator animationstart and I changed but it is not slowing down And one more issue when i restart my app it is not showing any animation I want to restart my animation on On Create Please let me know how to show full text inside circle Like i have Hello world I have used your library its working goodBut i want to apply gradient in filled part How can i do this Can you please create a Android X version Its been a long day so Im probably overlooking something obvious but why is defaulttextsize defined twice in the constructor There is a small issue in displaying the textual percentage progress The value returned by getProgress is calculated based on modulus operator which returns the remainder not the percent value While assigning value to textual field it should apply this formula getProgress getMax This component does not support Android databinding Any upcoming fix For changing central text you should call setTextString method If this method isnt called progress value would be set as default text For resetting custom text and setting progress value you can call setDefaultText method Setting custom text does not affect progress value its only visual change for UI
