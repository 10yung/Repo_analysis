 If you are new to the project get yourself familiar with before filling the issue Steps to Reproduce These steps are using the attached test app that demonstrates the issue Have a form with ComboBox controls that can be hidden Visiblefalse as well as a context menu that can be displayed Set a ComboBox to be hidden Visiblefalse Rightclick to open the context menu Leftclick in the area where the hidden ComboBox is Observe that the ComboBox lists pops up even though the combo box itself is hidden Screenshots I hid most of the combo boxes in my test app and then clicked on the location of the bottom one when the context menu was displayed Screenshot at PM You can open any number of hidden combo boxes at once Screenshot at PM Sample Code using System using SystemDrawing using

behavior Clicking on a hidden ComboBox will cause its list to pop up if a ContextMenu is displayed If a ContextMenu isnt displayed then the issue doesnt occur Expected Behavior Clicking on a hidden ComboBox will never cause its list to pop up Please describe the behavior you are expecting On which platforms did you notice this macOS X Linux Windows Version Used Mono JIT compiler version tarball

Please paste the stack trace here if available You can join us at to discuss your reported issue When calling a generic class we need to make sure it has been initilized This is done by calling genericclassinit Since the need to check if the method has been executed happens frequently but will only run once it should be put out of line assisting branch predictor preventing misspredictions in all places but the first Currently this is not the case since we will generate code like this cmp byte ptr rcx Dh jne F A call p pltEmptyGamejiticallmonogenericclassinitllvm F mov raxqword ptr monoaotEmptyGamellvmgot C h Where we will always except for first call take the forward branch Instead we should mark the call to the method as out of line at least giving the code generator the information so it can move it out of line and preventing a jmp unless when it needs to init the slow path Doing that will generate the following code cmp byte ptr rcx Dh je C A mov raxqword ptr monoaotEmptyGamellvmgot C h C call p pltEmptyGamejiticallmonogenericclassinitllvm C jmp A
