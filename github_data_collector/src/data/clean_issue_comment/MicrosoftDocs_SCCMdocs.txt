Updating the steps based on customer feedback Summarize the change in the pull request title Describe your change specifically why you think its needed Fixes IssueNumber if necessary I think its worth mentioning on this page that if you install a pull DP on a workstation OS the ConfigMgr client will enable BITS with default settings even if the client settings are set to disable BITS This means the pull DPs transfers will be throttled regardless of any other settings To override this so the pull DP will for example use the max available bandwidth when pulling from a DP configured with LEDBAT you need to set Limit the maximum network bandwidth for BITS background transfers to Disabled in GPO This is mentioned in a couple of forum threads eg but I dont see this called out in any official
