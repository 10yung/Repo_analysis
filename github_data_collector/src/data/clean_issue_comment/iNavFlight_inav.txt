 Current Behavior There is currently no way to change the information on the display Desired Behavior I would like a way to change the OLED display Where does the OLED display get its information from Can we modify the screen somehow to show more relevant information This could be set up as a HUD for a camera eg DJI to show your home arrow distance to home alt speed mah There are all sorts of fun things you could do with this as a HUD Im trying to add a SoftSerial port to the NOX target to allow SmartAudio VTX control using the LED pad Im a software developer but dont have experience with this type of hardware I hope this is the appropriate place to ask these questions I looked over the existing code for NOX and have a couple of questions There appears to be a SoftSerial defined already as a workaround for ESC telemetry define USESOFTSERIAL define SOFTSERIAL TXPIN PA Workaround for softserial not initializing with only RX define SOFTSERIAL RXPIN PA Backdoor timer on UART TX used for ESC telemetry If I dont need ESC telemetry can I redefine SoftSerial on PA LED PAD My current plan is to define SoftSerial to PA define USESOFTSERIAL define SOFTSERIAL TXPIN PA Softserial on the LED pad define SOFTSERIAL RXPIN PA In targetc there is a timerHardware section I dont understand const timerHardwaret timerHardware DEFTIMTIM CH PB TIMUSEPPM PPM DEFTIMTIM CH PA TIMUSELED LED DEFTIMTIM CH PA

mix of TIMUSEPPM and TIMUSEANY for softserial DEFTIMTIM CH PA TIMUSEANY Softserial on LED PAD Note Ill make my changes to a new target using the appropriate ifdefs I didnt want to complicate the discussion here Thanks for any help Hi First of all I would like to give you my congratulations for the wonderful software that you developed But after several months of frustration with Altitude Hold feature I m asking for help Not sure if this is the current place let me know if there is a better one I have a inch quad with a Matek F STD equipped with a sonar TFMini pointing to the ground I ve used the Present setting for this type of quad There are two major issues that I m not able to overcome Quad is not able to keep altitude with stock PID values or even after a tentative PID tuning to the Altitude Hold parameters When hovering two meters from the ground the quad slowly starts to drop altitude and hits the ground And when hovering if I softly move the quad forward pitch it will lose altitude and hit the ground Sonar seems not be doing nothing ie when I get the quad hovering two or three meters from the ground if I put my hand under the sonar the quad does not react moving up Barometer is properly isolated with foam and sonar and barometer have correct readings in Sensors tab I believe vibrations are within the expected values based on my limited knowledge from inspecting Black Box logs Moreover installing Ardupilot on this same setup with default PIDs proves that there is no problems with my hardware the altitude hold works wonderfully and the sonar reacts properly I m sharing Black Box log that reflects these two issues Every time I moved forward the quad it dropped altitude until I add some throttle to compensate In the last moments of the flight the quad was hovering about three meters from the ground in Position Hold until it slowly moved down and reached the ground moment which I disarmed the quad I ve spent several hours looking for videos and posts regarding this kind of behavior but I don t find anyone facing the same problem as I am Can someone give me some light where can be the problem and give some hope to move forward Thank you Tiago LOG zip Need camera shutter release in missions Suggested Solution In mission planning add modes user user for pinio with pressed timing or similar mechanism with servo Need stopping on point for this Current Behavior On a waypoint mission when RTH is selected at the end of a mission the OSD is not showing RTH once the mission ends Adding to the above with no clear indication on the mission progress you cannot really tell when your mission is over Adding to that when mission is over and craft is in loitr there is no indication on that state as well ie that the mission is over Steps to Reproduce Configure mission Select the Checkbox RTH at the end of mission Expected behavior Change the osd from en route to waypoint to RTH when the mission is over and the RTH option is selected as stated above Suggested solutions Change the osd from en route to waypoint to RTH when the mission is over and the RTH option is selected as stated above version is Inav FC Board name and vendor Omnibus f AIO Current Behavior If applicable add screenshots videos and blackbox logs to help explain your problem Dangerous behavior Failsafe RTH RTH ends up in a crash The compass seems to have an error Getting back control doesn t work Even a disarm doesn t change anything Steps to Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Use Failsafe RTH Diarm if you want the full schnetzmachine mode you need a compass error too Expected behavior A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen A disarm should end in a quad drop Something that handles a compass error without having the risk of a crazy flying uncontrolable schnetzmachine would be nice too Suggested solutions How could we solve this issue What changes would need to made to INAV If the compass does not change but the gyro says something else maybe their is something wrong Is a plausibility check with the gyro or gps possible Additional context Add any other context about the problem here Go to CLI execute dump command copy its output to PasteBin and provide a link to a paste here If you see this video keep in mind after the RTH starts i don t control anything on the RC This is full autonomous INAV flying behavior with a not working compass After the quad moves from HOME point I switched failsafe of to normal mode and checked all switches to be on normal mode It doesn t change anything so I hit the arm switch to disarm And the quad keeps flying and change direction and keeps flying and change direction again and luckily crashes in the end This could get horrible wrong PLEASE FILL THIS OUT Use CLI

Suggested Solution Would this be a simple matter of changing WS LEDSTRIPLENGTH to in srcmaindriverslightws striph And LEDMAXSTRIPLENGTH to in srcmainioledstriph NOTE Feature Requests without suggested

V targetthe BMP I C external BARO is not working There is a SPI I C conflict on the targeth see here and here In my case i wanted a I C BARO so had to recompile inav with define BMP SPIBUS commented out define BMP SPIBUS This is the FC used Current Behavior Unstable flight may just flip out at any time using Omnibus V target Forums and websites that seem dated recommend using Fireworks firmware I tried that and it just doesnt work Github INav recommends Fireworks FW Some websites have updated recommendation to Omnibus V Cats whom answer threads are split down the middle Im one whom Fireworks just doesnt work properly for I know about the using second gyro and pointing the Fireworks FW in the write direction since this firmware wasnt written for this board Is anyone using this FC successfully with INav I fly the X S Omnibus F V and have no issues which has or targets and I use them all Steps to Reproduce Load Omnibus V FW chance of flight ending in disaster Load Fireworks FW Ive never gotten as far as flight just doesnt work Same Omnibus V FC flies perfect as a betaflight quad with no issues Ill give anything a shot if anyone has a recommendation that is working for them I will also retire this setup in INav and move on no big deal Expected behavior Complete a flight mah s without flipping over and crashing Suggested solutions Uniting all users of the Omnibus F V in the correct firmware to use Additional context This post is getting long sorry Happy New Year Packers won Go to CLI execute dump command copy its output to PasteBin and provide a link to a paste here
