I would like to track my phone to get its location and obtain RSSI values as well How can it be done Any ideas Fixes The names of locations lose any number of trailing t or x characters eg console whereami learn l couchright devnull whereami locations couchrigh This is due to using rstriptxt on the filename at getdatapy which will strip any number of t or x characters When running whereami crossval I get ValueError nsplits cannot be greater than the number of members in each class I suspect this happens when the total number of samples is but one of the locations has samples This case should be checked for and handled gracefully the same way as the case when the total number of samples is ie not throw an exception On python usrlocallib python sitepackagessklearnensembleweightboostingpy DeprecationWarning numpycoreumathtests is an internal NumPy module and should not be imported It will be removed in a future NumPy release from numpycoreumathtests import inner d None Ambient conditions fog storms air quality etc regularly affect radio transmissions in the suburban neighborhoods Ive lived at Some ambient conditionslike storms and fogoccur less regularly than the nighttime drops in temperature and humidity On the average for any given geographic location temperature and humidity are correlated by time of day The influences of ambient conditions on wifi RSSI will be less pronounced in denser urban environments than suburban environments The same goes for more climatecontrolled environments large libraries universities etc So this may not be applicable in all use cases Nonetheless given this time constant I think factoring timeofday into measurements and samples would be an interesting and useful addition to the project Ive kinda implemented this by changing the names of my classes eg shopbedroomday and shopbedroomnight or shopofficeday and shopofficenight Is there a way the project could make this more formal Like adding a timeofday component to locations Installed with sudo pip install U whereami with systems python My current locations are shopbedroombed shopwindow shopcouch shopfrontporch shopkitchen shopbathroom shopbackporch shopbedroomdesk When I run whereami crossval I get a stacktrace ending with ValueError nsplits cannot be greater than the number of members in each class Im not sure how to fix this error but in searching around for a fix I feel like the existing project documentation could be a little clearer eg where the trained data is whether its different from data in whereamitxt what exactly whereami train does whats the benefit of the n samples option and how to use the rename option If this is already documented could you please point me in the right direction EDIT for the nsplits error this link is helpful So it follows that one benefit of setting samples option during learn is that one sooner reaches the minimum of samples necessary to run whereami crossval The system currently prints contents as a Python dictionary which is a hassle to parse Adding support for JSON and text outputs In windows WiFi sampling must be done between every iteration Otherwise the method used here will return data of the same values and there is no point in collecting nrecords It will all represent a single value The program needs to call the Windows API to refresh the API points before gathering a new sample
