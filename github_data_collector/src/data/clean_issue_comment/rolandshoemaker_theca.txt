This software is really cool I was thinking about building something very similar to this Then I did some research on the rust ecosystem and found this I have converted my notes over to it I think it has a lot of potential Most of my suggestions actually require very little changes It could all be done just using the profilejson Let me know how you feel about these suggestions I may add them myself soon as I have time available Replace symmetric encryption with GPG or additional add GPG as an encryption option Im not a fan of the symmetric encryption itd be way better it if let you set a gpg key or several for teams and it just automatically encrypted to those keys when closing If done well you could safely store your notes on Github Select note by UID or title Select by title and UID It would be nice to be able to select by both Folder and Subfolder organization Nestingtrees so you could have programmingrust programminggolang programmingr Have you used pass This is along the lines of what I was thinking You could also use the folder structure to provide more granularity with the gpg encryption For example one folder can be encrypted with keys and another just encrypted with yours Option to default editor when using edit or another short command to quickly open an editor The ability to default the edit command to open up the editor This may require a config option it can just be stored in the profilejson theca edit editor is more than I want to type every time I edit Optional color label for a note to group similar notes and make division of different notes very clear at a glance It would also be nice to be able to set the color in the notes list this could also be defined in the profile When you have like notes files it helps distinguish them it could be like a label in a way Ability to very easily set a aftersave hook script that runs every time a note file is saved Ability to very easily just add a script to the saving process like a aftersavescript attribute So in the profilejson one could specify a script to run when a file is saved For example I could define a syncsh script rsync the changes to another server or scp the changes to off site backup or assuming theca has a git repo like mine one could commit and push the changes to an off site repo This could feasibly replace my request for gpg encryption but personally I think adding gpg provides better security The private gpg key would not even need to be present to encrypt and the exposure from comparisons with symmetric encryption Alias commands to short letter verisons For example edit could also be accessed with e theca edit editor becomes theca e editor I would love to have a library for this so I can integrate it in imag my personal information management suite for the commandline written in Rust I could use the JSON API but a native interface would be way nicer I guess I would integrate it as notes module backend crate allows for an easy installation of rust tools After running crate install theca I got an error message that its not available cargo install theca Updating registry error could not find theca in registry It would be really handy to be able to install the tool by means other than executing a shell script that needs to be reviewed beforehand Bug referred here Setup link and instructions here cargo build fails building libc v on nightly b on Linux and Windows Could you specify which nightly builds the current codebase I keep trying to read it as The CA Could you drop a hint in the README about how one is supposed to pronounce the name
