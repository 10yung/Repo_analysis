Getting alpha issue while displaying rows from dequeueReusableCell Rows are displaying with less alpha valuesome transparent guard let layout myCollectionViewcollectionViewLayout as VegaScrollFlowLayout else return keep coming out nil how can i solve this Hi I am facing a issue in which first collectionView item disappears while displayed section header in collectionView Flow layout gave two different issue While Scroll to downward First Item after each section header disappears While Scroll to upward Section header disappears See Attachment for issue ezgif comvideotogif Hi I would like use VegaScroll in userdisabled mode and call action on button press to scroll to the next index It all works fine only problem is that the animation is too fast and it doesnt look that great I found only one way to control it in viewDidLoad method collectionViewdecelerationRate UIScrollViewDecelerationRateNormal But that doesnt quite do the trick Is there a way to control the speed of scroll animation directly in VegaScroll class Thank you Can we have or is there an option to dont have the spring animation of the cells Hi in the README it says the minimum build target is iOS but when I build the library with Carthage it shows an error when importing it into a project with minimum build target as iOS say gin that minimum build target for the framework is iOS Id love to be able to update the collectionViews data on the go I found this code does the job let range RangeuncheckedBounds collectionViewnumberOfSections let indexSet IndexSetintegersIn range collectionViewreloadSectionsindexSet However running this makes the app crash at line because of an unexpected nil override open func layoutAttributesForItemat indexPath IndexPath UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes return dynamicAnimatorlayoutAttributesForCellat indexPath I tried removing the to prevent the forceunwrapping of a nil variable but that resulted in a generic terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException Any way we can update the data at runtime while viewing the collectionView Im thinking of some cool animation the cell thats to be removed scales down then the cells below move up smoothly w a easeOut curve Would be awesome Thanks I got this message when I added and ran a test project UICollectionViewFlowLayout has cached frame mismatch for index path NSIndexPath xc length path cached value expected value This is likely occurring because the flow layout subclass CoinVegaScrollFlowLayout is modifying attributes returned by UICollectionViewFlowLayout without copying them Any idea how to fix this The one solution I found didnt work override func finalLayoutAttributesForDisappearingItemAtIndexPathitemIndexPath NSIndexPath UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes let attr selflayoutAttributesForItemAtIndexPathitemIndexPathcopy as UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes manipulate the attr return attr If I want to use this on landscape view specifically for iPad where can I make the adjustment so that the cells stay centered
