I have run grunt to verify the unit tests pass I have added suitable unit tests to cover the newchanged functionality In the Filter Nodes filtering search top of the left nav Ive found a behaviour Id describe as a bug in that Say you have a sub module called My Module Foo The Foo will wrap visually in the sidebar nav My Module Foo But if you go to search for the specific module in the filtering select and type My Module Foo nothing is found To find it you have to leave the space out between where it wraps Instead searching by My ModuleFoo finds the item I think this is bad and therefore filing a bug on the UI nodered On Win Chrome Official Build bit cohort Stable Hi everyone Using nodered v with nodejs v Ive started to use the context from localFileSystem for persistence I managed to use it and store items with globalset and flowset inside function nodes I have a contextStore named file and stored a variable a variable with flowsetcount file with a function node Everything worked well The bug ive found is when i try to retrieve synchronously from the file contextStore Using function node i have this ASYNC working flowgetcountfilefunctionerr myCount iferr nodeerrorerr msg else msgpayloadmyCount nodesendmsg SYNC not working var a flowgetcountfile msgpayloada return msg And i get the following error node c ed f e function error Error Callback must be a function Ive tracked down the error path into the following file from source noderedruntimelibnodescontextlocalfilesystemjs line where it seems that its always expecting a callback function even if its sync LocalFileSystemprototypeget functionscope key callback iftypeof callback function throw new ErrorCallback must be a function Hope you guys can fix it shortly Cheers GB Before you hit that Submit
