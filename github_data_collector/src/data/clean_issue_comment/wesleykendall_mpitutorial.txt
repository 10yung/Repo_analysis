The tutorials here are great Would love to see a tutorial using a cartesian topology in MPI I wouldnt mind writing up a tutorial once I figure it out If it hasnt been done already Id like to add some tutorials for derived datatypes This would also be part of Hacktoberfest Hi Thanks for these tutorials I cant seem to find tutorials for nonblocking message passing MPIIsend and MPIIrecv It would be great if you could add those too please Would be nice to cover these as well to eg allow gathering arrays of different sizes from different processes into a contiguous array at the root
