Hi I really like this project Thanks a ton for creating this and have been using it for sometime by directly accessing it from the browser However when trying to access it thru angular via httpclient its always giving access denied I have investigated and found that the HTTP OPTIONS request method is also under authentication and it fails for Chromes PreFlight request as this request doesnt sent the authorization header which has been passed to the GET request Can you please remove authentication for HTTP OPTIONS request and respond back with a HTTP Status code of and a Allow header indicating the operations that are permitted on this resource eg Allow HEADGETOPTIONS The CORS spec which says for a crossorigin request with preflight make a preflight request Exclude user credentials I would have done a PR myself but i am not well versed with C Screenshot of the Chrome Tools Screenshot of Curl Id like fit a terminal with a fixed x size to a containing element on a webpage and allow the user to resize the terminal font using ctrlctrl along with other features It seems theres an xtermjs addon that provides the fitting feature but Im uncertain of how I would process to modify ttyd to achieve this effect Would I need to custom build ttyd modifying xtermjs with the fitting addon and updating the default indexhtml or is there a quicker route to success Thanks in advance for any help guidance you can provide Id like to see an option to use ctrlv for paste Its not so hard to modify that html file though Or even further give a chance to load an external js file which can access the xtermjs instance Such that customization can be done by this js file most of the time Currently if a user selects port as advertised in the help menu there is no way for the user to trivially find ttyds port This commit resolves the issue by logging the port to the console and by opening a URL with the correct port information if a user has selected such an option Im trying to use ttyd for a mainframe the main problem is that the terminal size rows and cols should be fixed no fitting or better a fit that should be and aspect fit changing font size I wanted to achieve this with some changes to html css but could not find how to do this there are some standard resolutions to admit o or columns and some related values for rows but this should be an initial option without further changes Any simple way to do or I should modify code Hi I built reverseproxy to redirect authenticated users to the right ttyd based on their jwt token on a k s cluster But unfortunately the fact that authtokenjs is not inside the index cause issues I have no C skills but would it be possible to serve it directly inside the index rather than beside If indexhtml is not changed actually htmlh do not need to be generated again The generated crtkey works for GoTTY based on my test import my own CAcrt in Firefox So I think it should not have any issue It failed in ttyd for below case start ttyd version release on a host ttyd ssl sslcert xxxcrt sslkey xxxkey top use Firefox and web debug Firefox has nothing showed Firefox shows succeed in getting and authtokenjs But GET failed for ws GET The ttyd log shows The log shows WARN refuse to serve WS client for illegal ws path cc tsl Is there a way to set the backspace to ctrlh or is it unsupported Hi First I want to thank you for creating and maintaining this project I have ttyd running on small server with very limited resources creating a new container for each client using the command ttyd docker run it rm ubuntu and it works great However the session and the container keep running as long as the user does not close the browser as expected Itd be very useful if those sessions and their containers can be terminated after a fixed period of time eg minutes Is there any known method to achieve this Eddie
