CocoaPods support Drop the deprecated exclusive flag from Podfile I just trying to run the sample app and facing a problem with the Podfile Just need to remove a deprecated flag from the Podfile and now the pods installing fine Thanks bithug There is no documentation in the code And the README is pretty lean Its hard to know what values to provide to the properties of the spring Ie what are the units of the values Eg how should I be determining velocity for the spring While using RBBSpringAnimation I noticed that movement was quite jerky in the initial phases of the spring animation To combat this I increased the sampling rate specified in RBBAnimations values method from to Eg NSArray values RBBAnimationBlock block selfanimationBlock copy CFTimeInterval duration selfduration return RBBBlockBasedArray arrayWithCountNSUIntegerduration block idNSUInteger idx return blockidx f CGFloatduration The results seem to be smoother animations Im not a mathsignal processing whiz but I think this is an example of the Nyquist rate Perhaps this could be made a property on RBBSpringAnimation As in some situations I think would be fine but others a higher value is going to produce smoother results Not sure whether this is animations or Apples fault but if you attach a RBBSpringAnimation to an AVPlayerLayer weird stuff happens Same animation works fine everywhere else This adds RBBRubberbandAnimation which is an alternative to RBBSpringAnimation and CASpringAnimation that is optimized for CGPoint animations and correctly handles the velocity paramter even if x or y are p aligncenter img src p objc RBBRubberbandAnimation rubberband RBBRubberbandAnimation animationWithKeyPathposition rubberbandfrom CGPointMake rubberbandto CGPointMake rubberbandmass rubberbanddamping rubberbandstiffness rubberbandvelocity CGPointMake RBBSpringAnimation will remain as an alternative to CASpringAnimation The current naive implementation performs poorly for overdamped oscillations
