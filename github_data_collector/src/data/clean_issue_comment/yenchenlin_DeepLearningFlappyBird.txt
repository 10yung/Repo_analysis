I was wondering if the tfreducesum and y are d and the mse cost term is d however the gradient to be propagated needs to same dimension as network output ie ACTIONS Is the final loss grad just replicated in both dimension ie This PR adds a few additions that make it easier to configure parameters for training and logging I added argparse and moved a few of the parameters to be settable with command line arguments This makes it easier to run a training run with different settings and compare I also added wandb conditionally W B a free tool that anyone can use anonymously to get hosted TensorBoard and graphs for key metrics like qmax It makes it easy to compare runs too Example img width altScreen Shot at PM src Cheers Why I cant read png file from assets Is that a problem from my module Appreciate this excellent work I got a lot of inspiration from this work on pygame I have achieved to train an AI for a more difficult version flappy bird the horizontal distance between adjacent pipes and the gap between up and down pipes are random within a certain range rather than being fixed Instead of neural networks and reinforcement learningI use evolutionary strategies and Cartesian genetic programming which attempts to build the control function a math expression directly using only basic arithmetic operators With a small population of size the bird can learn to fly quite well in typically less than generations which seems to be much more efficient than simple neuron evolution I implement this algorithm with Python and pygame For those who are interested please check my GitHub repository A demo is here Hi Thanks for your nice code and documentation I saw the report from Kevin Chen where he experimented with three difficulty levels easy medium hard of the game Can you please tell me which difficulty level the game is set in your code and How to change the difficulty level if I want to I guess its related to value of PIPEGAPSIZE in wrappedflappybirdpy currently its set to Is that hard mode By Increasing or decreasing the PIPEGAPSIZE can I change the difficulty level If so are there any specific value for those modes Thanks no this two module The code works fine but lacks of freezing of the target network rootlocalhost DeepLearningFlappyBird python deepqnetworkpy ALSA lib pulsec pulseconnect PulseAudio Unable to connect Connection refused libpng warning iCCP known incorrect sRGB profile libpng warning iCCP known incorrect sRGB profile libpng warning iCCP known incorrect sRGB profile libpng warning iCCP known incorrect sRGB profile libpng warning iCCP known incorrect sRGB profile libpng warning iCCP known incorrect sRGB profile libpng warning iCCP known incorrect sRGB profile libpng warning iCCP known incorrect sRGB profile libpng warning iCCP known incorrect sRGB profile libpng warning iCCP known incorrect sRGB profile Traceback most recent call last File deepqnetworkpy line in module import wrappedflappybird as game File gamewrappedflappybirdpy line in module IMAGES SOUNDS HITMASKS flappybirdutilsload File gameflappybirdutilspy line in load SOUNDS die pygamemixerSoundassetsaudiodie soundExt pygameerror Unable to open file assetsaudiodieogg rootlocalhost DeepLearningFlappyBird
