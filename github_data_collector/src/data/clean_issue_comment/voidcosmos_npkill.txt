Added functions setCursorAtHelp and printAtHelp not using y coordinates Describe the bug When npkill finishes searching it displays mb releasable space despite showing multiple nodemodules folders On folder deletion the program hangs After five minutes I killed the process with task manager and found that it succeeded at deleting the folder but got stuck anyways To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Run cmder Run npkill Select a nodemodules folder and hit space Expected behavior The program shouldnt hang Also it should be able to calculate folder size Screenshots OS Windows Version Additional context I suspect it may have something to do with file paths you can see in the screenshots that the first part of the path uses one type of separator and exactly after PWD it switches separator type After a really long time about half an hour the program managed to unhang itself after deleting a really small mb nodemodules folder Also after unhanging it calculated the size of two other really small nodemodules folders I was thinking maybe my hard drive was having some trouble but Crystal Disk Info is reporting good HDD health Instead of rming the folders when a delete is triggered it would be helpful to have an option that trashes them instead such as trash This is much safer and reversible Describe the bug On MacOS I get the following error when attempting to delete files The directory cannot be deleted Do you have permission Have tried with sudo and nonsudo accounts To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Run npkill with or without sudo command Attempt to delete an item from the list displayed See error Expected behavior Item is deleted with no error Screenshots img width altScreenshot at src OS MacOS Version Describe the bug Running npkill resulted in prompts for access to my contacts pictures and calendars I promptly stopped the process To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Launch terminalapp or iTerm v npx npkill See screenshot prompt Expected behavior Yes by running npkill I granted access to my system However I didnt expect the package or its dependencies to be compromised by malware Screenshots prompt OS MacOS Mojave G Version Latest not installed Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Im always frustrated when I see mb millibits instead of MB megabytes Describe the solution youd like Id like to change mb to MB and gb to GB Describe alternatives youve considered I have not considered any alternatives Additional context Files to change tests resultservicetestts srcconstantsmainconstantsts srccontrollerts srcservicesresultsservicets Pull Request Link Describe the solution youd like Would be awesome to be able to hold shift cursor arrow to skip or line positions because scrolling through thousands of directories takes a long time Describe alternatives youve considered Trying to exclude folders but that doesnt work as mentioned here Describe the bug A clear and concise description of what the bug is To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Open a terminal Run npx npkill The bottomleft corner displays a message Cannot read property path of undefined Expected behavior npkill runs normally and displays a list of directories Screenshots If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem OS MAC OS X Version npkill v Describe the bug help does not print the list of commands out of view To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Open a terminal with a height less than rows v Type npkill h You can see how the last rows do strange things and omit the output of commands that do not fit in the terminal Expected behavior It is expected to list all available commands as shown here regardless of terminal size Screenshots OS Tested in Arch I imagine it applies to all systems Version Probably since the help command was implemented Additional context May need to change the system by which the command list is printed Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Using the exclude option logs an error excludeDirsflat is not a function This is because the flat method user here only exists from node Describe the solution youd like Im not sure if other similar newer methods are used elsewhere in the code but itd be nice to document the node versions required Ideally though itll be nice to use alternative methods that exist in older versions or a polyfill This would make the library more portable Describe alternatives youve considered It works without exclude In my local nodemodulesnpkill I added this polyfill from stackoverflow A more robust polyfill can be found here Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here
