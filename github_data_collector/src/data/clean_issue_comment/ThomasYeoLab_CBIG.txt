Ive downloaded the standalone scripts for MNI to fsaverage projection Can these be used to do the reverse ie project data from fsaverage to MNI space Thanks Marta I am trying to help a researcher set up the CBIG Schaefer LocalGlobal repository on a server running Ubuntu I set up all of the paths for the required software libraries in a copy of the CBIGgwMRFtestedconfigsh file The researcher is primarily interested in the Schaeffer LocalGlobal stable project After following all of the steps in the READMEmd I sourced my bashrc and was confronted with warnings that all of the versions of the required software that were already installed on the researchers local server were the incorrect ones Setting up environment for FreeSurferFSFAST and FSL FREESURFERHOME usrlocalfreesurfer FSFASTHOME

error occurred In an assignment AI B the number of elements in B and I must be the same When calling function CBIGVonmisesSeriesClusteringfixbesselrandnumbsxfun line rhsl slengthl end My MATLAB version is R a in Linux and the data are in HCP format dtseriesnii I ran the function following the user guide and the first scripts in step had already been finished without error How should I fix this error We are trying to release a few scripts to provide the network label with the network name The only problem might be that the network structure could be very different if you are training from scratch on a different dataset Here are two cases Use our estimated group priors to estimate individual parcellation The group atlas will be utilized to initialize the algorithm therefore the network order in the individual parcellation will be the same as the group parcellation We provided two group priors which are generated by a group atlas estimated by GSP dataset in fsaverage space and a group atlas estimated by HCP dataset in fsLR k space I will provide these group atlases with corresponding network labels Use your own data to train the model and estimate group priors If you train on your own data then your group atlas will be different from ours the network ordering will also be different In this way you will have to run a Hungarian match algorithm to match the networks in your estimated group atlas with our atlases To do that you can use the following code If its fsaverage you can directly use the following command to reorder the color table and visualize it mypar
