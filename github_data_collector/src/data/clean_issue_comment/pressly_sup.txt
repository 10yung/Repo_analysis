Since golanggo SSH library requires this field on each connection Currently all new installations of sup via go get doesnt work at all This commit fixes it This PR introduces error messages to clarify some regular issues I encounter Sup always tries to connect to a SSHAUTHSOCK even if one is not defined Sup silently continues if a defined SSHAUTHSOCK is unreachable Sup doesnt report any permissions issues preventing keys from being read Sup cant currently handle passphraseencrypted keys but produces no warning about this Dependencies needed to be updated to accomplish this last task and a small change was required to maintain the existing lack of SSH hostname check behavior Add support for a username prefix in Supfile host entries Eg yaml networks staging hosts userhosttld This was possible before but buggy The following bugs are fixed by this PR adding a username to a Supfile host prevents that host matching any configured Host section in sshconfig sshconfig usernames override the username set in the Supfile Good day In new Go versions sshClientConfig needs to initialise HostKeyCallback Thank you A need for me to use sup in the CI like Jenkins and its not a good idea to set the ssh agent every time when the job is executed The current code only read the identity file which name is id Why not make it to be definable Error when parsing the identity file in the openssh private key format This can be solved by updating the version of cryptossh package The related PR Changes enable network user and identityfile settings in yaml file provide an env variable NETWORKIDENTITYFILE to override the yaml identityfile setting in some use case like CI use gomod to manage the dependance update crypto package to enable the openssh type key file parsing Lets say I have the following in my sup file production hosts root tb ashburn If I run sup only production date then a match occurs If I run sup only ashburn production date then a match WILL NOT occur How do the maintainers feel about a PR to change only so the comments can be matched against Im having issues running Docker containers interactively on Windows using bash Heres the output when I run my sup command Running task docker run it envfileenv NAME testpy the input device is not a TTY If you are using mintty try prefixing the command with winpty exit status new feature download files from remote to local added download operation refactored duplicated code block adding task to tasks into a method sample Supfile commands downloadlogs download srcfolder varlogmylog src SUPHOSTlog dst tmp Also modify sshgo to include configHostKeyCallback sshInsecureIgnoreHostKey We should review whether this is ok or whether theres a better callback function to use here Updating the vendor package solved my issue with sshagent and allowed me to connect to a remote host even if I have several keys registered with the agent Without this patch I have to clear my sshagent identity list each time I use sup Fixes
