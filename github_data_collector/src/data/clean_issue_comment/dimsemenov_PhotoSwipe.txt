How to slide to the next picture when zooming in Currently it can only be in the current unit Ive implemented to a website the Photoswipe library and everything works fine on the pc Even with the chrome device tool the photoswipe is opening up properly But on phones it wont work Ive noticed that when I delete the bootstrap meta its working even on phones meta nameviewport contentuserscalablenowidthdevicewidth initialscale shrinktofitno but the problem is that the website is not properly displayed because of the lack of the meta What can I do to make both the meta tag and the photoswipe lib work together On touch devices endless scrolling start with first pic after reaching last is only possible if minimum pics in the gallery Endless scrolling works on tapping the button but not with swiping Hi how to close the gallery on overlay tap Im using PhotoSwipe with Vue on this site eventlokale i have multiple galleries on one page and when i switch between galleries the url doesnt get cleaned and the site refreshes To recreate the problem go ahead and open some of the images on the link above close that gallery and open the other one that is initiated by clicking on the image icon in the row where it says R ume then close that gallery and youll notice the problem if it doesnt happen just redo the same steps will happen after the second or third try ive added typebutton on the buttons that control the gallery so they dont trigger the form but still getting the same problem also to mention this is happening only on Chrome Am i missing something obvious or this is a bug Steps to reproduce Open a gallery in fullscreen Press kbdEnterkbd kbdReturnkbd and kbdSpacekbd Exit fullscreen mode You can try this on your own CodePen Actual Behaviour The images that were active while pressing any of the mentioned keys will remain visible and the fullscreen mode cannot be entered a second time Expected Behaviour No visible artifacts working fullscreen mode Notes Ive added an event listener which prevents kbdEnterkbd kbdReturnkbd and kbdSpacekbd while PhotoSwipe is in fullscreen This fixes the issue in Chrome but the problem persists in Firefox Setup Windows Chrome Firefox Developer Edition How can I initialize the gallery without it automatically starting to view any pictures I need for the user to select from a gallery Im displaying and then start that way but if I dont call galleryinit first it doesnt work at all Thanks Ive implemented PhotoSwipe here and it works great on desktop The full images are x On mobile however it displays the image much much larger than the screen and thus Im unable to even view the full pictures from my mobile device How do I fix that when one defines loop false this definition indeed prevent him to loop back to the first photo if he is sliding images with his finger But if one uses the navigation arrows the loop is still enabled If you use your mouse to click outside the element it works just fine and the photoswipe modal will close However on mobile if you simply touch outside nothing happens Is there a workaround for this
