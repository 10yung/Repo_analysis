Currently running on MISP and Im trying to figure out if there is a way to add multiple tags to an event in a single API call I havent found anything documented for this yet Im attempting to minimize the total number of API calls required and using individual calls to eventsaddTag for each tag is slowing things down with the total number of eventstags that I have Looking for some guidance for this use case Thanks in advance Wed like to setup a cron job that performs queries using searchlogs to pull data from various instances remotely and aggregate the results for local use eg usage or ingestion stats The MISP user should be restricted to basically only being able to run searchlogs Ideally this user should be able to pull rows from the db logs table for all orgs As I see it the LogsController restricts access to only the users org unless the users role is Site Admin However we do not want the user to have those admin wide privileges Is there anyway to create a user role Audit Auth that will be restricted to running only searchlogs but with access to all orgs to pull stats on Models like Events and Attributes If not then is our only solution to create a user for each org of interest in that restricted role This is a bit painful as we add new orgs when adding feeds for use with Sharing Groups and managing new searchlogs users would be inconvenient On I see API Added rate limiting option to the API iglocska And I see Enforce search rate limit on adminrolesadd when clicked has of searches min This seems like a useful feature Thanks I was not able to find more details on how this works eg is this for WebUI search PyMISP API searches etc Is there an issue or a doc that explains more I did try a test setting up a Role with the limit set to but was able to perform unlimited PyMISPsearchlogs requests with a user of the Role Note for others there is a fix if you play with this See Describe the solution youd like Its already possible to have a default tag collection for newly created events but it would be great if this is also available for newly added attributes The default tag collection should be configurable per attribute type for example filename cat cat md cat cat Describe the solution youd like Make the window to add pushpull rules resizeable Its difficult to differentiate between tags starting with the same textstring Additional context Servers MISP Dears I have a quick question Is MISP Feeds System enough Do we need to add any other external custom feeds What is your advice Best Regards Im installing MISP core on Ubuntu using the commands wget O tmpINSTALLsh bash tmpINSTALLsh c during installation I came across the following pymispexceptionsNoKey Please provide your authorization key Nevertheless it was installed but there is no access URL The message is MISP Installed access here Work environment Questions Answers Type of issue Support OS version server Ubuntu OS version client Ubuntu PHP version MISP version git hash MISP Browser Chrome Support Questions Some default feeds are no longer valid whether to consider deleting them status ZeuS Tracker has been discontinued on Jul th stauts Not Found stauts Ransomware Tracker has been discontinued on Dec th In addition it seems that the ID numbers do not increase in order What are the rules for defining ID numbers thanks Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe If you delete a known remote organization nd tab the screen returns to local organizations st tab Describe the solution youd like For better UI it would be an improvement if the screen returns to the nd tab remote after the delete If you delete local organization it can remain like it is and return to the st tab This makes deleting multiple organization sequentially much faster Work environment Questions Answers Type of issue Bug MISP version git hash after a fresh git pull Expected behavior I expect the Event list filter to be able to search for any string Unfortunately strings containing X without quotes and X being any nonempty string will break the URL parsing of the resulting search page Actual behavior When a filter is created for eg http note the whitespace the request is being made to a URL of a form This triggers wrong routing resulting in a CakePHP error message Not Found Error The requested address was not found on this server Interestingly enough when searching for a urlencoded version of that string by directly GETing it still ends up with an error but a Apachekind Object not found The requested URL was not found on this server If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again If you think this is a server error please contact the webmaster Error MISPURL Apache Steps to reproduce the behavior Go to List Events page and enter without quotes in the filter field
