Hello We are developing business central apps using docker containers on a Kubernetes cluster developers avg containers per developer and review environment containers per branch That are containers in total running at the same time Containers live until branch merge This is the main reason why we are using Kubernetes The current business central images are built with navcontainerhelper in mind for setup and convenience Unfortunately it is not possible for us to use navcontainerhelper in a Kubernetes environment because we can not just run commands inside containers with powershell However this issue is not limited to a Kubernetes setting It also applies to any other container orchestration environment It would be great if you could provide different images for different usages eg a test image with test DLLs already setup and a regular Or atleast an environment variable like includeTestDependencies App deployment is not an issue we managed to do it over dev endpoint I do not believe this is a duplication of issue but ratheran extension of it i am not sure if this is a bug or i have set something up incorrectly The below function creates a container successfullyand i can ping the ip as well the hostname We can connect using our domain users as this is setup using gmsa I can connect to this from the Webclient windows client and development environmentbut not using what NAV THINKS is the correct addressfor example the listing in the server Instances of the developer environment will display containerdomainlocal which never works while trying to run an object i have to manually remove the domainlocal portion and then it will connect This also means that if i already have the client running i cant run an object after making changes without it opening an entirely new instance of the windows client which is the main frustration NewNavContainer containerName ContainerName accepteula acceptoutdated additionalParameters additionalParameters memoryLimit g auth Windows databaseCredential databasecredential databaseInstance databaseInstance databaseName databaseName databaseServer databaseServer doNotExportObjectsToText imageName microsoftdynamicsnav cu na updateHosts PublicDnsName dnsName my Additional parameters are listed below the dnsName variable is containerName domainlocal and i have also tried just using the ContainerName without domainlocal attached to the end additionalParameters publish publish publish env publicFileSharePort env PublicDnsNamednsName securityopt credentialspecfileContainerNamejson networktlan if any information about my network its a transparent one i believe setup is needed please let me know i followed instructions someone posted in either or similar issue report that i can no longer locate It appears that the NAV Server Event provider is not registered during setup in the latest nav docker image PS C Program Files Microsoft Dynamics NAV Service GetWinEvent ListProvider MicrosoftDynamicsNAVServer GetWinEvent There is not an event provider on the localhost computer that matches MicrosoftDynamicsNAVServer
