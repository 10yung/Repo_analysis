Please see this conversation Tested with gradlew publishToMavenLocal It should do same stuff differently so we could profile it systrace etc and compare implementations right now I just modify sample app and profile that Right now Im thinking about at least options Render changes directly on main thread Render changes that were computed off main thread and then posted to main thread Render changes that were computed on main thread with Domic Render changes that were computed off main thread with Domic Thatll reduce overhead of switchMap Since we pipe all changes through our model we can expose API that can let user capture and apply captured state That can be helpful for state saverestore reproducing UI from bug reports etc
