Hello Thanks for your tutorial its very awesome However when I practiced the part I found some error about testcases below And I also found that this sentence Need to implement searching an internal node does not exist so far Are there any steps the tutorial misses indexmd indexkormd partspartmd partspartkormd cstack Hi First Thank you for your awesome work Ive translated the article into korean

hurting my brain how many assumptions this tutorial has on the pre requisites we need What compiler should I be using gcc I ended up g What ruby things should I be installing and how bundle gem rspec How should I be savingstructuring my files in a single dbc cstack To be honest this tutorial is awesome I really hope it can be continued Can you introduce the next plan or what contents of the next Just like Part Splitting the Internal Nodes And I found this I mean we still have many works to do right If I want to continued that what should I do can you give some advice Thanks a lot error
