Report A feature request What do you want to add Currently this library realties on facebookpop which is no longer being updated by the look of the repositorys static pull requests This is one thing prevents it from being updated for supporting things like Swift Package Manager How should it look like If the required animations were added directly to this repository and in Swift it will prevent any issues as CocoaPods may be phased out in the coming year with Xcode Ill likely attempt this at some point in the future but if anyone sees this who maintains or even uses this library and wants to attempt it Id be very grateful I appreciate this may not be something that Yalantis have scope for at the moment just wanted to list it as an issue for now Report Report a bug What did you do Crash

Project that demonstrates the bug Please add a link to a project we can download that reproduces the bug I have a date picker in My screen and the koloda view reload when I select a new date and if I start switching date continues than the koloda view crash on reconfigureCards A feature request What do you want to add Add gestureRecognizer to shouldDragCardAt delegate method arguments It will make easier blocking the swipe event when the Koloda is inside a tableviewCell and you dont want to mess with the scroll How should it look like func koloda koloda KolodaView shouldDragCardAt index Int gestureRecognizer panGestureRecognizer Bool Report a bug What did you do I set the delegate method to the following and all is working until I use the revertAction method after that this has no effect and the value returns to swift func kolodaSwipeThresholdRatioMargin koloda KolodaView CGFloat return What did you expect to happen Im expecting for it to always be What happened instead After revert action its like it reverted to its default value Your Environment Version of the component Swift version iOS version Device iPhone Xs Xcode version Project that demonstrates the bug The bug can be easily reproduced in your demo project by just adding the code above kolodaSwipeThresholdRatioMargin Report a bug What did you do I added a view in Storyboard and added KolodaView as custom class What did you expect to happen Module should automatically be set to Koloda What happened instead The module section stays empty and the app crashes when trying to load the view Your Environment Version of
