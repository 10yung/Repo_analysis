delete recordings in tmp dir on audio engine start I hope to be collaborating pretty soon Best regards Hugo Barbosa Founder CEO MyCloudVIP Could a saturation module be added Something like a zener limiter with controllable current controls rolloff would be nice Sorry if it s already there and I missed it I downloaded AudioKitSynthOne from GitHub did the pod commands changed the bundle identifiers and built the project using Xcode On startup does not matter if I take the master or develop branch it crashes with an uncaught NSException on windowmakeKeyAndVisible Stack trace Thread

AppDelegateapplicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptions at UsersdwrDownloadsAudioKitSynthOnedevelopAudioKitSynthOneAppDelegateswift When I browse around the stack trace I see a lot of cloud related texts like CloudDocsLibrary Not sure what to do next I managed to build SynthOne in February of this year Some new info it says AudioKitSynthOneKeyboardView x cf setValueforUndefinedKey this class is not key value codingcompliant for the key darkMode We want to support MacOS Catalina with Synth One The MVPGoal is to have a first running version of Synth One available in the App Store Further goals could be adding AUv support This document is supposed to track progress towards that goal Current state I managed to get a build of Synth One running on Catalina that produces audio output Screenshot at Unfortunately this is far from releasable The biggest current obstacles are Cocoapods does not support iOSMac targets Catalyst We use a lot of thirdparty frameworks that are closed source and not compiled for iOSMac There are a lot of UIKit related crashes that warrant further investigation Current steps x Remove ChimpKit from S Dated framework no update in years x Remove EZAudio OpenGL dependencies from AudioKit x Remove AudioBusIAA from Mac targets x Figure out what to do with OneSignal and MS AppCenter dependencies Figure out what to do with Cocoapods support Need support for LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace across platforms Resolve all the other issues S crashes on any other screen than the homescreen presumably due to some Storyboard issues How to build it currently Currently building for Catalina requires the following steps Remove all Pods except for Disk from Podfile Drop in iOS Project for AudioKit Set checkbox for macOS Fix missing entitlements and codesign issues analogcode needs to add those at some point Build for Catalina iOS builds will not work due to the missing Pods Just curious The AERealtimeWatchdog complains at launch with a AERealtimeWatchdogUnsafeActivityWarning which traces back to the S AudioUnits internalRenderBlock I dont know if this is a serious concern or not but I am getting occasional EXCBADACCESS crashes in my app which includes a skinless version of SynthOne These crashes always occur when using the synth we have an AKAppleSampler in the app as well and always point either to our Conductor when it tries to play an event or within SynthOne code itself Of course its EXCBADACCESS so hard to know where its actually occurring Any thoughts Heres a backtrace of a crash just a moment ago thread queue

libdylddylibstart If there isnt one already in the project definitely add it If there iswhere is it Thanks in advance and thanks for posting and updating such a wonderful project Enjoy In AudioKitSynthOneManagerManagercallbacksswift retain loops are created by the callbacks Search for callback in your codebase and youll find more The callbacks need to be of the form myWidgetcallback weak self in guard let strongSelf self else return do stuff with strongSelf This isnt a big deal for a standalone app though its considered bad form but if you ever want to make an AudioUnit Extension the leaks will become an issue Timers are also a source of retain loops as well as simply creating cycles between view controllers etc You can use Xcodes Memory Graph Debugger to find them though its still not very easy I ve been playing around with Synth One and I m very impressed with it but also kind of sad that it doesn t seem to take advantage of MPE devices like the ROLI Seaboard and Blocks I do see pitch changing a bit and velocity sort of works needs some tuning I think but rich touch info seems to be ignored
