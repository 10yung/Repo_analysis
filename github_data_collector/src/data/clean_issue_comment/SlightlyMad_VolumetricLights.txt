For some reason In one specific scene the light just goes like yeah im not gonna be volumetric and just fails leaving a shitstain of disappointment on my entire project Thinking it my be a problem with my version of unity i opened an example script and it worked fine i did literally the exact same things as in the example and it still doesnt want to work edit oops i fixed it the range of the light was too goddamn bigg Its quite confusing that the asset package has no problem it runs well both in unity editor and built application But when I import the asset to my own project everything seems ok in unity editor then I built a PC package All volumetric light effects disappeared I think maybe there is something wrong with my settings in unity Im using Error Invalid pass number for GraphicsBlit Material HiddenBilateralBlur with passes VolumetricLightRendererOnRenderImage AssetsPluginsVolumetricLightsSlightltyMadVolumetricLightRenderercs horizontal bilateral blur at half res GraphicsBlithalfVolumeLightTexture temp bilateralBlurMaterial vertical bilateral blur at half res Like the title says if youre using orthographic projection to achieve an isometric look even if you update the projection matrix in the code nothing will be rendered to the render texture unless the near clipping plane is an extreme negative value This issue can be observed in the example scene I tested it on Mac OS Metal with Unity f and on Windows with Unity f Hi I have used your asset in the development of my game since Unity Now I am moving to HD Render Pipeline and I cant get your asset working What should I do Thanks So lets say I have a point light or spot light somewhere with a volumetric light This light will have a shadow strength of something less than lets say Now I add a second light with a volumetric light This one will have a strength of The second lights volumetric shadow now behaves like it has the shadow strength of the first one Also changing the strength of the first light now affects both volumetric lights So basically the volumetric lights take the lowest shadow strength of all volumetric lights that are available and uses it for all volumetric shadows in the players view It happens with both spot lights and point lights Objects turn dark when they are at the opposite side of the light source Heres everything looking fine the light source is pointing at the camera The building is lit perfectly but the terrain in the background is darkened the camera is turned degrees If we get farther from the building we see it turning black This is how everything should be lit No dark areas or shadows As the title says no error no warning but doesnt work anymore Also using Lightweight render pipeline Might be the issue Using the lightweight render pipeline installed from the package manager is confirmed the issue I dont know whats wrong there is no warning or error but the lights are for sure non volumetric now Hi again Lights seem to not render in some of the newer macOS versions at all is this a known issue
