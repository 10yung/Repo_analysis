Hello When i try to load any scatch with this library i got an avrg error createprocess no such file or directory error Other scatches compiles normaly Currently my device is detected as the following d f ea a ea In Devices Printers middle section it shows up as Unspecified but on the right its listed as an Input device How can I change it to be detected however I want Heres the relevant code include Arduinoh include HIDProjecth uint t rawhidData void setup RawHIDbeginrawhidData sizeofrawhidData void loop delay Create buffer with numbers and send it uint t megabuff for uint t i i sizeofmegabuff i megabuff i i RawHIDwritemegabuff sizeofmegabuff With HIDAppendDescriptor node I can specify a custom one but how do I do that using RAWHID Hi mates I need to create a video controller console and I would take advance of this project does it supports encoder Is the encoder classified as a default pheriperal for HID devices Thank you a lot Im having issues creating code to type a hot key Ctrl Alt m Im using keyboard testing software and it is only detecting the Ctrl and Alt key being pressed the M key is completely ignored I have this so far KeyboardpressKEYLEFTCTRL KeyboardpressKEYLEFTALT Keyboardpressm delay KeyboardreleaseAll If I remove KeyboardpressKEYLEFTCTRL or KeyboardpressKEYLEFTALT then it will type Ctrl m Alt m respectively If I change the alpha key to p or a or b or c I havnt tested the whole alphabet then it will work In summary I cant get Ctrl Alt m to work but Ctrl m Alt m and Ctrl Alt p do There are some basic HID versions working with low energy Bluetooth using the ESP but none is close to having the broad functionality yours has Example Hi I am trying to write a sketch controlling an android device Rightclicking an ordinary mouse generates a back event But AbsoluteMouseclickMOUSERIGHT not working for me Also I was not able to find a key combination or key code for the events Back and Home Could you please help me PS It seems that the Back event can be obtained using Win Backspace but I still did not understand how to get it Hello Im working on using an Arduino to report a UPS is attached when using an external battery pack with my computer Is there any support for the UPS HID profile in this library If not any thoughts that could point me in the right direction Thanks in advance Hi I was wondering if anyone has tried to use this library with a blue chip STM F C T and had any success I am trying now and I received a HIDh file missing error I am trying to get the gamepad code working on a SAMD board and am having no joy The code compiles and uploads fine the board is identified in the windows usb controller setup but I get no data from the board The same code works fine on a Leonardo Also the keyboard and mouse examples both work fine on the SAMD just not the gamepad I have tried multiple SAMD based boards and several computers with the same result
