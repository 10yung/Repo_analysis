In v Hi I managed to create a trelliscope that is able to have a state that sort certain cognostics automatically in acending or decending order and select what labels to display by default For example r state listsort listsortspecTransitionNamedir asc sortspecDataStagedir dsc labels cTransitionNameDataStagebqcrsdArea May I ask if it is possible to set a state that has filtering capabilities For example create a state that filters Area between two values Thanks for your nice work when figures get more a search button which can search figures by key words with exact match or fuzzy match may need Hope this will be added in upcoming works All the best Yuanzhi I am attempting to plot a D plotly scatterplot in Trelliscope and have received various errors One of which is the list does not contain elements and the other I have come across most recently is panel not written must be trellis ggplot or htmlwidget object From these errors I am gathering that Trelliscope does not support D plotly images is this correct If my assumption is correct does Trelliscope support any interactive D plotting options I have attached an image of my test code for review DTrelliscope Hello I have a little problem I have tried trelliscope on some teaching platform and it worked great After that i tried same code in Rstudiojust for playing around with it and it ended up with no plot I can save a plot but i cant see it in viewer or browser And there were no error messages I use R ubuntu and downloaded trelliscope package today Maybe i did something wrong Thank you for your help Hi Thank you for this very useful package In this tutorial of trelliscope One can modify the panel function through the interface Is there a way to do it with trelliscopejs Hi I do like the package and the functionality as replacement for facetwrap Do you have an idea how facettrelliscope might replace facetgrid Best regards J rgen Hi I have install trelliscopejs package from R CRAN try to follow Datacamp sample gapminder data but after processing progress bar writing panel the chart not show anything My R version and RStudio is at the subject Im using facettrelliscope from the trelliscopejs package for data visualisation It works fine when my ggplot has one layer But if I introduce a second layer it doesnt facet correctly Example Load packages librarytidyverse librarytrelliscopejs Basic stat summary table using iris statsum iris groupbySpecies summariselmean meanSepalLength Standard ggplot with facetwrap ggplotiris aesSepalLength PetalWidth geompoint geomvlinedata statsum aesxintercept lmean facetwrapSpecies Use facettrelliscope Data from statsum does not facet ggplotiris aesSepalLength PetalWidth geompoint geomvlinedata statsum aesxintercept lmean facettrelliscopeSpecies See this question on stack First off this package is awesome Ive made this pull request because there is a small issue when using it with flexdashboard When using this package with flexdashboard the presence of a margin causes the bottom bar not to be visible and removes a core part of the functionality Changing this fixes the issue Is there any reason why there is a px margin Best Simon
