 First of all thank you fort his incredible library Theres a very small bug which displays the third the first and the second work fine label in your example its the word IT always in white at the first launch After switching the tabs it displays correctly in the color set in the Inspector View Hope to see the bug solved soon Again thank you so much Perhaps there could be a noItemSelectedish setting that initializes the view without any item selected Im getting the following error Overlapping accesses to colors but modification requires exclusive access consider copying to a local variable Hello and thanks for the great work youve done on the project Im facing an issue where the delegate method is not being called when the selected index is changed via a swipe Im monitoring via the following delegate method segmentedControl segmentedControl SJFluidSegmentedControl didChangeFromSegmentAtIndex fromIndex Int toSegmentAtIndex toIndexInt and it appears that if the user scrolls quickly to a new segment index this is not called as the toIndex is not updated Is there another delegate function I should be monitoring for this or is it unexpected behavior I really like the project here and will be using it in my app if I can resolve this Thanks for taking the time to readrespond When using in Swift the App is showing weird Curves but not the expected ones as in sample video img width altfluid src This commit fixes the build errors associated with Swift Add supported to Swift Ive been reading inside the code and was wondering if there was a way to change the shadow colour to another colour aside from that of the segment Hi I noticed something strange with the segment control I created programmatially with SJFluidSegmentedControl The third segment appears fadedlighter in color than the nd segment Please see screenshot below screen shot at pm When I select a different segment nd or rd and then go back to the first segment the third segment is no longer faded I was trying to troubleshoot this and noticed changing the transition style from fade default to none will cause the nd segment to also look faded and selecting different segments will not correct the problem But how can I correct this issue so the rd segment shows up correctly when the view is loaded screen shot at pm Here is my code ViewControllerswift TestSJFluidSegmentedControl Created by Jack Ngai on Copyright Jack Ngai All rights reserved import UIKit import SJFluidSegmentedControl class ViewController UIViewController SJFluidSegmentedControlDelegate SJFluidSegmentedControlDataSource lazy var mySegmentControlSJFluidSegmentedControl unowned self in let segmentControl SJFluidSegmentedControlframe CGRectx y width height segmentControldataSource self segmentControldelegate self segmentControlbackgroundColor UIColorred green blue alpha segmentControltextColor UIColorred segmentControltransitionStyle fade Changing to none will make all other segments look faded slide has is the same as fade segmentControltextFont UIFontname MontserratRegular size UIFontsystemFontofSize segmentControlcornerRadius segmentControlshadowsEnabled false segmentControlshapeStyle roundedRect return segmentControl override func viewDidLoad superviewDidLoad Do any additional setup after loading the view typically from a nib viewaddSubviewmySegmentControl mySegmentControltranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints false override func didReceiveMemoryWarning superdidReceiveMemoryWarning Dispose of any resources that can be recreated func numberOfSegmentsInSegmentedControl segmentedControl SJFluidSegmentedControl Int return func segmentedControl segmentedControl SJFluidSegmentedControl titleForSegmentAtIndex index Int String switch index case return THIS WEEK case return THIS MONTH case return THIS YEAR default return func segmentedControl segmentedControl SJFluidSegmentedControl gradientColorsForSelectedSegmentAtIndex index Int UIColor return UIColorred Thanks for taking the time to read my question
