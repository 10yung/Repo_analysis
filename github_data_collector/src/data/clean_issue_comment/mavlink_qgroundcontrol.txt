Related to This adds support for the new ArduSub feature of automatically detecting the thrusters directions and reverting the corresponding motor output if necessary It currently looks like this Screenshot from feature request I use UDP video stream over LTE and according to my tests RAW h works much better than RTP Please add RAW h support Or please add custom video stream source configuration string as its made in Mission Planner I use gstreamer with this string to play RAW h gstlaunch v udpsrc port buffersize h parse avdech Hello I created an image for a new Autogyro UAV category to avoid an unknown airframe image display The new group was added according to the manual I am using Elementary OS Juno which I believe is based off of Ubuntu LTS I am using QGroundControl v I have a radio modem connected to the computer via an RS to USB adapter pl converter is what shows up in dmesg My architecture involves a python program that interfaces directly to the serial port usually devttyUSB and then rebroadcasts out via UDP QGroundControl connects to the rest of the system via this UDP link and the python program handles incoming messages from both streams and forwards them appropriately What is happening is that the python app will be communicating with the modem just fine but as soon as I open QGroundControl the link stops and no more messages comes through If I look in varlock I can see a file is made called LCKttyUSB As soon as I close QGroundControl that lock file disappears and the python program is able to communicate with the serial port again If I try opening the serial port directly with QGroundControl I get this error Link Error Error on link Serial Device on ttyUSB Error connecting Could not create port Permission error while locking the device I have removed modemmanager and my user is part of dialout This problem seems somewhat recent The setup seemed to be working properly months ago The only hardware change since then is I am using a different modem requiring an RS to USB adapter rather than a TTL to USB adapter Everything is unchecked in AutoConnect to the following devices not Not all mission plans consider the VTOLTAKEOFF identical to the launch position After setting the launch position manually it should no longer move See When planning a survey on a hill with terrain following you can set a max climbdescent rate This is only applied to the transects within the mapping mission The turnaround waypoints do not consider this limitation as shown below This seems quite wrong on build time we should not copy libraries a target for make package shouldbe used instead on cmake this is easier to handle as we have a INSTALL command that runs only on make install The problem with the current approach is that the comand fails after the build is successfully finished making any IDE to think that the software did not compiled correctly Hi I work with px code for survey application i can not see camera trigger indicator in qgc flight display menu but before when i was tested with ardupilot code it was working i checked tlog file of px code The location of the camera triggers was saved so there is a problem
