It looks like the number of times citr requests the full library from BBT can be optimized For large libraries this should yield a performance improvement Im open to adding an endpoint in BBT that would allow testing whether the library has changed since last fetch but to do this effectively I must understand what triggers a reread of the BBTproduced bib file and whether its cached on the citr end Its frustrating when citr freezes your session so I thought Id have a play with the future package Results seem promising so far so thought Id report back having alluded to the potential utility of having the initial bib read running in the background several months ago Basic concept demonstrated in reprex below Thoughts welcome r exclude things to make reprex faster exclude cMy Library

when knitting the document it sorts in alphabetic order based on the name of the third author which places the references in the reversed order articleDanielsson abstract The aim of the present study was to investigate executive functions in adults with intellectual disability and compare them to a closely matched control group longitudinally for years In the Betula database a group of adults with intellectual disability ID n was defined from measures of verbal and nonverbal IQ A control group with two people for every person with intellectual disability n was chosen by matching on the following criterion in order of priority IQ higher than age sex sample level of education and years of education Three types of tasks of executive functions were included on two occasions with years between testing sessions The Tower of Hanoi executively loaded dual task versions of word recall and verbal fluency Adults with ID showed significant impairments on verbal fluency and on the executively loaded dual task word recall task at encoding but not at recall There were no group differences on the Tower of Hanoi No significant differences between the two test occasions were found The results are interpreted in terms of individuals with ID having problems with speed of accessing lexical items and difficulties with working memoryrelated executive control at encoding which includes shifting between tasks There are however not necessarily problems with inhibition The dual task results additionally imply that the adults with intellectual disability were more sensitive to strategy interruptions at encoding but that dividing attention at recall did not have such detrimental effects author Danielsson Henrik and Henry Lucy A and R onnberg Jerker and Nilsson LarsG oran doi

Children with intellectual disability ID were given a comprehensive range of executive functioning measures which systematically varied in terms of verbal and nonverbal demands Their performance was compared to the performance of groups matched on mental age MA and chronological age CA respectively Twentytwo children were included in each group Children with ID performed on par with the MA group on switching verbal executiveloaded working memory and most fluency tasks but below the MA group on inhibition planning and nonverbal executiveloaded working memory Children with ID performed below CA comparisons on all the executive tasks We suggest that children with ID have a specific profile of executive functioning with MA appropriate abilities to generate new exemplars fluency and to switch attention between tasks but difficulties with respect to inhibiting prepotent responses planning and nonverbal executiveloaded working memory The development of different types of executive functioning skills may to different degrees be related to mental age and experience textcopyright Elsevier Ltd author Danielsson Henrik and Henry Lucy A and Messer David and R onnberg Jerker doi jridd

Strengths and weaknesses in executive functioning in children with intellectual disability volume year It is often the case that bibliographic information needs updating because of typos first names as initials rather then in full etc Currently bibliographic entries are added to the local bib file when the reference is inserted in the text It would be best to make such updates in Zotero as a master source and then update the relevant entry in the local bib file Would it be feasible to have a function that looks at the local bib file and refreshes the entries from Zotero
