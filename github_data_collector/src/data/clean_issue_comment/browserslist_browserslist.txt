IE Mobile should technically qualify as dead for almost months now It was supported as part of Windows Phone x and that went out of support on July The next version of Windows Phone WP used Edge Mobile instead of IE Mobile The current defaults includes Chrome and Safari which as far as I can tell havent been updated since more than two years Shouldnt those be filtered by not dead Safari for Windows Apple no longer offers Safari updates for Windows Safari for Windows was the last version made for Windows and it is now outdated Published Date September Browserslist is an industrystandard config and ecosystem around it to specify what browsers and Nodejs version are supported in this project It has M downloads per month Large projects use it like Autoprefixer to find what vendor prefixes add to CSS Babel for JS polyfills in babelpresetenv and postcsspresetenv for CSS polyfills Create React App and Angular CLI use it by default Since this project has a significant effect on the web dev ecosystem we need a big project of improving security and promoting best practices Improving Security Browserslist relies on caniuselite npm package with Can I Use data We can t use caniusedb directly because of its big size We have a script which tracks new releases of caniusedb repack them into a compact format and release the new caniuselite version to npm Unfortunately there are a few security concerns about this script We need to refactor it to avoid using it for malicious package publishing as we had with ESLint Move script from Digital Ocean server to GitHub Actions Split package into caniuselitejson with only static JSONs and caniuselite GitHub Actions will have access only to release caniuselitejson Unpacking scripts will be released manually Talk to npm team to add This project doesn t have postinstall script settings to prevent publishing packages with scripts Fix the problem is caniuselite licensing by keep using nonsoftware license for caniuselitejson and using MIT for unpacking scripts in caniuselite Promoting Best Practices Browserslist was created to prevent developers from supporting popular browsers It is a common practice of ignoring browsers which is not popular in your country For instance many US developers prefer to avoid UC browsers However the UC browser has a market more than Firefox and desktop Safari In Browserslist we are promoting queries like last version instead of selecting browsers manually like it was in babelpresetenv before chrome We are already promoting browser diversity check our interview of Google s The State of the Web and speak with the local community in Afrika Asia and Russia about their browsers Unfortunately a lot of users do not know about this problem this mission of Browserslist and browserslistrc best practices We need to educate the community about browsers in different countries and why and how they should help browser diversity Add npx browserslist lint CLI tool to show lint config against the most popular mistakes Add this lint messages to browserlist website Make an article about Browserslist browsers in different countries Make a talk and try to talk about Browserslist at conferences Extra Features Make browserlist official Create browserslistbyfeature npm package to have query like extend browserslistbyfeaturemodules to select all browsers with ES modules support requirebrowserslistcover in CN mobileToDesktop true gives andchr and other items in but gives andchr and other items in Were using babelpresetenv and it broke recently after update I traced and found browserslist gives different result before and after So I come with the line above babelpresetenv always calls browserslist with mobileToDesktop true Honestly I cannot quite understand how mobileToDesktop works from READMEmd but I found several changes regarding mobileToDesktop option between and Is current result correct Does this have a formal grammar Although the documentation seems to be thorough theres too much ambiguity unless you give a CFG for valid browserlist strings As title I think it should make sense like last Chrome version I have project setup with Lerna and Yarn Workspaces packages packagesapackagejson packagesabrowserslistrc packagesa packagesbpackagejson packagesbbrowserslistrc packagesb packagejson browserslistrc In the root browserslistrc file I have browsers list and in each package browserslistrc file I would like to do extends browserslistrc but I cant I can only extend from package like here extends orgbrowserslistconfigmycompany However I dont want to create separate package to only define list of browsers BrowserslistError Unknown browser query android all Maybe you are using old Browserslist or made typo in query I received this error when using the reactstarterapp maybe its got to do something with BrowsersList itself hence reporting it here In the near future would a query like last edge versions translate to edge edge The way it will work in browserslist would likely have a huge impact on the transition period between EdgeHTML Edge and Chromium Edge Note It will be much more common for this query to come down in the form of last versions The specific example of last edge versions was only used to focus the question The browserslistga looks useful but not everyone uses Google Analytics I would like to see an explanation or just a good example of the format so I can create my own browsersliststatsjson file based on a custom data source such as useragent headers in serverside request logs
