it would be great if we add two new option along with zoom Brightness contrast version Lets say image size is x and do the crop on screen of the the width as x but the final output image size is x this is a bug I want to use this library in swift How can i use this screen shot at pm I want such options and not want to let user change CropViews frame by touching Can you show me some way or At least few hints about how to approach If trying to rotate degrees to a landscape view from a portrait view it appears the limits of the window are based on the dimensions of the portrait view Might I suggest adding either a button to rotate the image degrees below the reset button or using some variant of sinangleMPI MPI to change the bounds to map height to width and width to height in those scenarios Firstly thanks your fantastic works I checked codes and can not understand checkScrollViewContentOffset did clearly When I commented those invocations simply it seems that no weird actions occur Could you explain the related codes sample code does not work and crop view controller does not fit in the pop over The PhotoTweaksViewController does not handle orientation changes gracefully often resulting in misplaced UI components Could you give me some advice about handling orientation changes or look into it yourself Thanks for this great component
