 bug Hello DreamRs team Thank you for putting together this wonderful package it is very nice especially when used in a Shiny app Whilst trying to learn how to use this package effectively I came across the example provided by your team showing linked tooltips located here Unfortunately this does not appear to work either inside of a shiny app or when just using the defined makeline function When using the code as it is now all of the graphs produced do not have visible tooltips either in Rstudio viewer or Firefox each with R MS Windows When editing the code to put a scatterplot on top of the linechart the vertical line appears when hovering over a point but not the tooltip R on CRAN now version librarybillboarder data dataeconomics package ggplot helper fun makeline functionvar title percent TRUE billboarder bblinechartdata economics cdate var bbscatterplotdata economics cdate var bbxaxistick listformat Ym fit FALSE bbyaxistick listformat if percent suffix bblegendshow TRUE bbxgridshow TRUE bbygridshow TRUE bblabstitle title bbtooltiplinked listname mytooltip Id for linking tooltip makelinepsavert Personal savings rate TRUE makelineuempmed Number of unemployed TRUE makelinepce Personal consumption expenditures FALSE makelinepop Total population FALSE I also noticed that when doing a simple unlinked bblinechart with some example data the tooltip does not appear either and I have to put a bbscatterplot subsequent to the bblinechart to make it appear I hope this is not too much of a nightmare to resolve as those tooltips are extremely useful within a Shiny app Thanks again for making this package it is very nice and I eagerly look forward to future updates Darren How can someone download a chart as a pngjpeg I tried using negative values in a billboarderbauge in shiny and somehow it seems like negative values are not displayed am I doing something wrong or is this a known issue Further when using positive values while having a negative min value only the positive area is rendered meaning when min and max a value of shows only a colored area that equals which is not correct Again I might be doing something wrong If not is there a fix for this issue Update As far I understand it this problem seems to be rooted in the billboardjs library itself So maybe not an issue for this package See Code below libraryshiny librarybillboarder shinyApp ui fluidPage baugeOutputoutputId gauge server functioninput output outputgauge renderBauge bauge value alternatively use instead of min max colors cFF labelformat suffix billboarder bbbarchart data explanationplotdf mapping bbaesx featuredesc y featureweight group churnpredictor rotated TRUE stacked TRUE bbcolorsmanualLess likely to churn rgba More likely to churn rgba Hi Is possible to add tick labels with the limits to the gauge charts Something similar to the one discussed in this stackoverflow thread Thanks Andr Id like to customize the tooltip shown when a user hovers over a scatterplot point To do this I need to pull data out of the data object passed to formatcontents However not all of the fields from my dataframe are getting into data How can I add fields to data or otherwise get the other columns from the dataframe into the right place Here is an example that should illustrate what I mean dataframe x rnorm y rnorm group sampleletters size replaceT label sampleletters size replaceT billboarderdata bbaesx x y y groupgroup labellabel bbscatterplot bbtooltipgroupedFALSE contents htmlwidgetsJS functiondata titleFormat valueFormat color consolelogdatareturn tabletrtddata labeltdtrtrtddata xtdtrtrtddata valuetdtrtable As of now the labels are all undefined because data has group for both the id and name fields How would you implement a second Y axis for values in rd column having totally other scale than in nd Is it natively in R formulas or do we need to pass by API Thx
