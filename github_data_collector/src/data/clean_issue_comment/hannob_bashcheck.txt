 added a c option to remove colour GNU bash b does not do expansion which leads to misdetecting a fully patched bash on Debian sarge my own packages as vulnerable to CVE and missing CVE expand those bashisms to keep compatible and return correct values even for that version of GNU bash bash might not always been in bin Im having a cosmetic issue When run on a blackonwhite terminal at least the yellow output is nearly complete unreadable and I have to copyandpaste it to be able to actually read it Please either provide a switch to deactivate coloring or detect whether the output goes to a terminal and show colors only then so that bashcheck cat removes the colors like ls does In the BusyBoxKernel for instance on QNAPNAS the mktempcommand have no support for the tswitch and right problems to create subdirs in some dircetorys
