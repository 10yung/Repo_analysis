open context menu to freeze a column Reload the page Try to open dropdown menu to freeze a column Result You can see that not only the option does not work it also does not translate the key to its default name Zrzut ekranu o Demo Provide a link to a live example on JSFiddle or Codepen or fill the following demo with your settings Your environment Handsontable version It doesnt seem to be related to any version Browser Name and version Chrome Operating System Windows Context Why is this change required What problem does it solve All input elements owned by HOT got an attribute datahotinput which are identified by that key Previously it was done by searching a proper class name which was a lot less extendable The documentation has to be updated The input element which is created in the createElements method must have an datahotinput attribute Currently Ive removed className checking and replaced it with attribute checking This can be treated as a breaking change When a developer has implemented a custom editor with class name set as handsontableInput this was a workaround previously then this stops working the input element will lose focus How has this been tested Please describe in detail how you tested your changes doesnt apply to translations E E tests It can be tested using this demo With the previous version kbdESCkbdaping an editor didnt work Types of

Checklist Go over all the following points and put an x in all the boxes that apply If youre unsure about any of these dont hesitate to ask Were here to help x My code follows the code style of this project x My change requires a change to the documentation In the relation between the frozen line and any kind of border is implemented according to the following spec Edges with the frozen line We do not render the part of a border that overlaps with a freeze line However if the width of the border is bigger than we render the part of the border that bleeds on the other side of the freeze line However today wojciechczerniak and krzysztofspilka suggested that this gives a bad UI experience and it would be better if we added a sesne of depth That means a cell selection should be rendered above the frozen line when the selection is on an overlay with a higher zindex behind the frozen line when the selection is on an overlay with a lower zindex The request is only about selection borders Custom borders should always have a lower priority than the frozen line Suggested change to the spec Edges with the frozen line Custom borders We do not render the part of a custom border that is on the freeze line However if the width of the custom border is bigger than we render the part of the custom border that bleeds on the other side of the freeze line Selection borders For selections made on a pane that is lower in the visual hierarchy we do not render the part of a selection border that is on the freeze line For selections made on a pane that is higher in the visual hierarchy we render the part of a selection border that is on the freeze line This is proposed outside of scope for Description There is a hole after selection and fileHandle square on printed Handsontable If you

related Operating System macOS Description We have a scenario with several columns where the cells contain an array of numbers IDs For these cells weve created a custom multiselect editor The issue that were experiencing is that the copypaste functionality CTRLCCTRLV provided by the builtin plugin doesnt seem to work with a value containing an array Steps to reproduce Provide steps to reproduce this issue Open the demo see below Select the first cell of the first row containing the commaseparated values Press CTRLC or CMDC Select the first cell of the second row Press CTRLV or CMDV The values of the first cell are not copied to the second cell Performing the same for cells of the second or third column does work as expected Demo Your environment Handsontable version Browser Name and version Chrome Operating System Windows Description During the second horizontal scrolling we lose the right border rowHeaders when fixedRowsTop and fixedRowsBottom are enabled Only the border that is not associated with fixed is not displayed I scrolled it with the Apple Magic mouse without clicking or losing focus That can be reproduced with TrackPad or by pressing the scrolling wheel and moving the mouse sideways in a typical mouse Steps to reproduce Provide steps to reproduce this issue Open demo svgPR v Scroll it horizontal two times Actual result Right rowHeader is missing img width

webkitxxxlarge value of the fontsize attribute for the Handsontable container Once we set it up autoColumnSize does the job and resizes the columns respectively to the new content The autoRowSize that is also applied by default ignores the font change Steps to reproduce Provide steps to reproduce this issue Open the demo Go to this example This is the effect if we initiate the table and then change the fontsize To get the table from point you can use render click the table Go to This is how it looks before in Demo Provide a link to a live example on JSFiddle or Codepen or fill the following demo
