How would you use this if you want to use a middle per routepath Id like to offer an important addition to Alice middleware chaining for httpRoundTrippers We love Alice and use it for chaining httpHandler middleware At the same time working in a router area we feel the same strong need to be able to chain httpRoundTripper middleware pieces clientside declaratively Fortunately the mechanism of Alice can be easily extended to support httpRoundTripper We thought that we would offer the PR to Alice instead of keeping it on our end Let me know what you guys think Thanks MiddlewareFunc defines a standard signature for a httpHandlerFunc which accepts a chained httpHandler to invoke ConstructorFunc supplies an adapter for converting a MiddlewareFunc into a Constructor This is most useful for building middleware with bound parameters via closures Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend After playing around with alice for a bit I was wondering might it be a good idea to provide a Constructor alternative whose signature is funchttpHandlerFunc httpHandlerFunc All my middleware are just handler functions and so I have to do httpHandlerFuncmyMiddlewareFunc before passing them into alice This is not a big deal but since there is also a ThenFunc alternative to the Then function to pass in the final handler I was wondering if there is a reason not to provide the same flexibility for the middleware I am not sure though what a good name for that alternative Constructor type would be since ConstructorFunc doesnt feel right to me type Constructor funchttpHandler httpHandler is used for defining middleware functions and is used as part of Newconstructors Constructor this has caused some problems for me due to the lack of implicit type aliasing on sliced variadic parameters example here the issue im facing is that im writing a package where id like to users to be able to define a slice of funchttpHandler httpHandler and not have to import alice in order to provide them i know i can iterate and manually do the type conversion and im doing that for now but i figured id make this issue anyway just as something for you to consider Thanks
