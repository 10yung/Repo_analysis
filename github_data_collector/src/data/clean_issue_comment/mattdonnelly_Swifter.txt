I want to get userID when using authorizeSSO method so I created a PR referring to the code below why iOS authorize method need SFSafariViewControllerDelegate but if developer used TwitterKit before sometime get confused TwitterKit implementation how I create a internal view controller to implement SFSafariViewControllerDelegate inside the authorize method And handle the SafariViewController event I want to use the features included in this commit But I think this commit has not been released since it was merged Are you planning to release a new version thanks Im relatively new to development firstly Anyway I have made a custom app for my Twitter account to post tweets which works fine on However when I tried running it on beta D c the app crashes on startup with the error shown in the screenshot img width alt src I have an app I wrote years ago with TwitterKit and am looking to transition to Swifter now that TwitterKit is no longer supported However I am not finding any good resources or sample code for writing a simple Post a Tweet using Swifter I know how to create the tweet but nothing seems to happen It appears that Swifter requires usage of a callbackURL Can you post a wiki or simple sample code for posting a static tweet using Swifter Hello all In zachrwolfe brought up the idea of allowing raw Data access to the returned data response from the Twitter API and also adding support for Decodable Unfortunately due to my other commitments I let the PR slip through and it was closed But I think it is actually a great time to start discussing possible changes to the Swifter API to expand and take advantage of a lot of the new features that Swift has since then introduced Currently Swifter works by having its own JSON wrapper that it returns to the client with and does not allow the client to access the raw Data that is immediately returned by the Twitter API In Swift the language now includes the protocol Codable which allows the client to create typesafe encodersdecoders for their data and supports JSONDecoding outofthebox However since Swifter is at the end of the day a API client wrapper I was against having a data model to decode all of the JSON data within Swifter as The appsclients may have their own model and it still means that the model whether JSON or a Decodablestruct within Swifter is duplicated and needs to be copied to the endresult Twitters API could change and since Codable is a typesafe model any changes to the JSON declaration by Twitter would theoretically break all clients using Swifter without the client realizing as it would just start throwing decodable errors Goals Add support for accessing the raw Data Add support for thirdparty decoding Maintain existing API without breaking changes if possible Dont duplicate codepaths Possible Solutions In zachrwolfe introduced the idea of replacing successHandler with a rawSuccess handler that leaves it up to the enduser to handle the data I think this is a fine solution but breaks goal above as we would be replacing every API in Swifter with a new handler Pros Makes it very easy to decode into whatever type the user needs Cons Breaks existing API Add data property in JSON type to allow the appclient to then decode into whatever data model they need Pros Doesnt break existing API merely an additive change Cons Not efficient converting to JSON then converting back into Data To be added Notes There are still a lot to think about how we can shape this API while maintaining the goals for this proposal Ill update the post as discussions happen It seems that the way to go is using the search api with a sinceid set to the target tweets id then checking the inreplytotweetid parameter However in the standard API this usually misses many tweets twarc seems to work though not sure why Anyone wanna work together to implement a way to get fullfidelity replies to a particular tweet even if the first version only works for tweets made in the past week Neither the command pod search swifter or a search on cocoapodsorg show Swifter as one of the results I can install it with the git option in the podfile but it would be great to have it in cocoapods too for pod install swifter Thanks HTTP Status Bad Request Response request media uploadjsonerrormedia type unrecognized Im sending an movmp file did twitter support movmp Im trying to post
