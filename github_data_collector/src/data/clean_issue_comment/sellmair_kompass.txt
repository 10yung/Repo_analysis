Id like to start a bit of a discussion around the DSL syntax Multiple paths to one goal kotlin routerclear routerpushRoute kotlin router clear push Route kotlin router clear pushRoute There are several ways to perform similar actions The first way isnt correct as it wont bundle up the actions as a single item but my understanding is the last two ways are essentially the same I think it would be a better idea to have a single syntax even if it means that a single push needs to be performed as kotlin router push Builder syntax kotlin router clear push RouteA push RouteB push RouteC The builder continuation syntax that allows a user to push a series of routes like this is inconsistent with the use of infix functions as a user is unable to split these onto different lines The following code will not compile kotlin router clear push RouteA push RouteB push RouteC I have two questions Is the buildercontinuation syntax actually useful Could commands just be split onto different lines If the buildercontinuation syntax is useful should the use of infix be removed so a user can split the continuation over multple lines It may be possible to implement a FragmentRouteStorage that takes the key of a route and retrieves the router later from the router by using the key again
