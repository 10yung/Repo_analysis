it shouldnt bower in the snapstore is please upgrade to and ideally build the snap direct out of github possibly you need to take ownership of the snap too to achieve that Currently thats the status

but when it seems about to finish really on the last line the command line freeze exactly where it says bower status resolved This has happened with different components I have installed the latest

tvekProject bower home bower invalidmeta forhomescrapbooktutorialtvekProjectbowerjson bower invalidmeta The name is recommended to be lowercase can contain digits dots dashes Describe the results you expected bower home Additional information The Expected Solution for this is change the default project name to lowercasename of the current foldername ie Currently name tvekProject After Fixing name tvekproject npm WARN deprecated bower psst While Bower is maintained we recommend Yarn and Webpack for new frontend projects Yarns advantage is security and reliability and Webpacks is support for both CommonJS and AMD projects Currently theres no migration path but we hope youll help us figure out one I want to take a stab at the deprecation messages invitation to discuss a migration path Ive tried moving a few projects from Bower to NPM and the obvious problem that I always get stuck on is what do I do when a package doesnt exist on npm Managing dependencies on both Bower and NPM at the same time isnt feasible so Im pretty much hosed So heres a rough idea for how to allow all interested packageapplication authors migrate to NPM Each package in the Bower registry is automatically republished to npm under the bower organization scope with source codefiles untouched This automatic publisher generates a packagejson for each Bower package based on the bowerjson correctly pointing to the other npm bowerX dependencies If all Bower packages exist on NPM application authors could then easily make their move from Bower packages to NPMs bowerX packages without needing to change anymuch source Because everything would be installed in the bower nodemodules subdirectory any hardcoded dependency paths would continue to work as written Flat installs would be supported by yarn install flat Once squarely inside the npm ecosystem applications could start moving away from bowerX dependencies gradually If the mirror Bower on NPM part of the idea sounds crazy theres actually already some successful precedent for this DefinitelyTyped for example mirrors their big github repo of type definitions under the types scope on npm Obviously the npm team would need to be looped in to confirmapprove this for us but its possible Also worth highlighting again that this plan is focused on making the BowerNPM migration easier Bowers future would continue to exist outside the scope of this plan What does everyone think Crazy Feasible BUG REPORT bower v node v git v Additional environment details proxy private registry etc registry Steps to reproduce the issue npm install save
