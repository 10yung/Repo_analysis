Describe the solution youd like I think Its a good idea to refer vendor first if vendor not exist then refer to xxpkgmod Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Feature request Describe the solution youd like I recently released a new golang formatter that shortens long lines and aligns struct tags on top of whatever is done by an underlying formatter like goimports It would be nice to have it as an option in vscode since I think it could be useful for many Im happy to implement the change Describe alternatives youve considered Using the existing formatters The version of

Right Arrow the selection does not stop when all the content inside the quotes is selected rather it jumps to select the whole line For example with the following valid go code content some string here if the cursor is anywhere inside the double quotes and I press ShiftAltRight Arrow twice the selection jumps and the whole line is selected I would only expect the text inside the quotes to be selected first This problem is specific to go files as I dont have this problem with JavaScript files the selection expands correctly Version information as below Version Commit a de ead f a d f d c

bug InstallUpdate tools does not list or update goimports when goformatTool is set to goreturns This is an issue because goreturns internally uses goimports so you should really have an uptodate version of goimports However your version of goimports will never get updated to latest Screenshots or recordings Screen Shot at AM I ran go test several times with the same result although I set go test count eventually removing everything from test and still running the cached content I had to run go test from the terminal to get what I wanted to run There are other ways to disable caching
