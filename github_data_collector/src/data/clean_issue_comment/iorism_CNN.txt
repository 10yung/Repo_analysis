CVPRW to other places due to capacity can you give me addressI do not find it Hi I havent found an email address to directly contact you hence I am writing on Github I have a question regarding the training loss Is it defined as the L loss on the wavelet coefficients or is it defined in image space ie by reconstructing the clean image from the predicted wavelet coefficients and then calculating the squared error to the ground truth Is it possible to provide code for training your network Thanks and best regards Tobias Pl tz
