 adapt UKF implementation to permit use of existing airplane radar models update UKF and plot functions to use state horizontal distance horizontal velocity height add motion type in call to wavefront and shortestwavefrontpath correction in shortestpathmr method types comment correction to heuristic distance check Manhattan distance for BFSDFS relocate Dijkstras case in switch for code clarity updated obstacles o variable references to obsts plots titles tighter axis and legend on position plot D viewpoint on potential field surface map I was speaking with a classmate this evening who was having problems understanding what was going on in the measurement linearization function After an attempt to explain it using the magic of the Identity matrix I realized the current solution was still overly complex This version gets rid of the intermediate Fi matrix and directly inserts the linearized measurements into an Ht of the correct size I also took the opportunity to get rid of the extra copy of rangebearingmeas and the that was hanging around in ekfslamm Causes issues in Windows OS due to lowercase filename ekfm in the same directory Note The kept lowercase file is referenced by current examples and the removed uppercase file appears to be a modified remanent of the code v version with a different function signature prefers diagonal paths This one you may or may not want to bother with The original file was using the measured robots position instead of the robots belief in updating its pose estimate Kinda takes the challenge out of it Then there are some minor code clean up bits to stop MATLAB from complaining Ok trying this again the old mappingfastSLAM has been overwritten with the new files and Ive updated exampleslecturemr fastSlamfastSLAMm to point to the new versions
