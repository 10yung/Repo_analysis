I used this code and compared the results GetIniContent iniPath wincmdini OutIniFile iniPath wincmd ini The difference appart from white lines were in the lines which had values that are within quotes keysome value This will become after output keysome value This is a problem param n param n because standard ini reader will get n instead n I noticed this because custom application I added in Total Commander lost quotes around parameter and consequetlly didnt work any more as expected Servus Im working a lot with python and its parser for config files There are several characteristics of an ini file structure which are not considered in PSIni Multiline Values Indented lines enable multiline values ini Multiline Values chorus Im a lumberjack and Im okay I sleep all night and I work all day which can be easily considered when insert the evaluation of a Regexstring eg s after inserting a key in GetIniContent Interpolation of values It enables values to contain format strings which refer to other values in the same section or values in the special default section Additionally extended interpolation enables to denote a value from a foreign section ini BasicInterpolation homedir Users mydir homedirslumberjack ExtendedInterpolation mypictures BasicInterpolationmydirPictures Moreover there is the oppurtunity to use environment variables as values I have implemented already these functionality but for the last published version in PSGallery Is there the possibility to open a pull request for version Besides these extensions there seems to be a misbehaviour when using redundant keys in one section In GetIniContent the generation of ArrayList overwrites the current key and logically add to this key a empty object of ArrayList I think that behaviour is not intended and can be easily fixed Im looking forward hearing from you This library would be much more useful to me if we were to separate the concept of converting tofrom ini format from readingwriting files since really these are separate things I propose that we create the functions ConvertToIni and ConvertFromIni which would match the existing powershell api for JSON Csv etc OutIniFile and GetIniContent should then be rewritten to use these new functions Pros More flexible More consistent with similar existing PS functionality Cons I need this ability for my project and am working on this Im happy to consider any feedback and send a PR if you agree this would be useful The following private functions need Unit Tests ConvertIniCommentToEntry ConvertIniEntryToComment It would be great if you add Chocolatey package publish repo to wwwpowershellgallerycom document installation steps Write content for wiki Home x GetIniContent x Alias x Parameters x Examples for parameters OutIniFile Alias Parameters Examples for parameters compatible with hashtable and SystemCollectionsIDictionary Unit Tests
