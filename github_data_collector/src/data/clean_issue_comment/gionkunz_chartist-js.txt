Does Chartist have any options for automatically rendering a linear regression line for a given series or all series provided Happy New Year to all Thanks for the Chartist lib Ive been fiddling with it for the last few days it had its learning curve but I mostly got it showing what I need My question or issue is for a chart like this Chart url Is it possible for the overlapping dots to sum up their color as they combine As it is the yellow ones series are hiding everything under them so you cant really tell if there are points behind Maybe theres a function or some CSS I missed or overlooked in the documentation sorry if this is the case TIA Hello How can i install chartist and plugins without bower Thanks in advance Hello I created a fork of the tooltips plugin a while ago and currently Im maintaining it A user of my fork pointed out to me chartistplugintooltip that the website still refers to the old version It would be nice if we could update the references on the chartist webpage To edit the website I had to upgrade gruntsass to version otherwise this wouldnt be compatible with NodeJS I included distribution files of my plugin directly into the repository because bower is deprecated and I didnt want to list my plugin there if you shouldnt use it anymore And by the way thanks for your work on Chartist its my first choice for charting Hi all Does it support floating bars The documentation does not say anything specific I tried to a minmax value as array but it doesnt draw it thanks LM I cant find any issues relating to Org Chart Ive written a very preliminary modified Line chart type called SegmentedLine which allows a user to divide a line into segments based on an arbitrary test which can be encoded in the meta value for a point Its not in veyr good shape ATM but it works for me If theres broader interest I can rewrite it with an eye to merging into Chartistjs or making more publicly available through another mechanism but I wont bother if theres no interest The preliminary code is available here feel free to comment here or open issues in that repo if youre intrested img width altScreen Shot at src This is the chart without any additional CSS javascript new ChartistLinectchart series showArea true axisX showLabel false offset axisY showGrid false showLabel false offset height px Why dose it not fill the entire width I have a problem changing the colours of the bar chat my code below var chartData labels Minor Major Critical Catastrophic series className ctseries ctseriesa data strokeyellow value data strokegreen value data strokeorange value data strokered value Screenshot at As you can see the labels are not in the middlecenter of the slice its a few pixels too high In Chrome Firefox I dont experience this I have no idea whats causing this
