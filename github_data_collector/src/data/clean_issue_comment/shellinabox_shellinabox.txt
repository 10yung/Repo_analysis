the readme for a guide I am writing on how to install shellinabox in a certain environment I mean the browser gif I have just installed this package on my new Raspberry Pi using ManjaroARMxfcerpi imgxz When I start it with shellinaboxd debug certetcnginx port I get config Ignoring certificate directory as SSL support is unavailable Tried on notebook with Manjaro and get the same problem Is there a way to fix this I have a bunch of servers running shellinabox and they all seem to have broken in the last hours while using SSL to connect despite nothing at all changing on the server I havent updated any software at all on the servers so I am confused as to what could be happening but I wouldnt doubt it could affect others too perhaps its some new browser behaviour When I run SIAB and attempt to connect I get the output below If I run with the t flag everything is fine Ive gone through the shellinabox code and the client initiated renegotiation stuff seems to be in the httpd library but I still havent really nailed down what is going on Since nothing has changed on the server I wondered if perhaps my SSL certificate had a problem It was set to expire in days so I just went ahead and bought a new one however that hasnt fixed anything The SNI callback part seems to suggest the issue has to do with using wildcard domains but I cant figure out whether thats actually related to the error or not rootpintoetcnginx shellinaboxd debug port certetcnginx server Version server Command line shellinaboxd debug port certetcnginx server Listening on port ssl Support for PFS

connection to myispnet ssl Freeing SSL handle ssl Removing stacked write BIO We use shelliabox behind a reverse proxy and tried to rewritereplace the incoming url by enriching the url call of shellinabox by reverse proxy definitions This works fine all incoming calls are replaced to the desired route imagine incoming shellsomething will be transformed to shibpathotherparams siabpathservice is invoked and script is executed with the URL param Unfortunately in the script the URLParam is the originalURL shellsomething not the replaced route Due lack of possibility to define additional query params I found no possible way how to transfer additional parameters to the script Any ideas I can help myself by exposing those parameters to the client request but that is something I do because I see no other way currently Would be nice if there is a possibilty to transfer the route call to the service script as parameter or generally body parameters or header info Any Ideas Hi I Merged some Pull Requests together and created a new deb file from my branch For now everything runs fine maybe this is easier to merge than every single PR otherwise just ignore Kind regards Jonny There appear to be a significant lack of logging options The choices seem to be debug several lines per second for a loggedin user verbose still a couple lines per second per user and quiet bupkis with default being quiet How about something in between Like logging a line for each new incoming connection See Additionally the code needs to be updated so it can be compiled with modern versions of openssl see
