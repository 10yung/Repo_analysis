When running in JupyterLab in Safari the latest fastprogress has a very high CPU load up to on a relatively modern machine Profiling shows that Safari is spending almost all its time in loops of WebCoreDocumentupdateStyleIfNeeded CPU load returns to normal if I remove everything from the style block of htmlprogressbar but then of course I get a generic progress bar style rather than one like that shown in the README I am using fastprogress through emacs using emacss inferiorpythonmode and elpy When I invoke a function through PyMC that uses fastprogress it takes over input to the editor until the python call using fastprogress terminates Also it takes the current cursor and pulls it out of whatever editor buffer it was in and puts it into the interactive python buffer My guess is that this has something to do with the way that fp is writing its output to the console Is it perhaps sending characters to it one at a time to write the progress bar When Im trying to run the following from fastai v lesson IMDB notebook py datalm TextDataBunchfromcsvpath textscsv I get the following error optcondalibpython sitepackagesfastprogressfastprogresspy in oniterbeginself def oniterbeginself if selfdisplay selfout displayHTMLselfprogress displayidTrue selfisactiveTrue NameError name HTML is not defined Here are the library versions fastai fastprogress Is there a way to get console behavior in Jupyter console Currently it just says IPythoncoredisplayHTML object Jupyter console Python default Dec Type copyright credits or license for more information IPython An enhanced Interactive Python Type for help In getipythonclassname Out ZMQInteractiveShell In from fastprogress import masterbar progressbar from time import sleep mb masterbarrange for i in mb for j in progressbarrange parentmb sleep IPythoncoredisplayHTML object It would be nice to have an example for file download Using the fastai library I am using a computing EC machine with a jupyter notebook to train models using fastai lib However when I reload the notebook the cells that where running while I closed the browser tab do not display any output Is there any way to fix this Maybe setting some top level config in the notebook to revert to the console output Im using Ubuntu LTS chrome Since end of October VisualStudioCode supports python IPython and Jupyter Notebook see this repo as an example Now running the progress bar example python from fastprogress import masterbar progressbar from time import sleep mb masterbarrange for i in mb for j in progressbarrange parentmb sleep mbchildcomment fsecond bar stat mbfirstbarcomment ffirst bar stat mbwritefFinished loop i mbupdategraphgraphs xbounds ybounds does not properly update the UI thus resulting in this output img width altschermata alle src The animation is now showed in the UI basically Runnable example is here The notebook widget created does not scale to large loss values An example can be seen in the following photo b fdb c c c a a fff
