Creative Cloud screen is normal showing apps But it has been updating for some time and has not gone beyond the I can not install any app until I finish this update When I hit alt I see the cursor changing to what it should be but when I click with the mouse it does nothing In other words I cant use clone stamp and healing brush Does anyone know how to fix that When changing any settings with the save for web feature in photoshop the application crashes On the latest version of the script the menu option for file sync appears but it doesnt actually sync anything Manually starting CoreSyncexe results in a Wine crash When I try to open photoshop Ubuntu LTS Processor Intel Core i U CPU GHz Graphics GeForce MPCIeSSE OS type bit illustrator is working thank you very much Any clues

and failing on getting LR Classic to run on Wine Id be grateful for any help or tips Would it make sense to include noncloud scripts in this repo too corbindavenport I have followed your youtub video and got the following error when installing Adobe DC Exit Code Please see specific errors below for troubleshooting For example ERROR DW DW Summary fatal errors errors Payload Adobe Acrobat DC Adobe Acrobat Setupexe ERROR DW ERROR DW Third party payload installer Adobe Acrobat Setupexe failed with exit code Best Im getting an error at about of the Adobe CC installer Here is the backtrace backtracetxt I have done fix for install error at for ubuntu and the POLwine fix because I encountered both these errors the first couple of tries Would you please list your script at PlayOnLinux scripts Thank you At some point in the future after CC support is completed if possible a normal bash script should be made which would install Creative Cloud to the users existing Wine installation This would have a few advantages It wouldnt require PlayOnLinux to be installed It could run sudo commands which POL blocks for security reasons Once started it could run in the background without any user interaction until the users Adobe ID is required maybe it could send notifications A PlayOnLinux version should still be maintained for users that prefer that frontend
