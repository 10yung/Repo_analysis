version jupyterhub version if used with JupyterHub jupyter notebook version A prof ran into this problem while running nbgrader UnicodeEncodeError charmap codec cant encode character u in position character maps to undefined His Comment That is the code for superscript zero Eliminating that in the notebook brought up other messages superscripts don t work does not does not but greek letters and do work The same characters in the course notes work those notebooks can be generated and released but the Lab notebook not More of his comments John I narrowed down the issue the error appears only in cells that are marked as Readonly under View Cell toolbar Create assignment Since I don t bother with that for the course notes but do mark cells with the questions are readonly in assignments and exams so students always see the original question that didn t appear for the course notes A temporary solution is not to use readonly cells Any help on this would be appreciated Thanks for helping to improve nbgrader If you are submitting a bug report or looking for support please use the below template so we can efficiently solve the problem If you are requesting a new feature feel free to remove irrelevant pieces of the issue template Operating system MacOS nbgrader version Python version default Aug Clang tagsRELEASE final nbgrader version jupyterhub version if used with JupyterHub Not using jupyter notebook version Expected behavior I just upgraded both my iMac desktop and my MacBook laptop to Catalina MacOS and did a fresh download and install of Anaconda nbgrader and a bunch of notebook extensions on each I followed exactly the same protocol for each machine Ive got a directory containing a nbgrader course which I created on the laptop preupgrade pushed up to GitHub and then pulled down to the desktop Both copies are fully synced with the repository and both have the same absolute path on each computer Usersusernamenbgraderp s where the username is the same the nbgraderconfigpy file is very simple unmodified I believe from what the quickstart creates On each machine I launched jupyter from the command line after cding ito the course directory I have edited my jupyterjupyternotebookconfigpy file very slightly setting the default browser to be Chrome making the same change on both machines On the laptop where the quickstart was originally run and the course files created launching jupyter and clicking the Formgrader tab produces the expected Manage Assignments page showing the one problem set that Ive already customized somewhat from the quickstart example I expect Formgrader to work in the same way on the desktop allowing me to manage assignments and grade on either computer so long as Im good about keeping the two machines synchronized via GitHub pushes Actual behavior On the desktop launching jupyter and clicking the Formgrader tab produces a page entitled Error that says Sorry the formgrader encountered an error Please contact the administrator of the formgrader for further assistance However from the Files tab of the main Jupyter page I can drill down into the folder hierarchy and open one of the problem sets notebooks just fine The Validate button appears and seems to work properly Steps to reproduce the behavior Described above Sorry but it seemed necessary for the expected and actual behaviors to make sense Ive been using nbgrader for the first time this term Its beena very positive experience but there are several features that I feel would help my workflow One of the simplest from my naive perspective would be comment hints on the commenting boxes when Im manually grading To explain I find myself repeatedly writing the same things in specific comment boxes because many students have the same error Perhaps for next year I can change my tests to catch those specific errors and make a relevant comment However since Im not aware of being able to alter the tests of a released assignment I need to explain it through comments At the moment I have appropriate blocks of text in a text editor and I have to copy and paste them each time I need them If there was the option to have some sort of dropdown list of the comments previously made in that same comment box in other students work this would make life so much simpler nbgrader version jupyter notebook version Trying to make nbgrader
