Added scrollDirection parameter which defines the direction of scrolling behaviour If not provided the vertical scrolling behaviour will be used Added the parameters for showing scroll indicators of the ScrollView The default behavior is still set to false When you scroll there is a layout issue at the top of the screen The GIF below compares expected and actual behaviour QGrid Bug If you embed the ZStack in a List as in the following var body some View GeometryReader geometry in List ZStack selfbackgroundGradient edgesIgnoringSafeAreaall VStack if QConstantsshowDesigner selfdesignerViewgeometry selfgridViewgeometry Then you get this in the simulator img width altScreenshot at src I have tried various experiments and the best I can come up with is to add a frame modifier as in var body some View GeometryReader geometry in List ZStack selfbackgroundGradient edgesIgnoringSafeAreaall VStack if QConstantsshowDesigner selfdesignerViewgeometry selfgridViewgeometry framewidth geometrysizewidth height geometrysizeheight But this is still wrong because the grid is in the wrong place see screenshot and I cant work out how to fix it Any ideas img width altScreenshot at src The wrong number of columns are displayed when opening the app directly in landscape The initial device orientation is not detected This creates a Tests folder that has the necessary files to create and add tests for things in the main QGrid package Why This is a step in the right direction for the item on the Roadmap TODOs Add unitUI tests How to run the test suite Easy Do swift test in the root directory of the repository I noticed that the QGrid only works well when not contained in a NavigationView It seems to not correctly respect the safe area and cuts off part of the UI that seem to have the hight of the navigation bar Here are some examples of what I mean Simulator Screen Shot iPhone Pro Max at As you can see part of the UI underneath the navigation bar is cut out Also the lower part of the grid is cut out due to the home indicator NavigationView QGridprofiles columns profile in ProfileCardViewprofile profile If I add the edgesIgnoringSafeArea all to the grid this is what happens Simulator Screen Shot iPhone Pro Max at NavigationView QGridprofiles columns profile in ProfileCardViewprofile profile edgesIgnoringSafeAreaall Can you please elaborate on the usage of NavigationLink with QGrid img width altimage src NavigationLink does not seem to be working here
