With iPhone XR iOS CIFiltername CIQRCodeGenerator will crash and the error message is EFQRCode iPhone X CIFiltername CIQRCodeGenerator iPhone X iPhone iOS Expected behavior QR code should scan if it is framed by the rect of interest with a small margin Found behavior QR code does not scan unless it is significantly smaller than the rect of interest Steps to reproduce Modify example so that the preview is full screen To do this I deleted all constraints on it and used the autoresizing mask to cover all of the superview Modify the region of interest so that it appears approximately square even though the view is nonsquare Start scanning a QR code from up close then zoom out It will be a while before the region detects the QR code the QR code is only detected at scales much smaller than the region displayed see image IMG this is the maximum scale I could get the QR code to scan with starting from a close zoom Tested on iOS with iPhone X Hello thank you very much for the cool project It could be so good as QRcodeReader will be able to read raw QRcode bytes In my current project I pack raw bytes into QR code but default apple implementation prefers string results by reading from QR code But raw results are also available via KVP Ive made quickanddirty solution here I just pack raw data against string if the string is available and Ive inserted a global property to allow to finish scanning if raw result is sufficient I can create a merge request but my solution is not so elegant If you give me tips to improve Ill made this and prepare a better solution After scanning a barcode if you go back to open the scanner the still image of the previous barcode flashes on the screen then the preview is reset How can we fix this to where the previous image is not cached and flashes when we relaunch the qr scanner view controller Hi I am using the pod version in my project Sometimes the scanning controller opens up but the scanner doesnt work Thanks in advance Thanks for the wonderful library I faced a retain cycle Im not sure its just for me codeReaderdidFindCode codeReaderdidFailDecoding builder should be accessed via weakSelf Like weakSelfbuilder to avoid retain cycles Hi I am trying to stop camera after validation code Example I am validation domain first after scan because end user may be scan other QR code So if I am using didFindCode and after that I am validating code if code is not for my app so I start scanning again but in this case camera screen is fluctuating Here is my code I am using QRCodeReaderView for custom view readerdidFindCode weak self result in guard let self self else return let url resultvalue let url URLinitstring url if let baseUrl url host if baseUrl domainco baseUrl domainNameco Some Code Validation else selfsnackbartext Invlid QR code MDCSnackbarManagershowselfsnackbar selfreaderstartScanning readerstartScanning So please let me know if I am missing anything Thanks for great QR example First of all thanks for building this This PR makes the framework app extension safe so that it can be integrated into apps with extensions
