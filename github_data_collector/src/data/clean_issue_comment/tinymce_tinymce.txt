ephoxsugars BodyinBody currently doesnt support elements that are located withing the shadow DOM It returns false for such elements even though the element is located in the body This results in buggy behavior for some features such as the quickbar This pull request fixes BodyinBody so that it supports shadow DOM inhabitants Extra characters ufeff appear when unchecking styles on an empty cursor

attached in image Google Chrome release has the potential to cause a significant impact on applications that utilize cookies for crosssite resources This release is in response to make cookies secure by default within Chrome and is in alignment with other browser vendors efforts for Safari Edge and Firefox Noticed tinymce is also using cookies and third party cookies may effect existing sites if not take actions Is there an impact for existing applications using tinymce by this future release of google img width altScreen Shot at PM src What is the current behavior Describe the bug Pasting text from microsoft word doesnt work pastes in the editor fine when I go to call back stored text from a database the editor doesnt display anything that I pasted from word When calling back text into the editor text is being duplicated What is the expected behavior Using a local version of the editor not pulling from the web address using version I have the ability to use to text editor to paste in text from microsoft word and store that text in a local database Later on you can view the stored text click them and the program displays that stored texted within this editor The text should only show what was pasted in and you should just be able to copy and paste text from microsoft word into the editor and save it then call the text from the database and have it displayed in the editor Additional Information I have tried many plugins avaliable and none of them seem to work Its very tempermental in the sense of it will occasionally be fine I have to resort to pasting the word text into Notepad which removes any formatting by Microsoft word as pasting directly from word shows up weird breaks in the text extra lines that are not in word and spaces etc When pasting directly from Microsoft word the text pastes and saves to the DB perfectly fine although there are some weird formatting with extra spaces that are visable in word but I take those out When pressing a button to call this saved text back from the Database if I have pasted directly from word nothing happens when I call the text the editor doesnt populate with any text at all Problem with doing it this way is it keep duplicating the text I input when I call it back from the database for example I could paste in paragraph of text Save that text to the DB that part is fine but when I go to click the button to call that text back into the editor it has the paragraph I saved but then the exact same paragraph is underneath it I have checked for white space and new lines etc but there is none Very stuck on this and none of the plugins seem to work The only thing that seems to work is when you type everything manually into the editors and save it Ive not had any forms of problems doing it this way but there is a lot of text for me to do and I really dont want to manually type it I have also tested this by completely removing TinyMCE editor and it works perfectly fine Tin Tin Version impacted Actual behavior When the editor contains a large image that takes more than the viewport the PageUpPageDown keys does not produce the same behavior across the browsers Chrome is reacting correctly while Internet Explorer and Edge does not On Chrome the Page UpDown makes the viewport scroll up and down from top to bottom and from bottom to top On Internet Explorer it makes the viewport go at the bottom then gets stucked at the bottom On Edge PageUp makes the editor go at the bottom then go one step higher than going back to bottom and so on Video that shows the problem Expected behavior Chrome is acting correctly Page Up makes the viewport scroll from bottom to top then at the top it stays there Page Down makes the viewport scroll from top to bottom then at the bottom it stays there TiniMCE editor is not initiating in IE but works fine in chrome Getting error Unable to get property getItem of undefined or null reference What is the current behavior Describe the bug Please provide

previous versions of TinyMCE Latest versions of TinyMCE I saw Google chrome Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge running on Windows Not work previous versions too In a link modal when saving and when the selected link element has a class that is not defined in linkclasslist setting the class attribute gets changed to the first listed in linkclasslist setting This is expected behaviour but is causing some issues Same issue exists in image plugin It can be fixed in a dozen of ways so here is one solution a new linkclasslistsetup setting which is expected to be a function that accepts editor and returns array of default classes This way we can add current classes added to the selected link onfly by checking for values in editordomgetParenteditorselectiongetNode a href Unfortunately I do not have experence with yarn builds nor yarn tests and am asking someone to build the thing if this gets approved Hey everyone i have a form that loads the number of fields dynamically and in one form
