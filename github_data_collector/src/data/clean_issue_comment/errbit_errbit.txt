I havent account on airbrake just have only api key from Errbit app I upgraded rails to and it forced me to upgrade airbrake from to and now airbrake prompt me to pass projectid What should I pass to that option Should it be only integer Thanks Errbit version dev OS Debian Buster Errbit seems to not support airbrake v api new features From logs it sounds like its related to APM features of airbrake Are there any plans to implement this or atleast catch the exception Client airbrakeruby Ruby Steps to reproduce Connect latest airbrakeairbrakeruby client to errbit Observed Results Exception is thrown about the missing routes Expected Results Implement missing feature or catch the exception and document comptability Application Logs ActionControllerRoutingError No route matches PUT apiv projects routesstats ActionControllerRoutingError No route matches PUT apiv projects routesbreakdowns This is the updated rebased with current master PR of Added two input fields with a javascript datepicker to problemssearch form to filter problems by date range The date a problem was first noticed is considered when searching Example Problem which was first noticed at will be found if your search criteria is to The date a problem was last noticed is considered when searching Example Problem which was last noticed at but first noticed at will be found if your criteria is to The last day of the date range is fully considered in the search Example Problem which was first noticed on at will be found if your search criteria is to By default the first notice date of the very first problem is used as the beginning value of the date range The end value is by default the date of tomorrow So searching for something but not a date will not lead to wrong results Errbit version dev OS Ubuntu running in Docker Step Describe the problem When I go to the errbit interface I can search for the error title eg SIGTERM but I cannot search by the APP SERVER Screenshot at Screenshot at Steps to reproduce Click on an error Copy paste the APP SERVER value Try to search for it Observed Results Errbit returns no errs here Expected Results To see the errors for the matching APP SERVER The link to flippaerrbitphp is broken i think the repo has been deleted There is a similar one at wasilakerrbitphp which might be a good replacement it is basically the same repo but with some adjustments to make it work with Composer a dependency manager for PHP If needed I can create create a pull request for this Fix crash if hash is not Hash for example hash is String Feb ip errbit ActionViewTemplateError undefined method keys for Error happen while saving charge and recalculating totalsString window rawdata prehash prettyhash noticeparams apphelpershashhelperrb in prettyhash appviewsnoticesparamshtmlhaml in appviewsnoticesparamshtmlhaml appviewsproblemsshowhtmlhaml in appviewsproblemsshowhtmlhaml Id like to try and get support for nested exceptions into errbit This current pull request is just a first cut to get some feedback Currently there are no tests but once I get some clarity on my approach I will definitely add them Here is the exception Im raising usrbinenv ruby requirerelative configenvironment require airbrakelogger Railslogger AirbrakeAirbrakeLoggernewRailslogger class One Error ClassnewStandardError def selfrun raise Errornewraise one error end end class Two Error ClassnewStandardError def selfrun Onerun rescue OneError e raise Errornewreraise and wrap one error end end begin Tworun rescue TwoError e Railsloggererrore end and here is a screenshot of the backtrace in errbit using my nested exception change screen shot at pm this prevents a situation where a process holds onto a bad connection forever after a mongo server failover It would be beneficial for some environments to have an endpoint where with a single call or rake task an app can be created with the app key in the response data Ive added badge types that are available for each app Badges are a nice way to communicate quality in a README etc Thinks that I am not so surecould be optimized if somebody wants to help please feel free x authenticated key Ive reused the key usage from the atom feed that makes the token quasi public and might be a problem when the Atom feed contain sensitive info Maybe generate a new token per app only for badge usage Right now we will only use the badges in private projects so for us not urgent but definitely preferable update added environment BADGEPUBLIC which the user can decide which approach is more suitable x Badge Ranges Ive just made some guesses Not sure how merged problems fell into that etc Would be great to make the ranges configurable via ENV config etc maybe later only added smoke tests had not the time to add thorough test of the logic as ranges not sure right now other badge ideas class infrastructure is there to add other badge types easily bildschirmfoto um bildschirmfoto um
