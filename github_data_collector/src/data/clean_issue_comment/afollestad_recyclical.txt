Please consider making a Pull Request if you are capable of doing so Thats the plan but would like some directionsuggestions first What module does this apply to Core Description what youd like to happen Currently withItem requires a layoutRes id as its first argument and a ViewHolderderived class type as its second template parameter View Binding classes seem to be the suggested mechanism for getting typesafe references to layout Views which would essentially eliminate the need for ViewHolder classes AFAIK anyway Would a good way to approach this in recyclical be to remove the need for the first argument layoutRes and add an overload to withItem that takes a ViewBindingderived class type as the second template parameter That second type parameter could be used to inflate the layout using ViewBindinginflate with the parentactivity context Thoughts Describe alternatives youve considered Not many just using the regular ol ViewHolder findViewById right now EDIT View Binding is what Im talking about just to be clear When I scroll the list quickly I can feel the obvious drop frame If I slide slowly it will not The default Adapter does not have this problem Will you consider adding ViewPager support New ViewPager works with RecycleViewAdapter which could be provided by Recyclical library but current implementation doesnt allow create adapter separately form target RecycleView and setup extension method can be used with RecyclerView or his subclass only and this is a very strong limitation Unfortunately ViewPager is not subclass of RecyclerView and hasnt got public api to retrieve it Possible solution is create new class like RecyclicalSetup but without RecycleView dependency Which will set up and return object of adapter Will you consider adding paging support
