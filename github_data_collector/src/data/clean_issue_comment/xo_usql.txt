I see the option to set a pager but it does not seem to be working for me Is this currently supported and if it isnt what is the status of this feature The overview section of the readme specifices that this tool supports context based auto completion but I cant find anything on that Does usql currently support any type of completion and if it doesnt are there any plans to do so Hi kenshaw In Linux I have used odbcDB to connect to the DB instance Thanks for the going an extra mile and providing a Dockerfile for DB instance Can I use a similar approach to connect to Tibero Apart from that Can you elaborate on how to use adodb to connect to DB in windows And can we apply this adodb process on Tibero too Thanks Chakri Would be nice if there was a native way to configure connections to use an SSH tunnel similar to how MySQL Workbench and other GUI clients allow you to do this I know this can be set up manually but managing the lifecycle of one or many ssh tunnels can be very annoying usql set SHOWHOSTINFORMATIONfalse mysql c SELECT FROM items LIMIT C this works outputs pipeseparated CSV usql set SHOWHOSTINFORMATIONfalse mysql c SELECT FROM items LIMIT C F usql set SHOWHOSTINFORMATIONfalse mysql c SELECT FROM items LIMIT C F usql set SHOWHOSTINFORMATIONfalse mysql c SELECT FROM items LIMIT C fieldseparator usql set SHOWHOSTINFORMATIONfalse mysql c SELECT FROM items LIMIT C fieldseparator all of the above return the following error usql error csv must be passed a value try help After window switch coming back to usql window tab switching problem generally happens when some query is written but not executed and after coming back to usql window and using back space key strokes dfb dont work Back space erases multiple key strokes at once Ive found on Postgres dt is not yet supported and on sqlite tables is not working either Btw since there is no standard way to list all the tables in a dbms id like to suggest adding a usqlspecific query that does just that on every supported db The prompt is hard to read Example prompt myunixusernamevarrunmysqldmysqldsock The username part should be highlighted with one color The varrunmysqldmysqldsock part with another color Highlighting the at the end of the prompt with a bright color in bold for multiline would help noticing the forgotten at the end of the command When a partial command is typed in readline and up arrow is pressed it should bring up only commands starting with the typed text see how the Elvish shell does it if usql meet error should return exit or stderr for example xsql wrong sql insert abc abc usql mysqlrootpwd testdb f xsql only returns Connected with driver mysql
