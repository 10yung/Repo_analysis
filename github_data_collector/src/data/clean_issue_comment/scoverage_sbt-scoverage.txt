This PR accompanies After the PR on the compiler plugin has been merged the dependency versions need to be changed for the feature to work sbtcoverage Hey there trying to integrate scoverage with a scalajs project but running into problems after a sbt cleancoverageproject clienttest Im getting info info Wrote instrumentation file UsersnimaeskandaryDevvinyldnsmodulesclienttargetscala scoveragedatascoveragecoveragexml info info Will write measurement data to UsersnimaeskandaryDevvinyldnsmodulesclienttargetscala scoveragedata error UsersnimaeskandaryDevvinyldnsmodulesclientsrcmainscalavinyldnsclientpagescredentialsApiCredentialsPagescala Found a dangling UndefinedParam at PositionfileUsersnimaeskandaryDevvinyldnsmodulesclientsrcmainscalavinyldnsclientpagescredentialsApiCredentialsPagescala This is likely due to a bad interaction between a macro or a compiler plugin and the Scalajs compiler plugin If you hit this please let us know error class Backend error error one error found error Compile compileIncremental Compilation failed error Total time s completed May AM sbtclient The exact line its pointing out is this one Any ideas Hi Team I am new to scala as of now I want to update my sbtcoverage to from When I did so I am getting error as shown below error value ScoverageKeys is not a member of object scoverageScoverageSbtPlugin ScoverageSbtPluginScoverageKeyscoverageMinimum These are my plugins in pluginssbt addSbtPluginiospray sbtrevolver addSbtPlugincomeed si n sbtassembly addSbtPluginiogatling gatlingsbt addSbtPlugincomgithubgseitz sbtrelease addSbtPluginorgscalastyle scalastylesbtplugin addSbtPluginorgscoverage sbtscoverage My Sbt version in buildproperties is sbtversion Can you please let me know what is the issue Also when I navigate from Intelij to the scoverage class its still pointing to sbtcoverage jar instead of somehow I feel the desired jar is not getting downloaded to dependencies Any help is much appreciated I created a Stackoverflow Question As I got no answer I wonder if this is maybe something that is not supported by scoverage at all In the Monix Ive had to disable code coverage via sbtscoverage because the Travisci build had an additional overhead of over minutes so we are talking minutes for a build versus minutes see sample the build would sometimes timeout possibly depending on Traviss allocated resources because when they tended to fail they would fail in a row see sample and note that only the build with coverage was timing out The code being tested is heavy on concurrency and so some tests tend to be heavy because multiple iterations are used The performance issue happens locally too but Travisci is obviously underpowered Is there any configuration I could try for increasing performance Versions used sbtscoverage Scala I know this exists ExcludedPackages empty Reverse AuthService Models Data But I would like to know if there is any IncludedPackages that although you add new tests you should not add it in the exclude to avoid evaluating its coverage The changes which I requested in issue I hope it will be helpful
