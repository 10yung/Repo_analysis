 bsds bsds Hi shenwei First thanks for providing your code and can you tell me how to get the output of FC layer in CNN Hi I have some error using your codes Error using imResampleMex Requested x x GB array exceeds maximum array size preference Creation of arrays greater than this limit may take a long time and cause MATLAB to become unresponsive See array size limit or preference panel for more information my system env is br nvidia gtx mbr gb RAMbr intel i HQ CPU GHz GHzbrbr HI there I got the following error when trying to use the edgesDetectDL to detect edges on my images Error in edgesDetectDL line Reference to nonexistent field imgId Is there any solution Thank you SirI want to know PATCHMEAN means whatHow to get it in my own training dataKindly guide methanks I am getting this error Kindly guide me Dear Professor Shen Thank you for the code I am successfuly run your code I have questions what is the function inside edgesDetectMexCNNFeats May I see the CC original function for edgesDetectMexCNNFeats and edgesNmsMex How about NYUD dataset As I know NYUD does not has boundary groundtruth do you produce by yourself what are you doing with NYUD depth how is the nyud structure Thank you for your help and kindness Looking forward to your reply Sincerely Jan Kristanto Dear Mr Shen I encountered the error File BSR BSDS data images test Thumbjpg does not exist I follow the all instructions given for proper setup and the error screenshot from MATLAB is given below Here is the link where I downloaded the data set which was provided in your download help too Thank you for your help and consideration Looking forward to your reply soon Yours sincerely Ege Engin Master Student in Electrical Electronics Department in Middle East Technical University Contact egeengingmailcom Hello I tried to run the code but there is a error Undefined function or variable caffe Where is the definition of the caffe Thanks Best regards train test line Only for training stage This parameter indicate an absolute distance Pixels whose distance greater than this distance are regard as negative samples line Only for training stage This parameter indicate an relative distancerelative to the height of ground truth Eg if the height of ground truth is and the paprameter is the distance is Pixels whose distance less than this distance are regard as positive samples line Only for training stage The maximum negative samples in training stage line Only for training stage The maximum positive samples in training stage line Mode flag or is testing mode and is training mode training mode shenwei
