if this framework support objc great Ive got a performance tool that similarly uses CADisplayLink to try and measure the framerate dropped frames But in my tests back during iOS and CADisplayLinks callback timing was only affected when a frame drop happened due to slowness inprocess for example if theres a lot of auto layout work My understanding of UIKits drawing is that after the layers are all prepared they are composited outofprocess in iOSs equivalent of the WindowServer as OpenGL Metal rectangles So if compositing is too slow say because you have a bunch of expensive layers with blurring and rounded corners the display link callback will still happen right on time Youll see a slow frame rate but the meter will show I did an ugly hack to solve this that worked in iOS and but doesnt work anymore in iOS and Did you have a way to address this If we can figure it out we can improve both our projects If not you may want to write some kind of disclaimer in your readme If you want to test this out the repo I linked to has an example project and you can add your meter to it Youd want to use the ios branch
