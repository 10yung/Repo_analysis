Hi Dear SwiftMessage is working on iOS and below Simulator After update my phone in then app will be crashed Please le me explain how to resolved this issue Find the snapshort Screenshot at PM I couldnt find anything regarding support for multiple windows in iOS see am I right Would be great to see another SwiftMessagesPresentationContext case to specify the scene window In the meantime Ill try to hack something or use the viewController context BTW Really loving Swift Message Great work Is there a simple way to control the animation speed I can extend the Animator and copy it over and change the value but in doing so I lose the Presenter logic which looks for bottom Now I need to copy over vast quantities of code just to make the hide animation the same length as the show Is there a simple way to a simple change the animation duration Is it possible to make it compatible with Swift Package Manager Thanks when message show on my iPad Pro inch the whole UI doesnt respond to touch event but its OK on iOS simulator The code below var config SwiftMessagesdefaultConfig configpresentationContext windowwindowLevel normal configpreferredStatusBarStyle lightContent configduration secondsseconds SwiftMessagesshowconfig config Select case viewController UIViewController and set duration forever When dismiss or pop vc we get retain cycle Im not sure if this is the way you prefer to solve it but this fixes by introducing a new message type We use CardViewxib to display a pure text message without an icon title or button We set the body labels text alignment to center since we want the text centered in the card The problem is that the content is only centered when the text is long enough to wrap over two lines We can fix this by opening CardViewxib and set Alignment to Fill for the vertical innermost stack view We considered a couple of ways this could be done but ended up in that it would be nice to have a pure text card view for which the content is centered We will add such a xib to our project now but it would be nice if the library could include such a xib as well So I guess were all currently in the phase of stumbling all over weird kinks of iOS The app Im working on right now is not dark mode ready so we overrode the user interface style in our app delegate if availableiOS windowoverrideUserInterfaceStyle light This does the trick however at one place we use SwiftMessages like this private func openAmountPickerwithInitialAmount initialAmount Int var config SwiftMessagesConfig configpresentationStyle bottom configpresentationContext windowwindowLevel statusBar the important bit configduration forever configdimMode grayinteractive true configinteractiveHide false configpreferredStatusBarStyle lightContent let picker AmountPicker view containing a picker view and a close button pickerinitialAmount initialAmount pickerdelegate self SwiftMessagesshowconfig config view picker Now if my phone is set to dark mode iOS will try to use dark mode colors for UI elements inside even though I overrode the user interface style for the window If I use viewsomeView for presentationContext the label colors in the view are back to what they should be as the someView is inside the window defined in the AppDelegate and that is forced to light mode So I guess that SwiftMessages creates a new window for window and doesnt copy over the overrideUserInterface value Now the question is whether this is a bug or not Difficult to say but it definitely is behavior one wouldnt neccessarily expect SwiftMessagesSegues messageView is a BaseView and since BaseView does not conform to AccessibleMessage presented view controllers will not be accessible via Accessibility Inspector or Voice Over I implemented a subclass of BaseView that does conform to AccessibleMessage and set it to the messageView property of SwiftMessagesSegue This should work in most cases Expect where the presented view controller is wrapped inside of a UINavigationController During the install phase of Presenter the UINavigationControllers rootViewController is not added to the messageViews view hierarchy yet and the elements are also not exposed Any thoughts or suggestions
