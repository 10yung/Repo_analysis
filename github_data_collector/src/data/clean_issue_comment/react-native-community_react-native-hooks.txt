 Question From React Native v useWindowDimensions has been implemented to the core repository This is essentially the same functionality as useDimensions in this repo Should useDimensions be removed from this package or should it continue to exist for RN and users Before submitting it please ensure that this was not already asked in another issue or on StackOverflow Ideally you should always refer to StackOverflow first This issue should serve for you to ask a question about the library to the maintainers and other fellow developers remember that even if the issue gets closed the conversation can move forward Also ideally this issue should culminate in a PR to the documentation for this library so that future developers will have that doubt cleared Summary Just simple refactor remove unused React import stop create an object of initial value for each call Test Plan Whats required for testing prerequisites What are the steps to reproduce after prerequisites Compatibility OS Implemented iOS Android Checklist Check completed item when applicable via X x I have tested this on a device and a simulator I added the documentation in READMEmd I mentioned this change in CHANGELOGmd I updated the typed files TS and Flow I added a sample use of the API in the example project exampleAppjs Thanks for submitting a pull request We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes Please follow the template so that the reviewers can easily understand what the code changes affect Summary Added community eslint configprettier and applied linting Explain the motivation for making this change here are some points to help you What issues does the pull request solve Please tag them so that they will get automatically closed once the PR is merged What is the feature if applicable How did you implement the solution What areas of the library does it impact Test Plan yarn lint Demonstrate the code is solid Example The exact commands you ran and their output screenshots videos if the pull request changes UI Whats required for testing prerequisites What are the steps to reproduce after prerequisites Compatibility OS Implemented iOS Android Excuse me for the words but I just looked around the hooks and saw so many bad practices in your project mostly about performance so I wonder whether you still maintain this project or not For example this hook does resubscribe event every time the component renders There is a fix here but for maybe some reasons it is merged yet srcuseAppStatets javascript import React useEffect useState from react import AppState AppStateStatus from reactnative export default function useAppState const currentState AppStatecurrentState const appState setAppState useStatecurrentState function onChangenewState AppStateStatus setAppStatenewState useEffect AppStateaddEventListenerchange onChange return AppStateremoveEventListenerchange onChange return appState This hook creates new getPhotos and saveToCameraRoll functions every time the hook is called It would cause the hook consumer component to rerender unexpectedly srcuseCameraRollts javascript export default function useCameraRoll const photos setPhotos useStateinitialState async function getPhotosconfig defaultConfig try const photos await CameraRollgetPhotosconfig setPhotosphotos catch err consolelogerror err async function saveToCameraRolltag string type photo video try await CameraRollsaveToCameraRolltag type catch err consolelogerror saving to camera roll err return photos getPhotos saveToCameraRoll This is to prevent the usual Warning Cant perform a React state update on an unmounted component This is a noop but it indicates a memory leak in your application Thanks for submitting a pull request We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes Please follow the template so that the reviewers can easily understand what the code changes affect Summary I had a memory leak warning with the previous code and opened a StackOverflow question to solve it I ended doing my own hook based on this code to solve the warning Explain the motivation for making this change here are some points to help you
