This version uses GetItemProperty HKLM and QuietUninstallString reverting to UninstallString if the former is not available Complete rewrite using the uninstall list in the registry and quiet uninstall values provided by those reg entries Changed the code to remove all but latest version had to convert WMI version to SystemVersion for sorting Used a select first to show current select skip to remove all but current added QN and IGNOREDEPENDENCIESALL for silent uninstall other than UAC prompt Im not a PowerShell expert but Ive read somewhere on the interwebs that GetCimInstance should be used instead of GetWmiObject Also you are loading the entire database and filtering after the fact This script will bring only the wanted products and only the wanted columns Ive added Version for further filtering GetCimInstance ClassName Win Product Filter Name like Microsoft NET Core SDK Property NameVersionIdentifyingNumber Might also work for not sure since I dont have it installed
