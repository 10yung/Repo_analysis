classification How can I train the model and test for classification task on VOC and Caltch Thank you Hello when will you open source faster RCNN or any schedule Thanks in advance Hi I was able to run the Pascal detection code of SPPnet and it worked great Thanks I wanted to try classification on the caltech dataset do you by any chance have the code for that remaining Couldnt find it in this repo when i run sppexptrainandtestvocopts there is a error evalvoc line spptestparfor body line resmodelind imdbevalfunccls aboxesmodelind imdb cachename suffix fast spptest line parfor modelind numclasses

can not download the model Hello ShaoqingRen I started the one click script experiments Scriptsppvocm days ago after downloading dataset needed But until now the matlab is still running at the finetuning stageI have a nvidia gtx on my computer Would you please tell how long does take to finish running the experiments Scriptsppvocm on your computer and the hardware of your computer ShaoqingRen can you release the code of pooling layer after conv just like the code in caffe i just only want the C code of this layer thanks
