Im setting the animations here fragNavControllerpushFragment fragment FragNavTransactionOptionsnewBuilder customAnimationsenterAnimation exitAnimationbuild but when calling fragNavControllerpopFragment the pop animation is not working Any ideas about it Currently I use swipe layout on current fragment I want to see previous fragment behide the current fragment Can you support for this function It would be convenient if there was navigation in a certain fragment For example we have a chain a b c d e and I would like to returnfor example from e to b I have FragNavController in my activity When I call showDialogFragment like fun BaseFragmentshowDialogFragment bottomFragment BottomSheetDialogFragment requestCode Int bottomFragmentsetTargetFragmentthis requestCode thisbaseActivityfragNavshowDialogFragmentbottomFragment app crashed with fragment that does not belong to this FragmentManager Thanks for the marvelous library such a great help for managing loads of fragments Itd be great if there was be an option for passing a fragment manager as the dialog parent fm to attach to A simple and easy usecase example is when youre having multiple fragments inside a parent fragment referring as currentFrag like a view pager kind of situation and you need to set the interaction listener for the dialog through getParentFragment method Currently its assigned to the so called currentFrag which has to pass listener method calls to its child fragment which is not a neat solution Thanks in advance Hello I bumped into an issue with the FragNavController especially after restoring the from savedInstanceState and having a dynamically changing number of tabs that the rootFragments count is greater than the fragmentStacksTags so it throws IndexOutOfBoundsException with message Cant switch to a tab that hasnt been initialized is that expected behaviour Thanks Hi there is strange bug if you have a bottom navigation and sometimes when you click on two item at the same time two fragment stacks shown above each other but only one of them working and you must reselect bottom navigation item to get them to work again This is a strange issue Im facing Steps to reproduce Clearstack for current tab and replace the root fragment using replaceFragment method Though the above step works but when you switch tabs the already attached fragment disappears and fails to attach itself Please look into this issue and let me know if this sounds valid hi I have a problem with it Im new in android and I have tabs in a BottomBar in my App one of them has a view pager that scroll between or fragment in it in the first lunch everything is ok but when I switched between tabs and back to the tab has view pager it shows nothing view pager is loaded but fragments in it didnt load what can I do
