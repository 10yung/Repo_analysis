Hi how are you I just updated to Swift so it can be used in brand new projects Thank you very much Hello let me start with this is a really awesome repository thank you so much But it would be interested if you could support labels as a top layer instead of using pictures of text whenever we want to use texts Thanks You might want to consider to add the pan gesture recognizer after the zoomin animation is complete and remove it from the view when the zoomout animation is triggered That should prevent the sideeffect when swiping the view while the zoomin animation is in process which results in an odd looking pop Hi can this be used for cells in a collection view Or is it something you could add at some time Thanks
