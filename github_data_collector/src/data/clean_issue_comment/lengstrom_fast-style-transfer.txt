Excuse mehas VGG net been finetuned in your code Tanks Updated some functions in srcutilspy that had been deprecated in scipy Also made unzip silent in setup sh this make unzip faster because it does not spend so much time printing all images uncompressed Not really an issue with the code but tell me please is there a way to download these files somewhere else The hosting msvocdsblobcorewindowsnet is really slow and file download can not be resumed Torrent file would be the best option in my opinion Thanks Did anyone ever figure out the parameters used for the pretrained models Was the only weight changed the content weight to e The batch size might be problematic for me but its a starting point The code ran successfully on a file sized MB but the output was only sized MB Why Edit The data rate of the original is kbps and the bitrate is kbps but in the stylized file the data rate is only kbps and bitrate is kbps Frame rate and frame dimensions remained the same between them The quality is quite poor on the stylized video I have been using to do some hobby style transfering There I train the models and come up with a ckpt file that gets used I am unable to use that file for this off the shelf Is anyone aware of an easy fix so that I do not have to retrain models for hours on end While evaluating with the models provided in the google drive by lengstrom it seems to lack the file ckptmeta and ckptindex The ckpt file provided looks like the ckptdata of but how can I find the meta file and the index file Hi the code is successfully run on my GPU Nvidia Ti However it seems that the percentage of usage of GPU is low which can be shown as the figure of GPUZ Is something going wrong with my training process GPUz Description This issue occurs when latest version of SciPy is used while running this project Possible Cause Apparently imread is deprecated and is moved to imageio Current Workaround Install SciPy version Fix Can modify the code to use imageioimread instead of scipymisimread Not an issue but is there any place where I can find more pretrained models for style transfer Also is there a platform where I can publish custom trained models Thanks
