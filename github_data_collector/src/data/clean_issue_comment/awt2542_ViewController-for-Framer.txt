Is it possible to have a layer always on top of the view controller hi as title i am using the plugin to create prototypes i found if choosing Switch instant a backButton will not work to take me back to previous view but if i choose any other transition types the backButton works just perfect thanks for your wonderful work Hi there This is a quick note to remind you that Sketch will include a plugin update system It would be awesome if you could add support to it its really easy before Sketch comes out Ideally you should release an update for your plugin while were still in Sketch so your users will have a nice easy experience when is released For more details please check and Thanks in advance Nice work on ViewController Andreas The module makes stitching together scene transitions a breeze Ive got a problem framer slows downanimations lag the first time I add new layers to a new view the lag isnt so bad the first couple times I call mylayerViewonClick ViewsslideInLeftmyOtherlayerView which then adds myOtherlayerView as a child to Views However things get noticably slow after I do that the third or fourth time I suspect the lag is due to ViewController changing parentchild relationships every time I call mylayerViewonClick ViewsslideInLeftmyOtherlayerView Is there a way to preallocate views to ViewController such that all those layers dont have to switch to the View parent on the fly or perhaps you have other tips for speeding up those view switch animations It would awesome if Edge Swipe events are added automatically when a user is navigating through a navigation controller This could be deliberate but Ive noticed that when I create a symbol instance in Sketch which contains a group named with a transitiondestination that link is ignored presumably because framer doesnt import the symbol as layers Symbols given an instance name of transitiondestination also dont work presumably for the same reason You can partly work around this by wrapping an individual symbol in a group and naming that but this could become hard to maintain on large evolving prototypes Any ideas Seems like using ScrollComponentwrap on some layers will put them on top of everything Which is most problematic if it is on a screen that is currently not visible It can be manually fixed by setting the scrollcomponent parent but thats not optimal Some icons typical example is a simple back icon are way too small to be tappable The minimum tappable area on iPhone should be at least x px x Would it be possible to maybe autogenerate a x tappable layer under each tappable element If that layer would also blink when you tap outside anything tappable that would be great
