I create a new Wat project in I edit a wat file with memorygrow and memorysize such as the one below just for illustration module func add param lhs i param rhs i result i getlocal lhs getlocal rhs memorygrow memorysize i add export add func add and on build this gets the following errors testwat error unexpected token memorygrow expected memorygrow testwat error unexpected token memorysize

aliasJavaScriptJSsubvoice speak Can all of the required files be uploadedwritten in the left panel then set the specific options as default then build the wasm file Is the requirement and expected goal possible using WebAssembly Studio I compiled a simple Rust library nomangle pub extern fn oneplusone i The wat text representation of this code is as follows module type func result i func oneplusone type result i i const table funcref memory global mut i i const global i i const global i i const export memory memory export dataend global export heapbase global export oneplusone func oneplusone Please note the line table funcref Issue When I build and execute the above wat I get the following error testwat error unexpected token funcref expected anyfunc table funcref Solution I note that the WebAssembly wat specification has been updated specifically to use funcref instead of anyfunc for table declaration The Rust compiler and the wasm to wat conversion tool wabt that I am using appear to adhere to the newerfuncref spec Of course if I change funcref back to anyfunc then the WebAssemblyStudio IDE will build and run the code Just wanted to let you know my experience and I am wondering ifwhen WebAssemblyStudio will adopt the wat spec as per the link below Thanks Tim Associated Issue Summary of Changes Ported over the WebAssembly demo code of rustanalyzer available here Extended rust IDE functionality with the help of rustanalyzer things like goto definition find usages hover completions code lenses Note that this slows down the whole webpack build by quite a big margin Especially fresh builds could take minutes more Maybe another approach could be taken to include the final wasm binary Test Plan These changes have been tried manually by just trying stuff out in the helloworld rust demo Some parts work a bit less well than on the original rustanalyzer WASM demo because the monaco editor seems to be outdated This could be fixed in a followup PR as it might need some bigger changes throughout the codebase ScreenshotsVideos OPTIONAL example of find usages ralspwasmstudio Ive cloned the contents of this repo to my PC did npm install and everything as per the README file The interface can be opened in the browser But when I try to compile the sample empty C project or any other project I get this message error Task build failed file is null Is there something missing the README file Im doing it in a git bash on Windows Currently forking a workspace just replaces itself with the forked workspace It may be safer and less restrictive to just spin up a new tab so that the previous workspace and its URL are still accessible Bumps handlebars from to details summaryChangelogsummary Sourced from handlebarss changelog v November th Bugfixes fix add

enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing
