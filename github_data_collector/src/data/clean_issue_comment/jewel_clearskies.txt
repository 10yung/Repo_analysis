Is the protocol being worked on any more I note that clearskiescore is now abandoned Make is extremely clear that while file sync is one really useful application of clearskies it is now written in such a way that any friendtofriend application is supported by the protocol Hi there I just found a quite nice Linux GUI for Bittorrent Sync released under GPLv I think you guys might use parts of the code Just in case you didnt know about it already Hi I think you should display a donation option more prominently I found a bitcoin address in the clearskiescore repo but not many people go there and there isnt even a bitcoin logo or a colorful donate button or something to catch the eyes I think this project is pretty awesome and I think many people might support the efforts if you made it a bit easier Adding a paypal option might not hurt either
