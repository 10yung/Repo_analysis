 Hello I have two questions Under what sections the following items should be put in Suppose I need to include the following information in the READMEmd for a web app backend and frontend code Development prerequisites eg supported IDE database Docker image How to run the web app locally eg configuring ports Common gotchas devs may encounter while trying to run locallyworking eg ng serve running out of memory weird UI bugs Would I put these all under the Contributing section or is there some other sectionsubsection you would prefer What to put in the Usage section for web apps What should I put in the Usage section for web apps not including Web APIs There should be a linter after the spec in the main readme is filled out The linter will most likely use remark and remarklint This is the planning issue for the linter Please subscribe here and open new issues for tangential questions about Standard Readme
