which version Yes Electron If youre using Electron are you using autolaunch from the main process or a renderer process main process Can you reproduce this with a simple Hello World example app sorry i cannot If needs be would you be able to provide us with a simple app as simple as possible which reproduces the problem maybe Describe your problem after this I use electron at first i use node x to build our app and it installed in default directory cprogram file in all uses system and it can auto launch However when i change node to x it installed in default directory cprogram filex and it cannot auto launch anymore even i use disable then enable If the path contains spaces eg optIPFS Desktopipfsdesktop it needs to be quoted in the Exec line of the desktop file Otherwise the part before the space is interpreted to be the filename and the part after the space is interpreted to be a commandline argument FreeBSD can be treated in the same way as Linux for auto launch applications Target platforms this affects Linux Mac Mac app store and or Windows FreeBSD What problem does this solve Support auto launching apps on FreeBSD Could it break any existing functionality for users It should not break anyone npm test passed with updated gulp and updated gulpfilecoffee but these are not related to this change I have code in mainjs in Electron let autoLaunch new AutoLaunch name MyApp path

file This will allow consumers of the project to know a cannonical address to send funds to For example Im building an application that will allow developers to automatically donate ETH to all of their npm dependencies that have Ethereum addresses in their packagejson files Thanks for contributing Please fill these out to make it easier The target platforms the problem occurs on Linux Mac Mac

NWjs or Electron Yes Electron If youre using Electron are you using autolaunch from the main process or a renderer process main process Describe your problem after this Since the Mojave version of macOS Apple introduced some advanced security features which prevent autolaunch to execute its AppleScript The Exception Not authorized to send Apple events to System Events is thrown when calling autoLaunchenable Here is an example Is there any workaround I prefer to use the AppelScript method so my app appears in the Login Items menu which is not the case with LaunchAgent Thank you The target
