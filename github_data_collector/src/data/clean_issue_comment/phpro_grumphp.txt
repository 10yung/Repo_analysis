 Q A Branch master Bug fix no New feature no BC breaks no Deprecations no Documented yes Add a footnote that warns about setting the configcontainsfinder to true or leaving the default which is true when using phpcsfixer task on a lot of files See on a dockerosx environment leaving the intersection with the list of files given by grumphp can go into a timeout if configured otherwise it runs for a long time gave up after min We didnt have this problem because we were making our own phpcs config for grumphp which had a finder but with only the result of the git diff staged command and a few pipes and greps Removing this check from the config showed me something was wrong We should even probably thing of setting this to false by default but that would probably be a bc break not sure how to handle a real intersection Q A Version Bug yes New feature no Question no Documentation no Related tickets none Please add an advanced description on what this ISSUE is doing to GrumPHP Im using grumpPHP on a symfony project When using the ECS task with a very simple config file it doesnt trowh any error although there are plenty Running ECS raw in command line works and prompts all errors Also not specifying any file in the grumPHP file doesnt work either Im using the default config for ECS only specifiying my config file In case of a bug please fill in following information My configuration yaml grumphpyml tasks ecs config ecsyml ecsyml services PhpCsFixer Fixer ArrayNotation ArraySyntaxFixer syntax short Result grumPHP output GrumPHP is sniffing your code Running task Ecs raw ECS output srcControllersampleControllerphp begin diff Original New public function index sample array sample Q A Branch siduxpatch Bug fix no New feature no BC breaks no Deprecations no Documented yes Fixed tickets Please add an advanced description on what this PR is doing to GrumPHP Are you creating a new task Make sure to complete this checklist New Task Checklist x Is the READMEmd file updated x Are all CI services returning green Q A Version Bug maybe New feature no Question no Documentation probably When run without a config option the phpcsfixer task would fail with In ConfigurationResolverphp line PhpCsFixer ConfigurationException InvalidConfigurationException For multiple paths config parameter is required When I fill the config option the task is run without error Then I assume this option is mandatory and a default option should be applied phpcsdist seems accurate As stated in the docs the default parameter is null and Grumphp should fallback to phpcs which is not a good practice because it should be a noncommited local file x Lazy loaded no more exceptions during boot phase x Name injected in task x Config injected in task x static options resolvers asked features x Report task label instead of name x Preserve order of task declaration in grumphp file when priority is equal passthru option for CLI commands not sure we should do this not all tasks are passtruable how to determine x Run task with multiple configs x Gracefull error message for old task configurations provided by extensions Can be determined by tag properties x Better
