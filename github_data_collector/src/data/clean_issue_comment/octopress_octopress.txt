So looking at setting up Octopress for a documentation site ala Sendgrid and have a few questions as the README is far from verbose on the install process Here is what I have done jekyll new sitename gives the below file structure total drwxrxrx jerdog staff Nov drwxrxrx jerdog staff Nov rwrr jerdog staff Nov gitignore rwrr jerdog staff Nov html rwrr jerdog staff Nov Gemfile rwrr jerdog staff Nov Gemfilelock rwrr jerdog staff Nov configyml drwxrxrx jerdog staff Nov posts rwrr jerdog staff Nov aboutmd rwrr jerdog staff Nov indexmd cd sitename octopress init does some things and the new structure is total drwxrxrx jerdog staff Nov drwxrxrx jerdog staff Nov rwrr jerdog staff Nov gitignore rwrr jerdog staff Nov html rwrr jerdog staff Nov Gemfile rwrr jerdog staff Nov Gemfilelock rwrr jerdog staff Nov configyml drwxrxrx jerdog staff Nov posts drwxrxrx jerdog staff Nov templates rwrr jerdog staff Nov aboutmd rwrr jerdog staff Nov indexmd The only thing that actually changed was templates was added which is blank empty draft page post files So whats the difference here between normal Jekyll and Octopress When publishing a draft without a date the code that inserts the publish date into the post was not restricting itself to the YAML frontmatter section of the post Rather it would search anywhere in the post for the date and title keys and attempt to parse their values If a draft didnt have a date in the front matter but had the pattern date somewhere in the body of the post readpostyaml would find the pattern and attempt to parse the rest of the line If it was successful it would then try to remove the old date entry and add a new one in the front matter corrupting the body of the post I attempted to fix this by using YAMLsafeload to parse the frontmatter but ran into two issues It would parse the date as a date causing breakage in other parts of the code that were expecting strings YAMLsafeload doesnt tell you where it finished parsing so there was no way to get at the rest of the post after the front matter without using the regex anyway In the end I opted for a simpler approach use the regex the same one that Jekyll uses to split out the front matter and the body update the front matter and reassemble the new front matter with the existing body I was not able to craft a proper clash test for this fix all my attempts to echo some additional content into the draft failed unless I ran with the t flag Im not sure why that is I get the following error when I do rake generate Starting to watch source with Jekyll and Compass Starting Rack on

the next person Im testing Octopress I uploaded a minimal example on VincentTamocto test In indexhtml on the ghpages branch the canonical link reads localhost html link relstylesheet hrefocto

where static site files are commited remotepath Destination directory I was struggling to set everything up so I wrote this up It might fit better underneath installation I initialized a new octopress instance and then within the directory try to run any octopress command and i get the following octopress Usersgreggrvmrubiesruby libruby rubygemsspecificationrb in methodmissing undefined method this

set of files which includes my static files see list of files below cd site site ls a CNAME assets google d html indexalternativehtml about blog increaserevenuehtml indexhtml Note that my entire jekyllgenerated blog is now safely stored within blog which is how I want it But once I do octopress deploy it overwrites this entire folder which also overwrites my existing static files see listing below cd site site ls a Gemfile Gemfilelock about css feedxml indexhtml jekyll Here is my configyml title My Title email someemailcom description this means to ignore newlines until baseurl some description baseurl blog the subpath of your site eg blog url the base hostname protocol for your site twitterusername myusername source Build settings markdown kramdown theme minima This is my deployyml method git How do you want to deploy git rsync or s sitedir site Location of your static site files giturl mygiturl gitbranch ghpages Git branch where static site files are commited Note Once I remove the following line from my configyml source my jekyll build generates that deploy folder like octopress deploy does Given the new Octopress and an existing static site hosted on my ghpages branch how do I deploy my blog to a subdirectory of that existing ghpages site PS If you want SO points I also asked it there but couldnt get an answer despite it getting a lot of attention for some reason date field could be missing from the post metadata this fix tries to tell the user what is going the wrong way fixes Hey guys Id like to store pages I created after octopress new page Blablabla inside a subfolder instead of root How can I change it to make them stored in a subfolder
