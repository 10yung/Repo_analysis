Hello I am a th year student in ITCarlow Ireland a part of my project is TDOA localization I want to ask you a question that if I put all the microphones array as a line cm distance between each microphone I got the bad result on localization However When I rise the sample rate as larger as I can the result become accuracy but I cant do this on real world i am currently doing a project similar to this using mbed system with two electret microphone breakboard from sparkfun I am amazed by the sum of the algorithm that you have derived i respect your work and effort that you have madeBut i do have certain question to ask regarding this project that u have completedi am not familiar with matlab programming and i have not touch on it before during my studyDo u have a c format of the program so that i could further understand on it In your expository paper you stated that it only yields a solution when M To my next question do my microphone work similar when using with your algorithm
