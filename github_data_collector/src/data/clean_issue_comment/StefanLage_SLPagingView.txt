Integrating UITableviewController Not Updating Tableview Datasource Is there any way for refreshing particular tableview controller datasource and ui Hello I am new to iOS development and honestly not sure where to start with what Im attempting to build or how to phrase my question I have a login page and once a user logs in Id like to call for this type of paging How would I go about doing so making SLPagingView once a user logs in instead of in the app delegate file This was working fine until I tried it on an iOS device The pageControl also is not updating where it was working fine before I tried iOS Any thoughts ObjectiveC weak typeofselfweakSelf self selfdidChangedPage NSInteger currentPageIndex do something NSLogpage index i scrollView intcurrentPageIndex NSStringFromCGRectweakSelfscrollViewframe Hi I had to remove SLPagingView from my project because of this behaviour Its hard to explain but basically when loading a html with a combo box select element within it you cant select any option because every time you scroll the Picker View that appears at the bottom and lift your finger the default option is selected though if you tap an directly to an option it works but it is not the intended behaviour of a Picker View Also the Picker View can be scrolled to the left and to the right and then it returns to the correct position but with the same bad behaviour To replicate this just create a brand new project pod install SLPagingView and use this code in the ViewControllerm import WebKitWebKith interface ViewController property strong nonatomic WKWebView theWebView end implementation ViewController voidviewDidLoad super viewDidLoad theWebView WKWebView alloc initWithFrameselfviewframe selfview addSubviewtheWebView NSURLRequest request NSURLRequest requestWithURL NSURL URLWithString theWebView loadRequestrequest Fortunately the project Im working on wasnt making use of SLPagingView so I could removed it I have an iOS app where ViewController is the default view controller The implementation of ViewController looks like this import ViewControllerh import SLPagingViewControllerh import UIColorSLAdditionh interface ViewController end implementation ViewController voidviewDidLoad super viewDidLoad Do any additional setup after loading the view typically from a nib voidviewDidAppearBOOLanimated UIColor orange

the tabs visible This possibly could be my install of cocoa pods is messed up but it is unlikely I am unable to install this via cocoa pods from github or just by refrencing pod SLPagingView i have also tried referencing the github repository pod SLPagingView git I have spend quite awhile trying to rule out my cocoa pods install but i have successfully installed other pods Any help would be
