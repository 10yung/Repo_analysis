Would be very handy if I could save the todolist into a glocolumn of gitkrakenglo Brilliant plugin Ive tried adding support for empty markdown checkboxes which are supported in github PR reviews However I keep getting conflicts with the regex See for some regex x r n r n x It would also requires this to be done first Any tag with a is not recognized by the system First of all The idea to allow tags to organize TODOs is excellent Ive never seen this anywhere else A few ideas to improve tags Currently only ASCII characters are allowed in tags which is a problem for certain languages eg German The reason is w at which only accepts word characters However this could be solved by making the regexengine localesensitive at least says so Do you have an idea how this could be achieved Or what about taking another approach and consider basically anything prefixed by as a tag something like s Is there a specific reason why tags are only allowed at the end of the line More general Is there any reference for the tag syntax youre using If you would omit the from the regex tags would be possible anywhere TODO object profile do this Minor I sometimes add an URL to a TODO for later reference If the URL contains an html anchor like eg wwwexamplecomfoohtmlbar the bar part is extracted as a tag It would be great to be able to hide certain tags in the table view Some of the tags on TODOs in my project are not relevant to me or are only sometimes relevant Hi todo finds and lists keywords even if when are just code strings eg printREVIEW DETAILS gets that line listed in todos Thanks in advance OS Win bit Atom x PS Thanks for the great plugin Hello I would love an option to show TODOs in gitmodified files Our project has many TODOs from various contributors and it would be nice to see my current TODO list as I am working on a task The package stopped working in the logs there is the following error Uncaught in promise TypeError target Symboliterator is not a function at

cant seem to find a way to ignore an entire project folder If I add it to the ignored paths todoshow continues to scan the contents even though Ive added the project folders name My repro I have a project folder processingpy in the Atom workspace Add processingpy to the Ignore These Paths field in the Config pane Subfolders of processingpy are still scanned when using Workspace scope eg processingpyruntimesrc I would expect to be able to ignore the entire project The use case is including a project in the workspace thats essentially a library Im contributing to and modifying but from which I dont want to include all the TODOs written by the original developer just mine in my own project folders I cant seem to modify my On Table and Off Table columns Screenshots below show the same column layout no matter what columns Ive selected for On Table and Off Table I refreshed the todos between taking screenshots and restarting atom brought me back to the state shown in the first screenshot Any other info I could provide to help debug this problem Screenshots nocolumnchange nocolumnchange nocolumnchange Versions Ubuntu LTS todoshow Atom Electron Chrome Node
