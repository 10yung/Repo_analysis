 Issue I have created a custom field via Studio in Project Task Templates called categoryc I have created a custom field via Studio in Project Tasks called categoryc I have filled in some data in the custom Category field in some Project Task Templates that are related to a Project Template When a project is created using the Project Template referenced above the Project Tasks are created successfully but the values in the categoryc field are not propagated Expected Behavior When a custom field of the same name and type exist in both Project Task Templates and Project Tasks then the value of the Project Task Templates custom field should be written to the respective custom field in the newly created Project Task associated with a project created with the relevant Project Template Actual Behavior The value is not written Possible Fix modulesAMProjectTemplatescontrollerphp should be updated with something similar to whats detailed in these posts The code would need to be generalized to pick up any custom fields in the Project Task Template and check for that field of same type existing in the Project Task Some checks would likely need to be added before the JOIN is performed Context This impacts the usefulness of Project Templates moderately Your Environment SuiteCRM Version used Browser name and version Firefox bit Environment name and version MySQL PHP
