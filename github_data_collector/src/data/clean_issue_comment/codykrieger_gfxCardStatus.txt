FIrst thanks for the great work I just got a refurb MacBook Pro and the screen flashing convinced me my computer was toast until your software flitted across my radar Now the device is stable as a rock Heres the issue When I choose Integrated then attach the iPad monitor the checked off item on the gfx menu becomes Discrete while the letter on the menu bar remains an i Heres a movie demoing IMG MOVzip Steps to reproduce Set Integrated Only Run Chrome and open something that would activate discrete GPU Close laptop Wait a bit Open laptop Expected result Integrated GPU in use Actual result Discrete GPU in use checkmark moved to Discrete only When Im on Integrated Only mode and I exit my session I always get a black screen The computer shut off the monitor but the computer is still responsive I can log on in a session restart the computer and so on using the keyboard If I am in a black screen state and start again my session and log off immediately using the keyboard the screen comes back to life If Im taking a long time in the session and log off the screen doesnt come back to life So it look like the way the exit is handled by the application maybe the automatic mode should be toggled on exit to ensure the computer behaves by default Computer MacBook Pro inch Early MC LLA Hi and thanks for the good work This is a minor one but think its worth a look I recorded a

comapplekecpthread comapplekecLibm comapplekeccorecrypto EOF I have a MacBook Pro inch with the Radeon X When I connect my external monitors the dedicated graphics kick on as expected and gfxCardStatus reports this correctly However when I disconnect my monitors it still says dedicated when it is actually using the integrated graphics As you can see below img width altimage src Ive confirmed that it is indeed the integrated graphics being used by looking at the displays tab in About My Mac which is how Apple suggests checking which GPU is active img width altimage src If I exit and reopen gfxCardStatus the state is correct and it will say integrated again img width altimage src Umbrella ticket for tracking the compatibility issues noted in the following tickets many of which are interrelated Sometimes I see my Mac just switching back to integrated from discrete and Im not sure what was using the discrete chip Theres currently no way to look back and see what was just using it Itd be cool if there were a log where I could see each time the GPU switched with a reason as well Alternatively a simpler UI could just be a list of the most recent applications that caused the discrete chip to become engaged Im seeing the notification body text truncated when switching back to the integrated GPU note that the notification for switching to the discrete GPU is not truncated screen shot at screen shot at Running macOS on a MacBook Pro inch
