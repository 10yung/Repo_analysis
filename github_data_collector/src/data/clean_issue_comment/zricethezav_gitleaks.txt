Describe the bug At some point between and the way repo configurations interacted with the base configuration changed Previously the repo configuration was merged into the global config For example you could have a base set or rules and whitelists configured globally but for individual repos you could have explicit whitelists or rules that may apply Now the repo configuration is taken whole sale leaving the global configuration behind While I can understand the need for this I did like having the previous behavior Maybe behind a command line option To Reproduce Add both config and repoconfig to a scan and you will only see repoconfig things happen Expected behavior Have some ability to merge what is in config and repoconfig similar to the previous behavior Screenshots NA Basic Info please complete the following information OS Docker container Gitleaks Version Additional context NA cc zricethezav When running organization scan all values of repo field were empty fille with dot because repoManagerOptsRepo was empty Now when cloning we chck if scan is run for organization and if so dont set repoName which is already set correctly in new version prompt repository does not exist when want to use audit organization Added gosec based securityscan to makefile and docker Issue suggestion Thanks for this excellent project Can I suggest adopting a lintersecurity checker such as gosec as part of the devCI flow The latest scan report attached for reference There are some medium issues reported which could be considered low However there are some low issues reported regarding some missing error handling case which could be considered as technical debt resultsjsontxt FEATUREREQUEST When the repo is very big then the scan takes quite long See output below time gitleaks repopath INFO T No leaks detected commits audited in seconds milliseconds microseconds real m s When I could specify how many commits ie last commits should be scanned would make this kinda scan a lot faster Since version got released the depth option is no longer available how can I achieve that functionality in V I noticed that the AWS example key is mentioned in a few places in your docs But I was curious why this was not whitelisted by default in the tool Ive included a PR for this but I assume youre already not including this for a good reason so you can close this one if you want but it would be good to understand why this is I just updated gitleaks for the first time since around August and using the latest version the excludeforks flag doesnt exist anymore Is there any other way I can achieve this effect It seems that currently GitLeaks uses GoLang regexFindString value against a single line of code That does not seem to work against JSON based configuration like this myUsername value someusername myPassword value somepassword Regexp not ideal looks somewhat like this azAZ iusername azAZ s s n s value s s S s n s Can be tested here I might be missing something but cannot find a way to get GitLeaks capture such configs Regexps seem to be ok while testing on the test dataset With line by line execution we have a single line which looks like value somepassword not enough to make an informed decision if this is a secret or not Can rules be improved to support optional multiline regexp execution Also relates to the following suggestion It we had capturing group value extraction then we would be able to factor entropy value of the captured secret which in turn can be a workaround to handle multiline secrets better Support capturing groups as a rule match value
