Nodejs version to your travisyml If you re interested in upgrading this repo to Nodejs you can a hrefbergiehallocomparemasterbergiegreenkeeper Fupdatetonode open a PR with these changesa Please note that this issue is just intended as a friendly reminder and the PR as a possible starting point for getting your code running on Nodejs details summaryMore information on this issuesummary Greenkeeper has checked the engines key in any packagejson file the nvmrc file and the travisyml file if present engines was only updated if it defined a single version not a range nvmrc was updated to Nodejs travisyml was only changed if there was a rootlevel nodejs that didn t already include Nodejs such as node or lts In this case the new version was appended to the list We didn t touch job or matrix configurations because these tend to be quite specific and complex and it s difficult to infer what the intentions were For many simpler travisyml configurations this PR should suffice asis but depending on what you re doing it may require additional work or may not be applicable at all We re also aware that you may have good reasons to not update to Nodejs which is why this was sent as an issue and not a pull request Feel free to delete it without comment I m a humble robot and won t feel rejected robot details details summaryFAQ and helpsummary There is a collection of frequently
