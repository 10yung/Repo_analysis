Uncaught InstagramAPI Exception ChallengeRequiredException InstagramAPI Response LoginResponse Challenge required Hi I have a question regarding Instagram more than your API I think but as you did develope so much stuff around it you might have the answer throughout your API maybe I would like to know the pagination size of Instagram Related to both Threads and Messages In fact I would like to know How many threads and how many messages per thread are returned at the first request when you request the API for the first batch How many threads and how many messages per thread are returned for each new page How many Messages are returned per page when you paginate a given Thread Also I am pretty sure that these amounts are serverside definitions but would I be able to change it from clientside using your API Legacy Issue Template Prerequisites You will be asked some questions and requested to provide some information please read them carefully and answer completely Put an x into

not find Thanks in advance for the help I know this does not fit the format but as far as I follow the issues the recent issue probobly about the same problem is not getting any updates I would love to know if anyone else is still having the same problem During the time since the api stopped working Ive realized a few things some old versions of the api is still working For instance for one of the acounts I have thats using this api Im still using the old v and it seems to post just fine other private apis python nodejs etc seem to be working Are we a minority with this api failing to work since yesterday Or is everyone having the same issues Can this be account related rather than api related Thank you
