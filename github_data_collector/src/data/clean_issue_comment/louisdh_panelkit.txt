 Is it possible to provide a spacing between the added panels andor the main view ie panelContentView Is it possible to pin a panel programmatically This is what I got from running the Xcode migrator I added a showcase Thanks for this awesome library Hello first of all thanks for this project I am trying to integrate this into my Objective C project using swift extensions as you mentioned in some other issue But Panel Delegate is not being called here is the method I am calling in my Objective C class selfwebBroserVcmodalPresentationStyle UIModalPresentationPopover UIPopoverPresentationController popoverVc selfwebBroserVcpopoverPresentationController popoverVcsourceView selfbrowserButton popoverVcsourceRect CGRectMakeselfbrowserButtonboundssizewidth selfbrowserButtonboundssizeheight popoverVcpreferredContentSize CGSizeMake self presentViewControllerselfwebBroserVc animatedYES completionnil Now I am using an extension to call the Panel Kit methods for PanelManager and PanelControlDelegate extension CanvasViewController PanelManager public var panels PanelViewController let mapPanelVC PanelViewControllerwith selfwebBroserVc in self return mapPanelVC public var panelContentWrapperView UIView return selfview public var panelContentView UIView return scrollViewContainer extension WebBrowserViewController PanelContentDelegate public var preferredPanelContentSize CGSize return CGSizewidth height public var maximumPanelContentSize CGSize return CGSizewidth height public var preferredPanelPinnedWidth CGFloat return But the PanelContentDelegate is not being called can you please tell me what I am doing wrong louisdh Is there any way of executing code when a panel closes I tried overriding different methods I can see in the open source code but most are in extensions and so not overridable I tried overriding viewWillDisappear which gets called every time a panel pinsfloatsunpins I also tried adding a custom done button however that one got removed and replaced with the PanelKit one Is there a way to run code when the close button gets pressed or could you add that functionality I have a view and I want to switch between form sheet or half screen view and on a button tap or on resize handler press I want to present it as Full screen view controller Is it possible It would be great if it were possible to have tabs like in Goodnotes or Safari alt They would be created when dragging a panel over a nonfloating panel I guess theyd be in a bar below the Navigation bar or maybe the Navigation bar could be split if it were only two or so A tab could then be grabbed and pulled back out to a floating panel Maybe even a panel with multiple tabs could be dragged Kind of the way that windows behave now on MacOS when having the native tabs TextMate is a great example for that I triggered a crash in OpenTerm while trying to dock a panel to the side I believe this is caused by PanelManagerAutoLayoutupdateFramefortokeyboardShown dividing by zero Not sure the circumstances that caused this or if this is something misconfigured in OpenTerm but there should be a check to handle this case in PanelKit Crash is below Assertion failure in NSLayoutConstraint setMultiplier BuildRootLibraryCachescomapplexbsSourcesFoundationFoundation LayoutsubprojNSLayoutConstraintm OpenTerm Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInternalInconsistencyException reason Multiplier is not finite Thats illegal multiplierinf
