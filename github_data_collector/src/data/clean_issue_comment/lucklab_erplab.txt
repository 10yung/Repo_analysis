Function crashes with EEG datasets that happen to have artifacts in the wrong place Heres a minimal test example to produce the bug winRej chanRej joinclosesegmentswinRej chanrej shortisisam

PopsummaryARerpdetection feature within a loop in MATLAB but have been getting errors I have the subjectlist and then define the subject as subjectlist in the loop In the loop I successfully use load and process and loop through and save the subjects data using filename subject set filepathC Users ERPLab Desktop But using this strategy for getting a txt summary of artifact rejection has not been working ERP popsummaryARerpdetectionERP filename subject txt C Users ERPLab Desktop And I get these errors where is the subject Error using popsummaryARerpdetection Unmatched parameter name txt must be a string scalar or character vector that can represent a field name Error in popsummaryARerpdetection line pparseERP fullname varargin How can I use PopsummaryARerpdetection in a loop to get the txt of artifact detection for each subject OS version Windows Matlab version R a EEGLAB version EEGLAB ERPLAB version ERPLAB Orestis suggests that in ploterp not popploterp the ERP trace can be overloaded There should be rotation thru colors then different line types sold dashed dotted Suggests possible typo in ploterp Vector incorrectly reduplicated There is a report of bin numbers in the contraipsi assistant tool being different from expectations and manual equation entry Lets check Report Dear sir or madam Im currently investigating selective attention but Ive found a strange thing when I tried to create contraipsi waveform For example I have bins bin target on the left epochs bin target on the right epochs When I use contraipsi assistant it automatically creates nbin target contra epochs nbin target ipsi epochs However if I manually enter the equations it will be nbin target contra epochs nbin target ipsi epochs The only difference between the equation automatically created by the assistant and manually entered is that I didnt manually enter the first line as the assistant did which is prepareContraIpsi Im quit curious about the function of this command and would like to know which calculation is correctI personally suppose nbin and nbin should have the same number of epochs Sorry to bother you and many thanks Description I am trying to interpolate bad channels with the surrounding channels using channel operations I typed in the formula following the recommendation in the manual eg ch ch ch ch ch When I click Run i get the error message Error
