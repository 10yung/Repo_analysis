Are the provided pretrained models finetune on VOC dataset or they are just pretrained on Imagenet eg I am talking about ImageNetpretrained networks after a conv why the feature map can represent different location information why would these features map have such physical meaning This paper did not mention the content I really appreciate your assistance I cant understand about PSROIPooling In paper figure why there is all different score maps i hope to get the cpu version because my pc has no GPU If it run on CPU how much is the fps hope to get your reply as soon Hello I want to train RFCN with matlab in this windows version But I only find the last step code in steps training method and no endtoend code And I want to train on my own dataset So I want to know are there RPN code and prototxt I can use to run my experiments up Please help me How to understand the positionsensitive score map Whats the meaning of the translationinvariance in the classification stage and the translationvariance in the object detection stage How to show it in the object detection detection framework in RFCN Thank you very much Hi thanks for your sharing spirit Do you have merged OHEM into Faster RCNN for the official MATLAB version Could you teach me how to modify the codes When running rfcnbuildm it reports Compiling nmsmex MinGW Compiler C mex g error fexceptions No such file or directory matlab version is a MinGW is I use the model to train my own dataset consisting of classesmanhole cover and bg When I use the original imagenet resnet model to initialize it cant detect anything However When I use the rfcn model it can detect what I want but also its very responsive to the objects the original rfcn model can detectcar person dog and etc What I plan to do is to use some images in pascal voc dataset as background to train the model Do you have any suggestions Here are some parameters I use in training iter lr increasing it will result in nan loss number of images Hi daijifeng Thank you for sharing this project for us Now Id like to try training the model on my own dataset and I notice there is a meanimage file How to get that file if I want to train my own dataset and your train process seems to use both voc and voc if I want to use only one dataset which parts of code should I modify Thank you
