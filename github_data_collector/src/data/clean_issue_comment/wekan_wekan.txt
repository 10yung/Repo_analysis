 Issue I am not sure I am testing the restapi correctly but I have a running instance and I am trying to get the login for the first time I thought I could use an application key to login without using my usernamepassword but I do not know where to find it So I tried with usernamepassword to get the authentication via restapi baseAddress curl X POST baseAddressuserslogin H ContentType applicationxwwwformurlencoded H Accept d usernamemyuser passwordxxxx Unfortunately I get the following error internalservererror reason Internal server error no other message appear in the logs I must say that all of my users are logged in using LDAP authorisation Is there anything special I have to do to get that login Or maybe I can get an application authorisation key from the browser Thanks in advance Server Setup Information I am running on openshift with the following Wekan Version Meteor version Node version MongoDB version MongoDB storage engine wiredTiger MongoDB Oplog enabled OS Type

way to invert the filtering system that is currently in use Current behavior cb If clicking on a tag and its not yet filtered for then the board is filtered on that tag cb If clicking on a tag and its filtered for then the selected tag filtered is removed from the filter Proposed new behavior nb If clicking on a tag and its not yet filtered for then the board is filtered on that tag nb If clicking on a tag and its filtered for then the filter for the selected tag will be inverted nb If clicking on a tag and its in the state inverted filter then the tag will be completely removed from the filtering like in cb Proposed UI Either an exclamation mark instead of the checkmark or the checkmark in the side panel stays but the selected tag gets the strikethrough property Feature request New

it includes using Node v MongoDB x etc There is currently a lot of changes in progress to make all platforms compatible and working so I recommed following Snap Dont use edge channel it has inprogress changes Keep using stable channel in production For example sudo snap refresh wekan stable amend Docker Dont use latest tag In production use Docker tag v that is before major upgrades For newer versions of Wekan test on some separate system before using the version in production Sandstorm Please make backup of your Sandstorm installation and grains before testing newest Wekan version Source

jumps when moving card wekanswimlanejumpswhenmovingcard hupptechnologies Can you look at this I would like to know if it is possible to create a fully readonly role User in this role should not be able to create new boards and they should not be able to modify any of the boards they are assigned to All they should be able to do is view the boards they have been added to The closest I can find in the current setup is the Comments Only role but unfortunately users assigned to this role can still create boards Can anyone advise me if this is possible and how I could go about implementing it
