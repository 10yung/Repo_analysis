 Is there a way for me receive touches on a UIButton that is in the behind view controller while the front view controller is being presented Like being able to handle touches on the plus button in the lower controller here Hi Ive made many improvements to this project First of all Ive imported most of the useful changes from other contributors Then Ive added main changes Keep tracking dragging when moving up instead of doing nothing so that it could feel nature Added customizable velocity and distance to dismiss the modal view more flexibly Added a delegate to check if we should begin the pan gesture to avoid gesture conflicts Thanks When the modal view doesnt have a zero origin bound after rotation the original presenting view will be set to negative frame origin eg if the bounds is the backViewControllers view will collide with the status bar i have a tableview being presented and when building with xcode beta it wont accept any user touch events works fine with xcode ios any ideas on what the problem might be elements in the presented modal controller that arent in the tableview work fine My first view controller is locked to landscape mode only by overriding supportedInterfaceOrientations while the destination view controller can be either portrait or landscape When I navigate to the second view and switch to portrait and then try to swipe to dismiss the animation glitches out heavily Are there any possible workarounds for this Gesture fails even if scrollView contentOffsety is This happens when you started more horizontal pan gesture than vertical And dismiss gesture not started even if you on top of scrollView Current version does not have Carthage support My view controller presenting the modal view controller has the top element with a top spacing of After dismissing the modal view using the drag down gesture the top spacing seems to be gone And it looks to be gone not only for the base view controller in that tab I am also using a tab bar controller but its also gone for other view controllers in the tab bar controller Let me know if you want screenshots
