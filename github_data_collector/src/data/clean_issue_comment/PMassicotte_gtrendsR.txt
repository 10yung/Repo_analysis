Hallo gtrendsR team I want to thank you again for your great job I was wandering if it is possible to extend the list of categories For example the online version includes the topiccategory biodiversity but it is not available in gtrendsR Or is there maybe a workaround Thanks a lot Sergei Hello I had some trouble with the function gtrends This is my code r define the keywords keywordscTrumpClinton set the geographic area DE Germany countrycDE set the time window time set channels channelweb trends gtrendskeywords gprop channelgeocountry time time This is the error I get Error in curlcurlfetchmemoryurl handle pkgenv cookiehandler schannel failed to receive handshake SSLTLS connection failed Is somebody able to help me out Thank you for the support Some geographical codes do not exist in the countries data set For example Madrid region in Spain is ESMD and does not exist in the datacountries Thanks This is the easy fix A more far reaching solution would be to abandon the anytimeanydate and anytime function and use fixed formats or somehow make sure that the tz parameter supplied by the user is taken into account appropriately with the anytimeanytime function my feeling is this may create problems Nevertheless please test this version as I am not affected by the bug I have tried to check with the explanations given in by eddelbuettel Im not sure if this is a bug or not But changing to works fine and the starting date for the data is r gtrendscNHL NFL time yields an error Error Cannot parse the supplied time format sessionInfo R version Platform x w mingw x bit Running under Windows x build Matrix products default locale LCCOLLATEEnglishUnited States LCCTYPEEnglishUnited States LCMONETARYEnglishUnited States LCNUMERICC LCTIMEEnglishUnited States attached base packages stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base other attached packages gtrendsR lfe Matrix lubridate ggplot loaded via a namespace and not attached Rcpp Formula magrittr tidyselect munsell anytime colorspace xtable lattice R rlang stringr dplyr tools grid gtable withr lazyeval assertthat tibble lifecycle crayon purrr curl glue sandwich stringi compiler pillar scales jsonlite pkgconfig zoo I fail to retrieve related topics in any language other than English It must be a problem of my setup and not the package but I have no idea how to solve it Would appreciate any clues Hello again I think a very useful improvement would be to automatically stitch together weekly time series for queries that span more than years That way the user can have very long weekly time series instead of having only monthly time series T here are studies on the net that show that it is simply a matter of renormalizing the series which is straighforward as long as there is some overlap between the two year weekly pull What do you think Hi There is an option when I search for more than one keyword to obtain a compared breakdown by city that gives me the percentage of searches that went to each keyword for the given keywords searched Is this possible to download with gtrendsR I attach an example here Thank you Google Trends gives you the option to see results for just the company not the search term For example I want to see results for Apple the company not Apple the search term Is this functionality possible in gtrendsR Im having trouble understanding results from an orquery When I do the following orquery for searches for dog or cat by DMA I get results for about DMAs with or so NA results res gtrendsdogcat geo cUS time resinterestbydma Seemingly most DMAs dont search cat or dog very much However if I run the following commands for just dog I get results for every single DMA res gtrendsdog geo cUS time resinterestbydma How is it possible that search volume for Cat or Dog is less than that for just Dog Whats wrong here Thanks so much
