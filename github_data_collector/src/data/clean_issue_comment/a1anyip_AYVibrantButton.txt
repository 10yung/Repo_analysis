AYVibrantButton does not update subviews both overlays after device rotation Thus cached and oudated renderings of the overlays are used after changing frame One cannot switch quickly between UIButton and AYVibrantButton Making text attribute instead of setTitle method doesnt help just breaks compatibility and adds work if you want switch between implementations Hello I implemented this library but it looks like certain fill versions of the button come out pixelated Any thoughts on why img width altscreen shot at pm src img width altscreen shot at pm src Added support to nib initialization for AYVibrantButton Enabled pod support to iOS Hi there Pretty selfexplanatory But when I try using the invert style for a button it doesnt work in ios Any ideas I tried removing the code for ios but unfortunately that also removes the title of the button itself Title suffices Is this possible Maybe Im not seeing it AYVibrantButtons are gorgeous but the nonstandard button attributes are a huge drawback Rather than an AYVibrantButton being a dropin replacement for a UIButton users must set the font title and title color properties in alternate ways Worse because of UIButtons default Auto Layout behavior I end up having to set these attributes in BOTH the AYVibrantButton ways and the UIButton ways in order to get proper sizing behavior I end up with code like this screen shot at pm It would be great if AYVibrantButton pulled these properties from the UIButtons standard implementation rather than providing its own alternate properties
