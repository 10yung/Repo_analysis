I cannot use now dev or now to run my application anymore as it doesnt seem to respect a previously working tspath setting which aliases to src for a createreactapp Is there an example of a working setup anywhere for Nows current environment usrlib now npm tsnode typescript typescriptlanguageserver nownode How do I deploy an app that uses express None of the tutorials online work Whenever I try deploying an express app it gets stuck at the Queued step Moved from zeitnextjs Describe the bug When I run my Nextjs app with now dev after a while on the order of minutes definitely less than an hour my requests to it will stop working How to reproduce The original reporter provided this Im not sure how to isolate this one It happens all the time with this project but its not an easy thing to get running for reproduction Run now dev Work on the app making changes to files saving and watching them hot reload in the browser Eventually one of these changes will try to reload and will get stuck The onpage indicator for a page compiling will be there and keep spinning continuously Trying to refresh the page just causes the browser to try to load the page until it times out When I give up I can hit CtrlC to try to kill the server but if its in this state it can take a minute or two to actually get the message and quit I encounter the same issue on a different private repo Changing even css in styledjsx can block the server Since ctrlc is so slow to answer I ctrlz then kill then restart now dev Expected behavior Continuing to make changes should keep working and trigger refreshes in the browser System information original reporters OS macOS Catalina though I think this happened before upgrading too Browser if applies Ive seen in both Chrome and Safari Version of Nextjs has happened in earlier versions of Next as well Version of Now CLI OS Ubuntu Browser both chrome and firefox trigger the issue Version of Nextjs Version of Now cli the problem has started since we upgraded to nextjs Additional context The issue disappears if we run next dev directly Hi Could you elaborate on your plans to deprecate builds in the nowjson config file What will happen to existing projects with complex monorepo style setups Thanks Please could you create or modify the existing a Nuxtjs example that supports universal mode with SSR Thanks When you use now dns in scripts there are summary lines that cant easily be redirected or muted In some cases this makes it hard to create nice output Would be great if one could suppress these with an option sh now dns ls Records found under username s Developing this app in svelte using parceljs for bundling Also have serverless functions running now dev works fine with routing but once deployed and reload on a route other than I get a page and not entirely sure what the nowjson should look like Whenever I make a new deployment by means of a git commit or via the now cli the build process will take the gatsby cache folder into account At the start of the build process it will show something like this Build runtime installed ms Build cache found MB files Build cache unpacked ms Installing dependencies However when I use a deploy hook the cache is not taken into account The lines build cache found and build cache unpacked are never printed I reproduced this behaviour by creating a new gatsby repository following the steps described in the docs Whenever I made a regular commit simply modifying the README file the cache was used when I used a deploy hook the cache was not used Side note for some reason the build actually failed when making a new commit but that is unrelated to this issue I noticed the same behaviour in other projects without failing builds Currently this instruction does not work unless manually specify the runtime I thought it would be just src indexjs which index moduleexports a function that gets a Probot instance But its not exactly that way I also switched to src packagejson where I have nowstart which runs the probot but seems to not work
