Fantastic git Im wondering if anyone has tried to capture and analyse the CSI data in realtime using this extractor Ive seen people successfully do it with this approach though cant see anything on this git about it My guess is if sticking to the original approach youd somehow have to feed back the constantly updating pcap file from the Nexus to the computer and then adjust the Matlab code to somehow constantly run the updated file Many thanks for anyones thoughts Hi I have the trouble with the collected CSI data from Nexus phone My CSI data is scattering some subcarrierss signals are onoff suddenly There are unchanged subcarriers and I compared that result with the provided sample files experiment coutside The patterns are totally different the sample files are very stable consistent My router is TPlink AC router channel GHz MHz The filter is set for Beacon Frames x What is the problem here Does Nemon work with any type of WiFi router or I have to use Nexus one as the transmitter one as the receiver like the sample files Thank you so much for your help Hey I wanted to know how I can useport this tool for my Raspberry Pi Zero so that CSi Extraction could be done for my project matthiasseemoo had a paper on Nexmon from Wintech but that paper couldnt be found anywhere This was the link which was provided everywhere but it doesnt exist If anybody was able to port this tool to another device it would really help me if you could share what and how I could do it for the Raspberry Pie Zero Diving into the data a bit im seeing that only about a quarter of the UDP payload data is changing from packet to packet Seems strange AP is on channel init string was echo cd ffffffffffffb fbe e xxd r p base pcap attached I sniffed the UDP traffic with tcpdump dumped to a file adb pulled that mon pcapzip r array dtypeint Everything appears to build fine on Bionic but the resulting firmware doesnt appear to work I managed to build under a Docker Xenial environment after hitting a fair number of missing dependencies buildessential file vim bison flex maybe one or two others Its a bear getting adb working from inside a container but ultimately copying fwbin to vendorfirmware via the host worked The failed image does something wonky too wlan stays down even after backup restoration and power cycle Need to return to a full backup Could use slightly less opaque ioctl syntax Hello After we complete the installation when we execute nexutil s l b vZNABAIAAAADcIWoPIF such a error nexdriverio error occurred We dont know what went wrong Could you give us some advice We would appreciate your help very much Looking forward to your reply Hello I am not sure how to define the first bytes d of d ffffffffffff Ive tried to enable all of the bits with ffff but the results of tcpdump does not contain CSI information Thank you Hello I have implemented this patch on the Nexus to extract CSI on Channel of the GHz band Currently the beacon frame of the router can be seen which occurs at ms increments I am inside with no known connections to the router Will extracting CSI from this frame be too fast for the firmware Router Sagemcom c d I have attached two files one showing the beaconing of the router and another with CSI output of the channel at a different time It looks like somehow the filter I applied cd ffffffffffff c d was rotated for the packets that did not output properly Any and all help would be appreciated Thank you datatargz hello Since the nexmon framwork can support raspberry pi bcm a so is there any chance that we can extract channel state information on raspberry pi bcm a Hello under the nexmon framework you continued to do a tool to extract CSI However there are a few things Id like to learn I have read the source code of UCODE and there is no hint of CSI how do you know where is CSI Can all BCM wifi SoCs extract the CSI of OFDM Where is the CSI address in D core Are all BCM SoCs the same Whats the CSI address of different antennas
