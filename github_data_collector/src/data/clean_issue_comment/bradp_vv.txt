I create a site but no URL is being written to vvvcustomyml I have to manually add the repo and URL to the file then run vagrant provision to get everything working Is there something Im missing It could be likely as Im incredibly new to VVV When I run vv create it is emptying the contents of my Vagrantfile and creating an empty Vagrantfilebackup this leads to vagrant provision There are errors in the configuration of this machine Please fix the following errors and try again vm A box must be specified Hello First of all sorry for my English I trie to import db frome file and wpcontent from Gitlab when create a new project with vv create I modified vv file to import wpcontent to a specific folder and define WPCONTENTDIR WPCONTENTURL constants Everything works fine db and wpcontent are imported but the problem is in the db the actionplugins and currenttheme options in wpoptions table are reset I need to activate my theme manually and reactivate all the plugins Its a problem because I lose some plugins configurations Maybe I do something wrong but I dont know what Thanks for your help Hi As everybody knows every time we turn vagrant onoff as well as creatingremoving projects it goes through all sites and databases makes DB backups etc Therefore when you have sites with huge databases its taking minutes to handle all that stuff So Im wondering if there is a way to throw some sites out of that process without removing them completely Maybe rename a project folder or a config file somewhere by suffixing it with off for example It would be super helpful Thanks PS Sorry if its a wrong product to open a new issue I just migrated my vvv installation to an external drive Now when I create a new site using vv create everything works but it does not appear to be updating the etchosts file I initially tried to access my new site and received the error ERRICANNNAMECOLLISION I checked the etchosts file and the newsitedev was not listed so I copied one of the other vagrant entries for the new site and now it works Any ideas how to fix so I dont have to manually edit my hosts file each time I create a new site ubuntu vv version vagrant VirtualBox terminal output default

HTTPS which will end up causing a few headaches for people Ive been trying to figure out how to use vv to change the URL created on initial vv create but havent come across a way to do it yet I know that Ill have to go searchreplace the database separately but I cant get Vagrant to accept my changes to the two nginx conf files Ive found with my dev URLs So two questions arise from this Is there an ability to change the URL through VV or through another route Are we going to get an update where the default wordpress installs and future default installs are not setup at dev This one doesnt need to be answered just more something to think about Thanks I tried many times to execute the file under vagrant SSH but couldnt run chmod x vvvinitsh and then run it again and no reponse at all vv
