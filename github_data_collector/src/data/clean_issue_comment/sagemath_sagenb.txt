See the discontinuation notice for BeautifulSoup at and see the new project that is apparently not used anywhere Im trying to package this for nixos and there were concerns raised about apparently unmaintained dependencies Would you mind commenting on those if you plan to remove or replace them and if you think the concerns raised are valid pythonopenid dependency of flaskopenid not python ready apparently open vulnerabilities not updated in years not released in FRidh suggested making that dependency optional is that feasible flaskoldessions similarly not updated in years tests failing Misc The main maintainer of python packages in nixpkgs would also like to reduce the dependencies on flask extensions in general if that is possible In a sagedevel post on December David Cousens suggests the menu section of sagenb worksheets should be made nonscrolling leaving only the part with cells to be scrollable He observes I find myself often scrolling back through a large page to reach the menu and then having to scroll back to where I was in the worksheet In the same discussion KarlDieter Crisman notes that the suggested behaviour is the one available in CoCalc Sage worksheets sagews and Jupyter notebook worksheets ipynb Currently the upload of data files via the Data Upload interface produces an error The relevant portion from the server standard error is attached erroruploadtxt More later One gets Internal server error also reported on sagedevel and on asksagemathorg A workaround is to upload individual sws files ie Sagenb notebook files If I manage Users from the Admin account I get an Internal Server error when I delete users or suspend users Anyway the users are deleted or suspended in the notebook gui but the directories are not deleted Can I delete the user symlinks and user directories manually Whats wrong with my installation I configured sagenotebook server with apache as https proxy I have this running quite a time now Now I realized that some requests from the notebook try to get a page with http I assume its hardcoded somewhere So for a working notebook it is not sufficent to open port in the firewall only It is also necessary to open port as well So if I watch packets from time to time I get not only encrypted packets but also some http requests It seems that they happen for example if the worksheet list of a user is called GET homeanyuser or GET pub or GET logout Has anyone an idea how to solve this Maybe in locallibpython sitepackagessagenbflaskversionworksheetpy the line addr httpsshomes if not gnotebooksecure else s could be responsible for that But starting noteboook with secureTrue doesnt work and should not be used together with apache as https proxy I think If I alter the line no change in behavoiur Any Ideas Thanks See There could be a checkbox system perhaps with a check all button for granting user management things like deletion
