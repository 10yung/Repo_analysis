Added an additional function disableuacwin that disables UAC on Windows and above VMs This allows for more activity within the VM without UAC blocking attempts The function takes the VM name as an argument The goal here is to make something that might be more graceful and comprehensive than the present solution of registering ievmsbat as a scheduled task to run ondemand with schtasksexe This would enable cleaner implementation of additional VM software installs with the additional benefit that when used for malware analysis the UAC feature wont block execution priv escalation so more data collection is possible This includes two commits that Ive consistently had to make to my environments Attempt to fix issue where drive letters in copytovm are different than the windows configurations and also fix the case where the control ISO wont boot in the VM because the DVD is not always the first boot device Ive had several issues getting it installed and installing an IE vm I had to use homebrew to install VirtualBox and unar now Im here curl s env IEVMSVERSIONS bash Checking for VirtualBox Checking for Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack Pack no Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack

installing IE and plus its not working not available Hello I dont expect this to get merged but I wanted to fix the lingering issues with ievmssh that I have been manually patching as I need and I figured it would be beneficial to others I wanted to bump version to but I realized that theres a dependency on the releases for ievmscontrol iso that I have no control over I removed WinXP VMs from the downloader however I added a link in README for a Windows XP mode for Windows machines which should prove helpful This is working with VBoxManage version r There is an API that MS Dev site that contains links to latest VM for given platform GET Its would be a nice feature if bash script could give that link from this API It would appear this repo is idle or abandoned If you know of a working versionfork of this repo please point it out to everyone Currently this script doesnt work and none of the forks work either I see more than a small amount of refactoring ahead to make the current download URLs via IE on win IE on win IE on win IE on win md f ab c cf b ead IE on Win MSEDGE on Win x Stable MSEDGE on Win x Preview work with the existing download code if os Win then url VirtualBoxzip else url IEversionosForWindowsVirtualBoxzip fi At which point Im forced to wonder if now isnt a good time to refactor the whole script Help me get IE running on my machine I have Virtual
