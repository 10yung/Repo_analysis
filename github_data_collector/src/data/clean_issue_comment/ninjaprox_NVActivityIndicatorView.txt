This has been requested before See Is there a means for tuning the animation speed I tried the layerspeed but that stopped the animation Any ideas Thanks Wellington Made this small fix to get this working in Xcode We are using Carthage and we couldnt deploy our project because NVActivityIndicatorView and the extension had same bundle identifier import UIKit import NVActivityIndicatorView import Foundation class Loading UIViewController NVActivityIndicatorViewable func startProgress let size CGSizewidth height let color UIColorblue let type NVActivityIndicatorTypeballScale let message Loading startAnimatingsize messagemessage typetype colorcolor func stopProgress selfstopAnimating Want to add a rectanglesquare view below indicator view to stop blending it into my views background design and I dont want to use full screen background to hide the design I have used UIColorwhitewithAlphaComponent as background color Let me know if you need screenshot This adds support for SwiftPM manifest based dependency managers Specifically this adds support for installing via Accio but will probably also work with SwiftPM once its integrated into Xcode Please note that this project is part of Accios official integration tests within the Demo project Hi is it possible to set up the NVActivityInidicatorView with gradient color For now initialiser looks like this initframe CGRect type NVActivityIndicatorType nil color UIColor nil padding CGFloat nil but maybe theres some trick that could be done to achieve gradient color instead of one color If its not possible it could be feature added at some point With the new Xcode update I cannot archive an application that has the NVActivityindicatorview and the extension version of the framework both installed using cocoa pods I have tried changing the Product and Module name in Build Settings for the Extension target so that it is unique but the only fix that works is changing to the Legacy Build System Error message is below Multiple commands produce UsersLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataBuildIntermediatesnoindexArchiveIntermediatesSkadaddleIntermediateBuildFilesPathUninstalledProductsiphoneosNVActivityIndicatorViewframework Target NVActivityIndicatorView has create directory command with output UsersLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataBuildIntermediatesnoindexArchiveIntermediatesIntermediateBuildFilesPathUninstalledProductsiphoneosNVActivityIndicatorViewframework Target NVActivityIndicatorViewAppExtension has create directory command with output UsersLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataBuildIntermediatesnoindexArchiveIntermediatesIntermediateBuildFilesPathUninstalledProductsiphoneosNVActivityIndicatorViewframework Hi I created an update to include the possibility for a custom animation this is based on the pullrequest by nicoaldegheri please have a look and let me know what you think Hello I try to load NVActivityIndicatorView in UIWindow I have created Singleton class and get reference of UIWindow then show indicator method in Singleton class However I call show display indicator in UIWindow from Singleton class
