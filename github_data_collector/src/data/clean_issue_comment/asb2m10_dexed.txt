Some users are confused because virus total said it could be a virus There are quite a number of available sysex files online which have high bytes in the middle of their sysex data erroneously Typically this isnt garbled data just data with the high bit set for no reason Dexed cant parse these correctly I attach one example Consider the patch SYNCLAVIER or as Dexed puts it SY C A VE R whose parameters and name Dexed interprets hillariously incorrectly This is an easy fix Dexed just needs to strip out all high bits between the F and F then parse from there BANK SYXzip The CC mapping works well but there arent enough CCs to map all the individual controls I am using a custom MIDI controller with lots of controls How easy would it be to add mapping support for RPNs or NRPNs instead of CCs There are hundreds of these available so each Dexed control could then be individually mapped Hello there Just wanted ask for a slight modif On the parameter window Foot and Breath labels have been inverted Would anyone change the line code for the labels to be at their proper place If I were able to do it I would But in terms of programming Im totally disabled Have a nice day Thierry Hey so I saw that someone released an iOS version of dexed Seeing that the original is licensed under the GPLv and that the App Store is not compatible with it I thought Id reach out and let you know If Ardours audio engine is allowed to run with realtime priority opening the Dexed GUI causes a massive wave of buffer underruns This state even prevail after closing the GUI again and requires an Ardour restart to recover Drastically increased ALSA buffers eg ms instead of ms mitgate this problem but this renderes realtime scheduling useless and leads to unacceptable latency Revoking the realtime priority remedies this problem but requires ms latency on my system for reliable audio My guess is that some GUI related operations accidentally take place in Dexeds audio processing loop that would be called by Ardours realtime DSP thread Can anybody confirm this I saw the TODO item on portamento and I implemented something It has a formula based on measurements I did quite long ago on Yamaha SY portamento delays DX may or may not have used identical values I dont know DX this should be checked Its the kind of operation obtained when portamento is configured in poly mode It implements the CC and While browsing through patches and carts I figured it would be very convenient for the computer keyboard to remain focussed on the onscreen MIDI keyboard component so that I could play notes as I clicked through patches So Ive added this functionality as well as a toggle to configure it on and off It was mostly for myself but I figured that others might find it useful too Please let me know if you require any changes DexedParameterDialog I usually use the Dexed standalone on manjaro linux xfce Using it as a plugin with Ardour seems to be utterly impossible as it will crash randomly when used with other plugins In that case I dont even know whether the fault lies with Ardour or Dexed To get to the main point the Dexed standalone crashes when I enable or disable MIDI channels in the options menu In my case I have set up ALSA MIDI through ports I use several instances of Dexed for different instrument parts so each instance needs to receive on a different MIDI through port However when enabling and disabling ports Dexed frequently crashes or simply ignores the settings and listens on ports it shouldnt be listening on while ignoring the relevant ones Sorry for sounding a bit annoyed but the constant crashes are super frustrating if they continue to get in the way when trying to make music Just leaving this here for any good soul who would like to try their hands at it From Wikipedia MIDI Polyphonic Expression MPE is a method of using MIDI that enables pitch bend and other dimensions of expressive control to be adjusted continuously for individual notes MPE works by assigning each note to its own MIDI channel so that particular messages can be applied to each note individually Instruments like the Continuum Fingerboard Linnstrument ROLI Seaboard and Eigenharp let users control pitch timbre and other nuances for individual notes within chords A growing number of soft synths and effects are also compatible with MPE as well as a few hardware synths Here is Roger Linns explanation on why MPE was needed Here is the MIDI Associations article with a link to the technical specification free registration required to download it The specification goes to great lengths to describe zones master channels and other concepts so I think its an essential resource for anybody interested in implementing this Im thinking about getting one of these fancy new controllers and Id love to use Dexed with it Unfortunately I did some tests in Bitwig and I couldnt get pernote pitch bend to work no matter how I set up the MIDI channels or MPE settings Its probably something that needs to be addressed in Dexeds code
