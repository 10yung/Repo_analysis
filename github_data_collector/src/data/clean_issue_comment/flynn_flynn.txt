tried a restart also tried installing cert to different keychain also tried Safari also tried Firefox with own cert manager I am currently trying to build a repository that involves buildpacks herokupython and herokunodejs In the terminal it seems to skip python build process and try to run Procfile using NodeJS pack My buildpacks file Output of flynn log i I seem to be getting error when doing flynnhost collectdebuginfo Is it required in order to debug this PS I have tried both Heroku and Dokku they worked alright I am trying to get it work for Flynn Apple now enforces its requirements for trusted certificates Requirements for trusted certificates in iOS and macOS As such macOS users are unable to access the Flynn Dashboard with a Your connection is not private error in Chrome or untrusted certificate in Safari For example NETERRCERTREVOKED img width altScreen Shot at am src I have any idea about to solve this error clean installation running flynnhost bootstrap

import file myapptar optionally name myapp and the database in the app wont restore as the db expects the extensions to be installed In our case its looking for genrandomuuid from pgcrypto I can get around this manually by restoring the app then installing the extensions manually and then running flynn c mycluster a myapp pg restore f myappdump But is it possible for the import command to be aware of pg extensions and install as required before restoring the database update It is possible that this n public in the pgrestore in file clipggo will only restore objects that are in the named schema public and like its sibling option in pgdump does not include any extensions update confirmed But by adding this prior to the pgrestore it will restore extensions pgrestore l myappdump grep i

Currently log management little bit unclear After using flynn couple of months dashboard got frozen when we try to access to logs Is there any improvement on roadmap for log management and dashboard UI Thanks for all the hardwork titanous
