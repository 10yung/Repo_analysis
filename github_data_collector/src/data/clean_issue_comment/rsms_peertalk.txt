I try to find way to launch peertalk ios with linux server backend I try to understand is there any way to replace peertalk mac os with usbmuxd libimobiledevice Can I ask for some hint I am trying to make an HDMI iPad application Ideally the configuration would go as follows HDMI converter USBC iPad decode HDMI data into video Preferably Id only need to use oneway communication I dont care for the iPad to respond to the HDMI provider unless thats necessary Is it possible to instead of PeerTalk just PeerListen My app suite connects WindowsMac with iOS and Im trying to use unified communication protocol Apparently I cannot use PeerTalk directly on Windows So Id love to strip off everything but the usbmuxb service features of PeerTalk codebase just to ensure that a TCP socket server running on iOS can receive data through USB Now the question is Can I achieve my goal by simply using the PTUsbHub class alone I cant initialize PTUsbHub PTUSBHub failed to initialize Error DomainNSPOSIXErrorDomain Code Operation not permitted By using your library I faced up with slow transferring issue My setup is using serial port for grabbing incoming data and translate them via usb to iOS My serial is usually has baud rate its about kbitss and I see the big differences with displaying big data in uitextview which were received from serial port and from usb using peertalk The data from serial port is displaying almost immediately I want to know if its possible to connect the peertalk iOS app with Ubuntu OS without using the MacOS app When pulling PeerTalk through CocoaPods it is not pulling the latest codebase Its actually pulling an old commit since version points to an old commit Would it be possible to push a new podspec to cocoapods master repo for version and tag the master branch with tag I can do a PR for the podspec if you will Example for iOS works ok but when Im trying to use libs in my own project swift version with objectivec mm classes bridges I get next error Cannot initialize a variable of type PTExampleTextFrame aka PTExampleTextFrame with an rvalue of type void in this function Peertalk Example PTExampleProtocolh also this header file for Mac targetproject so does why iOS targetproject reference to it static dispatchdatat PTExampleTextDispatchDataWithStringNSString message Use a custom struct const char utf text message cStringUsingEncodingNSUTF StringEncoding sizet length strlenutf text CFAllocatorAllocatenil length PTExampleTextFrame textFrame CFAllocatorAllocatenil sizeofPTExampleTextFrame length memcpytextFrameutf text utf text length Copy bytes to utf text array textFramelength htonllength Convert integer to network byte order Wrap the textFrame in a dispatch data object return dispatchdatacreateconst voidtextFrame sizeofPTExampleTextFramelength nil CFAllocatorDeallocatenil textFrame screenshot at apr I setup a httpserver on Macbook then perform iproxy finally I need to visit the website on an iPhone can I directly enter safari it or write an APP which wrapped peertalk best wish for you i am not good at englishD I just spent several hours debugging this it doesnt seem to be mentioned anywhere Am I missing something
