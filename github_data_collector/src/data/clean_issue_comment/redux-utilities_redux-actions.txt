The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

bottommost part of this documentation is a broken link that looks like this vanilla tutorial Im following the docs to implement reduxactions in a project When I get to the error handling example const noop createActionNOOP const error new TypeErrornot a number expectnooperrortodeepequal type NOOP payload error error true I noticed that when I pass an error for testing like this const successAction errorAction createActions SUCCEESSACTION payload data payload ERRORACTION payload error payload try let data some stuff to fetch data throw ErrorBad times on the internetz successActiondata catch error errorActionerror The action is now type ERRORACTION payload Expected it to be Error Bad times on the internetz instance error true Did I write a wrong implementation What should be the right way to get the error I want to be able to reduce the action with an error payload and save the error to the store for further steps like showing a toast with the error message to the user Hello Here is code sample The issue is that when I combine actions without prefixing everything works OK But without prefixing reducer react to first passed action type to combineActions Im just curious if thats not a bug
