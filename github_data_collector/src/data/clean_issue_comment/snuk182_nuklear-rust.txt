At first I build the gdi demo by nightlyx pcwindowsmsvc all good but got crash when build by nightlyi pcwindowsmsvc And I debugged to figure out the crash palce is nkinit relate to nkhandle In nuklearsys pub union nkhandle pub ptr mut stdosrawcvoid pub id stdosrawcint bindgenunionalign u this cause nkhandle take bytes in i build but the C def is typedef union void ptr int id nkhandle it only take bytes in i build so thats the problem In future SDL backend will be created How draw object on background Not in windows but on background Do You know how do this in C and Rust When pulling from Git there is no issue it is exclusively when nuklearsys is imported from a Cargo repository Panic with trace OS Win Pro Compiler c d Toolchain stablex pcwindowsmsvc This makes it possible to do rust macrouse extern crate nuklear as nk let s nkstring Is possible run this in SDL or native in linux This must be a hidpi issue but on Mac on a retina display the mouse input positions are all doubled or equivalently the output image is doubled That is if you click cm to the right the left window edge the click will be received by the widget cm to the right of the window edge The doubling is relative to the window not the screen Hope thats clear Aint help a lot although hogs resources Thanks
