Hi Your work is really great I have some questions when I train the cfnetconv network In your code runexperimentcfnetconv m the epoch is set to But in your pretrained networks the pretrained networks for cfnetconv are called cfnetconv e mat and cfnetconv graye mat I want to know how many epochs do you set when training the cfnetconv network color and gray Thank you very much Hope your reply Hi Luca Thanks for your work I would like to fine tune your pretrained Imagenet weights using my smallish video data The object I need to track is not one of the classes in Imagenet I used this implementation out of the box it works fairly well but I would like to improve the accuracy by trainingtuning on my own data I was wondering approximately how many new videos and frame pairs would I need to get good results Hi thank you for your attention An error occurred when I compile vlcomplienn only though cpu My system is intel i K ti ubuntu Matlab b Gcc cuda Error using mex homeriverNewFoldertoolboxmatconvnet beta matlabmexbuildvlimreadjpego In function BatchItemItemBatch const vlimreadjpegcpptext x ef undefined reference to warnmemsetzerolen collect error ld returned exit status error in vlcompilennmexlink line mexargs error in vlcompilenn line mexlinkopts objs flagsmexdir flags Any suggestions will be appreciated Thanks in advance Hi is there any plans for releasing a Tensorflow or Pytorch based version of this codebase thanks Aruni How do I run this tracker for my own data Hi bertinetto Thanks for your excellent work I have successfully run this tracking program But I ran training program with trouble The vlimreadjpeg could not read image The warnning information is like this E code tracking cfnet data d ILSVRC train cropxjpg because gdi InvalidParameter orimage file does not exist So could you tell me the problemOr give me some hint default I followed Tracking only step and Matlab gave me this message dist overlap fps when I ran runcfnet evaluation with tcAirportce dataset I expected the result show me tracking scene because this model is suited to object tracking but just threw me above message Originally does this model throw distribution result overlap IoU fps frame per second Hi Luca and Jack good work as always I run the CFNetconv CFNetconv Baselineconv on OTB OPE by setting the hyperparameters according to the table in the paper and find that the results are much worserthe numbers after the are the results shown in the paper Baselineconv precision success CFNetconv precision success CFNetconv precision success Does anyone knows what may cause these results I run the code on Matlab a by using CUDA and matconvnet Hello the video sequence is too large for me to download it form google drive can any one tell me the official website to download it thank you Su Zhengpeng
