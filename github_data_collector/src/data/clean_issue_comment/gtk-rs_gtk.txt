Add support for using composite templates from BuilderGlade example from python button GtkButton buttonaddGtkArrowGtkArrowTypeLEFT GtkShadowTypeNONE I can see gtkArrowType in the docs but not the Arrow object When you go to any trait in gtkprelude eg ButtonExt and then click on one of the implementors eg Button you get a error These were ignored previously Fixes This might not be generated because its similar to gobjectgetproperty Despite the naming it does not have the same functionality Rather it gets the style property of the Widget Without it widgets like Granites avatar widget cant be implemented in Rust The methods we need to figure out how to bind setchildproperty getchildproperty This issue is to provide a list of vfuncs of GtkWidget to be crossed of as they are implemented The first batch is covered in x adjustbaselineallocation x adjustbaselinerequest x adjustsizeallocation x adjustsizerequest x buttonpressevent x buttonreleaseevent canactivateaccel Needs work on signals API childnotify compositedchanged computeexpand configureevent damageevent deleteevent Needs bindings for GdkEventAny destroy destroyevent directionchanged dispatchchildpropertieschanged dragbegin dragdatadelete dragdataget dragdatareceived dragdrop dragend dragfailed dragleave dragmotion x draw enternotifyevent event focus focusinevent focusoutevent getaccessible getpreferredheight getpreferredheightandbaselineforwidth getpreferredheightforwidth getpreferredwidth getpreferredwidthforheight getrequestmode grabbrokenevent grabfocus grabnotify hide hierarchychanged keypressevent keyreleaseevent keynavfailed leavenotifyevent map mapevent mnemonicactivate motionnotifyevent movefocus parentset popupmenu propertynotifyevent proximityinevent proximityoutevent querytooltip queuedrawregion realize screenchanged scrollevent selectionclearevent selectionget selectionnotifyevent selectionreceived selectionrequestevent show showall showhelp sizeallocate statechanged stateflagschanged styleset styleupdated touchevent unmap unmapevent unrealize visibilitynotifyevent windowstateevent This function does nothing Wrong I used this function to set the sizes for the main window of my application When I upgraded to the latest version of the gtk crate and was informed by the compiler that this function was deprecated I checked the documentation and saw the quoted sentence So I removed the call recompiled and reran my application The main window was now the size of a postage stamp I did follow your suggestion to use setdefaultsize instead which restored the proper dimensions of the window in question but assertion that setdefaultgeometry does nothing is simply false and should be removed from the documentation Usually you want to pass None for the adjustments which will cause the scrolled window to create them for you Pass None for the adjustments leads to error E type annotations required cannot resolve gtkIsAgtkAdjustment srcmainrs let scrolledwindowScrolledWindow ScrolledWindownewNone None note required by gtkScrolledWindownew You have gtkNONEADJUSTMENT defined Why not mention that in the documentation instead of None and avoid leading users down this incorrect path Just wondering is this startup time normal or not
