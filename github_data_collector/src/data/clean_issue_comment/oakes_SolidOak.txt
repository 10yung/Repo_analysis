Is SolidOak going to support RLS There is a plugin for neovim supports Rust Language Server SolidOak builtin terminal does not recognize terminated process Steps to reproduce build latest master of solidoak on debian testing as described in READMEmd create new project by clicking New Project button A hello world example gets created click Run button Expected cargo run should compile the project and print Hello world to the builtin console Observed project gets compiled no Hello world output visible builtin console stuck when pressing Stop button the Finished string appears but no Hello world Some debugging Please note Im an absolute newbie to rust Therefore my debugging capabilities are quite limited Sorry about that extend the hello world program to one which takes some input eg guessing game example from docrustlangorg so that the process does not terminate immediately after compilation the program runs prints out some println and I can enter a string after entering a string the program is supposed to print a message and exit no println message visible builtin console stuck again change solidoak code buildersrs file runbuilder function to print the pid of the process started by cargo run Recompile solidoak match termforkcommandprojectpathstrasref args Okpid printlnpid pid currentpid pid in the xterm where I started solidoak I see the pid of the process that was started by cargo run when I click the Run button with ps aux grep PIDNR I can verify that the program is running I enter some string to the builtin console I expect the process to end I can verify with ps that the process actually ended The builtin terminal did not recoginze that the process ended Last println messages not visible and builtin terminal stuck I have to press Stop button Hi all I tried to build a DockerContainer but I have a strange error message error could not find native static library nvim perhaps an L flag is missing error Could not compile neovimrs Can I build it with the stable toolchain Regards Dockerfile Dockerfile FROM scorpilruststable RUN apt update apt upgrade qy apt install qy hicoloricontheme gnomeiconthemeextras git libgtk dev libglib dev libcairo dev libvte dev apt install qy libtool autoconf automake cmake libncurses dev g pkgconfig unzip rm rf varlibaptlists RUN cd rust git clone cd SolidOak rm rf git RUSTBACKTRACE cargo build release Replace with your user group id RUN export uid gid mkdir p homeuserlocalshare mkdir p homeuserconfiggtk echo e Settings ngtkrecentfilesmaxage ngtkrecentfileslimit homeuserconfiggtk settingsini echo gtkrecentfilesmaxage homeusergtkrc echo userxuidgidDeveloperhomeuserbinbash etcpasswd echo userxuid etcgroup echo user ALLALL NOPASSWD ALL etcsudoersduser chmod etcsudoersduser chown uidgid R homeuser chmod R homeuser USER user ENV HOME homeuser CMD cd rustSolidOak cargo run release echo try xhost localhost if it does not start Build like this docker build nocache t dns utf solidoak Start like this docker run ti rm nethost e DISPLAYDISPLAY volumetmpX unixtmpX unixrw volumeHOMEXauthorityhomeuserXauthorityrw volumepwdhomeuserbasename pwdrw dns utf solidoak Some jurisdictions have no concept of committing a work to the Public Domain and others have rights that cannot be waived authorship rights vs editorial rights CC handles these by using Public Domain where it exists and getting as close as possible where it doesnt See also The title says it all gtk handles Windows platform for a while now Any project to add Windows support of SolidOak Copying pasting from the clipboard Ubuntu LTS does not seem to work Am I missing something xdgbasedir has getconfighome which you can use to get the correct directory to put config files into on linux on windows it should go into appdata for backwards compatibility it should first try to read from the correct location then from the old solidoakrc and use the first one it can find if it can t find anything it should create the config file in the correct location I have problems in OsX with locale settings The character set dont display correctly with the spanish keyboard There are some way to configure it Thank you Here is an github repository with tomlvim support
