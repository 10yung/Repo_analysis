First of all thank yannickl for this awesome project We imported the version into our project and found that the dealloc method was never called I found the progressTargetTimer may never be invalid if the progress didnt reach the end So I wrote this in the host views dealloc method to invalidate the progressTargetTimer objc progressBarprogress The dealloc method was called finally when the progress view type is rounded with gradient colors there is a tiny part of the background track view appears on top of the progress view track Hi I am trying to place a UIImage instead of indicatorTextLabel I have added attributed string on this label but the image is not showing in ylprogressbar it is though showing on any common label Could you pls guide me feca b da cc if incrementValue is should not create a timer cant support the RTL with autolayout I tried to use setProgress animated true at first but when I get progress by selfprogressBarprogress its return not and I tried to set Its still return for me Why its not update I would like to implement cancel button into this progress bar It looks like for some reason with a label it doesnt show up But it would be nice to have it as otherwise it looks like the bar is broken or something Thank you Hi in my app Im implementing autolayout When i try to implement YLProgressBar in my xib file im getting Failed to load designables from path null Can the question is how can i use this library in xib that contains autolayout
