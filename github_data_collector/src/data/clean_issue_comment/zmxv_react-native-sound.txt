loop once A total of plays beetle Please post your code js SoundsetCategoryPlayback const sound new Soundtadamp SoundMAINBUNDLE error soundsetNumberOfLoops This will cause infinite repetitions soundplay bulb Does the problem have a test case I dont have a public test case Its clear why the issue occurs though because the looping is claimed as supported by android in README file but in code

audio from file path An this moment soundgetDuration returns seconds which is correct Source continue downloading and sound keep playing Doesnt matter how many time it will play but getDuration keep returning seconds Even when current position is minutes When I restart device with cached file download is finished it will return real total value example mins beetle What is the expected behavior It will return correct value I expect to get different value in downloading process between sec and mins beetle Please post your code Code is same like in docs bulb Possible solution Seems like sound instance keeps value of initial duration and just continue returning it Maybe this behavior is ok for you Id like to be able to do force duration get bulb Is there a workaround I tried to create
