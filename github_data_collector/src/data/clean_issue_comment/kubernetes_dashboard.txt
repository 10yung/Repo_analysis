race conditions Bumped the major version do to the rewrite and also a minor change in how the stability window is used In the new version the stability window only applies to file resources waiting for them to exist and stop changing for other resources they are completed as soon as availablep pAlso in the new logic once a resource becomes available the system doesnt continue to check it it only continues checking the pending resourcesp pLogging was improved and simplifiedp ul licodelcode codelogcode just indicate what resources are still pendingli licodevcode codeverbosecode includes

many kubecontexts The dashboard would have a dropdown to select contextcluster and an all clusters view similar to allnamespaces Why is this needed Many users are in situations where they run many different clusters We have over clusters it would be nice to have one dashboard for them all and a way to get an aggregated view Comments Wondering if this is a feature the community would want Im going to be working on it anyway What would you like to be added The first thing is the ability to pass alloweddisallowed namespaces I have this done already in a private fork Why is this needed Basically the use case is with RBAC you can give cluster scoped rights or namespace scoped rights but for our developers we want them to have access to some subset of the namespaces in a cluster we dont want to run multiple dashboards per namespace So we pass a list of allowed or disallowed namespaces to the dashboard Comments Wondering if this is a feature the community would want before I put

merge it now I think it should be discussed Maybe the frontend should be changed either Above its some reference about pod status How to use the kubernetes goclient to get the same Pod status info that kubectl gives kuberneteskubernetes printpod hi everyone I found that the dashboard can not handle the pod Terminating status BTW when the pod phase is Running and the DeletionTimestamp is not nil
