Hi I love the output formatting that better panic provides My application captures backtraces in some flows to print them to the user but it then resumes operation so it doesnt panic in the normal sense a panic would occur Id like to apply the same formatting style betterpanic uses when printing the backtraces but Settings only provides a public API to install a panic hook Would it be possible to expose some API that you would consider stable for backtraces formatting something like rust let settings Settingsauto let formattedbacktrace settingsformatbt bt Thanks Rust testing framework capture output of tests and release it only if tests is failed in consistent with other output But if i would use betterpanic It prints stacktraces on demand and in inconsistent with other output form This is example of output from real project where i was trying to install betterpanic The application panicked crashed explicit panic in nodesrctestmodrs line thread testintegrationfinalizedslashingwithserviceaward test testintegrationfinalizedslashingwithserviceaward FAILED Backtrace most recent call first File nodesrctestmodrs line in stegosnodetestApiskipmacroblock File nodesrctestintegrationrs line in cargo test output test testintegrationfinalizedslashingwithserviceaward FAILED Are mixed within betterpanic output Is it possible to fix
