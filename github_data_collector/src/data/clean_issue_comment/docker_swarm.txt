I did check that this didnt exist in open issues couldnt find a roadmap which mentioned this I am using swarm to create a small containers service backend and would like to be able to view the logs as the service starts in a similar way to dockercompose up eg a collated or aggregated view of all the logs If Im not in the right place or its already been discussed and dismissed please let me know Before filing an issue double check that youre in the right repository This repository is only for issues related to the standalone Docker Swarm project Issues related to Docker Swarm Mode are filed under the repository githubcommobymoby For further information refer to Swarm Disambiguation in the README Environment Ubuntu Docker version build d d image yogeshkathayatnodeping which is a simple nodejs app running on a nodealpine build my current host IP Ip that I want to ping My compose file version networks basic services pingtest image yogeshkathayatnodeping deploy replicas networks basic ports Issue I am not able to ping another host in the same local network from inside of the container if I remove ports section from my Compose file then it is working perfectly but I want to expose the port to the outside world Steps docker swarm init docker stack deploy composefile dockercomposeyml ping docker exec it containerid binbash go inside the container ping host in the same subnet or network Hi What are the plans for swarm future Wiki is outdated there are no public roadmaps Is it a good technology for using in production right nowin next years Hello Some arguments of docker service create allow to use template like NodeID But unfortunately node labels are not supported What is the right way for a decision of this problem I need to set the environment variables for every task For example docker service create env SOMEENVNodeLabelsSOMENODELABELVALUE In this way I need to configure docker services task especially for every swarms node When Im adding a new node swarm is assigning the wrong ip to node docker info Swarm active NodeID m fm zodif vwmogm drejzjg Is Manager false Node Address Manager Addresses docker node inspect format StatusAddr m fm zodif vwmogm drejzjg When I do this in one of my servers one of the images of the dockercompose is not correct it is an outdated image docker stack deploy c dockercomposeyml builder But when I change its name for example by executing the following command then it works fine docker stack deploy c dockercomposeyml whatever I think it has to do with caching but Ive tried removing all images all containers swarms services I have even done docker system prune but with no avail I then decided to rename varlibdocker uninstall everything from docker and install it again By doing this I was able to finally make it work with the builder name Ive tried the exact same thing in a different staging server from scratch where I had no Docker beforehand and using the first command everything goes fine so I wonder what is going on and what I can do to fix this issue without having to uninstall docker whenever this happens I have saved the problematic varlibdocker in case it is helpful in order to find what the cause of the issue is Let me know if I should provide more information and thank you Is it possible to have docker service rollback rollback to the previous cached image For instance imagine an upstream change to the image tagged latest causes a service to break Is it possible for the rollback to use the previous image even if it has the same tag Would be cool if this usecase was explained in the docs I can see in the service inspect that the hash is saved with the image so I thought it could be possible Thanks docker swarm version ce centos kernel centos el elrepox rootswarm dockercompose docker images
