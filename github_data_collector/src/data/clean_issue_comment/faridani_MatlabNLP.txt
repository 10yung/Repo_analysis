I am trying to execute the sentiment example but it is showing this error at line and in sentimentanalysis file ie trainingset featureVectortrainingsetindex what to do I found that SanitizerComment worked much better using the following regex myoutstring regexprepmyoutstring s removes all whitespace HTH can we get speed up by converting large matrices to sparse think about rewriting it with hashmaps Right now we are using regex which is slow Here is a simple solution put elements of the input string in a hash map container map compare the contents of that container map with the keys of the header if exists output the values Rewrite it with hashmaps
