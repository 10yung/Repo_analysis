Hi sorry to spam your github Thanks for your videos and code Theyre very helpful public int lcsDynamicchar str char str deleted code else temp i j Mathmaxtemp i j temp i j iftemp i j max max temp i j return max In your video you said that the lower right of the matrix should always be the max That makes sense to me so I was curious why you used this max variable to track the max hi w en i run this cod It takes about seconds to transmit and display information to me My question is is there a way to get this information faster than this time import requests from bs import BeautifulSoup page requestsget soup BeautifulSouppagecontenthtmlparser locator div h a tag soupselectonelocator tags tagattrs title printtags hi Im a beginner in Python And now Im working on selenium There is a website that when I click ctrl shift i on it to see the details of the objects shows the whole page as an object Is it possible to identify the objects There is a video in the zip file that shows what is happening when I want to select one of the web page objects the objects cannot be selected Rec zip thank you Initializing th index As we are already copying the max value in the array T during regular iterations another iteration to find the max value is unnecessary Added python solutions of few Leetcode questions on binary trees will be adding more solutions this looks great most clear answer ever but this does not looks a binary search the loop looks still a linear search from len I guess instead of every time or on failure use to jump back or forth only that will be the binary search I cannot come up with an example that should update the root reference ie I think the root will not change when we are in this situation so we do not need to update the root reference Are there any people thinking this is a necessary operation and can give an example of why this is operation is necessary
