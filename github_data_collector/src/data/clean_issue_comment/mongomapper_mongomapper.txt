 Hi MongoMapper team Please explain attributes is a valid name for key or not If yes could you please complain about that to stderrstdout while you see user tries to create such attribute We spending a lot of time founding why our app not working with such key name class Point include MongoMapperDocument key nameid ObjectId key value Float key attributes Hash end Thank you I am using gem mongomapper in my rails application I have installed mongo and there is mongo router which managing different mongo instances The schema which I am using in my rails application requires username and password to connect when I am connecting this schema from mongo console I am able to successfully pass through but it fails when the same thing tries from my rails application I am getting mongo authentication error Here are the logs usrlocalrvmgemsruby p gemsmongo libmongofunctionalauthenticationrb in issueauthentication Failed to authenticate user xxxxx on db xxxxxx MongoAuthenticationError from usrlocalrvmgemsruby p gemsmongo libmongofunctionalauthenticationrb in addauth from usrlocalrvmgemsruby p gemsmongo libmongodbrb in authenticate from usrlocalrvmgemsruby p gemsmongomapper libmongomapperconnectionrb in connect from usrlocalrvmgemsruby p gemsmongomapper libmongomapperconnectionrb in setup Linux Ubuntu Ruby version mongodb Any idea what could be going wrong Should I updatedowngrade something Cheers Matias MongoMapperconnection MongoConnectionnewlocalhost ArgumentError wrong number of arguments given expected from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsbson libbsonbsoncrb in deserialize from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsbson libbsonbsoncrb in deserialize from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongonetworkingrb in readdocuments from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongonetworkingrb in receive from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongonetworkingrb in receivemessage from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongocursorrb in block in sendinitialquery from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongofunctionalloggingrb in block in instrument from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongofunctionalloggingrb in instrument from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongofunctionalloggingrb in instrument from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongocursorrb in sendinitialquery from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongocursorrb in refresh from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongocursorrb in next from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongodbrb in command from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongomongoclientrb in block in checkismaster from usrlocalrvmrubiesruby libruby timeoutrb in block in timeout from usrlocalrvmrubiesruby libruby timeoutrb in timeout from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongomongoclientrb in checkismaster from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongomongoclientrb in connect from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongomongoclientrb in setup from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongomongoclientrb in initialize from usrlocalrvmgemsruby gemsmongo libmongolegacyrb in initialize from irb in new from irb from usrlocalrvmrubiesruby binirb in main Using fixnum in ruby generate warnings change shouldnt have any real world impact unless someone has a replica set with members I have device model which is default mapped with device collection but based on some user permission I need to map this model to some different table having the same attributes so the data can be fetched from this new collection These instructions do not work The required gems to run mongomapper with sinatra seems to be gem sinatra gem activemodelserializersxml gem activemodelserializers gem mongomapper gem bsonext well sort of optional but highly recommended Mongo mapper it is not compatible with mongodb Because it depends on mongo gem which does not support mongodb x Is there a way to enable the support with mongo x This PR changes badges to use SVG Ended up needing this and whipped it up Its not on by default since the requisite libs may not be in a particular project but can be included easily enough via MongoMapperDocumentplugin MongoMapperPluginsStrongParameters
