Hi I would be interesting in adding league positions and team form into an analysis It would be useful if I could get info on each time with regards to position in league shotsshots on target ect for each of the teams in a specific match It probably already been done but I want to weight a match prediction based on the recent league position and how the team has performed against other teams close or further away from them in the league Getting the league table data and all other stats for a team with a time stamp or period would be useful is there anyway I can get week by week league table data thanks Garry All of the other datasets were updated with the exception of champs Can you please post some code in champsr that pulls in the most recent results and appends it to the older data Fantastic package englandcurrent returns the same column names as in dataengland but the column types are different For example division is numeric whereas it is a character in dataengland This causes an error when trying to bind these rows with dplyrbindrows Would work much better if these were all the same Either all characters or numeric Hi James I trust you are well Here are the deductions for the safrica data to add Brazil league data Just posting a helper function for manually adding new results to the results dataframe in case you want to include it in the package I often find myself wanting to analyse the latest results before the footballdatacouk CSVs have been updated so this comes in handy It uses the matchTeamnames function described here r addResult functionhome visitor hgoal vgoal Date SysDate division tier Season home matchTeamnameshome visitor matchTeamnamesvisitor FT paste hgoal vgoal totgoal hgoal vgoal goaldif hgoal vgoal result ifelsehgoal vgoal H ifelsehgoal vgoal A D df dataframeDate Season home visitor FT hgoal vgoal division tier totgoal goaldif result rbindengland df arrangeDate Example usage addResultMan City Stoke SysDate tail Date Season home visitor FT hgoal vgoal division tier totgoal goaldif result Newcastle United Liverpool D Manchester City Stoke City H Just a possible improvement that Ive used in recent blog posts a function which matches team names from another dataset onto engsoccerdata team names For each team name in a vector it finds the highest similarity string in nameother variable of teamnames dataframe using the levenshteinSim function from the RecordLinkage package Works well for me so far but untested with nonEngland teams matchTeamnames Matches a vector of team names with names used by teamnames dataframe in engsoccerdata package Inputs a vector of team names outputs the original dataframe with new teamname in column team and old teamname in column teamold mindist specifies lowest similarity threshold for a match if all possible matches for a team are below this value returns NA Returns a vector by default if checkResults is TRUE returns a dataframe of old names and best matches for purposes of validation matchTeamnames functionteams mindist checkResults FALSE requireengsoccerdata requireRecordLinkage requiredplyr teams ascharacterteams oldnewdf lapplyuniqueteams functionx distance levenshteinSimascharacterx ascharacterteamnamesnameother threshold on distance newname ifelsemaxdistance narmT mindist ascharacterteamnames whichmaxdistance name NA oldnewdf dataframeoldname x newname distance maxdistance narmT stringsAsFactors FALSE plyrrbindfill ifcheckResults returnoldnewdf else teams oldnewdfnewname matchteams oldnewdfoldname returnteams Have German data need to add for France Holland Italy Spain even if not all years just yet Teamnames for leagues portugal belgium scotland greece turkey are not necessarily consistent with teamnames in champions league dataset this needs to be fixed Similarly check facup teamnames dataset and check consistency of nonleague teams with england Need to add playoff fixtures from other competitions eg scotland
