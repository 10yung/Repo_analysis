When I ran MOTtestm there was only one tracking trajectory was visualised But the paper shows there should be multiple tracking trajectories How to show them all in the image When I running on my own dataset images MOT format the function readdresimage will use all memory G G swap memory and then my system Linux will make MATLAB crush Is there anything wrong on my environment I use MATLAB b ubuntu When I run testm there is no visual interface when running MOTcrossvalidationm I had one problem This error is Index exceeds matrix dimensions Error in CLEARMOTHUN line ic uniquegtMat Error in evaluateTracking line mets mInf CLEARMOTHUNgtInfoSingleseqCntgtInfostI Error in MDPtest line metrics evaluateTrackingseqname optresults benchmarkdir Error in MOTcrossvalidation line MDPtestidxtestj seqsettest tracker Please help me Thank you very much when running MOTcrossvalidationm I had one problem This error is Index exceeds matrix dimensions Error in CLEARMOTHUN line ic uniquegtMat Error in evaluateTracking line mets mInf CLEARMOTHUNgtInfoSingleseqCntgtInfostI Error in MDPtest line metrics evaluateTrackingseqname optresults benchmarkdir Error in MOTcrossvalidation line MDPtestidxtestj seqsettest tracker Please help me Thank you very much Hi How can I train MDP on my own data and then visualize the test results Also from where can I see the processing speed of Frames per second As per my understanding it uses detections for every frame I want to provide it detections for one frame then let it track those detections for the next X frames and so on Thanks simple to use the maximum score to the minimum to or else I use matlab b and compile is ok but when I run MOTcrossvalidationm warpmexw invalid happend how can I solve this problem convertTXTToStruct line missingFrames sizestInfoW rangeend wrong usage For a colon operator with a character operand the first operand and the last operand must be characters Do anyone know how to solve Please help me
