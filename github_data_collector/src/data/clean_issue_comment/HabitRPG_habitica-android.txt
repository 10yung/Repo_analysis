Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe People do not find our guild challenges because many only use the app We have to link them in chat Putting them into the guild description is a pain to maintain and it looks bad on the browser version Describe the solution youd like I want the guild challenges to be listed below the guild description in the guild details view Describe alternatives youve considered As a workaround we can put the links to the guild description and maintain it when challenges are created but we have many challenges and they change once a month so this is a lot of extra work for the guild leader Additional context I guess you need to put it to the fragmentguilddetailxml but this means in GuildDetailFragmentkt a guildChallengesView has to be added I saw the ChallengeListFragmentkt but I dont know if this can be used as a view like the TextView vals Im lost on how to implement this in detail and couldnt test it even if I knew how to put it there Could someone please explain to me whats happening there and how the fragments are used Habiticareslayoutfragmentguilddetailxml comhabitrpgandroidhabiticauiviewsCollapsibleSectionView

their new signin method by april so we will also have to implement this on Android so that users who sign up on their apple device can sign in on all their devices This will depend on the server issue for implementing this Describe the bug My reminders across nearly all of my dailies and tasks dont occur at the expected time For example I just received this push notification reminder Screenshot However this notification should come until tonight and as I understand it shouldnt even come on a Monday based on how its configured Even so it certainly shouldnt have come this morning Screenshot I received this alert last night around PM Screenshot As a final example I have this alert that I dont think has ever occurred and I certainly did not receive it this morning Screenshot I have many other dailies with reminders that are simply not happening at all or coming at completely random times Here are my settings Frankly I have no idea what the reminder time in the settings is for but Ive never gotten a reminder for it Everything in push notifications is enabled Screenshot Update as I was writing this bug I did get the push notification to check off my todos Except it chat at about AM and mine is configured come at PM as you can see in the above screenshot Screenshot To Reproduce Create a daily Set a reminder on said daily Expected behavior To receive my reminders at the expected

the web version you only need to spend gems for public challenges and you can create non public challenges by assigning them to your party In the Android version your party does not show up as a choice on the location menu If you create a party challenge on the web and try to edit it in Android it lets you but prevents you from saving changes with the message you need at least one gem to create a public challenge To Reproduce While having gems Try to create a partyonly challenge on the app Create a partyonly challenge via the website Find the challenge in the app and make any edit to it Attempt to save changes Expected behavior Step above your party is one of the choices for location Step above changes saved successfully Screenshots NA Smartphone please complete the following
