MicrosoftDataSqliteSqliteException x SQLite Error database is locked I even have it reboot nightly to clean up the error but still happens every day If I reboot I am able to log into the plex request site but at some point during the day if you try to login again I am not able to get in after seconds or so you will see the database is locked error and will have to reboot the server Logs log txt

is by design but it does not work for me and I assume others that use Emby DVR Only Movies and TV Shows are set in Ombi to be used In Emby I have a movies library and a TV Show library They are working great in Ombi I also use the Standard shipped Emby DVR function and this has a built in Mixed Content library used to record shows called Recordings My remote users do NOT have access to this and only get TV Shows and Movies libraries The Ombi newsletter however is also reading new content from the Emby Delivered Recordings library which is set to Mixed Library This means they get informed about all my TV recordings which they dont get and I would delete after watching Apparently Plex has a feature to control library access Need the same in Emby To Reproduce Run newsletter ombi is emailing out new content from the shipped Emby Library Recorded TV not just TV Shows and Movies from the librarues with content specifically set as TV Shows and Movies Expected behavior Either ignore emby libraries with Mixed Content which would work for me but maybe not others or offer library control in Ombi to be able to select just the Emby Libraries to monitor Screenshots If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem Logs Logs directory where Ombi is located If applicable a snippet of the logs that seems relevant to the bug if present Desktop please complete the following
