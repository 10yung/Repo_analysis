For large directories getting checksum for each file is slow The change is to get checksum from file list directly Im trying to backup my crontabs folder using this command homepidropboxuploadersh upload varspoolcroncrontabs crontabs The first time that I run this everything is fine and I get a new folder called crontabs under my dropbox apps folder Dropbox Apps Backup crontabs The second time that I run this line again without any changes as a weekly backup the API opens a new folder under the already existing folder so i get this folder structure now Dropbox Apps Backup crontabs crontabs The third time I run the same command I get Creating Directory crontabscrontabs FAILED Skipping file varspoolcroncrontabspi file exists with the same hash Skipping file varspoolcroncrontabsroot file exists with the same hash Some error occurred Please check the log Why is it duplicated the folders and how can I prevent this Thanks If a filename contains a quote mark or backslash dropboxuploader fails dropboxuploadersh upload testDataJ R Bob Dobbstxt dutests Uploading homejlennoxGitDropboxUploadertestDataJ R Bob Dobbstxt to dutestsJ R Bob Dobbstxt FAILED An error occurred requesting upload Some error occured Please check the log dropboxuploadersh upload testDatatest atesttxt dutests Uploading homejlennoxGitDropboxUploadertestDatatesttesttxt to duteststesttesttxt FAILED An error occurred requesting upload Some error occured Please check the log Note that in the latter case dropboxuploaders console output is also mangled it produces beep sounds when the literal a is interpreted Fixes issue If I try to upload a file with a percent sign in its name dropboxuploader cannot upload it successfully dropboxuploadersh upload testDatatest testtxt dutests No such file or directory homejlennoxGitDropboxUploadertestDatatest e sttxt Some error occured Please check the log Any error coming out of read really but D is the most likely candidate and what Im aiming for Hi everyone is there a way to tell the script to not handle dot files I just dont need them and I would be happy to not look at them at all Thank you very much Fixes Fix bug not download empty file when local does not exist And add new option c skip doing checksum
