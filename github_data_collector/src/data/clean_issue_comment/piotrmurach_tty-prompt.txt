 Describe the change Allow PastelDetached objects to be given as colors Why are we doing this Allows for more coloring options Benefits Drawbacks None that I am aware of Requirements Put an X between brackets on each line if you have done the item Tests written passing locally Code style checked X Rebased with master branch Documentation updated Describe the problem This goal of this ticket is to make it possible to give a PastelDetached instance as helpcolor argument to TTYPromptnew This would make sense since Pastel is used anyway and it would allow for more options Steps to reproduce the

way to make a menu system using Promptselect without it leaving the breadcrumb trail of all the previous selections For example before ruby examplerb Really Cool Menu Coolness Status Coolness Status Back Really Cool Menu Manage Coolness Coolness is at Manage Add coolness Coolness is at Manage Add coolness Coolness is at Manage Add coolness Back Exit Its a little hard to see whats going on and all the terminal recording software I tried did not like all the lineclearing but every time a lineitem is selected a new breadcrumb is added ie at the root Really Cool Menu upon selecting Coolness Status a line is left behind Really Cool Menu Coolness Status Compare that to the version with quiet ruby examplequietrb Coolness is at Manage Add coolness Back Exit I did the same exact keystrokes into status back into manage add twice But the output is a lot cleaner This also applies to a number of other classes slider question and derivatives enumlist expander mask yes I hope this is a desirable change Other minor changes Added vim modeline to lib Updated some confusingbroken docs misc formatting fixes Why are we doing this I really want to be able to have a clean menu system using ttyprompt Benefits Broader customization will expand usage possibility Drawbacks None that I can see Its a new feature that should not overlap with anything Requirements Put an X between brackets on each line if you have done the item x Tests written passing locally x Code style checked x Rebased with master branch x Documentaion updated The hardware cursor is not moved to the focussed option in select and
