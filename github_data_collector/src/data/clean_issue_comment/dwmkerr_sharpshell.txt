Version of SharpShell used Related types of SharpShellServer Any Hi there the SharpShellxml file of the nuget package bloats the build output dir and is not required for releases I would suggest to either remove it from the nuget package or if nuget supports this somehow exclude the file from build output Keep up the excellent work Cheers DCW Version of SharpShell used v Related types of SharpShellServer Any I have an issue with the deskband name it does not seem to be related to what you say here The name used in this toolbar is specified by using the DisplayName attribute on the server class Picture speaks a thousand words so please just see what I mean Of course I can provide more information if needed Log Messages If you are seeing unexpected behaviour please include relevant logs here There is a guide on getting the logs for SharpShell in the SharpShell Logging page when i using PreviewHandler i found it can not do preview for system known file extension for

request for comment requesting everyones oppinion Also it is a new featureimprovement which doesnt have a very high priority right now just wanted to write it down as it might proof useful in the future Ive have been reading a bit microsoft docs lately and found this article very interesting Basically Microsoft discourages the use of IContextMenu and encourages the use of static verbs or other dynamic verb methods They say you shouldnt use IContextMenu because its overpowered and complicated and there are easierleightweight options static CreateProcess static IDropTarget static IExecuteCommand static IExplorerCommand dynamic Advanced Query Syntax static verb IExplorerCommand IExplorerCommandState static verb First Maybe SharpShell could provide multiple options to build SharpContextMenu or decide dynamically which option to chose for registration mainly to have the least impact Of course we should keep in mind not to make it complicated for new projectsbeginners Second The docs and examples could highlight even more of these best practice for SharpContextMenu dos and donts These two steps could help improve optimizing the ContextMenu if an overpowered IContextMenu isnt really needed Means we need to derive a new SharpFileThumbnailHandler class which is similar to SharpThumbnailHandler but implements IInitializeWithFileStream instead We also need to note the usage of the DisableProcessIsolation flag as noted in this thread to allow the handler to register This would resolve issue Version of SharpShell used Related types of SharpShellServer Any I am attempting to define submenu items after the main menu item is expanded The main menu item is always shown and what submenu items are shown depend on a connection to a server I dont want to attempt the connection until the main menu item is expanded otherwise we are doing this any time Explorer context menus are triggered Ive attempted MainMenuItemDropDownOpening sender args SetSubMenus SetSubMenus will attempt the connection set some bools based on that and then call CreateMenu Ive also tried MouseHover DropDownOpened DropDownClosed MouseEnter but none of those events are handled Is there any way to achieve this Version of SharpShell used x Related types of SharpShellServer Any Since there have been quite a few questions like Why does my Extension not show up or How do I installregister my extension and others I will try to add a FAQ related only to registration and installation issues to the docs referencing the issues and trying to give best practices Some of it might be soon obsolete ifwhen a new method of registration comes in place but most of the information will be the same regarding GAC Registry Explorer and others Ill keep this issue as a reminder and to welcome others to join me in building the FAQ If you have new or old questions to the registrationinstallation of Servers post them here If I have a class derived from SharpPropertySheet and the CanShowSheet method returns true is the instance of the class valid until the whole Properties Dialog box is destroyed or only until another panesheet is selected or some other time I ask so I can know if I can define and use instance variables like an open file handle so I am not continually opening and closing files When I click on this link from the the following page its down the bottom and labelled as Installing I get a Version of SharpShell used Any Related types of SharpShellServer Any As previously discussed here Demand for other Packages besides SharpShell Package rises Important The Packages need to be in sync because currently the Tools eG Server Manager need to be built with exactly the same version as SharpShell used in the project Also I reccomend making it obvious for consumer that these additional packages are optionally devIDErelated and not mandatory Part of the task to get this automated CICD As also stated in the referenced issue later its possible that this is replacedcomplemented by something like chocolatey
