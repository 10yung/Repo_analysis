Hello I use RKTlib verdemo b a and I want to receive input data on the Serial and transmit it over TCP client The input data is of RXM RAWX format and my device is ublox EVK PPP ublox The transmission from my serial to a TCP client is fine I get the data there but it is not converted even though I have selected Conversion from ublox format to RTCM The data I get is still encoded What am I doing wrong how can I fix this problem It looks like this Screenshot I do not use any startup or shutdown commands or messages The configuration of the ublox is saved and the data I get is the data I need Would it be too much to ask if there would be a small change in the strsvr so that it could be set to pass over also the in rtklib unsupported RTCM message types like in a RTCM to RTCM type streaming Just pass them over without any conversion And also for your interest The MSM message type GLONASS conversion to does not seem to work right in rtklib STRSVR ver b Some work to fix this issue has been done by rtkexplorer this beta verdemo b b will show GLONASS observation data for both L and L in rtknavi but feeding this correction stream to my Trimble ag receiverdisplay will put the receiver to a boot loop I am trying to get rtkrcv working on Linux system I am able to see the solution on my terminal window but I am not able to save it into a file Whenever I set the outstr type as file it throws segmentation fault Any suggestions on how I can save the solution file and log file would be great It seems that the overwrite process when closing the file is not appropriate Hello ubx files from ucenter cannot be converted It seems that files are just not written to disc and its known problem but on other version of rtklib I was using version from b commit a afc from repo with binaries I see that there a classic Hatch filter in RTKLIB common functions extern void csmoothobst obs int ns but see no example how to use it and it never seems to be called at all Look like it comes right of of the classic text books to smooth X past values If there any best practices example of how to call this method Of how to bring it more than that one prior observation set to operate on If I call it on the observables set right before calling rtkpos it does not appear the the smoothed values Ps Ls are being passed back or set in obst but I have not investigated much further no immediate visual effect on the navigation output Found this while searching on line quite a guy Hi everyone Im using GNSS SDRLIB with a Nooelec SMARTee and active L GPS antenna outdoor with clear sky view This is set up as a Rover via a TCP connection I can get in a few seconds a SINGLE fix in RTKLIB but then the RTK correction is giving me errors and cant be resolved to a solution As the base I am using an Italian NTRIP Server Here is my RINEX file generate straight from GNSSSDRLIB RINEXzip Here a screenshot of my setup with the Errorwarning page Cattura Hi steps to reproduce rtkpost run rtklibpost in Kinematic mode with ECEF output and GPST timestamp with observations from run rtklibpost on the same input data with output time stamp set to UTC In the output pos logs I find that the first position solution record of each file differ by seconds UTC latitudedeg longitudedeg heightm Q ns sdnm sdem sdum sdnem sdeum sdunm ages ratio versus GPST latitudedeg longitudedeg heightm Q ns sdnm sdem sdum sdnem sdeum sdunm ages ratio In GPS time and UTC differ by seconds see I checked the unit tests in RTKLIBtestutestttimec and find the following test Line double ep Line tgpst utcepoch timeep time epochtep assertep ep ep ep ep ep which corresponds to leap seconds for as well Is it possible that the Rtklib leap seconds need to be updated cheers Jan Tested on Ublox NEO M Quality indicator and wrong time in some observations Convbin generates many empty rows in observation file C x mutex uses lock function pound defining a definition of lock causes compile to fail See
