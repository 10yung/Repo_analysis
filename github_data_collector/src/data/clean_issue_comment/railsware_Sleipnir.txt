 What is difference between Sleipnir and Quick They seem very similar to me What are some trade offs and advantages of using Sleipnir Thanks In Swift String is not SequenceType anymore One should try to use StringCharacterView instead Eg swift public func endWithitem String EndWithStringCharacterView Character Usefull links from AlexDenisov Could you please add support for carthage Can someone check to make sure they can still run the Sample project Ive had no luck writing command line projects that reference a Swift framework and was told this is not supported in currently released XCode I see the same issue with the Sleipnir project Do others have the same problem I see a runtime dyld error dyld Library not loaded rpathlibswiftCoredylib Cant add public extensions to generic types Array or Optional Found this related issue on stackoverflow How are others working around this I guess in my local copy Ill remove the public modifier and add some other helper methods Here is one of the compile errors regarding this UsersmgwelchDocumentsProjectsthirdpartyswiftzsleipnirSleipnirSleipnirMatchersShouldSyntaxswift Extension of generic type ArrayT from a different module cannot provide public declarations It would be great to use Sleipnir with Cocoapods to ensure that it works on simulator I believe there are a lot of projects that have cocoa pods installation as requirement for any of their dependencies As a build master I want to retrieve test results in JUnit XML compatible format So that I can report them on my build server Jenkins CI As a build master I want to start the test run automatically without tapping any UI buttons So that I can run tests with my CI scripts As a build master I want to retrieve test results in JUnit XML compatible format So that I can report them on my build server As a build master I want to crash the application when all tests would have been executed So that test running does not block the integration and next jobs run as expected
