If I understand correctly a cell in a Jupyter notebook can only render one output In case of Daru this can be done by calling mygraphshowiniruby In order to render multiple n plots in a single output theres DaruViewPlotList which constructs a table with n columns and a single row If the individual plots are too big this table would overflow and the user needs to scroll sideways see attached screenshot Is there a better way to display multiple plots especially without horizontal scrolling If not and you are interested Id also take look into that not sure if it suffices to give a numcols parameter for the construction of the table to limit the number of columns or wrap the individual plots inside a flexbox container Screenshot at The link in the description of this project see screenshot below does not work If I understand the discussion in correctly the link should point to Screenshot at Github Actions beta version can be used in SciRuby repos Anyone feel free to play and setup it for this repo Refer Need to improve test converage for datatables adapter th cell throws error this issue is opened so that it remains into consideration Hi I use DaruViewPlot almost everyday It is troublesome to write showiniruby method every time I plot I am lazy I write a simple ad hoc monkey patch below so that I do not need to write anything ruby module DaruView class Plot def toiruby representation showiniruby representationoptions mime representationobject end end class PlotList def toiruby representation showiniruby representationoptions mime representationobject end end end How about implementing the toiruby method There may be some reasons for not being implemented But I think it is useful This is not a problem Information for people using Googlecolab How to use IRuby on Google Colab If DaruViewplottinglibrary and DaruViewPlot are in the same cell it works well But when DaruViewplottinglibrary and DaruViewPlot are in the different cells it does not show anything Hello Hello Thank you for developing a powerful gem But Is daru view compatible with Jupyter Lab I got errors when I tried to use daruview with Jupyter Lab But Jupyter Notebook works well So I can use daruview now Im thinking about copying the example notebooks to repository because it supports interaction with them via Is that a good idea last few lines of error binbash libtool tagCC modecompile gcc DHAVECONFIGH I Iinclude pedantic Werror Wall DGNUSOURCE DLINUX DREENTRANT DTHREADSAFE g Iusrlocallibrubygems gemsrbczmq extrbczmqdstinclude g fPIC MT zdirlo MD MP MF depszdirTpo c o zdirlo zdirc libtool compile gcc DHAVECONFIGH I Iinclude pedantic Werror Wall DGNUSOURCE DLINUX DREENTRANT DTHREADSAFE g Iusrlocallibrubygems gemsrbczmq extrbczmqdstinclude g fPIC MT zdirlo MD MP MF depszdirTpo c zdirc o zdiro zdirc In function zdirnew zdirc error readdirr is deprecated Werrordeprecateddeclarations int rc readdirr handle entry result In file included from includeczmqpreludeh from includeczmqh from zdirc usrincludedirenth note declared here extern int readdirr DIR restrict dirp zdirc error readdirr is deprecated Werrordeprecateddeclarations rc readdirr handle entry result In file included from includeczmqpreludeh from includeczmqh from zdirc usrincludedirenth note declared here extern int readdirr DIR restrict dirp cc all warnings being treated as errors Makefile recipe for target zdirlo failed make zdirlo Error make Leaving directory usrlocallibrubygems gemsrbczmq extczmqsrc Makefile recipe for target all failed make all Error make Leaving directory usrlocallibrubygems gemsrbczmq extczmqsrc Makefile recipe for target allrecursive failed make allrecursive Error CZMQ compile error extconfrb failed Could not create Makefile due to some reason probably lack of necessary libraries andor headers Check the mkmflog file for more details You may need configuration options Provided configuration options withoptdir withoutoptdir withoptinclude withoutoptincludeoptdirinclude withoptlib withoutoptliboptdirlib withmakeprog withoutmakeprog srcdir curdir rubyusrlocalbinRUBYBASENAME withsystemlibs withoutsystemlibs withsystemlibs withoutsystemlibs extconf failed exit code Gem files will remain installed in usrlocallibrubygems gemsrbczmq for inspection Results logged to usrlocallibrubygems extensionsx linux staticrbczmq gemmakeout
