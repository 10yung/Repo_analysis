youve now met the thresholds to be effectively considered an active maintainer of the project for example merged PRs on and To publicly acknowledge that fact wed like to add you to the tldrpages organization If you accept the invitation we ask you to make your membership public and in case you dont already start hanging out in our Gitter chat room Youll now be one of the public faces of the tldrpages project How does that sound Are you up for it The objective of this issue is to discuss a decision about the syntax of the token for the filenames in the examples written in the tldrpages As soon as there is a decision I could mass change the discarded token to the chosen one In this case I address the filename and filename token To know the current situation I run the next script to know the current state in the English pages bash grep o filename pagesmd grep o filename pagesmd wc l For filename there are results in English pages gist with the results and for filename there are results gist with the results I prefer to use filename not because it is the token more used but because if I am not wrong in English it is correct to use filename when we are talking about the name of the files in a computing context Wordreference definition What do you think about it Dear comrades this is a riot No just a joke that I need to did I hope you dont mind I would like to discuss about the emojis in commits messages Should we avoid its use I ask about it because mebeim ask me to not use emojis in commits messages in and then explained me his argues in The first thing I want to clarify is that it isnt about me or my commits If most of us agree to not use avoid it or using in a different way I will do it without any problems I usually use gitmoji with gitmojicli since a few time ago because I like the graphical way to summarizecategorize the commit But this is something I know that not all projects use and it is easy to not use because the commit message is done with gitmojicli and not git commit To summarize the opiniones given by mebeim and zdroid in The first one said the emoji dont add useful information and it is only rendered in specific environments and the second one said it could be at the end of the commit message to not make the commit message harder to read I have been using until now but as I said I can stop to use So should we avoiddont use emojis

documentation or a homepage if applicable In a I translated gitdiff a page where are examples for the command Should we remove one of them Maybe the fifth I refer to the one dedicated to show just the filenames of the changed files markdown Show only names of changed files since a given commit git diff nameonly commit This issue is very relevant for me due I am translating all the git commands to Spanish so I need to know if I should keep this in the Spanish translation or if we should change the English page to remove one and then commit another change removing it for the translation I did Thank you for reporting an issue Please review the following notes before submitting it Most issues on this repo are requests for new commands If its the case make sure to use the standard title page request command name and include a link to a web page about the command and if possible to an existing source of examplestyle documentation If your issue is with a particular client of tldr please raise the issue in the repo for that client For example if you are using the node client you would report the issue here If you have a general question or are not sure whether to open an issue please feel free to ask in our Gitter channel Currently the project has its own GitHub wiki Whats the use of it in the current state of project It seems most of the pages are quite outdated there although some of the pages arent present in the repository itself I see two issues with the sole existence of the Wiki lack of review system like the one we have for PRs duplication of information What are

command so I will mark it when I have all the commands translated This PR is a work in progress with the purpose to translate to Spanish all the git commands There are untranslated commands if I am not wrong so if you think I should translate just a batch of or commands warn me to keep in mind and stop to work in this PR when I reach the recommended limit for a batch in the PR
