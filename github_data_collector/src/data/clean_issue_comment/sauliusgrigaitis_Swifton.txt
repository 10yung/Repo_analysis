I appreciate your frankness and Im sure frustration of your remark IMPORTANT We dont see any way how to make web development as great as Ruby on Rails or Django with a very static nature of current Swift We hope that things will change at some point and we will return to active development Could you please expound upon this and provide more reasoning as to how and perhaps maybe why this is the case Personally Im curious about how Swift has this lockin when compared to Crystal albeit Crystal is modeled after Ruby and I can see somewhat the difference Im just hoping to see things through your eyes better after working on this so diligently as you have and to understand the walls you hit more clearly Using the last version of Swift Swift version dev When executing swift build Cloning HEAD is now at ee c f Merge pull request from webymaster Resolved version Cloning HEAD is now at c a Merge pull request from webymaster Resolved version Empty manifest file is not supported anymore Use swift package init to autogenerate error The package at bitnamiswiftSwiftonPackagesPathKitgit has no Packageswift for the specific version It seems that the version of the dependencies are correct If good Ill add tests I was thinking if its possible to map routes directly to methods of Controller For example routerget TodosControllerindex etc Resources can be implemented by adopting protocols Ie TodosController adopts Resource protocol and implements some or all of the protocols methods routerresources will expect a class which adopts that protocol Filtering can be implemented by looking up method names via reflection What do you think of this approach This is kind of the same as but that issue encompassed two issues All static files were returned in a response with a textplain mimeType Now fixed Media assets cant be returned because the following line failed swift Routerswift if let body Stringdatacontents encoding NSUTF StringEncoding Any file that is a jpeg or png etc Returns a nil body on this line which leads to this code returning a notFound Response swift Routerswift if let staticFile serveStaticFilenewRequest return staticFile as Response return notFoundnewRequest as Response So we are still having an issue with not returning media assets this isnt in line with the README Static assets JavaScript CSS images etc are loaded from Public directory by default This is crucial and needs to be fixed before Swifton can be useful I cant imagine a website without any media assets Im willing to investigate this much further but we may need to modify the router to return ResponseTypes from the router instead of Inquiline Response types Of course any other thoughts are welcome I started to add Cookies code here but actually it should be extracted to Middleware TodoApp is good starting point but would be really great to build fully featured app that developers could use as a reference Please suggest ideas and discuss about it here Few initial ideas TodoApp we can extend current TodoApp but its well know that a Todo App doesnt represent complexities that usual real world apps has ECommerce boring but definitely would help to findout missing features in Swifton New Startup this would be most exciting any hustlers here that would like to get their idea implemented TodoApp deploys on Heroku but for some reason templates are not found It could be working directory path issue so probably quickest solution would be to play with SwiftonConfigviewsDirectory variable Investigate and check what most important helpers do we need Investigate and findout how it can help
