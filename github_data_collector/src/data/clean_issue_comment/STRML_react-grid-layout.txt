I tried changing heights in CSS but It seems some internal problem Run on Replit This project was bootstrapped with Create React App Warning Failed prop type minHeight larger than item heightmaxHeight in GridItem created by ReactGridLayout in ReactGridLayout created by ResponsiveReactGridLayout in ResponsiveReactGridLayout created by WidthProvider in WidthProvider at tablelargejsx in CSSTransitionGroupChild created by TransitionGroup in span created by TransitionGroup in TransitionGroup created by CSSTransitionGroup in CSSTransitionGroup at tablelargejsx in TableLarge at tableleadboxcomponentjsx in div at tableleadboxcomponentjsx in TableLeadBox at leadboxcontainercomponentjsx in div at leadboxcontainercomponentjsx in div at leadboxcontainercomponentjsx in div at leadboxcontainercomponentjsx in LeadBoxContainer at Appjs in div at Appjs in App created by ConnectFunction in ConnectFunction at srcindexjs in Provider at srcindexjs MY applications is very huge Check Replit yarn install and yarn start and then click on L as show in the image button I have hosted this in heroku here featrender Add shouldComponentUpdate to ReactGridLayout GridItem This improves performance quite a bit in most cases is implemented safely to avoid breakage on equal arrays and objects To do so while avoiding the maintenance burden of keeping a keylist in sync with propTypes we read propTypes using babelpluginpreval then construct a function to do the fastest possible comparison This is a lot faster than isEqual while avoiding unnecessary comparison of eg children Supersedes pinging zaykaalexander Colleagues I want to note that the new version has ceased to support previously announced functionality v In particular it does not recount ResponsiveGridLayout when updating columns Please only submit bugs to this tracker If you have a feature request please implement it This is free software and the author is busy with other projects Please use the CodeSandbox Template to demonstrate your bug It is much easier for us to help you if you do screenshotzip May I know if it is possible to expand and shrink the components from all sides and corners just like gridster Please take a look at Gridster demo as reference on how it can be achieved Demo link below Angular Gridster Demo Hi there I am trying to implement a multi selection feature for RGL However I believe there isnt an easy way to do that without making relatively significant changes to the package Alternatively nested Grid would work but Id have to generate new absolute grid item values for the child grid and then convert it back after deselection Before I move into that direction can anybody suggest anything else Wed love to have your input Hello Thanks for creating and maintaining this awesome repo I am trying to add and remove custom classNames during some drag conditions however elementclasslistadd function or any other such as remove toggle do not fire when passed to onDragStart prop of GridLayout Component I have tried to test this function with other available event props too such as onDrag onDragStop and there are not any problems with them You can find the example code below Thanks for your time Onur Hi The ResponsiveReactGridLayout do not allow to forward a ref to the underlying ReactGridLayout This prevents keeping track of the number of columns and size of the layout for example To give a use case I want to display a placeholder grid behind the layout during edition so I need to know precisely its size I could compute it from a parent component but the most straightforward solution is using a ref to access the rowHeight cols and width props Ive implemented a working version for RRGL but I should probably open a PR for new versions with forwardRef I will need to implement this sooner or later anyway when I update my project to React Thanks again for your work on RRGL its been running strong for years in our project and provides an excellent user experience I found an error using the new drag and drop feature on firefox Sometimes reactgridlayout does not catch the drop event when I used on firefox You can check this issue by opening the link on firefox Demo Video This property will cause some performance issues I will manually disable userselect to optimize performance so I need a prop here
