 Issue Styles are broken in High contrast mode in the new chromium Edge browser but works in old Edge browser Root cause In old Edge the mshighcontrast media query implies mshighcontrastadjust none In newchromium Edge this is no longer the case and mshighcontrastadjust none needs to be set explicitly Fix Setting mshighcontrastadjust none is to ask the browser to not override those styles when high contrast is enabled We need to make sure we set mshighcontrastadjust none everywhere we set mshighcontrast from now on Describe the feature that you would like added Add pagination to DetailsList Its common for list component What component or utility would this be added to DetailsList Have you discussed this feature with our team and if so who no Additional contextscreenshots fill this out I am reading the docs specifically this page My understanding from this is that hover refers to the current component either parent or child but the hover always references the parent element Is this
