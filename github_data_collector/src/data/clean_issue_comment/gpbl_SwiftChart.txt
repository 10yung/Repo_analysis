Im trying to implement the touch to show the current value The problem is that Im getting use of unresolved identifier value when I try to add the text to my label The series are shown correctly in the Chart but Im not getting the value inside the indexes func didTouchChart chart Chart indexes Int x Float left CGFloat if dataResponsecount for seriesIndex dataIndex in indexesenumerated if dataIndex nil The series at seriesIndex is that which has been touched let value chartvalueForSeriesseriesIndex atIndex dataIndex let date dataDates dataIndex let type SensorTypegetSpecialCharactersensorTypes dataIndex lblValuetext value type date Ex C It used to work fine before but I dont know what happened I dont know what could be happening I was expecting this behavior d e adc e a c c This is a similar issue to The panning of the finger on the chart seems to interfere with the gesture recogniser responsible for dismissing the modally presented VC Whenever the motion of my fingers starts to go a bit vertical the VC starts to go downwards and the gesture recognisers on the chart all stop The install method was previously notated as pod SwiftChart but the correct input should be pod SwiftChart Added width parameter for lineSeries in order to be able to have different widths for different series Add framework for project Add Swift Package Manager support Packageswift file Make extension api only safe Hi this is a tiny change to the readme Thanks for this library The example code was still using CGRectZero but this has been renamed to CGRectzero Added an import statement to the example code getting crash in override func awakeFromNib superawakeFromNib chartdelegate self Here is Crash There seems to be bug somewhere with the pod installation Experienced with pod installation so it isnt my process as its a simple process anyway Only this module has this issue so it points to something with it Using the latest xcode and swift Cleaning the build folder and rebuilding results in same thing Using SwiftChart from cocoapods When building with xcode and Swift language set to I get this error kCALineJoinBevel has been renamed to CAShapeLayerLineJoinbevel Is it possible to fix it and update cocoapod Should be small change Hi As said in the title I try to use this function to get a vertical line showing value func didTouchChartchart Chart indexes ArrayInt x Float left CGFloat for serieIndex dataIndex in enumerateindexes if dataIndex nil The series at serieIndex has been touched let value chartvalueForSeriesserieIndex atIndex dataIndex But Xcode give me an error Any clue to fix that Thanks
