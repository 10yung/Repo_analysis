 It seems all of the tests you write must start from the beginning I want to write a class for testing specific view controller without any action on another screen Is there any solution This repo has been exceptionally helpful Thanks for making this Ive been running into a pickle especially while testing search on VCs in iOS where the search bar is embedded inside a navigation bar Neither appsearchFields or any child element under appnavigationBar reveal the relevant XCUIElement Is there a workaround for this I have run the tests provided within the project The fix is trivial the element being checked is a staticText but should actually be the navigationBar In func testDismissingASystemAlert there is code sample on how to write test for case when system dialog appears Location Services permission dialog This code works fine only if run once for the first time on particular device Reruns are not triggering system dialog to appear which is understandable this is how system works But this means I can only have one test to see what happens with my app in this test it is tapping Allow button There are at least two more cases besides tapping Allow button which can be tested first one is of course tapping Dont Allow button second one is pressing Home button Is it possible to rewrite this test so that system dialog appears every time a test is being run Im trying to simulate double pressing the home button to launch the socalled app switcher However it looks like voidpressButtonXCUIDeviceButtonbutton is not synchronous and calling ObjectiveC XCUIDevice sharedDevice pressButtonXCUIDeviceButtonHome would launch the home screen any way regardless of how quick the subsequent press follows Any idea or tips on how to accomplish this The is a small coding error expectationfor exists evaluatedWithObject nextGame handler nil This create a Argument labels do not match any available overloads error The correction is as follows expectationfor exists evaluatedWith nextGame handler nil
