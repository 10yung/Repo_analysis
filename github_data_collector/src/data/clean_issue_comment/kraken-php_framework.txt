Hey man i cant see any commit since you have abandonned project You have a verry good idea in your hand and i think you can create a better PHP world I am very interresting by this framework and if you need help tell me this framework is work on windows now As example mgp InstagramAPI It requires reacteventloop and reactsocket that leads to conflict with reactsocket which uses krakenphpnetwork through cbodenratchet i find out that cbodenratchet support reactsocket Can you update it please Hello I get these errors running php krakenserver Ive enabled the allowurlinclude in phpini and i also gave permissions to data folder These are the errors Throwable trace WarningError date It is not safe to rely on the systems timezone settings You are required to use the datetimezone setting or the datedefaulttimezoneset function In case you used any of those methods and you are still getting this warning you most likely misspelled the timezone identifier We selected the timezone UTC for now but please set datetimezone to select your timezone in LogProviderphp ExecutionException ServiceProvider Kraken Root Provider LogProvider raised an error in ServiceProvider ExecutionException ServiceProvider Kraken Root Provider LogProvider failed during registration in ServiceRegister ExecutionException ServiceRegister could not be booted in ServiceRegister InstantiationException Core module could not be booted in Core Stack trace throwable Kraken Throwable Error WarningError in ErrorHandler call Kraken Throwable ErrorHandlerhandleError date It is not safe to rely o homemakecompyvendorkraken Array in unknown call UndefineddateYmd in LogProvider call Kraken Root Provider LogProviderfilePathhomemakecompydataloglev emergency in LogProvider call Kraken Root Provider LogProvidercreateHandlerKraken Config Config emergency in LogProvider throwable Kraken Throwable Exception Runtime ExecutionException in ServiceProvider call Kraken Container ServiceProviderthrowExceptionKraken Throwable Error WarningError in ServiceProvider call Kraken Container ServiceProviderregisterProviderKraken Root Runtime Core ProcessCore in ServiceRegister throwable Kraken Throwable Exception Runtime ExecutionException in ServiceRegister call Kraken Container ServiceRegisterregisterProviders in ServiceRegister throwable Kraken Throwable Exception Runtime ExecutionException in ServiceRegister call Kraken Container ServiceRegisterboot in Core call Kraken Core CorebootProviders in Core throwable Kraken Throwable Exception Logic InstantiationException in Core call Kraken Core Coreboot in ProcessBoot call Kraken Root Runtime Boot ProcessBootboothomemakecompydata in krakenprocess main Killed Where is the problem Another issue running a php file using the Kraken script i get this error but i think is because krakenserver didnt start PHP Fatal error Cannot instantiate interface Kraken Loop LoopInterface Thanks Implement asynchronous Redis driver At the moment the console server is bugged Sometimes it stops working and needs restart to fix the most common problems but sometimes the message routing fails or it does not clean after itself Right now the best solution for this problem is not to use console but stick to alternative start method which in default configuration is php dataautorunkrakenprocess undefined Main Main This is the logic that works underneath projectcreate command and it is equal in use If there are any subprocesses or subthreads in Main they will also be fired The only con of this approach is that you will not be able to use console command therefore when shuting down the project you will need to kill all processes manually This is very urgent problem and should be prioritized to be done for the release of v At first Filesystem was added only for the need of reading and writing configuration files Then the additional abstracitons were added because they were easy to implement on top of leagues filesystem There is set of drawbacks of using this apporach and would be beneficial to reimplement it The proposal is Move current Filesystem Kraken Filesystem to Cloud Kraken Cloud namespace Implement async Filesystem in empty Kraken Filesystem None None None
