 I use a library ng bs modal and after upgrading my project to version xx the subscribe have no effect bsmodal modal bsmodal ViewChildmodal modal BsModalComponent thismodal onClosesubscribe consolelogclose Repo to reproduce In Google JavaScript Style Guide points to it should instead point to Im planning on using Webpack in the future and am currently on Webpack Id like to get the full benefit of treeshaking and want to make sure Im importing rxjs correctly in my projects First Webpack has a thing that restricts you to either cjs esm or any import format Webpack does not have this but does utilize treeshaking where it exists When I do js import bindCallback from rxjsobservablebindCallback Am I using the cjs method and treeshaking or will this automatically use esm if available From using other libraries like datefns I believe I have to do this instead js import bindCallback from rxjsesm observablebindCallback Is my assumption correct or do I keep calling imports like Ive always been doing the first example that caused documentation to display incorrectly The misleading BehaviourSubject name in line was replaced with correct BehaviorSubject Originally posted here but was told it belongs in this repo Thank you for raising your concerns we appreciate your feedback and contributions to this repository Before you continue consider the following If you have a How do I do question it is better for you and for us that this question is placed in StackOverflow or some chat channel This way you are making it easier for others to learn from your experiences too These Issues are meant only for technical problems bugs and proposals related to the library If your issue is a bug please follow the format below RxJS version rxlite Code to reproduce js const Rx requirerxlite RxObservableof repeat subscribei consolelogonnext i Expected behavior Either throw an error or repeat or times Actual behavior Repeats infinitely logs onnext onnext onnext onnext etc infinitely Additional information I understand that it doesnt make so much sense to pass a non natural number to repeat In our case the repeat count was calculated dynamically which made it unclear that this was an issue I realize this isnt a problem in later or nonlite versions just leaving this info here for future googlers I was helping someone with rxjs v and they pointed me to an issue ticket on this repo because they thought the disclaimer was about where to download the latest version not that this is the old repo bower install rxjs this command installs rxjs is there a bower command to install latest rxjs i guess im the first one to ask for it i need to figure out how to get away from bower sad face I bumped into the problem with lettable operators in particular with timer For instance this import rxjsaddoperatorcatch still works and even changes Observable object globally so theres no need to import that catch again in a certain ts file once it is imported in project module file And this import rxjsaddobservabletimer doesnt work anymore instead import timer rxjsobservabletimer should be used and it doesnt modify Observable object it is used as an independent function and it cannot be imported globally it should be imported in each ts file individually if it is needed Why is import rxjsaddoperatorcatch still in use and has its counterpart of import catchError from rxjsoperatorscatchError and import rxjsaddobservabletimer is no longer in use Is there any documentation on the topic On the import syntax migration Thank you
