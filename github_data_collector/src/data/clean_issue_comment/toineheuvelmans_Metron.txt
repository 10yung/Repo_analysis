It is nice to have this feature If you should choose to pursue implementing a Bezier cubic curve my repository CeranPaulSketchCurves has class Cubic that could be helpful to you I havent spent any time on a quadratic curve but can see the usefulness of that for importing and exporting SVGs My repository needs to have its Ellipse class fleshed out Ill be in touch when I have something useful Paul Metron is a lovely little library and has saved me a ton of time Circle works for some cases but not for ellipses Seeing this officially supported would be great Added a function that returns the two intersection points of overlapping circles img
