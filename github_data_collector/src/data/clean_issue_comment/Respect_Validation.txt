valid ValidatorCurrencyCodevalidate RESULT TRUE This should be documented somewhere it took a while to find out How to pass the extra parameter to the ruleName like maxminValue inclusive true vkeyValuemincount max maxcount if I want to pass inclusive as false what should I do Refer PSR Hi I have an issue using the minValue and maxValue messages I use as follows v notEmpty numeric not v negative min max I pass errors to my class translator by calling the translate method The class translator works because using v notEmpty length I expect to get a value of in minValue and get it But when using v notEmpty numeric not v negative min max I expect in minValue as in the documentation for min and in maxValue as in the documentation for max and then try to use minValue and maxValue in the text of the translation similar to length but instead I get The value has to be not more maxValue or The value has to be not less minValue Those these values do not fall into the translator What could be the problem My security scanner is giving me suspicious code warnings from your code File Location wpcontentpluginstainacanvendorrespectvalidationlibraryRulesAbstractCompositephp Found issues

I did something wrong User RCooler has opened issue and this PR is a small addition in PostalCodephp containg regex for Cayman Islands KY Hi Within your Message localization last sentence states that Note that getMessage will keep the original message But when i apply translation even getMessage returns the translated message Below is the sample code PHP php namespace MyApp use Respect Validation Validator as v use Respect Validation Exceptions ValidationException class Validation public static function myTranslator return Translated Message name must contain only letters az and some allowed chars are additionalChars public static function testValvalue try valpha notEmptysetNameName checkvalue catchValidationException e esetParamtranslator MyApp ValidationmyTranslator vardumpegetMessage vardumpegetMainMessage return true res ValidationtestValJohn Even your original template contains extra double quotes around additionalchars variable Example php vageformatdmYage validate is false the format argument its useful for validate the value format Example php vminimumAge formatdmYvalidate is true the format argument its useful for format the value Changed regex for IL to allow and digits Reason In after the introduction of the digit codes digit codes were still being used widely
