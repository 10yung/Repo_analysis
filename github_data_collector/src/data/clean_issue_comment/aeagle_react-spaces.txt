Hi aeagle our team investigated and we found it to be a problem when resizabletrue and scrollabletrue both are enabled This change in the Spacetsx file helped fix it Please review Note Please ignore the whitespaces in the diff Hi aeagle we have a requirement where we need a custombuilt ResizeHandle component So could we have a way in which we can pass a custom component via props Something like this probably SpaceLeft resizabletrue resizeHandleComponent size Describe the bug I have a site where I have a sidebar that people can toggle between being shown on the right and on the bottom When I toggle between these by changing the element from SpaceRightResizable to SpaceBottomResizable the new situation is calculated as if the old sidebar was still in place To Reproduce See Press Toggle side a few times and see the sidebar eat away more and more of the main content Expected behavior I expect the sidebar to be placed in accordance to the surrounding SpaceViewport without taking into account the old sidebar element Strangely enough when you switch between a SpaceRightResizable and no element the calculation does use the new situation Desktop please complete the following information OS eg iOS Ubuntu Browser eg chrome safari Chrome Version eg In the example when I openclose the Left Pinnable pane the constructor of Sample labelLeft Pinnable is called everytime component is recreated when resizabletrue This is causing my component Sample to lose its state When you set resizablefalse constructor of Sample labelLeft Pinnable is not called If I have a space I want its height to be whatever height the content needs it to be Then other spaces move with respect to that space I can of course do this myself by getting the size of the rendered component and then setting the size of your space etc However this would be a great built in feature
