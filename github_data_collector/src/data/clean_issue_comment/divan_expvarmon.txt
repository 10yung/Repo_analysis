Im trying to run it on MacOs recieving this expvarmon ports zsh command not found expvarmon thanks For Issue Added new KindDurationString and updated Kind and Format Gave KindDurationString the same color as KindDuration In Update if we have a KindDurationString try to parse it to an int I have a number of stats that export as a duration string such as uptime m s or averagerequesttime ms These dont generate spark lines nor are their max really valid How about an additional var type durationstr that parses the duration back into an int for comparisonsparkline but still displays with the duration string representation for labeling I cant find a way to monitor a variable located in an object inside an array see the following JSON Blah DeviceStatus Descr Foo ConnectionStatus false Descr Bar ConnectionStatus false I tried with expvarmon varsFooBlahDeviceStatus ConnectionStatus but the UI gives me BlahDeviceStatus ConnectionStatus NA Adds support for accepting multiple vars flags This is useful for other scripts to construct vars flags I also found it to be easier on eyes when you look at it Moves the maingo into cmdexpvarmon This way people can install different versions of executables and use expvarmon as a library It also fixed undefined DefaultEndpoint when I tried to run the main Also I would create another cmdexpvardummon or any other names you like to separate the dummy prints with the normal ones Please note that I passed the interval to constructors for the following reasons It is a configuration value Once it is set it is not supposed to be changed hence unexported variable Hi Given the following snippet go package main import expvar nethttp func main m expvarNewMaptest mAdd x httpListenAndServe nil Expvarmon stops showing results all together You can add a sleep time before the add and observe it only happens when the string is added I cant seem to have it report the number of goroutines in my running process I am using the varsGoroutines I do see memory stats expvarmon ports varsGoroutinesmemmemstatsHeapInuse The submission introduces new flag theme There are to possible values dark default value current helloworld theme and default theme based on terminal settings Im curious if there is any way to use expvarmon inside my own program I want to deploy one binary on the server and give admin view whats going on eg When Ill run my expvarmon it should run expvarmon tool with all variables set
