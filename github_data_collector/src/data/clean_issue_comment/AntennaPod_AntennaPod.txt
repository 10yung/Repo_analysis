This has been nagging me for a while I love chapters but most podcasts do not have them But I keep on hoping and swipe to the rd fragment to find empty chapters Since most podcasts do not have chapter markers this pull request will hide the rd fragment for chapters if an episode does not have chapters but it will show the chapter markers if the playing episode has them This podcast This Week In Startups has chapter markers if you wanted to test Most other podcasts do not have chapter markers ScreenShot at PM I am currently using LineageOS for Xperia XZ Compact For some odd reason I cant select external storage for my podcasts Should fix Is there anything more that needs to be done fix In the iTunes search feed use artistName In the RSS feed from iTunes use summary In GpodnetPodcast and Fyyd use description Gpoddernet search img width altScreen Shot at PM src Fyyd img width altScreen Shot at PM src Browsing on iTunes img width altScreen Shot at PM src Advance search on iTunes img width altScreen Shot at PM src Expected behaviour When I search on my podcast app it should be be smart enough to default to the local iTunes country On this line in file ItunesPodcastSearcherjava ITUNESAPIURL We should change to with country char country code docs from Apple Current behaviour It currently searches from the default iTunes app but maybe there is a way to default to the country specific iTunes store first App version b from Google play Android version Device model Nokia Install and open antennapod Import this db file Import is successful App restarts and has the podcasts Close app Open app Expected behaviour App should open Current behaviour App immediately crashes First occurred downgraded from beta version to stable today tried to import my db file Is there a good reason why we can only change the playback speed between and I think Pocket Casts allows speeds between x and x Sometimes eg if you have quickly speaking foreign language speakers you may want speeds lower than times and sometimes you have some blabber podcasts with slow speakers in your mother language which you would like to listen in even faster than times speed Problem you are having The first screen of AntennaPod is not user friendly for the nontech person Compared with other apps the first screen lacks a discovery process without going to search Suggested solution From the first screen taps to value or a listen Right now it takes taps if I wanted to listen to one of the top podcasts I suggest that we start adding the top iTunes categories by country and by category moving the add Podcast by URL to the top right with a button move advance search also to the top right behind and OPML input back into Settings or behind Categories from gpoddernet should be removed because the names are misspelled random and doesnt give AntennaPod a good image A Screenshots Drawings Technical details Example from the Podcast Player app from CastBox to get value with taps Open the app A scrolling list of category with a more link Tab and listen immediately for value and preview Screen Shot at PM Screen Shot at PM A Screen Shot at PM Steps to reproduce Search for podcast in Google playstore There are a bunch of apps and AtntennaPod is below many other apps with lower rating and with less downloads I notice AntennaPod does not include the words podcast in the name or in the publisher Suggestion During the publication to the Google Play store change the name to include the work podcast name AntennaPod Podcast Player Free Fast No Ads Publisher AntennaPod Podcast For Everyone community supported I think this will help with Google search ranking in Google Playstore Problem you are having When I search for a podcast using the iTunes search the URLs of the feed is returned along with the title of the podcast The URL doesnt help me decide whether I will subscribe instead the description artistName field is the right information to return Suggested solution Replace the feedurl in the search result with the description artistName Screenshots Drawings Technical details Take this as an example from BeyondPod img width altScreen Shot at PM src ByteHamster what do you think if I get a PR for the search result UI and the browsing UI to include the description
