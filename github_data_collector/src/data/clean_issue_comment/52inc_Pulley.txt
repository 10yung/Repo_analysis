How to add my own elements like a button in PulleyViewController I created it in my storyboard but didnt show when App runs Download the sample app open the drawer to the fully open position and then change the value of allowsUserDrawerPositionChange to false The drawer will glitch pts downward For some reason changing the value of drawerScrollViewisScrollEnabled is messing up the content offset so I simply saved the content offset before the isScrollEnabled change and reset it to the same value after without animation and this fixed the visual bug Using IB it would appear that the pull gesture does not work with OSX Catalyst The functionality works perfectly on iOS and iPadOS Builds however Screenshot Hey guys Im having problems with dynamic type in combination with Pulley Ive put a simple autolayouted UITableView into my drawer VC When I change the font size in Settings Accessibility Display Text Size Larger Text before starting the app everything works fine However if the app is already running and I change the font size it doesnt update the UILabels in my table view accordingly It seems like UIContentSizeCategorydidChangeNotifications are not passed to the drawer VC Ive already tried observing this notification in the UITableViewCell and calling viewlayoutIfNeeded but that doesnt solve the issue Do you have any idea how to fix this I had case when Drawer provided puller tip at the top of drawer body with transparent background In result I get something like this IMG I know there is an option to make custom shape but I thought that delegating that stuff to a drawer could be a nice idea IMG Hey guys I have an issue I cant seem to rectify I have a UITabBarController with tabs one of those tabs is a PulleyViewController The primary controller is a UINavigationController when I click on the tab everything is in order but when I go to another tab and then return the primary controller goes blank shows a white view I managed to fix it by making the primary controller the top view controller of the navigation controller but thats not what I want I tried adding Pulley with Carthage and while it sort of works i cant tap the map that i drew behind the drawer eg class MyViewController UIViewController override func viewDidLoad let drawer UIViewController UIViewController drawerviewbackgroundColor red let main UIViewController let mv MKMapView mvtranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints false mainviewaddSubviewmv mvleftAnchorconstraintequalTo mainviewleftAnchorisActive true mvrightAnchorconstraintequalTo mainviewrightAnchorisActive true mvtopAnchorconstraintequalTo mainviewtopAnchorisActive true mvbottomAnchorconstraintequalTo mainviewbottomAnchorisActive true let pulley PulleyViewControllercontentViewController main drawerViewController drawer pulleyallowsUserDrawerPositionChange false pulleydisplayMode automatic pulleypanelCornerPlacement topRight pulleyviewtranslatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints false selfviewaddSubviewpulleyview pulleyviewleftAnchorconstraintequalTo selfviewleftAnchorisActive true pulleyviewrightAnchorconstraintequalTo selfviewrightAnchorisActive true pulleyviewtopAnchorconstraintequalTo selfviewtopAnchorisActive true pulleyviewbottomAnchorconstraintequalTo selfviewbottomAnchorisActive true The area below my red drawer cant be interacted with eg if i double tap it then the mapview doesnt zoom in It seems that the PulleyPassthroughScrollView doesnt pass the hits down somehow It works fine in demo app but that uses Storyboards Any ideas on what i did wrong Hey so the pulley itself is great but I have a little issue I am transforming the primary view by degrees the drawer as well everything works well But when I want to constraint my elements in the primary view the top and bottom layout guides dont work and I cant use safe area below IOS So when I constraint my element to the top with constant it is on top of the notification bar how can I get the transformation to account the top and bottom safe areas correctly below IOS Dont default to collapsed state when current drawer position isnt supported
