TestCafe Related issues This seems to be an old promblem but I think is quite important This bug makes SweetAlert useless as a replacement for the Windowprompt method Also note that this problem seems to occur even with the official example Try the second example under Example code documentgetElementByIdbtnonclick function swalTest default value buttons cancel true ok value Button value content element input attributes value Default value thenresult consolelogresult Expected behavior If the input text is changed the new value should be passed as the result If the input text is unchanged the default value should be passed as the result What happens If input text is changed and Enter button is pressed the new value is passed as expected This is ok If the Enter button is pressed without making any changes NULL value is passed If the Ok button is pressedclicked the BUTTON value gets passed regardless of whether the input text was changed or not I have a JQkeyboard jquery plugin in my web application It works well in other textbox but not the input field in sweetalert Any solution for this Hi I would like to like to test my sweet alert pop up in Visual Studio with Selenium Below is my code WebDriverFindElementByIdbtnsubmitClick WebDriverFindElementByXPathdiv classsweetalert showSweetAlert visible var confirmbutton WebDriverFindElementByXPathbutton classconfirm confirmbuttonClick However there is exception thrown which is unable to locate my XPath for sweet alert please let me know on the correction of the syntaxsweet alert classlocation Hello everyone First of all I want to say thank you to all devs working on it because its a must have There is one small thing I need to do with Sweetalert redirect to another page ideally using laravel route when we click a specific button Im using a switch to make multiple step alert generating one sweetalert at a time By specific button I mean the cancel button and another one with catch Can someone help me on this Best regards It would be great if SweetAalert implements a Loading Alert Just to show an alert dialog with no buttons and a loading image while we perform some background tasks I have tried to do it using ajax but it doesnt work This will be an excellent option for this amazing tool Hi We are using sweetalert in our project Recently we did a HP Fortify Scan and found a vulnerability in the sweetalertminjs the origin for pushMessage is which flags as Overly Permissive Message Policy during the scan Is there a fix for this This issue is flagged as Low Severity Thanks I need onClose to run when the user clicks outside the sweet alert or on confirm but not on cancel The cancel button makes an async call which calls another sweet alert I have tried the following setups First this MySwalfire type success showCancelButton userId new onClose if userId new historypushusers thenmyswallResult if myswallResultdismiss MySwalDismissReasoncancel return sendWelcomeEmailresultdataid thenemailResult MySwalfire type success onClose if userId new historypushusers catcherr MySwalfire type error onClose if userId new historypushusers Then this MySwalfire type success showCancelButton userId new onClose if userId new historypushusers thenmyswallResult if myswallResultdismiss MySwalDismissReasoncancel sendWelcomeEmailresultdataid thenemailResult MySwalfire type success onClose if userId new historypushusers catcherr MySwalfire type error onClose if userId new historypushusers But instead of waiting the second sweet alert it pushes to users before
