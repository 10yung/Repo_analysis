The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

Security Alerts page details update code Which big cow told me how to install and run Thank you Web newbie here I was trying to yarn lint in client but ran into errors and got it fixed Perhaps there could be some intro for this by referring to this setup Also there are plenty errors after running it should they get fixed Id like to help on above but please kindly suggest a way that I could do it and contribute Hey this is a really cool app that I guess a lot of people incl me would learn from Would be nice if there is some slightly more detailed documentation on how to forge this app Cheers Hey this PR adds support for Gitpod a free online dev environment that wee built to simplify contributions and generally working on GitHub projects It allows anyone to get a readytocode dev environment for any branch issue and pull request with a single click resp by prefixing the GitHub URL with gitpodio img width altScreenshot at src You can try it out on my branch The workspace is configured so that four processes are started automatically in distinct terminals mongodb server client yarn gentypeswatch client yarn start I also made it open the website in the preview automatically once it gets served You can reach the graphql interface port as well See the Open Ports tab on the bottom Also I made it open the developmentenvjson on startup and update the server URL so that people see they have to insert more tokens It seems to work well but of course you might have better ideas how a perfect dev environment for fullstack should look like Let me know whether you like it and how I should improve further Also Im happy to support this in future too PS Gitpod unleashed its full potential when you install the GitHub app It will prebuild all branches incl PRs so when you open a workspace you dont have to wait for the build The app is also capable of adding buttons to issues For instance you can configure it to add a button to all first timer welcome issues I made my fork use a prebuild which is why the yarn install has already happened when you open it Without prebuilds the init part in tasks will be executed everytime how can make the run client Err Module not found Cant resolve configdevelopmentenvjson in Make result is an array and skip duplicate code What will you recommend Replace all exist mongo codes with dynamodb client sdk or write a seperate dynamodb lib and freely switch with configuration between mongodb and dynamodb
