of RPMs which requires different handler Modular rpms have been introduced in RHEL and Fedora Modular rpms are stored in rpm database but to be able to tell if given modular rpm is vulnerable we need to know which module contains given rpm Module name and streams are used as an rpm namespace IMPORTANT I was not able to test the new Photon OS driver with a running instance of Clair I tried to do it using clairscanner but they dont support API version issue Please provide me with feedback and if you can test it against a running Clair instance Currently Photon OS is not supported by Clair and it

new version of Photon is released Clair will automatically support it I started my work based on issue Signedoffby Martin Vrachev mvrachevvmwarecom It seems that the latest clair does not support archlinux pacman package scanning Postgres has the ability to configure readonly streaming replicas but by the current Clair startup attempts a number of operations that do not work on these readonly
