Dear sir I try to use the back trajectory functions to draw picture I try to use param mapres to change the base map You give us three chioce in this parameter TRUEhires and state but I want to use a higher resolution base map which have the states boundary in my study region like the mapres state I see the source code of the openair package but I still dont know how this function run Maybe my IT skill is poor So could you tell me how to change the base map to my needs if the openair package has this function now Thanks Dear sir I have the precalculated back trajectories for my location stored I am not able to import the precalculated back trajectory into the system The response is coming like this Kindly help me l itraj importTrajsite newmanali year local cuserspavan adityaDocumentsRTrajProc Error in UseMethodclose no applicable method for close applied to an object of class character Hi When using the percentileRose function sometimes white bars occur in the center of the plot What do these bars mean Should they be removed and how can they be removed Thanks in advance minimal working example using example data df readcsvOpenAirexampledatalongcsv libraryopenair percentileRosemydata df exampleWhiteCenter Hi Last few days Ive been using the function importKCL it was working but today after typing for instance mary importKCLsite my year Ive got this error Error in loadcon the input does not start with a magic number compatible with loading from a connection This is the version used platform x w mingw arch x os mingw system x mingw status major minor year month day svn rev language R versionstring R version nickname Action of the Toes Regards Uziel Good morning I have had an issue when trying to plot one particular month in the timePlot I want to look at one pollutant and Stack they years for October to see how things vary over the years Generally it works but there are formatting issues The pane on the left of each plot normally displays or used to the year for which the data relates to More importantly the bottom left corner of each plot displays Oct but no other ticks along the x axis This will not change no matter what nuber of datebreaks or dateformat combination is used Has anyone found a way around this I am running openair in RStudio The code I am using is something like timePlotselectByDatemydatamonth pollutant benzene stack TRUE Hi David Im wondering what kind of distance measure is used to calculate clustering with corPlot and if some references are available Thanks for the info and for openair Paolo Hi Prof davidcarslaw When I use the selection of windflow in the timePlot the error In maxdat ws narm TRUE no nonmissing arguments to max returning Inf occurs and the corresponding erros appears in the figure as Error using package x and units have length The corresponding codes are as follows timePlotphotochemicalperiodpollutantcO wswdwindflow listcol grey lwd scale Thus how to solve this problem Also how to use the windflow in the timePlot Thanks a lot Best wishes Gen Hi I was used to plot timeseries with timePlot several variables ungrouped Very useful In the openair version the function automatically adjusted the ylim for each variable so that it was possible to display variables with different ranges Now Im migrating to openair an the ylimits are fixed they are the same for the different variables so that it is not possible to display eg pressure and temperature Am I missing something Thank you very much Hi I use the openair package a lot for air quality analysis so thanks heaps for developing it I live in the southern hemisphere and previously Ive had no issues with using hemispheresouthern when using typeseason in a function More often now it doesnt seem to work and the seasons end up wrongly labelled in the plots For example the command below produced the following image scatterPlotseas xsoiyiod typeseason hemispheresouthern linearTRUE Scatterplothemsouthern Winter here is JJA and summer is DJF Has something changed or is there something Im missing The timeAverage function is also not labeling the seasons correctly for the southern hemisphere in the resulting dataframe I use openair for other types of analyses which often include rainfall It would be really useful to have sum as an option in the statistics call so that I can get monthlyseasonal totals of rainfall from the daily data Regards Kathleen Hello I am using the openair package version to analized air quality monitoring data In particular I am interested to use the function TheilSen I have already installed the openair package version as is shown in the figure OpenAir When I try to use the TheilSen function I get an error see figure below In R studio Screenshot And in R Screenshot The data that I used for this is the following the time is in TUC format mydata zip All the best
