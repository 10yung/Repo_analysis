Nice Carousel Thanks for Your amazing work I have a little bug found If the pictureurl contains any whitespaces it will not be displayed For instance picturejpg returns to display But this htmlinsert for whitespaces let the images not shown in the swiper Whats the reason This is a multiple allowed x bug enhancement featurediscussion RFC Swiper Version v PlatformTarget and Browser Versions All platformsbrowsers tested on Chrome on Linux Live Link or JSFiddleCodepen or website with isssue Tried putting a Codepen together but wasnt successful its not that I wasnt able to reproduce the problem I just couldnt get the slider to work properly at all What you did Setup a slider consisting of multiple variablewidth images that utilize the lazyloading functionality in Swiper along with setting slidesPerView auto Expected Behavior For the slides to be correctly positioned at all times no matter if lazy loading of variablewidth images is used or not Actual Behavior The slides get incorrect offsets Both on initial load since things go wrong as soon as one image has lazily loaded and as you start swipingnavigating Temporary Solution Use the lazyImageReady event to update Swiper using the internal function updateSlides as well as the function slideTo javascript on lazyImageReady function Swiper doesnt update the positioning of the slides once a lazy image has actually loaded which causes them to get incorrect offsets This is only a problem when the slides vary in size which is the case here since we load images of varying widths Fix it by using the internal function updateSlides as well as running slideTo to the current slide after every lazy image has finished loading thisupdateSlides thisslideTothisactiveIndex false this snippet goes inside of your Swiper config see the API docs for info on how to use events this way I might try again later to put a codepen together but no matter what Id be willing to help out fixing this as long as I can get some more insight into the codebase and whether my temp solution is along the correct lines I mean it works so Id think it should be x bug enhancement featurediscussion RFC Swiper Version PlatformTarget and

Expected Behavior When changing to another slide on the left to a slide with a lower index the inlinestyle width of the first displayed slide is set on the related DOM element as it is done for all other slides in the DOM Actual Behavior When changing to another slide on the left to a slide with a lower index the inlinestyle width of the first displayed slide is sometimes often not set on the related DOM element It is only recalculated when forcing an update by doing some further action or when calling swiperupdate in the swipertransitionEnd event missingslide This is a multiple allowed bug Swiper Version Latest PlatformTarget and Browser Versions All major browsers Working scrollbar Video demo Nonworking scrollbar What you did Downgrading Swiper from to will fix the issue with the scrollbar not being draggable Issue persists in all versions post Is caused by change in Line to Supportjs Commit ID is df dc Expected Behavior Swiper scrollbar is to be draggable Actual Behavior Scrollbar behaviour breaks despite scrollbar draggable true being set This is a multiple allowed x bug enhancement featurediscussion RFC Swiper Version Swiper and above PlatformTarget and Browser Versions Chrome Firefox and likely other browsers What you did Use Swiper within a shadow DOM Expected Behavior Seeing the icon font rendered in the prev next buttons Actual Behavior No icons are shown instead the texts prev and next are visible This seems to be more like a browser bug Seems like fontface isnt supported at all within shadow DOM Im reporting it here anyway just in case since Swiper uses the icon font by default since v Chrome bug report Other issues related to fonts within shadow DOM This was asked before here and was closed as answered but I dont see what the full answer was The suggestion that Just add some HTML Markup inside the Slide Div like div classswiperslide img srcimage div classcaptionyour Textdiv div Doesnt work when I try it Im using demo I then added the text css from demo to demo and still no captiontext displays tried it with both class names text caption What Im looking for is ability for text to display over the image ideally with some timed transition so that the full image can be seen for a moment before the text appears perhaps with an opacity layer behind the text so that it can be read more easily This is a bug enhancement featurediscussion RFC Swiper Version PlatformTarget and Browser Versions All well as many as poss Live Link or JSFiddleCodepen or website with isssue none yet PS I asked the question here as it had already been asked If its better askeddealtwith in Stack Overflow please let me know Tks for any helpguidance This is a x bug enhancement featurediscussion RFC Swiper Version You can see this on Swipers own demo What you did Use the mouse to drag slides when you get to the end the slides get stuck and the next navigation arrow isnt in the disabled state Expected Behavior To spring back like it does when you try and go back from the first slide Actual Behavior The slides get stuck and the next navigation arrow isnt in the disabled state Hi slightlysmilingface This PR simplifies code
