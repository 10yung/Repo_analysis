Hi I am getting types being removed stating they are unused this is not my case for example myapi packagejson new typings added unused typings removed typesredlock typesioredis typesexpress unused I installed typesexpress manually and my code is using it for the Request Interface I am not required to install express as its another library that is exposing it and it has express in its own deps Could we avoid removing types or put it under a argument so maybe something like this myapi packagejson new typings added unused typings found typesredlock typesioredis typesexpress unused To remove unused typings please run typesync passing u So we would need to run npx typesync u to remove unused types What do you think For instance when I had a dependency of bcrypt it gave me typesbcrypt alpha which is years old The latest version of typesbcrypt is actually This may already be possible with yarn but it would be nice to be able to have typesync search for type packages to install before installing a requested package so they all get installed at the same time Would seem that is required for this on npm might also work
