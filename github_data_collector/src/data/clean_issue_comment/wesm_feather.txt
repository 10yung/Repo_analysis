I need to save feather data in a more compact format After making several tests I found that after using the zip function the size of the feather data file reduce up to So there is a simple question does anyway to save data as a feather file with let say argument like compressed zip to save disk space libraryfeather libraryzip Write data in feather format writefeatherdf datafeather Write data in zip feather format zipdatafeatherzip datafeather How to have commands like these ones without using disk space for temp file writefeatherdf datafeatherzip format zip df readfeatherdatafeatherzip format zip Thanks Im trying to use feather to transfer large dataframes between R and Python However reading data fails after some size Below is a brief reproducible example seqs paste repA collapse N

feather output is of type labeled in a format I understand to be identical to that produced by the haven package feather seems to strip off the labels or at least I do not see them If they are there is there a way to make them visible if they are not there is there any way for me to get them there Hope so because Man these feather files are like lightning Hi I am using python for NLP and feather

catPlatformendian little Hello there Thanks for this amazing format I really like the interoperability between Python and R I wonder if the following is a bug When I create a large file with pandas and I write to disk using tofeather then killing the processing makes me UNABLE to delete the file from my folder Windows complains that the file is still in use in python although the processing has stopped permanently This is annoying because it seems I must restart my session to break the link with Python Am I missing something here Thanks could inplace type coercion or promotion be applied
