Since there are so few comments and the wiki is in terrible shape is FIDO dead I am facing issue in compiling the code and begin installation As I am getting couldnot found AesCryptocs error I checked the github history and found it was deleted Please let me know how I an compile the code I tried to run this Windows there is no installation file Linux Even after changing the permissions using chmod x file it says permission denied for all cs files Please help asap Thanks and Regrads Hello Developers I am a graduate student at SJSU and for our senior project my team and I were thinking of contributing to FIDO open source project I had a question which I hope the developers do not mind addressing I noticed in the wiki it mentioned that BroSnort were listed in the in progressplanned category Before we begin our work have you guys already began working on integrating these detectors I would greatly appreciate a response back Thank You Prabhdeep Singh Hi there Im a researcher studying software evolution As part of my current research Im studying the implications of opensourcing a proprietary software for instance if the project succeed in attracting newcomers Fido was in my list However I observed that the software history of when the software was developed as a proprietary software was not kept after the transition to Github Knowing that software history is indispensable for developers eg developers need to refer to history several times a day I would like to ask Fido developers the following four brief questions Why did you decide to not keep the software history Do the core developers faced any kind of problems when trying to refer to the old history If so how did they solve these problems Do the newcomers faced any kind of problems when trying to refer to the old history If so how did they solve these problems How does the lack of history impacted on software evolution Does it placed any burden in understanding and evolving the software Thanks in advance for your collaboration Gustavo Pinto PhD schema and sqlite db files for fido columns created for each table row entries created in config and configshistoricalevents tables Please update Im not sure in what context the class is used but the method of encryption in FidoFidoSupportCryptoAESCryptocs is insecure as outlined by this StackOverflow question Also there is no recognition of the original author of the class which I believe is copied almost verbatim from this StackOverflow answer The original author should get recognition even if it is a bugged implementation Copying it directly and adding your own copyright notice on it is in direct violation of its license Creative Commons under which all StackOverflow content is licensed In FidoDirectorDirectorHelperTheDirectorHostDetectioncs source the line if sHostname null sHostname StringEmpty in HostDetection method is buggy the case is impossible to succeed Find one to review this projects codes There are many bugs Leave using email as the error logger and find a cleaver way Also leave using Console as the main trace environment Recheck Responsegroup method It has really buggy if statements
