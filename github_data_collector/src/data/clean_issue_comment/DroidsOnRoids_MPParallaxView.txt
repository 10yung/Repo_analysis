I havent looked closer to the code currently no time for that but I found an issue caused by the release animation Its better visible with the the Interstellar view Keep swiping up the view and releasing it for about times After that the images inside the parallax view will have a smaller width and height than its super view and reveal white edges I just cleaned some unused lines of code to make it little easier to read
