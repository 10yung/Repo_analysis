r Installing package into as lib is unspecified ERROR dependency rayrender is not available for package rayshader removing In R CMD INSTALL Error in ip converted from warning installation of package rayshader targz had nonzero exit status I installed rayrender manually but just wanted to inform you Hello Firstly thanks so much for your time in developing this package I think Im going to be a heavy user of this package over the coming months and years This is a general question rather than an issuefeature request I was wondering how easy it would be to simulate treeswoodlandforest using rayshader I am an ecologist working with bats and Im looking at ways of representing the locations of bat roosts in individual trees across a landscape I have a DEM of my area of extent and point data of the location of individual trees important to the study It would be good if I could add a generic tree or even a simple cone on the landscape at these points to represent each roost I can then label these features with the builtin annotation functionality Many thanks Simon I was wondering about d printing some graphs so blind people could feel the data but the text on plots labels axis text title wont pass to the stl file So this is my suggestion is there any possibility of giving the text some relief so we could print the complete graph Maybe even changing the font to Braille and making it in relief so its perfect for blind people Any other ideas Not sure if this is a bug or the way plotgg interacts with ggplot themes and axis lines etc which isnt clear to me Producing a plotgg plot with the cowplot package loaded produces axis lines which extend away from the plot Expected result Result when cowplot is loaded libraryggplot libraryrayshader Fake some data years days df expandgridyearsdays dfval rnormnrowdf ggplot p ggplotdfaesxVar yVar fillval geomraster scalefilldistillerpalette GL rayshader plot plotggpmulticoreTRUEwidth height scale Load cowplot and plotgg again librarycowplot plotggpmulticoreTRUEwidth height scale Session Info R version Platform x w mingw x bit Running under Windows x build Matrix products default locale LCCOLLATEEnglishAustralia LCCTYPEEnglishAustralia LCMONETARYEnglishAustralia LCNUMERICC LCTIMEEnglishAustralia attached base packages stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base other attached packages cowplot rayshader ggplot loaded via a namespace and not attached progress tidyselect xfun purrr colorspace miniUI htmltools rlang manipulateWidget pillar later glue withr RColorBrewer jpeg foreach plyr stringr munsell gtable htmlwidgets codetools labeling knitr doParallel httpuv crosstalk parallel Rcpp xtable scales promises webshot jsonlite mime hms bmp png packrat digest stringi tiff dplyr shiny grid tools magrittr rgl lazyeval tibble crayon readbitmap pkgconfig prettyunits imager assertthat rstudioapi iterators R igraph compiler I think the dims are passed in the incorrect order This breaks my overlay I describe the issue here See There is a wateralpha argument but for some bathymetry applications it would be nice to see through the land I can get part of the way there by cutting out the land but this requires some careful manipulations Is it possible to set a solidalpha Im fairly new to R but managed to get a working R environment running in a Jupyter notebook Im able to plot my dataset with ggplot just fine but plotgg hangs at the same point after loading the X window Ive attached an image for reference I can supply extra environment information if you let me know what to do Thanks x scrot Hello I am currently working on an xyz data set that I would like to render as a map I attempted to create one on Matlab using a kriging option but requires omission of more than of the data points I ran into one of your examples but am wondering how I can modify the script to accommodate for my data set The following image is somewhat of what I want to create As chronicled on Twitter Ive been able to use Rayshader to create a D map of earthquake intensity data Id love map this on top of a traditional terrain elevation file Is it possible to combine two layers into one D map
