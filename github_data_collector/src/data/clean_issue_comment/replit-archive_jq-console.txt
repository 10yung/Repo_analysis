Hi Is there an sample implemented somewhere that shows this console being connected to a bash shell on any server localhost If not would it be helpful to have that Like a modern day shellinabox equivalent Hey all I would love a little help setting up GA tracking on a site built with JQconsole Would there be a way to track what strings people are inputting and which functions are executing as a result Thank you SetKeyPressHanlder SetControlKeyHandler Would be great to have ability to set key combinations with Alt Shift Cmd etc and keys like F F or something jqconsoleRegisterShortcut is good but it works only with Ctrl jqconsoleSetKeyPressHandler works only with key press events jqconsole really missing some flexibility in this questions This could be resolved in this way It looks like the old adjective is there just for jqconsoleoldprompt while it should be placed also on jqconsoleoutput jqconsolereturn and jqconsoleerror For coherence Although this is clearly a jQuery plugin I was wondering if there are plans to have this plugin work without jQuery Example of a project that have this feature masonry Currently the library always echoes key strokes on the prompt I was able to prevent this using the following code but it would be great if it was optional consolepromptleft divdiv The READMEmd says that the Prompt function Takes three arguments but it actually takes four JQConsoleprototypePrompt functionhistoryenabled resultcallback multilinecallback asyncmultiline
