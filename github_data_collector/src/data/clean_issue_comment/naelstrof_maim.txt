selection clipboard t imagepng i in terminal works fine It seems like WebP is going to be the format of the future since it outperforms PNG for the same result so omitting it from maim is a bit unfortunate Client support is pretty wide but Im not really sure how many open libraries there are for it Is that why Im using the latest git version of maim on a Gentoo Linux system I can make maim crash by running the following command maim nodecorations testpng terminate called after throwing an instance of cxxoptsargumentincorrecttype what Argument testpng failed to parse Aborted core dumped On the other hand the following command doesnt crash maim nodecorations testpng Im attaching a gdb backtrace maimlog Please tell me if you need other informations When trying to take an screenshot the selection box replicates alot of times and get on the final file cl that im using maim s o xclip selection clipboard t imagepng Is still possible to take an screenshot without the box on the way but i need to disable it with the b maim s o b xclip selection clipboard t imagepng Hi I have recently packaged maim for the official Fedora repository This PR just adds the link to the README On KDE Plasma when using maim select and selecting a window the window decorations are replaced with part of the screen contents apparently relative to where the selected window was originally spawned The problem seems to happen with any application internal Here the content of the top of the screen is being shown instead of Alacrittys title bar By using maim geometry slop the problem does not occur slop The problem also happens on the whole window border when they are enabled border maim version is v slop version is v Scrot contains the following command e exec command Exec command on the saved image Its useful because it allows commands like these scrot SnapshotYmdHMSwxhpng q e xclip se c t imagepng i f Where the image is saved to a file and the resulting file is operated on in this case copied to the clipboard In maim one would need to capture the date beforehand and use it in two separate operations like so filenameSomeDirSnapshotdate YmdNpng maim filename q xclip selection clipboard t imagepng i filename While this solution is elegant in this case it would be nice to have a native option for piping maim to multiple programs The tee program is a possibility but it reduces the ability to use maim options For example If I want to save the image with predefined quality value then there is no way to use tee with maim in a way that preserves this The following line would not work for example since xclip refuses input that contains the q flag maim q tee SomeDirSnapshotdate YmdNpng xclip selection clipboard t imagepng Ive been playing around with adapting maim in my scripts for a little bit so Im interested to see if theres something I missed or if maim is intended to be used this way Feel free to let me know if theres anything that wasnt clear Ive been having an issue for a while that ive just recently pinned down I use maim daily to take screenshots the command I usually use is maim s u b p devstdout xclip selection clipboard t imagepng My current setup is three monitors I have one x and two x monitors though the middle one is physically bigger than the second p monitor The issue Im having is basically that I cant consistently take screenshots of anything on the middle physically largest p monitor It usually just fails and clears the paste buffer From what Ive found selecting a region instead of doing the auto window select seems to succeed more it works almost every time if I capture a solid color image for example a blank terminal I usually get no error output and when I run maim manually not piping anywhere it either works and prints out a result to my terminal or will sit there and the command will never complete In addition to this sometimes when I try by using the aforementioned command earlier in this post it will sometimes print out X Error of failed request BadWindow invalid Window parameter Major opcode of failed request XChangeProperty Resource id in failed request x e c Serial number of failed request Current serial number in output stream Other times it will complete silently but I will end up with an empty paste buffer I at first thought I was having an issue somewhat similar to in that maybe my quality was simply too high and that taking screenshot from that monitor just took too long to process and got some semiconsistent results in being able to take a screenshot wait a few seconds longer than usual and then be able to paste that screenshot but that no longer really works Ive also tried lowering the quality to no avail To add to the confusion sometimes it works fine literally within seconds of itself I can try to screenshot a window have it not work then have it work fine if I just try enough times Sorry this issue is mostly just explanations of specific behaviors Im getting that Im sure you wont be able to reproduce Id be more than happy to debug this further if theres a way to make maim more verbose
