hi is there anyway I can insert my own labels for the node legends in the code below im able to customise the legends for the color of the edges using scaleedgecolordiscretenameType of edges

idea but it could be nice to display two edges in opposing directions instead of using arcs Reprex libraryggraph librarytidygraph gr createnotablebull converttodirected bindedgesdataframefrom c to c E

But for the second with labels there are edges that are now on top of each other again PS You can also see that labeldodge appears to be calculated from middle of the group of edges and not each individual edge but this may be difficult to fix I like those and I think they can work well for some hierarchical data r librarytidygraph Attaching package tidygraph The following object is masked

managed to obtain the following plot However in order to make it perfect Id like to arrange the order of the nodes for the items Q Q etc so that they are for instance from the darker to the most pale ie arranged by the strength of their link I tried arranging the order of the nodes but it doesnt seem to have an effect What would be the simplest way to achieve that Thanks Is there a way to change the file download name from diagram to a custom name To be more specific when you download as png the image that is created has the file name diagram That is what I would like to change Thanks Hi Thomas I dont know if this is a legitimate issue but if it saves someone like me half an hour of trying to debug my code it might be useful I am used to using US spelling of words and ggplot provides function and argument synonyms for US and UK spelling such as summarize and summarise or scalecolormanual and scalecolour manual What Ive just learned after going crazy cuz my code doesnt work is that ggraph or at least geomedgearc only works with the UK spelling so an argument color grey doesnt work but colour grey is fine Maybe its easy or maybe its difficult to implement both options I dont know but at least to have it as a reference here Cheers Is there some way to segment nodes into multiple sections of different colours Im imagining something where a node belongs to say two categories and can be split into a blue half and a green half If not could this be considered for a future release Does ggraph somehow allow for chord intersection diagrams I havent found a single package in R that can do it yet its extremely powerful for showing complex intersections between sets It requires nodes to be plotted in a circle and grouped by set some category Nodes that are in multiple sets should be plotted within each set in the circle and joined by an edge Ideally intersecting nodes are also grouped and a single fat edge is used to join the nodes in both sets Giovanni Gherdovich explains the concept here I noticed a few small typos in ggraph documentation and fixed them
