 Environment Ionic Angular Using v Prod build Description Im currently getting this error when running the app with angular clis prod settings img width altScreen Shot at AM src Did a little bit of debugging and the resolver obj doesnt contain a container prop while when running on prod settings it only has nativeElement Wondering if anyone encountered this issue before Is there any way to restore scroll position while navigating back using browser button This changes has been cherrypicked from the PR made for and fixes An ng branch has been created from the release There are a few known scenarios where the opencollective postinstall npm script can cause things to break further down the pipeline a few being certain buildCI environments script permission issues and offline installs Arguably displaying a banner soliciting funding shouldnt disrupt the development or build processes of projects leveraging libraries that are optionally and nonfunctionally using opencollective Ultimately at the heart of the failure is a non exit code being returned in the cases that opencollective fails to properly execute To prevent this nonzero exit code failure so that subsequent npm processes arent disrupted as a result of nonfunctional dependency issues a exit should be added to the postinstall npm script There are many discussions about this issue and workaround

in x Version used angular and infinitescroll x Browser Name and version Firefox and Chromium x Optional Operating System and version desktop or mobile NA x Optional Link to your project The problem is that when I keep scrolling down the more items is added to the scroll element and and the less I have to scroll again to reach the infiniteScrollDistance threshold For example st set of data I have to scroll full wheels nd set of data I have to scroll full wheels rd set of data I have to scroll full wheels And it keeps getting lower and lower so at the page only a couple of scrolls would be sufficient to trigger the scroller This is highly inefficient Love ngxinfinitescroll Please consider supporting our collective I followed the example div classsearchresults infiniteScroll infiniteScrollDistance infiniteScrollThrottle scrolledonScroll div but the scrolled event fires right after the page scrolls no matter the value of infiniteScrollDistance How to make it work Thank you
