Would be nice to update to appendbeforeaction in jammitcontrollerrb to remove the notice in Rails and be usable in We were using Jammit on a Rails application which we just upgraded to After deploying to production we started getting this error and our page viewscss do not display properly NameError undefined local variable or method pagecachedirectory for JammitController x f daee We are on Rails Ruby and Jammit Can anyone provide some insight on if there are compatibility issues with Jammit and Rails If so can you point me in the direction of where this needs to be fixed so I can PR Or should we scrap the gem and migrate to the asset pipeline Add a t test flag which checks configuration and dumps out the list of files being compiled reifying wildcards and the like which could be dumped to a log or a manifest file Am i missing sth or change committed in dcc b c b fc e e ba a dbc cd left us without timestamps in generated urls If you introduce the character sequence that is backslash single quote into a jst file for compilation with template the compilation breaks that is backslash space single quote does not have this problem It seems jsmin and cssmin are no longer maintained So should jsmin be used in the project I am currently packaging jammit for Debian But It cant be completed because of the jsonevillicense under which jsmin is released And it wont be changed since it is unmaintained This directly affects the inclusion of jammit in Debian as jsmin is a runtime dependency for jammit Moreover since jsmin is unmaintained any bugs that may come in the future will not be rectified I saw that the last version of jammit depended only on yuicompressor It is still maintained It seems to be a better choice now helps with debugging bad ruby in assetsyml I was configured to use the Google Closure Compiler javascriptcompressor closure But was unwittingly falling back to jsmin because require closurecompiler was failing silently due to it not being installed Hello For javascript code written in YUI modules I wanted to have my assets automaticaly built using YUIs shifter each time the specified asset is missing or when it is changed Feature Added By adding the two following lines in the assetsyml config file of Jammit buildassets true javascriptbuilder shifter You will have your assets built with Shifter each time Yammit is loaded This build process will occur only if the asset file is missing or if the file has been modified in the git sense Limitation As we need to know the name of the YUI module if it is missing we need the full module path in the assets configuration Therefore any assets glob defined with a wildcard js will NOT be shifted Suggestions This is a specific development for our teams app that relies heavily on YUI Shifter I will therefore leave this pull request open to any discussionsuggestionimprovements
