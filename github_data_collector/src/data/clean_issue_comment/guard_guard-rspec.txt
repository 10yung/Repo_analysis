 Problem Related to and I was unable have guard detect more that one change because Guard was terminating the runner with GuardRSpec has just been fired every time I eventually worked out this was due to the SPECOPTS environment variable having been set in our docker container Possible solutions First I think we should catch this error and show a warning instead of terminating since it has been a problem in the past with multiple causes and prevents the use of this library To solve this particular cause we could unset the SPECOPS variable when spawning the new process Error ERROR GuardRSpec

UsersviktorDeveloperRubygraphqlapitmprspecguardresult This is likely a bugso please report this at along with as muchinformation as possible to reproduce this issue Ive been enjoying being able to run rubocop only on changes in my feature branch and I was wondering if there was a way to run only specs affected by changes in my feature branch Im not a fan of spec runs kicking off when I save Id like to be able to control when they start but detect the set of specs that are influenced in my current feature branch The error message is currently like this This is likely a bugso please report this at along with as muchinformation as possible to reproduce this issue My text editor makes use of autosave and I am running a number of tests hence I often find myself manually cancelling currently running tests in order for Rspec guard to test against my newer changes Hello Im trying to accomplish something like this for some tests watchr appmodelsrb m P specfeaturesm If I call straight from my console rspec P specfeaturesm it works as expected but I cannot seem to be able to make this work using guardrspec I also tried it like so watchr appmodelsrb m P rspecspeccallfeaturesm All to no avail This adds a fix adding long arguments when calling the underlying rspec command with the custom formatter This supports a wider range of usecases like using a rspec file These long arguments are backwards compatible with their shorter f and r cousins Those short arguments did not seem to work well when specifying long arguments elsewhere rake testallversions passed
