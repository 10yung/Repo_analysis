Looks like support for CSSs support is broken after v any ideas changelog doesnt seem to have anything about it img width altScreen Shot at PM src Hi i think the following behaviour might be wrong this less less colors enabled b c selected d d d hovered dbdbdb testClass backgroundcolor colors enabled active backgroundcolor colors selected important hovered backgroundcolor colors hovered compiles to this css css testClass backgroundcolor b c testClassactive backgroundcolor d d d testClasshovered backgroundcolor dbdbdb notice how the important keyword is omitted in the resulting css borderwidth max rem px This code will break compile process Better error reporting in case of variable definition outside selector blocks L When a visitor hook returns an array of nodes for replacement the accept calls are not made Returning an array of node when the plugin implementation isReplacing is set seems to be correctly supported in the visitArray function implementation L Lets say now I have pages A and B both import a long common css commonless Is it possible to use the native import to import the external common module instead of inlining it into both Acss and Bcss Hi I follow up PR of matthewdean to replace inlinejs with plugin It works well with dev mode but OOM when dist Is that any club for this that I can dig into ref I know this topic has come up a lot but the answers provided for these questions dont work well for my needs or several cases I dont think have been properly discussed I strongly disagree with this being a feature thats not required there are definitely cases that can not be addressed as easily with just defining a variable ahead of time Any case in which you are not the one in charge of defining the values youre working with for example In my case Im creating utility mixins such as the one below util borderpath when pathtype individual bordertop pathtopdefinition borderbottom pathbottomdefinition borderleft pathleftdefinition borderright pathrightdefinition borderpath when not pathtype individual border pathdefinition And the And an example usage In variablesless mainheaderbordertype individual mainheaderborderdefinition none mainheaderbordertopdefinition px solid e e e mainheaderborderbottomdefinition none mainheaderborderleftdefinition none mainheaderborderrightdefinition none in main stylesheet page header utilbordermainheaderborder Now Im working with a site that shows all variables in a variablesless file in a web interface so Im defining all the potential variables for the end user to configure That mixin works fine and I have no problems with it However another mixin I have is the two following fontpath fontfamily pathfont color pathcolor fontsize pathsize fontHoverpath fontfamily pathfont color pathcolor fontsize pathsize hover color pathhovercolor I have two mixins here for dealing with text properties one for text that should have a hover color and one for when it shouldnt Id love to combine these two into the same mixin and put a guard on the hover testing for whether the hovercolor subproperty exists to determine whether it should be used I feel the other suggestions on this topic were closed with too little consideration to the possibility of people making libraries for other users or multiple people working on different files with reusable code Hi the CHANGELOG is out of date with the current version it says that is in beta but the releases page shows that is the latest version can the changelog be updated to reflect what changed Hi Im making updates for Open Collective Either you or another core contributor signed this repository up for Open Collective This pull request adds financial contributors from your Open Collective What it does adds a badge to show the latest number of financial contributors adds a banner displaying contributors to the project on GitHub adds a banner displaying all individuals contributing financially on Open Collective adds a section displaying all organizations contributing financially on Open Collective with their logo and a link to their website PS As with any pull request feel free to comment or suggest changes Thank you for your great contribution to the Open Source community You are awesome And welcome to the Open Collective community Come chat with us in the opensource channel on great place to ask questions and share best practices with other Open Source sustainers
