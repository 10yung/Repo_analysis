Chores Build fix use instead of c b f add chai and dirtychai and sinon for cleaner testassertions and spies deprecate old assertionmethods e e ba dad a Security The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th Bugfixes fix use Stringfield

warnings like below it looks like all components from reactnative had been imported by default so can I set that as empty or just view and text and I will import the others when I need them Thanks Tried to use vuei n with vuenativecore and when attempting use with VueuseVueI n I get this warning vuei n vuei n undefined need to use Vue or later Vue Then when using t I get this error Vue warn Property or method t is not defined on the instance but referenced during render Make sure to declare reactive data properties in the data option Description of the bug I want to use data provider pattern but i got warnings like Warning Each child in a list should have a unique key propss See for more informations when two components is inside default slot in provider component Adding key

devDependencies babelpresetexpo vuenativescripts Seems that CSS classes can only be set to a single class not a string of multiple classes Seems like a limitation and I dont see why it cant concatenate the computed styles together ie classone two doesnt work But in react native world its totally possible to do something like style stylesone stylestwo Also seems that I cannot splitshare class definitions either ie class color blue class class backgroundcolor red The above will actually only apply the second reference to class and totally ignore the style defined in the first reference This is really a hindrance to creating any sort of app of reasonable scale Im trying to run my app using the web variant Im getting this error when the app spins up Ive tried to look through
