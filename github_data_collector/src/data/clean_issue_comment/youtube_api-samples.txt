 else print Added new channel section The last line missing quotation marks at this file We are looking for a solution to embed Youtube videos to WebGL We have tried this lib but it only supports simple HTMLCSS not work with youtube player Alternatively we have tried to make a link in our app to the youtube player and a user can view the youtube video in this way but with an extra step trigger enter button again in the browser It is not really a good user experience Ideally we look for an Aframe plugin for Youtube like there is one for Vimeo Or open to other ideas Hey folks missing a coma

as the reference source code I am developing an Android app for Amazon Fire Stick devices I am using Cordova to create the Android wrapper around my web application which is loaded in an iframe I am using javascript to embed youtube player as shown here Below is what my code to embed Youtube looks like var player new YTPlayeryoutubecontainer height width videoId somevideoid playerVars autohide controls enablejsapi rel showinfo events onReady function playerseekTo true playerplayVideo I have used this code to embed youtube videos in my web application and it works without any problem but in Fire Stick devices the video shows up cut off as shown below Video cut off The video is supposed to play in the rectangular section The video does play but only the top left corner seems to be visible The strange thing is it plays fine if I play it in full screen mode It also plays fine in Fire Tablet devices whether its full screen or not Also in my tests I have found that the video is positioned correctly in the iframe in some rare occassions It seems similar to the issue described here but no answer is marked correct and it has been years since Im hoping someone has fixed this Any help will be appreciated Thank you Clean up script so it actually works with Python x Main changes fix rawinput calls and print calls without parenthesis Also some minor refactoring and code cleanup How do you access things from the community section Such as comments For example The posts listed here Accessing video comments is covered nicely I would now like to do the same for the comments in this section Hello Is there a retractMessage or messageRetracted event Theres a developer who made a Javascript chat using the Youtube LiveChat API to handle messages but when a user retracts deletes a message on YouTube Live Chat it make it to this custom chat messages So I want to contribute by making a pull request of this chats source to add this feature but I dont find anything on Google If there is a retract message event then we would be able to get the retracted message ID on the event listener and filter the displayed messages and if one of them matches then we remove that message from the chats view I hope to get a solution thank you Cheers Hi I tried to use the javascript MediaUploaderjs to upload youtube video to my own account for some reason I got this error in onError function
