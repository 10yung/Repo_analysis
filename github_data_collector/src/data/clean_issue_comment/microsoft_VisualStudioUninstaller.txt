I use the latest version of uninstaller to clean up visual studio from windows then I installed visuals studio enterprise and mysql for visual studio but mysql for vs failed to be installedalways prompted by visual studio must be installed I googled all the solutions on the internet none of them can solve my problem finally I found a solution open registry to search mysql for visual studio in HKEYLOCALMACHINE deleted searched item for mysql for visual studio then problem solved so uninstaller should deleted that registry item automatically I was meaning to uninstall visual studio but the uninstall process was taking too long and was not moving on so I quit the process midway After quitting my fan started rotating too fast and I found out that visual studio community update procedure was eating up a lot of CPU and not sure if it is related but windows search filterprotocol host and windows search indexer was also using a lot of CPU at the same time i tried force quitting it but it kept turning back on I rebooted my laptop but it was still using of the CPU and it took some time before the update stopped running and the CPU consumption came back to normal However I know that windows search filterprotocol host and windows search indexer normally holds a portion of the CPU but Im disturbed by the fact that it is now higher than it used to be Is it somehow related to quitting the uninstall process midway edit on turning on laptop everytime Ive found that Windows installer windows VSIX installer and Microsoft compatibility telemetry are the ones that are popping up and using all the CPU I have to manually quit the process in order to stabilize my computer Is there a way to solve this or do I just have to try uninstalling again edit Ive successfully uninstalled VS but the Microsoft compatibility telemetry and windows search processes are still using a lot of CPU I did some searching about these and I understand that its running because a lot of files have been changeddeleted recently If my understanding is correct I guess I just have to wait for it to finish its job This is nice when viewing the README on the web Improve code readability by moving code to a new private function I have Visual Studio Professional and used it for years without a problem Then some day I needed Visual Studio installed it then uninstalled main app only using standard uninstaller via Control Panel AddRemove Programs My OS is Windows SP Some day I needed to compile Webkit and its vswhereexe found Visual Studio and build failed I thought I need clean uninstall Visual Studio but dont know how and have no installer and no idea why vswhereexe detected it So I tried this Visual Studio Uninstaller It found some leftovers from VIsual Studio and removed them successfully I rebooted a PC and tried to run Visual Studio It failed to run I ran repair using Visual Studio installer it ran but now I cannot compile bit executables Every time I trying to build for Win x clexe fails with C Program Files x MSBuild MicrosoftCpp v V MicrosoftCppCommontargets error MSB CLexe I tried reinstall Visual Studio with or without update clean reinstall multiple times including reinstall of NET Framework all versions still the same problem Win AMD compiler works without problem Also I tried to replace C Program Files x Microsoft Visual Studio VC bin clexe by dummy bit exe which does nothing but still have xc b error when it runs When I run Visual Studio command line tools batch both bit and bit clexe are work perfectly fine inside it run compile sources compiled binary runs fine I have an error above only when clexe bit x ran from Visual Studio IDE Not sure whats wrong but if anyone knows a workaround WITHOUT reinstall OS please give it to me Thanks Is it possible to remove the confirmation Y to run the application Thanks vsbork Right now Im trying to upgrade to VS and because of space restraints Im getting rid of VS I have started up your installer as an Admin and hit Y but so far the uninstaller hasnt gone any further than what you see in the screenshot Is it working should I restart it Or perhaps just sit on my hands Can not install Microsoft Visual C Build Tools Tried to remove VS and VS studio express Files left behind are Here ddVisualCppBuildToolsFull log D T i Detected package MsiBuildToolsMSBuildamd state Absent cached Complete D T i Detected

This still runs the uninstaller even though I did not want to do so The help does not say about the correct way to enter this parameter If it should have been SetupForcedUninstallexe noprocess it should be emphasized in README On the other hand either all parameters should start with or none That was less easy to screw up
