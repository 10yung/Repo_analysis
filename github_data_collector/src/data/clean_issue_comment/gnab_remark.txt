There are a couple of solutions proposed in to make the list of contributors look prettier eg number of contributions Github repos etc As part of this issue we could make the list look better and if possible automate it so it gets updated automatically Im wanting to use some nested class and increment elements using content via a template slide However it seems like remark has some trouble with this The incrementing works on its own and the nested class elements work on their own but these two dont work together See this MWE DOCTYPE html html xmlns lang xmllang head titleIssues with

rightcolumn also works fine One Markdown bullet point A mark second bullet point Nested point Highlightincrement demo rightcolumn Combining the two does not work One Markdown bullet point content A mark second bullet point content Nested point textarea script src script script var slideshow remarkcreate script body html The issue is that in the last example where the word second should appear highlighted in the second bullet point it has been replaced with object Object So it should be One Markdown bullet point A second bullet point Nested point But it is actually One Markdown bullet point A object Object bullet point Nested point It seems like remark has a hard time parsing the custom css class and putting it into the content place holder Hello everyone Since the last release of remark v was on Sep I think it would be appropriate to cut a new release I would like to use this issue to track any work thats needed in order to do the release gnab it would be great if you take a quick look at it as well just in case Ive missed anything x PR to master merge x Create a new Github release from master with tag x Commit the new remark minjs to ghpages branch downloads folder X Write and update release notes HISTORYmd PR As part of the release notes update we should also review the Wiki to make sure its uptodate with the features X Update the list of contributors PR Update indexhtml in ghpages branch update demo slideshow with new features Ive probably missed something so please feel free to comment add more to this Pullrequest introduces a new implementation for the timer It allows for a custom formatter With this formatter one can implement a decreasing timer Unfortunately this requires to provide custom code which is error prone and maybe not everybody that wants to use remark is capable to provide it This is a request for a new feature allow to configure the timer to be decreasing with certain target time A code of conduct A code of conduct is a set of rules outlining the norms rules and responsibilities of and or proper practices for an individual Currently this project is missing one This could alienate a lot of people Eg the comment on issue isnt constructive and can zap the energy of maintainers A code of conduct could help in delineate what is acceptable behavior and provide directions how to deal with persons that violate the code of conduct While I was working on issue I have read into the Mozillas Developer Network MDN documentation on the keypress event It reports that the event is deprecated This feature is no longer recommended Though some browsers might still support it it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards may be in the process of being dropped or may only be kept for compatibility purposes Avoid using it and update existing code if possible see the compatibility table at the bottom of this page to guide your decision Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time It would be nice to be able to escape math delimiters so I can show LaTeX code in the presentation It seems the dollar sign cant be escaped so I cant write gamma and have it render as gamma While I can write to render having an escaped opening math delimiter that is followed by an escaped closing math delimiter doesnt work Thus while the preceding example works gamma does not render gamma This appears to be a bug The same applied for I find putting backticks around blockdisplayed LaTeX code doesnt render using either MathJax or KaTeX for example Gamma Gamma However rather than backticks you can just enclose the LaTeX code in a div This works fine provided the div begins within spaces of a newline that only spaces follow the end of the div and that the line following the div is blank Previously I used MathJax X and then the backticks worked The thought here is that creating inconsistent HTML is something I can live with in exchange for GFMsupport When presenting I like to have one window opened with slides notes presenter view and the second window with the slides only this is what the audience sees To do this today you need to disable screen mirroring and then move one window to the projector and another one with notes to your laptop This works however sometimes I do demos and like to switch to the terminal or a different window This means that I need to turn on screen mirroing do the demo then switch back to separate displays Does anyone know if theres a way in Javascript to detect that screens are being mirrored and set up the presenter view accordingly ie main screen with the presentation only and laptop screen with slides notes
