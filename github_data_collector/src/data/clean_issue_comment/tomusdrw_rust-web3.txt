lockfile updates if desired Security updates receive only security updates if desired details Having a quick glance to the dependencies I see you depend on hyper directly would it be a big effort to use reqwest instead is one of the most used http clients this days and provides a nicer API on top of that they already went through the effort of making it work with web assembly which seems like a major effort that this project doesnt look very motivated to take Reqwest would act as the abstraction layer that makes the switch from a hyper backend to browser fetch at compile time Nicer http api plus wasm support sounds like a nice deal right Hi I am trying to execute simplelogsubrs in the example but it stops around the contract deploymentaround l The compile is properly done though it hangs In ganache log the contract deployment is done but rust code stops at the deployment code Actually simplelogfilterrs seems to have the same behavior Do I miss something to run them What I did is following the instruction written in the readme but I am using the beta version of ganachecli Thank you Updates the requirements on hyper to permit the latest version details summaryRelease

an account based on an existing private key similiar to so that is possible to us HDWallet keys or simple local keys as an starting point thx I noticed that Geth added support for specifying block hashes for some methods In my code Ive been passing the block number through but passing the block hash through will give consistent answers if a reorg happens in the middle of some calls I think functions that have block OptionBlockNumber in their args would need to change but I havent thought about exactly how yet Updates the requirements on futures to permit the latest version details
