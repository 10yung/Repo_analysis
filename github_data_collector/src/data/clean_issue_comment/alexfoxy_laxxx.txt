When spinning up a webapp with rollup and importing laxjs in my case Im building a sapper app it complains about laxxx using the eval statement which supposedly is a security risk and may cause issues with minification Its only a mild warning but Id be happy if you guys could switch out that eval with something else sometime wink Thanks Hi In the readme file I read the following Implement a tween for scroll wheels to remove reliance on smoothscroll If I understand you correctly you need to avoid the effect of intermittent animation when using regular mousewheels not Applemagicmouse or touchpad I think I can help do this in a demo example and then we can add this to the api as an option Add easings support for library as option Example vh speed easingeaseInQuad Using windowinnerWidth as your basis for vw makes sense but this includes the scrollbar width which can throw off centering calculations To pull an element to center it may make sense to do something like translating it to vw elw which wont be exactly centered to any other centered content on the page that doesnt include scrollbar width Replacing windowinnerWidth with documentbodyclientWidthhere takes care of that It may also be useful to replace it for your breakpoint calculation but I havent used that and so didnt test Also I was stuck for a while expecting vw to work like it does in CSS so my vw was netting me crazy large numbers when I needed vw The information is in the readme but it might be worth a line calling out that its not used the same First of all this is by far the best scroll effects library out there I was looking for a lightweight alternative to the ScrollMagic GreenSock stack and this is finally something really useful Great job I was just wondering if there are any plans to add support for easings Im using laxjs to add some decent scroll effects to our website As some of the animations stop right inside the viewport it would be nice if we could add some easing effects to have them slow down before the animation ends
