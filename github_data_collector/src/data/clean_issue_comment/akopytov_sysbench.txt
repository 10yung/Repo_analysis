When can we support the trafodion database is there any thoughts or plans to implement something like ignore errors for PostgreSQL Trying to show how sysbench behave during a PostgreSQL pod failure with MySQL I can use mysqlignoreerrorsall and then if the DB pod gets killed the sysbench continue to run and just until the referenced database is up in a new pod maybe theres a way to do this on PostgreSQL but I cant find it Hi I was running a series of tests and I have noticed the getid function does not really random local function getid return sysbenchranddefault sysbenchopttablesize end It should be generating numbers between and the table size in my test I was using as table size so it should get random numbers between and To make it simple I was only using one function called executeindexupdates and I just printed the the ids print id I logged the output in a file cat getiddefaultintlog wc l cat getiddefaultintlog sort uniq c sort rn head n There is line in the file and only numbers responsible of that which is more than off all the lines So basically when I am running MySQL benchmarks sysbench creates hotspots in the workload By digging the code a bit Return random number in the specified range with distribution specified with the randtype command line option uint t sbranddefaultuint t a uint t b return randfuncab I have retested by using the randtypeuniform I was able to generate real random numbers cat getiddefaultuniformlog sort uniq c sort rn head n I also noticed sometimes the getid function does not create any numbers and sometimes it creates numbers bigger than which is very wired In the log file I could see lines like this So it look like there is something wrong going under the hood If this is a feature to be able to test hotspots in that case this should be clearly documented but I would recommend to change getid from default to uniform because I think most of the ppl does not realise default will generate hotspots in their tests and this could make many tests give misleading results Hi Aleksey I just noticed theres a problem in the packagecloudio scripts to install a repo for sysbench I use Amazon Linux and it is correctly detected as amzn but it tries to use el repo I think this error was previously masked because I also install EPEL and it seems to provide sysbench el It is only now that you released that install fails The first script is correct Detected operating system as amzn Checking for curl Detected curl Downloading repository file done However contents of repository file from above url is wrong akopytovsysbench nameakopytovsysbench baseurl Is there a command line option to control to the TLS mode when connecting to postgres Unlike mysqlssl pgsqlssl dont seem to be present When measuring the system performance on Windows running inside WSL does not make sense since WSL itself is slow So please add native build support on Windows Thanks Hi I am new to Sysbench and I wonder is there a manual for Sysbench x I want to simulate the performance of my MySQL branch under some very certain circumstances but a handful of syntax has deprecated in x Ive searched online to find one but the manual was too old and I realized that many changes had taken place in Sysbench x Therefore I wonder if there is a manual to help me Thanks in advance Were trying to get sysbench running on one of DigitalOceans recently released Managed MySQL containers Running the command sysbench usrsharesysbencholtpreadwritelua mysqlhostHOST mysql port mysqluserUSER mysqlpasswordREDACTED dbdrivermysql tables tablesize prepare Results in the following error sysbench using bundled LuaJIT beta FATAL unable to connect to MySQL server on host dbmysqlnyc douser dbondigitaloceancom port aborting FATAL error SSL connection error unknown error number FATAL sysbenchcmdlinecallcommand function failed usrsharesysbencholtpcommonlua connection creation failed However if we try to connect to this via command line or using DataGrip it connects just fine The part that is frustrating is the FATAL error SSL connection error unknown error number which clearly sysbench is having an issue connecting but then passes an unknown error number Makes things difficult to debug Has anyone run into this problem before Hello I would like to request a downloadable binary with LuaJit set up at bit After this patch It is possible to compile the binary by either building it with LUAJITENABLEGC symbol defined as msvcbuildbat gc or XCFLAGS DLUAJITENABLEGC in Makefile You can also work with the file thirdpartyluajitluajitsrcljarchh generated after the configure and set define LUAJITENABLEGC Ive actually compiled this manually using XCFLAGS and define LUAJITENABLEGC and here are my results sysbench e e d using bundled LuaJIT beta Running the test with following options Number of threads Initializing random number generator from seed Initializing worker threadsThreads startedSQL statistics queries performed read write other total transactions per sec queries per sec ignored errors per sec reconnects per secThroughput eventss eps time elapsed s total number of events Latency ms min avg max th percentile sum Threads fairness events avgstddev execution time avgstddev Finally I would like to mention that when running this binary for a prepare with threads I got FATAL sysbenchcmdlinecallcommand function failed luascriptsluaoltpcommonlua attempt to call global sbrand a nil value This error I dont have it with another binary like the one used by DimitriK that he provides on his blog so not sure if this is something related to LuaJit or to something else When i tried to build deb package on debian buster aptge suggested that i should install libmariadbdevcompat and libmariadbdev instead of libmysqlclientdev And since libmariadbdevcompat already depends on libmariadbdev I think adding libmariadbdevcompat todependency list solves the issue If libmariadbdevcompat not exists in builddepends list then dpkgbuildpackage fails o build deb package
