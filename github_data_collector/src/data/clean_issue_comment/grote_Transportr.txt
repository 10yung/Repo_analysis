Hello As some of you may know were facing a month long strike of transportation in France For Paris everyday the public transport company RATP is publishing the state of the network for the next day But even thought it may change on the actual day depending of the situation and unions will Since the beginning of the strike i had unfortunately to switch to another application citymapper because they include the realtime situation strike included and this option was not available on Transportr Transportr was even offering me routes through lines that wereare completely closed As strike is the national favorite hobby in France id love to find this kind of option in my favorite transport application Is it something possible Planned Best regards I came across Transportr through a tweet from Matthias Kirschner It looks lovely thank you so much for your efforts and for releasing it as free software I realize that the following is not a bug nor a Transportr issue per se I thought it was still good to share this and thought this was the most appropriate place but forgive me if Im wasting your time I live in Athens Greece and unfortunately there is no coverage of that in Transportr Im not an Android developer but comfortable with sending PRs so I read through your contributing instructions in order to see whether I could contribute this If I understand it correctly the process is Find GTFS feeds for local transport agencies easy enough found them Send an email to Navitias Google Group asking them to be added Wait until this happens or alternatively set up a Navitia instance locally which doesnt seem trivial Optional Send an MR with Java code implementing some bits of the transport agency logic to the the publictransportenabler staging GitLab repo Send the same PR to to the publictransportenabler GitHub repo Wait until this gets merged Send a PR to Transportr to add the provider That should be code in Kotlin alongside the agencys vector logo Im not proficient in Java and I dont know Kotlin To add to that I also have no idea how I would test if any of the above work besides setting up an Android development environment and building Transportr publictransportenabler locally and deploying it on my phone That would probably take me several days of effort Id love to use this project and would be happy to do a drivethrough contribution Unfortunately the bar is set pretty high right now It sounds like the responsibilities and data are scattered across multiple projects so not necessarily something that you could fix alone I dont have any bright suggestions myself If I can think of a couple maybe notsobright ideas Move more of the Transportr logic outside of code Kotlin and into a data format like YAML Maybe accompany it with a simple validator that one can run before submitting Accompany the app with a simple CLI that one could build that would test publictransportenabler and test whether a patch works before submitting it Would avoid one needing to be familiar with Android development Maybe add simpletouse instructions on how to build this CLI eg with Docker Thanks again and no hard feelings if you decide this is out of scope and declined as an issue outright Describe the bug When youre zooming in the zoom starts delayed by around s and the zoomin or out is weird it just zooms out to the entire country its too sensitive for zoom outin i believe and sometimes it does not immediately respond Maybe some sort of optional zoomslider could be better Versions please complete the following information Transportr Version Device Lenovo P Android Version Acknowledgments Please check the following boxes with an x if they apply x The feature I want to propose would be useful for the majority of users not only for me personally x I am aware that Transportr is mostly developed by one person in their unpaid spare time I can help myself to get this feature implemented or know someone who wants to do it If I want to add support for a new region or country I checked that this is already available in publictransportenabler and know the process described on the Transportr homepage Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe If your current route has many stops and you dont know the route well its hard to find the current station Describe the solution youd like It would be useful if the nearest stop according to the current location would be highlighted in the list of stops Additional context I think ffi does this too Describe the bug In VGNNetwork there seem to be some broken stations Every time you search for a route from or to such a station you can see the error message below I think more and more stations have this problem Deleting the app data fixes the problem details summaryError

Device OnePlus Android Version LineageOS As remarked by grote in These visibility changes on swiping in the trip details view in appear a bit rough in the UI Should be easy to use a object animator

to add support for a new region or country I checked that this is already available in publictransportenabler and know the process described on the Transportr homepage Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I think it would be great if the means of transport could be saved for each favorite trip as well as the possibility of saving a general means of transport settings for the app For example I take the bus in the morning I use the app to check which bus number arrives first at my bus stop I dont really want to see solutions that use trains etc but right now I have to edit that manually every time On the other hand on my way to the gym I need a bus a subway so I need to manually select only those Both these trips are saved as favorite but I have to manually checkuncheck the means of transport every time for each of them Thank you Describe the solution youd like I think it would be great if each favorite trip could also have its own mean of transport preference Describe alternatives youve considered No alternatives except to at least be able to save general preferences for the menas of transport unless you consider this another feature request In this case the preference would be applied to the whole app for any search Ill do Additional context Describe the bug Hi I often have time issues with the app Im on android As example you can see below The time is set to now but I only get result the latter are for tomorrow early morning I guess so are not relevant Im not sure if this is related to the app or publictransportenabler Ive also opened another issue there with results problems but this one sound like might be more related with transporttr The other issue Just in case To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Add addresses for departure arrival Click on search Scroll down to see results Expected behavior I expect to see various combinations of transports to get me from departure to destination from now onwards I dont understand why it displays past trips at least results Please check same route on to see expected results Screenshots Screenshot Versions please complete the following information Transportr Version Device OnePlus T Android Version See Describe the bug Hi my screenshot will help you with a simple example what I would like suggest to improve img src width When I search for a specific street in this example just M nckebergstr in Hamburg Germany as seen the app suggest several close locations but also unrelated stuff Moreover the app suggest the target but ranks it to the th place of the list In between are locations which might interest me but I dont expext them to be previous to the actual target I typed into the search bar Even more sometimes I have to scroll the list to choose such a specific streettarget Some users might think the app couldnt find the target To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Search for a specific street with a street number Watch the search results The app likely does not rank the acutal street to the very top results No error Expected behavior Search result with street numbers should have a higher ranking Dont show unrelated results before Screenshots See above Versions Transportr Version Device HTC One M Android Version Xenon HD Android Eventually realted Let specify street number on search
