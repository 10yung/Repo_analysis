master branch that fixes these dependencies ec bdc fe ce b d d e d f Unfortunately there has been no release since then Could you please create a new release maybe to publish this fix defines a postMessage handler The code for this handler does NOT verify the message origin This is an issue because any site can send a postMessage to the application and it will be processed Details in this blog post As far as I can see the attacker has the potential to Force the victims application to be logged in using attacker credentials by sending a postMessage with deliverCredentials and valid OAuth token for the attacker account If the attack is well crafted the victim might end up sending private data to the attackers account the attacker can then read this information Force the victim to logout to be confirmed by sending authFailure hey all i am looking for angular authentication solutionpackage works with devise and running into this package it seems like it does the authentication needed but is this project maintains by the owner angular keeps updated and I wouldnt like hack this package when angular upgarded Not sure what I am doing wrong or if its the module but with the below code authProviderconfigure apiUrl tokenValidationPath adminauthvalidatetoken signOutUrl adminauthsignout emailRegistrationPath adminauth accountUpdatePath adminauth accountDeletePath adminauth passwordResetPath adminauthpassword passwordUpdatePath adminauthpassword emailSignInPath adminauthsignin validateOnPageLoad true storage sessionStorage tokenFormat accesstoken token tokentype Bearer client clientId expiry expiry uid uid The authheaders key in session storage is with below code scopehandleLoginBtnClick function authsubmitLoginscopeloginFormthenfunctionresp handle success response See screenshot screen shot at pm When I use catch to handle a rejection caused by invalid login credentials angular will still warn about an unhandled rejection I believe the line that causes this is This rejection doesnt actually get returned anywhere The promise being returned by the submitLogin function is returning a different promise Express x is deprecated Will there be an update I am facing an issue where I have implemented SAML authentication in my rails api having angular front end The SAML authentication works just fine in chrome and firefox but on safari authvalidateUser returns undefined And that only is the scenario in production servers On development environment and staging server it works fine on safari as well I have checked Safari settings I have checked my SAML IDPs logs I have inspected the sever logs for both chrome and safari auth processes in both scenarios when I receive the response from my IDP I parse and sign user in on my API using devise token auth and then send response to frontend Redirected to Its been days and I havent come anywhere closer to fixing this issue Any help would be massively appreciated Im trying to register by email on the live demo app but I always get img width altscreen shot at src Is it working for anyone Is it possible to disable confirmable for submitRegistration Id like my user to register with one click without confirming email I disabled confirmable on devise now its giving a warning because the client is still sending confirmsuccessurl Unpermitted parameters confirmsuccessurl configname registration Is it possible to remove sending confirmsuccessurl from the client side
