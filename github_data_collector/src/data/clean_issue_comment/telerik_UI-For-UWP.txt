Hello I found some problems in your code using the PVSStudio static code analyzer I described the issues in the article Checking Telerik UI for UWP as a Way to Get Started with PVSStudio The text doesnt cover all analyzer warnings that were issued in course of the check Perhaps some warnings that arent mentioned in the article will seem to you more interesting if you check the project yourself Project developers know better what problems are more critical To work with the analyzer you will need a key here it is Name Telerik UI Key HNT P X KY T RD License Type Team License up to developers

TelerikUIXamlControlsChartChartIndicatorsDescriptorCollection TelerikUIXamlControlsChartChartAnnotationsDescriptorCollection TelerikUIXamlControlsChartChartAnnotationsDescriptor TelerikUIXamlControlsChartChartIndicatorsDescriptor Telerik UI for WPF already supports this feature So it should simply be a matter of copy pasting from there Intended Use Case I need to create an app with dynamically generated annotations and indicators At this time it is not possible to do this easily in a data bound way Description I am using RadCartesianChart in my UWP app to plot some values and there is a little issue The data when plotted on the chart shows most of the values accurately but with some values it just skips the data rows entirely and then moves on to next Also it does not show the first data row and the last one on mouseover behavior which works well otherwise in the data Have a look at the screenshots In first one the trackball is at start but it does not show the first value it shows nd or rd value from the data If you actually look close enough there is a small gap there which indicates that it wont go any further to the start So it also happens at the end of the data with the same behavior Second thing can be seen from the nd and rd screenshots where the tooltip is being shown but there is a lot of gap between the data I think it could be due to the the fact that value of the actual data is quite same there but there is difference in time and its around minutes but still it skips all the data and goes to the next intersection point Steps to Reproduce Use any type of data value and plot it on the Chart just make sure the data has atleast values in it otherwise it would not make sense Enable the trackball behavior and see for yourself Expected Behavior The trackball behavior should show all the data that is available on the chart and should not skip it Actual Behavior As discussed above Basic Information Version with issue IDE VS Community UWP SDK I am running Windows v and targeting v Nuget Packages Screenshots Reproduction Link If you want the actual data that I am using please head to in your browser so the website sets a cookie and then head to to see the actual data This data is in reverse format as so the first value will be the last value for the day and the last value will be the first one for the day So you can reverse the whole JsonArray and be done with it Every item in the array has values UNIX timestamp Current Value at that time and Volume Its a Stock Exchange website The XAML part that I am using is

chartRadCartesianChart Scenario I am loading RadDataGrid with more than columns along with dynamic frozen columns Since I have Frozen columns there will be some columns left out towards the right side which I have to scroll and see Issue I scroll towards the right side and If I start doing resize with the last column using resize handle it automatically scrolls me to the left side without allowing me to resize and not user friendly Also at time I am seeing exception being raised if I repeat these action multiple times Kindly help me on the same as I was able to reproduce this with simple example with columns more than Summary The RadDataGrid and RadPaginationControl solver several common UI problems However they are mutually incompatible and cannot be used together to solve a very fundamental UI design pattern datagrid with pagination support RadDataGrid is not derived from the WindowsUIXamlControlsPrimitivesSelector class In addition the RadPaginationControl class has a PageProvider property which is class specific and thus is not flexible enough to work with any other types It could be more adaptable if this propertys type was WindowsUIXamlControlsPrimitivesISelector an interface that WindowsUIXamlControlsPrimitivesSelector implements API Changes Suggestion The RadPaginationControls PageProvider class should be of type WindowsUIXamlControlsPrimitivesISelector instead of the concrete Selector class This would allow us to implement any control wed like Suggestion In addition the RadDataGrid should implement the WindowsUIXamlControlsPrimitivesISelector interface This second suggestion would remove the implementation complexity for the user community and embed the implementation details into the RadDataGrid class eg If RadPaginationControlPageProvider was of type WindowsUIXamlControlsPrimitivesISelector instead of Selector then we could create a custom RadDataGrid class that implements this interface and do the following var grid new MyCustomRadDataGrid thisidRadPaginationControlPageProvider grid If RadDataGrid implemented the WindowsUIXamlControlsPrimitivesISelector type then the user community would not need to create a custom RadDataGrid class Intended Use Case With both of the aforementioned changes RadDataGrid and RadPaginationControl can be used together This would provide seamless datagrid pagination support for the user community If only the first suggestion is implemented then the user community would still be able to define a custom RadDataGrid derivatives that implement the WindowsUIXamlControlsPrimitivesISelector thus achieving the same objective Though we set Frozen Column count the Horizontal Scroll bar starts from the first column Is there a way to highlight the vertical column line to differentiate between frozen and unfrozen columns or Can the vertical scroll bar be made available only from the Unfrozen columns Scrollbar option is supported here Is the same support available I have a stacked bar chart with dynamic series where each series relates to a specific color how do I bind the color of the series bars to the ColorCountColor each series is a

similar to one for WPF The DataGridBooleanColumn shows a box filled with an X Unicode character U Ballot Box With X for false values In my opinion this is incorrect I believe it should show an empty box Unicode character U Ballot Box instead
