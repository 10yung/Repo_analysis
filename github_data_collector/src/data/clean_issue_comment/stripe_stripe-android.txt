For my app I need to create completely custom interface to fill new credit card number with two line style and boxed text fields After that I need some code to interact with those elements and Stripe team thanks have already done a part of that work but the interesting part is tagged as private So I would like to know if its possible to make brandChangeCallback and completionCallback of CardNumberEditText public to be used directly in my code It will be ever more interesting to have a shouldShowErrorCallback And finally I dont if its a good idea to make strings ressource like cardnumberhint expirydatehint validdigits etc public Basically its to help us to make beautiful interfaces with the power of Stripe Summary Make some methods public brandChangeCallback completionCallback Male some ressource public cardnumberhint expirydatehint cvcmultilinehelperamex cvcmultilinehelper validdigits If possible create a new callback in CardNumberEditText shouldShowErrorCallback Summary Any way to get the default payment method and then set it on UI side On iOS it is possible by setting paymentContextdefaultPaymentMethod cardtokenid and then by doing that it reflects it on the UI side Calling let card paymentContextselectedPaymentOption gets the correct card along with its information SDK version Other information On iOS we can do paymentContextdefaultPaymentMethod cardtokenid then let card paymentContextselectedPaymentOption is that possible on Android Please only file issues here that you believe represent actual bugs or feature requests for the Stripe Android SDK If youre having general trouble with your Stripe integration please reach out to support using the form at preferred or via email to supportstripecom Otherwise to make it easier to diagnose your issue please fill out the following Summary We have an issue in production where onActivityResult is received after the calling activity has been destroyed To reproduce this I ve enabled Don t keep activities through the debug settings however with this setting enabled we dont always receive a callback to onActivityResult on API around in confirmPayment calls didnt invoke onActivityResult when the user cancelsfailsconfirms the payment in the DS screen on older API versions this occurs more often testing on API we dont receive any callbacks to onActivityResult Code to reproduce Enable Don t keep activities Call confirmPayment with a card that requires DS Verify onActivityResult is called when the user cancelsfailsconfirms the payment SDK version comstripestripeandroid Summary CardMultilineWidget has builtin validation for its fields but it shows all error messages when getCard is invoked It would be useful to have perfield validation so that we can avoid overwhelming the user with error messages as soon as they start typing Example use case We want to enabledisable other UI elements depends on whether or not a valid card has been entered To do so we need to observe all text changes If we call getCard any time any field changes well display error messages on fields that the user has not typed in yet Code to reproduce Add a CardMultilineWidget to your layout then set a text watcher on all relevant fields In each of those text watchers invoke getCard SDK version Summary See Video After inputting a credit card number requiring SCA you are unable to click on Complete Authentication the video shows someone tapping FAIL AUTHENTICATION when they are actually attempting to tap on Complete Authentication The application

Flutter There are ways of doing that One is to use platformchannels so that a Dart layer interfaces with the original StripeAndroid code in Java or Kotlin see Another is to port it to native Dart Note Since Flutter is for iOS and Android please also see Currently there are some individuals trying to start something in that regard and but thats incipient and I believe the Flutter community actually deserves official support from Stripe Flutter reached stable and is growing very fast We need Stripe there too This is an issue for some time now but was closed by mrmcduffstripe last year stating that new controls would be released fredstripe stated it would be possible to bridge the native stripe widgets for RN but this is actually not currently possible for Android Will this ever be

changing text inputs in the Multiline Card Input Im getting a lot of spam warnings in the logcat Although I may be incorrect I believe this may be due to how you clear the hints when doing animations in the EditText UI elements The code can be found here here here and here in the CardMultiLineWidgetjava file lines and Although perhaps other UI elements of yours may be subject to the same issue Suggested solutions are to use getHintclear on the hint CharSequence to remove the errors instead of setting it to be blank as suggested here I may be incorrect but Im afraid I dont have time to explore further yet I may try update this issue in future
