Hi I found some errors when pulling multiple variables from ACS yr data and I believe this cause is that the census does not return the estimates in the same order at ZCTA level And since the package just does a simple colbind for the variables some of the estimates are mismatched with the geoids I tried to pull each indicator separately and merge them together by their geoid everything looks fine then The parameter names in makeVarlist are not particularly clear especially varsearch Id like to rethink that function and add more options in a future release Open to suggestions
