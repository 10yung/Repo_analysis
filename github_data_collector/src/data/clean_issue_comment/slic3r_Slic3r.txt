 slic r version Windows Behavior on top and bottom layer when using adaptative quality the layer height evolves as it should I presume but I also get a layer thickness evolution that is weird only the very top and bottom layers has width but the others out of in my configuration if I remember or maybe out of topbottom layers has a very small width see in the sliced file What is it happening topbottomlayercrazynesszip STLConfig ZIP where problem occurs Upload a zipped copy of an STL and your config File Export Config Add a new printer profile for M D Micro which needs minor differences to all the existing printer profiles to print the generated Gcode Builds with all existing tests passing on my Debian Buster Have tested a few printouts which works on the M D Micro A feature for gradient infill would be great Do not request features for the Prusa D fork of Slic r here without confirming it is applicable to the mainline Slic r or your issue will be closed Development builds of Slic r Prusa D Issue Tracker Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I am struggling to create a material D print using Slic r When I attempt to export the gcode I get an error saying Some objects are too close your extruder will collide with them As far as I understand this is due to a hull being generated around both objects but is there a way to disable this check or to generate a hull around the two objects Slic rerror Describe the solution youd like If anyone can suggest a way around this it would be greatly appreciated Please also do try to give as much detail as possible as I am a beginner with the software and with D printing Describe alternatives youve considered I have been able to print this structure using two materials with the Ultimaker so practically I dont think the structures are too close together However I need to be able to print this using the custom printer we have available which has been setup with the Slic r software Additional context Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Leaky extruders combined with a stringy filament make using a skirt for priming the extruder difficult When it first starts extruding there is a string of filament that doesnt adhere to the bed possibly laying in the print zone disturbing the actual print Describe the solution youd like A simple purge line is the best way to get around this issue It is easily implemented tooall that is needed would be a third option next to brim and skirt with a few parameters such as position and speed settings Describe alternatives youve considered My printer is calibrated so the problem cant be fixed by tuning I used to snip off the string while printing which is not an optimal solution Right now Im using a purge line per custom gcode M Extruder in absolute mode G Home extruder G X Y Z FZTRAVELSPEED M Turn off fan G Absolute positioning M S start extruder heating M S firstlayerbedtemperature set bed temp M S

tab requires multiple Save operations to actually save the changes because Slic r hasnt recognized that the additional changes took place Steps to reproduce the behavior Open multiple settings tabs for one print job For example open the Print Settings and Filament Settings tabs Make a change on the Print Settings tab and Save Switch to the Filament Settings tab and make a change Note that the word modified does NOT appear in the setting title Save your change Make another change on the Filament Settings tab Note that the word modified appears in the setting title Save your change If you quit Slic r between steps and then reopen it you will see that your setting was NOT saved Likewise if you process a model to generate gcode without performing steps and you will find that the new setting has not applied Under this particular scenario it appears as though Slic r has not recognized that a change has taken place and a Save that doesnt actually save anything is required to provide that recognition D Model and Slic r Configuration Export This is not modelspecific nor does it have anything to do with my configuration Expected behavior When I make a settings change and hit the Save button I expect for my settings to be saved every time Desktop please complete the following information OS macOS Mojave Version Additional context Not a lot of context should be needed This is quite clearly a bug and its reproducible This is a very obvious bug and I assumed that someone had already reported it but I could not find it in the Issues list Related to Describe the bug The complexity of your implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm is On It can be implemented with a complexity of On log n using a priority queuemin heap instead of an array To Reproduce Have a look here Expected behavior The implementation should have On log n complexity Btw why do you use Perl C has a lot of wellimplemented data structures and is way more efficient during my installation ill get the following message Working on WxbuildMakeMaker Fetching OK Configuring Wx OK Building and testing Wx FAIL Installing WxbuildMakeMaker failed See rootcpanmwork buildlog for details Retry with force to

failed to install Wx i tried to install on my win and ubuntuorangepie and i get the same failure on both the logfile says that WX is not a known MakeMaker parameter name can anyone help Do not report

downloaded Slic r bitzip I unzipped the file When I double click on Slic rexe I receive the error in the title To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Go to folder the zip file was unzipped to
