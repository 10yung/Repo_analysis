Sorry to bother you with this but I am not able to change the configuration to fit my needs I am not sure if this is an issue I want to avoid the extra empty lines before and after regions public interface IViewModelContext region Events event EventHandlerPrimaryChainChangedArgs PrimaryChainChanged As an example after running reorganization I always get an extra empty line before the region

large files This PR is a reworkreattempt of Problem Spade panel content does great job of showing the exact anatomy of the source code document However that exact may not be always practical as often the spade content has very little code navigation value eg back fields indexers The problem becoms particulary difficult to deal with when deailng with the large files like automgenerated ViewModels when the most of the realestate of the Spade paned is wasted on back fields and the really useful stuff like properties and methods cannot be accessed without scrolling which needs to be repeated everytime user svitsch the active document to a new file Solution Similarly to the Properties panel of Visual Studio Spade panel now maintains collapsed tree view nodes even when active document is switched to a different file The feature can be enableddisabled from the user settings dialog It is enabled by default User can completely hide some items types in the tree view of Spade panel The feature can be enableddisabled from the user settings dialog It is disabled by default I also added suppressing UIThread warnings in the debug mode since they do not trigger any problems and you decided to not address them anyway I actually agree with that approach If it is not what you want it can be easily reverted in the project file I have also noticed that users requested some other Spade improvements associated with Spade panel remembering user choices eg zoom between the sessions Environment Visual Studio version CodeMaid version Feature Request Description It would be helpful if the Spade zoom level set using the mousewheel were saved between VS sessions Currently you have to rezoom every time you close open VS I separate my event handlers and it would be great if codemaid could do this automatically Description Id like to see a preview of what changes Cleanup or Reorganize will do Something like Compare to Unmodified in Solution Explorer where a new window is generated showing the current document to the proposed changes for a sidebyside comparison Environment Visual Studio version example Community CodeMaid version example Description It will be nice to have Items nesting functionality built into codemaid Hi I added the possibility to includeexclude the ability to sort static classes methods etc Include static sort activeinactive in settings Extend
