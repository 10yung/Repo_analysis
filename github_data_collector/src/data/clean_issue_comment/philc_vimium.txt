Now works properly with Shadow DOM ref discussion at Id like to set up a command like commandshiftk to go to the next tab regardless of if Im in the text box or not Is it possible to set up a find mode command that opens a link in a new window Alternatively Saka Key has find mode that opens in a new window but on chrome I cant seem to use them simultaneously On Firefox I have it set up so Saka literally only has that one keyboard shortcut setup and it works well in sync with vimiumff Just not in Chrome but Id prefer to use Chrome Are there any plans to adopt commands for incremental search and highlighting such as set incsearch set hlsearch The first thing that made me have a happy grin on my face when using vim as text edior was when I learned about the vim dot repeat function It was the first experience of how one can simply automate tedious linear and repetetive tasks with a single key As years have passed since I hereby kindly request to review request with the goal of implementing a way to repeat the last action taken using vimium This is quite powerful for things like going one tab left or previousTab If you want to do that multiple times you could just go on tab left once and then easily navigate through your tabs while just pressing the dot key On Chrome the default action of chrometabscreateTab when positionnull is to open at the end of tabs but on Firefox it isnt So this PR fixes it philc See And this PR has been welltested Hey folks I plan to modernize the code base by porting it from coffeescript to ES This will make the source more accessible to more developers and remove the complexity of having to transpile Major impacts of this Some hardtonotice bugs may be introduced by the decaffeinate conversion When Ive used decaffeinate on large code bases before Ive botched a few cases of removing unnecessary implicit return statements which are on by default on coffeescript All of the open PRs will become unmergeable and require revision before they can be reevaluated Forks of Vimium will no longer be able to cleanly rebase on top of our recent commits It will become harder to find the history behind each line using git blame and git grep I wanted to give a heads up that this is coming in case anyone has strong objections The tentative date for the conversion is Jan I may ship a new release to the store before then with a few bug fixes Regarding the open PRs Im going to review the most recent and merge those which seem valuable and lowrisk If a change is large and has a strong risk of destabilizing the code base Ill likely not merge it and ask that it be reworked post the ES conversion In case anyone wants to advocate strongly for an existing open PR to get merged before the conversion now is the time Once the source is converted to ES Id appreciate beta testers using the version on master to help surface breakages in features that I dont normally use before this version gets shipped to the chrome store to a wider audience Thanks This should be great I am a fan of this incredible extension Although we have two keys map f LinkHintsactivateModeToOpenInNewTab map F LinkHintsactivateMode But because the link has lots of target attibutes such as blank parent and so on sometimes we cant know the actual behavior when we hit f or F So i think its a good way to colorize the label on the link whether it will be opend in current tab or new tab Is there a way to add costume action for opening links in new foreground tabs Also is there a way to disable or modify keyboard shortcuts for existing actions
