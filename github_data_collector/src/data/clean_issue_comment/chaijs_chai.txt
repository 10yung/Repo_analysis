The documentation for above states The aliases gt and greaterThan can be used interchangeably with above However for least The alias gte can be used interchangeably with least To my mind there should be a greaterThanOrEqual alias for least in addition to the current gte alias for conformity in the use of these APIs The same applies to below and most the latter would benefit from a lessThanOrEqual alias Im trying to test if an array increases in length by after executing a certain operation The test is written in typescript and runs with the usual mocha r tsnoderegister mytestts The chai version is Unfortunately it does not compile with the error TS Property by does not exist on type Assertion Here is a simplified test to reproduce the error import expect from chai describeOneTest function itbugz functiondone const aa const len aalength expectaapush toincreaselen lenby done I dont see any definition for by in typeschai file indexdts and if I add the line bydelta number Assertion at the end of interface Assertion it compiles Well the test fails but this is another problem Thanks for investigating mario On expect documentation page the entry for fail is duplicated One is enough Thanks mario This code passes the test however it shouldnt ts const test data data data expecttestnottohavekeys data mocha chai Hi I have a little library that requires chai for tests I have to generate a dts file in order to use my lib with TypeScript Heres what happens Unexpected crash Please log a bug with the commandline you specified homeyoannpicquenotnvmversionsnodev libnodemodulesdtsgenbinlibrunjs throw e Error Invalid Chai property equallength See docs for proper usage of equal at Functionget homeyoannpicquenotdevblablatesthelpersnodemoduleschailibchaiutilsaddLengthGuardjs at Objectget anonymous at ObjectproxyGetter as get homeyoannpicquenotdevblablatesthelpersnodemoduleschailibchaiutilsproxifyjs at getParameterListAndReturnType homeyoannpicquenotnvmversionsnodev libnodemodulesdtsgenbinlibindexjs at getPrototypeMember homeyoannpicquenotnvmversionsnodev libnodemodulesdtsgenbinlibindexjs at namesfiltermapname homeyoannpicquenotnvmversionsnodev libnodemodulesdtsgenbinlibindexjs at Arraymap anonymous at getClassPrototypeMembers homeyoannpicquenotnvmversionsnodev libnodemodulesdtsgenbinlibindexjs at getResult homeyoannpicquenotnvmversionsnodev libnodemodulesdtsgenbinlibindexjs at getTopLevelDeclarations homeyoannpicquenotnvmversionsnodev libnodemodulesdtsgenbinlibindexjs I have tried to generate dts file separately npm install g chai dtsgen m chai I got the same error It says I have to log a bug how am I supposed to do that EDIT node v npm chai The Buffer and new Buffer constructors are not recommended for use due to security and usability concerns Please use the new Bufferalloc BufferallocUnsafe or Bufferfrom construction methods instead Probably there is missing info in the content for installing Chai Assertions for Promises It is supposed to be npm install chaiaspromised Link Screenshot from Is there a chai plugin with html diff Something like the chaixml which is excellent but does not digest img and similars Ive to compare two html strings Original Ive seen numerous posts on stack overflow about this issue however none of the solutions that I have read thus far have worked in my specific case Im generally quite confused as to why this might be happening Things Ive already tested Adding test scripts to test folder Adding test script folder path to test command Adding test script file path to test command The weirdest thing of all is that Moca is definitely finding the files and executing them and running the tests In fact if a test fails Moca will throw an error eg js AssertionError expected to equal at Objectanonymous UsersSancarnDocumentsProgrammingGithubnodemacUIAutomationtestTSEnumtestjs So the tests are definitely running and the tests are definitely passing As you can see from the TSEnumtestjs file below I should have passes However when run it says passed js npm test macuiautomation test UsersSancarnDocumentsProgrammingGithubnodemacUIAutomation mocha testtestjs CoolSuite passing ms Why does it say passed How can I fix this Any ideas My project folder structure packagejson lib TSEnumjs test TSEnumtestjs Packagejson scripts test nodemodulesbinmocha testtestjs In TSEnumtestjs js const assert requirechaiassert consolelogtsesuite returns CoolSuite asserttsesuite CoolSuiteSuite no initialised assert zomg assert zomg assert zomg assert zomg So does anyone have any idea why it says passed Everything else seems to work fine except this issue Its not a major issue but is very confusing Thanks
