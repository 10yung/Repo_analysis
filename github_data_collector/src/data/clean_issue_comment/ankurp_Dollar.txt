In order to use Swift Package Manager to add Dollar as a dependency in Xcode the Packageswift file must specify at least one target This PR updates Packageswift to add Dollar as a target What I install Dollar through Carthage Run and build are fine But when distribute to itunes connect It throws this error ERROR ITMS This bundle PayloadXXXappFrameworksDollarframework is invalid The Infoplist file is missing the required key CFBundleVersion Please find more information about CFBundleVersion at Screenshot at AM swift func fullfillelement Any count Int let a afullfill fullfill will extend the array with several numbers of elements For example I cannot currently do this omitmyDictionary keys one two three But must instead do this omitmyDictionary keys one two three For lots of design paradigms eg my blacklisted set of keys is shared and represented as an array or Ive derived the list of keys from an API and dont have them as individual values this is frustrating This thread indicates that there is no languagespecific way to pass an array into a variadic parameter Thus I think should support this the variadic versions can call into the array versions
