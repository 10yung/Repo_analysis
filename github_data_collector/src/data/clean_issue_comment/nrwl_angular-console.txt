Description ng generate fails with error UnrecognizedToken Click the Run button to reproduce as follows ng generate schematicsangularcomponent namesquare projectMyAppAngular Problem The is making PowerShell treat schematicsangularcomponent as a variable Resolution Add double quotes when executing command ng generate schematicsangularcomponent namesquare projectMyAppAngular Angular console version disabled the Generate menu item and does not display the command palette for my project When I downgrade to version the command works by displaying the list of commands I have the angularjson and nxjson files in my workspace I do not have the new workspacejson file Has this feature been removed from the extension Im really struggling to find it and i made frequent use of it When creating a library the option to use ESLint is missing This was removed in a recent update and considering that TSLint is now deprecated Palantir announcing TSLint deprecation this is important to have I understand that Angular doesnt fully support ESLint Angular migration to ESLint issue but this should still be a feature Also when applying lint fixes after say generating a component isnt currently working even with eslintrc file defined The error I get is Cannot find module tslint Though I assume its a related issue Sidenote great work on the recent overhaul Thanks Add e e tests for vscode ng e e vscode TODO Swap out mocha for jest should be doable using jestcli programmatically Write meaningful assertions I installed the standalone app and its only showing a white screen Starting it from a

If I access the port in my browser it seems to work Is this the intended behavior Hi there I have been following the tutorial to create an Nx workspace for my new group of applications After creating the empty Angular workspace I installed the Angular Console extension in VS Code Im trying to use the Generate feature to create the initial application but running into an error in the generated command I notice that it seems to be using an absolute path to ngcmd instead of just using ng as Ive seen it should be doing in the tutorial video In another console window I can run ng commands just fine as it is installed globally and there is a reference to C Users jordanw AppData Roaming npm in my PATH Im developing on Windows My globally installed Angular CLI version is and I upgraded the devDependencies in my workspaces packagejson to match that Any ideas what I could do to resolve this Let me know if I can provide any more information Thanks in advance Jordan I have set up a ng command and when I run it using cli it works However when I use the angular console vscode extention it fails with the space issue in the pathing x is this a bug I think so or this can be a mismatch of functionalities x did you search issues before creating new one Yes not found similar issues for what I am reporting x can you explain the issue in detail Creating a web component nonangular workspace using nxworkspace but the newly created workspace is not detected by AngularConsole which is looking for angularjson file I understand the application is called Angular Console But if the command line allows creating a nonangular workspace it would be great to have the Console application to detect it Based on the nature of AngularConsole at the current time it remains Angular specific But it would be great to have it also load nonangular workspaces Perhaps a new name may be good to have NrwlConsole maybe x have steps to reproduce npm init nxworkspace commonutils What to create in the new workspace web components a workspace with a single app built using web components Application name Foobar Creating a sandbox with Nx new commonutils presetwebcomponents appNameFoobar collectionnrwlworkspace Which stylesheet format would you like to use SASSscss Open AngularConsole and point it to the new workspace and it wont be able to recognize it due to the missing angularjson x can you include the versions node v nrwlcli nrwltao UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY nrwlworkspace nrwlschematics nrwlangular nrwlcypress nrwljest nrwlworkspace nrwlcli nrwltao npm nrwlworkspace nrwlcli nrwltao x can you reproduce this in Electron and VSCode Yes both have difficulties detecting a workspace without angularjson Hi I have a couple of custom schematics in my workspace They work fine when using separate folders per schematic and each having its own schemajson lets call this scenario A However now Im trying to add more schematics which Id like to group per subject say schematics belong to a group ngrx and a couple of schematics belonging to a group spectator To be able to do that I have added a collectionjson file referencing the custom schematics of course to the schematics folder lets call this scenario B Now when I try to run the schematics using scenario B I get an exception excerpt from angularerrorslog error Error Schematic Workspace not found in collection nrwlangular at

inspect the source code file readschematiccollectionsts from angularconsole There Im seeing an ifelse condition handling the custom schematics either using scenario A or B For scenario A Im seeing this implemenation starting at line const schematics listFilescollectionDir filterf pathbasenamef schemajson mapf const schemaJson readJsonFilef return name schemaJsonjsonid collection collectionName

schematicCollectionschematicspush name k collection collectionName schema normalizeSchemaschematicSchemajson projectDefaults description vdescription npmClient null npmScript null You can see that scenario B is missing the nmpScript implementation which might be the problem Ive provided my custom schematics for reference Again when deleting the collectionjson in the provided zip and renaming ngrxschemajson and serviceschemajson in the different folders to just schemajson scenario A is executed and everything works fine Please let me know if you need more info to replicate this issue
