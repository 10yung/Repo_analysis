mason is taken For me with current versions this gets stuck at the TravisAppveyor question I can select buttons with space move up and down but cant move the questions ahead On both Mac and Linux in the terminal In the R gui thing on a mac it works OK I suspect this is an ask problem Ie the user can have a config file or something that contains the answers to some questions and then these are never asked Will need to work out how exactly this would work A template can build on another template
