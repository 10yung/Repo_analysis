When I mess up the pin for my login or the connection fails osxfuse locks up finder and gradually the rest of the system locks up and requires a hard reboot to clear I am on a Macbook Pro with MacOS Mojave SSHFS version OSXFUSE SSHFS OSXFUSE FUSE library version When my connection drop the finder stop responding for a good to min No kernel panic no crash report just Finder is not Responding then it come back to normal I am on Mojave using the osxfuse Beta Dumb weird edge case I have my password for an ssh server saved in an image document on my Mac I used sshfs to mount a remote server and when it asked for the password I went to go open the Image Finder couldnt open the Image Preview Viewer while SSHFS was waiting for my password When I tried to relaunch Finder thinking it had crashed it relaunched but wouldnt let me open a finder window I assume that OSXFuseSSHFS causes a type of systemwide hang while it is in the process of mounting a drive This isnt really a big issue but one I thought I would bring to your attention and now that I know it happens I will be more aware of it in the future Great software and a godsend Hope someone with the same edgecorner case finds this note

In Finder if you eject the volume fuseloopmt exits with Is there a way to hook into this functionality to provide better user experience such as prompting the user to quit the client program Hello It seems to be a problem with deleting the docx files using the LoopbackFS sample project on OSX Catalina When deleting the docx file the callback removeItemAtPath is not called and after the file is gone a temp file fusehidden appears in the same directory Do you know any solutions for this Thanks in advance My file system is using the fuse argument parsing helpers ie a construct like this struct fuseargs args FUSEARGSINITargc argv if fuseoptparse args NULL myfsopts myfsoptproc return This let me do things like myfs h usage myfs source mountpoint options general options o opt opt mount options h help print help V version print version FUSE options d o debug enable debug output implies f f foreground operation s disable multithreaded operation o allowother allow access to other users o allowroot allow access to root o autounmount auto unmount on process termination o nonempty allow mounts over nonempty filedir o defaultpermissions enable permission checking by kernel o fsnameNAME

mountpoint options general options o opt opt mount options h help print help V version print version FUSE options d o debug enable debug output implies f f foreground operation s disable multithreaded operation fuse no mount point Ie there is both an error thrown about a missing mount point and I assume here OSXFUSE has a lot of options missing display of available mount options too Is OSXFUSE not fully supporting the Linux reference implementation of fuseoptparse In the the callback myfsoptproc this is what is done when the help key is found case OPTKEYHELP fprintfstderr usage s source mountpoint options n n general options n o opt opt mount options n h help print help n V version print version n n outargsargv fuseoptaddargoutargs ho fusemainoutargsargc outargsargv dummyops NULL exit This comes from some example code from FUSE I can only guess it is here somewhere it goes south Any suggestion what can be done to make this work also on OSXFUSE Just for info the exact same sequence works as expected on other FUSE like clones such as WinFSPCygfuse and Dokan If I remember correctly it also works on FreeBSD but unfortunately I cannot verify that right now Or is it so simple that there are no more options to present Hi I got a new Mac the OS version is macOS Mojave Then I try to install osxfuse with the command brew cask install osxfuse but the installation is failed I searched online and tried csrutil disable to recreate the varfolderszz files but doesnt help Below is the error logs Does anyone have an idea about this error Thanks in advance QIOWUM WQ

Qiong No error while installing or mounting but it actually not getting mounted ls to the mountpoint is blank sshfs V SSHFS version OSXFUSE SSHFS OSXFUSE FUSE library version fuse no mount point Hello bfleischer In Catalina Beta A a Image files not opening through Finder and not showing thumbnail I think that it is similar to issue You said that it was caused by a bug in Catalina and already fixed by Apple but Preview application still cannot open the image files with directio mount option On the other hand QuickTime Player works fine with audio or video files LoopbackFS example added directio mount option also has same issue Please check this issue Thanks call func resourceAttributesset icon for folder in macOS icon sometimes incorrect
