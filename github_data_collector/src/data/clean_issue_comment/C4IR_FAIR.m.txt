On page the book states that the transformation used from figure e to figure f a perfectly determine quadratic landmarkbased map is invertible and thus meaningless for image registration purposes This should say uninvertible instead of invertible right Mostly typos or copy paste errors I also told FAIRcheckFiles to consider all mex files as known not just linux mex files Extending to D and matrixfree implementations Extends on Haris work yn is not defined when wc is empty Therefore xn should be updated by yRef Addpath for addons folders during FAIR startup solver is defined as a char not string Probably this issue has recently arises because of structural changes in R a Pull breaks any example code that calls GaussNewtonm For instance E HNSPMLPIRSSDaffine Dm breaks at line in GaussNewtonm There are actually two issues line of GaussNewtonm has a syntax error and the variable solver is being parsed as the string backslash Line should be changed from error to errorError because error only accepts strings A workaround for the second issue is to comment out lines in GaussNewtonm A fix will require further investigation into the parsing of the solver variable
