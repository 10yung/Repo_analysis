This is one of my favorites from Atom and was disappointed to find a lack of support on JetBrains Is a plan for a seti mock in the future I would love to see it It causes horizontal scrollbars to have a dark theme Gloom Peacock Recently IntelliJ finally started supporting the ability to create UI Themes I wrote a quick node script that parses each color scheme xml file and generates the relevant UI theme json file Note this only supports versions Heres a link to the docs Admittedly Im not a designer and dont have an eye for this sort of thing but I was tired of using these great themes with a different UI in IntelliJ You can change any of the values with fields from the xml color schemes Im currently running the jar file The light themes could probably use some looking over I use strictly dark themes but I did confirm they all load Hi daylerees Wanted to tell you thanks for your job with such great color themes But recently Ive faced the issue I started to use Github Light theme and Ive noticed that the color of the params is not readable at all could you pls guide me how to fix that issue Thanks Screenshot of the issue I install the plugins from pycharm but i dont know where I can choose the theme when going from the darcula theme to a rain glow Im using blink the project view uses the Intellij theme font color in the project view This creates a dark on dark font and makes it very hard to read Im aware this project hasnt been updated in a while but I assume it gets any bug fixes if any show up The problem The notification is made for a dark theme but its using a light theme These are called notifications in the color scheme editor anyways I assume it applies to the actual notifications as well This happens on every single light theme Its fine in the dark ones because the text is readable but in the light ones the one in the pic is arbitrarily chosen it shows up like that Here is the problem which Ive found in every light theme Ive tried That value sets the notification color and it is only a problem in the light themes A quick search finds results all in xml files not filtering lightdarkcontrast so its set to that for them all It doesnt follow most of the themes which isnt that big an issue but on the light themes its unreadable For anyone using these themes this can be temporarily fixed by going to Settings Editor Color Schemes General Editor Notification background But it would be optimal for it to be fixed in the schemes themselves rather than manually setting it for the active theme Hey thanks for those awesome themes My personal favourite is Laravel despite never having coded in PHP lol but I found some issues with it I really enjoy the fact that variables are white DEDEDE I really helps to distinguish them from method calls In the original Laravel theme from rainglowio function arguments are also DEDEDE but in this plugin function arguments are FC C img width altimage src In Intellij Idea it can be changed under Identifiers Function declaration img width altimage src Class names are FFC C instead of DEDEDE img width altimage src It can be changed under Classes Class name Same for static classes under Classes Static class Unknown symbols such as method names with a typo are missing Underwave which makes them undistinguishable from properly named methods It can be changed under Errors and Warnings Unknown symbol Outlined entity has a foreground nearly the same as Editor background It can be changed under Code Outlined entity I guess it can be completely removed or changed to Bordered effect First thanks for great themes awesome piece of work And the problem in all themes folded texts are light yellow I guess they have not been overridden This makes them completely unreadable when using light themes
