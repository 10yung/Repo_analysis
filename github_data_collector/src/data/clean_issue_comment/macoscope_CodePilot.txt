Hi I rewrote parts of CodePilot so it works with Xcode Its available here It still needs some work to get all of the symbol functionality back to the original but I havent much time It should be quite easy now the approach for Xcode is clear in the new code My main use case is the new switcher function I added Do you think I should attempt a pull request or rename the repo to something else but still provide a link to this version Best Regards Anthony When the Mainstoryboard eg default initial storyboard shows up in the search results it appears as a yellow folder and I cant open it directly However I can open other storyboards Ive created this way ie type Ano for Anotherstoryboard and then select it The Mainstoryboard shows up correctly as a storyboard in the recent files list however Its just when typingsearching that it appears as a yellow folder This is on the latest Xcode and OS but Ive had this issue for a long time on many versions of Xcode and many projects Thanks It seems that CodePilot doesnt render correctly on retina screens The logo and others icons are blurry Is this a known issue One of the great features of Xcodes Open Quickly is the option to choose where exactly to open the selected file by showing the This way I can choose if I want to open in the Standard editor in the Assistant editor in a new tab or in a new Xcode window mainview From the docs For OptionShift navigation OptionShiftclick or OptionShiftchoose a file Xcode displays a graphical navigation chooser showing the current layout The chooser prompts you to open the file in any open editor pane in any window and tab or to open the file in a new editor pane window or tab Is it possible we can see this feature coming in CodePilot I found my CPU usage was pegged at about and the fan was going constantly so I removed the plugin which resolved the problem Is there anything I can send you to help debug this Xcode A rMBP GHz i There is a large delay between typing something and the results appearing and allowing the user to hit enter and proceed For myself this causes me to press enter before the results have appeared when Im using a search result I know will get me where I want Changing DEFAULTSSEARCHINTERVALKEY to a smaller float fixes the delay as expected but causes significant lag in the UI action response Id like to spend some time in instruments and see if I can figure out ways to improve this This ticket will also allow open discussion of areas in need of improvement
