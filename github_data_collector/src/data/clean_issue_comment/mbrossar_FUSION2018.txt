Hi Dear Martin At first I want to thank you for sharing the code u have written for ur paper I want to add GPS data to your code and so fuse IMU GPS and visual data but I dont exactly know how can I do that would you please help me that how can I do that Thanks in advance Dear Dr Martin Brossard Hello I am very interested in this research work However I have some confusion about the program for the ORBSLAMINT database It is excellent that you provide some introduction for the ORBSLAMINT database For example orbslamtrackerMain orbslamtrackerBis orbslammyTracks and what their role is The second issue I am facing is in ObserveLandmarks function Object tracking is to create a tracking object initialize and track Track the corner points directly in the current image frame using trackerMainstepline I did not find the creation and initialization of the object Whether the creation and initialization of the object was completed in orbslamtrackerMain or orbslamtrackerBis Thanks Dear Martin Thank you very much for sharing the code and the helping out also for the first Issue In function h which is widely used in all the Update functions the syntax is following ybar z z but I was having the division issue So I solved it in the following way A z A z B z y A BA B the size of y should be x well it works but I wanted to ask if that is correct The second issue I am facing is in ObserveLandmarks function The algorithm stopped with the following Error using randsample line K must be less than or equal for sampling without replacement Error in ObserveLandmarks line idx randsamplefindvalidityMain Error in mainExperiment line ObserveLandmarkstrackerMaintrackerBisdirImageIdxImage It means my values are greater than zero or complex Could you please guide me how to solve this issue Thank you very much in anticipation and keep up the great work
