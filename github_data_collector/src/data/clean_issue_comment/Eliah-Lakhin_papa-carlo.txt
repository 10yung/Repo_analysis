Hi guys any plans on this Any is a syntax error Parboiled is orders of magnitude faster then native papacarlo matchers It would be great if papacarlo added incremental parsing features on top of high performance of parboiled I am trying to change the js demo to use Calculator parser What I did was only replacing Json with Calculator in Demo object for lexer and syntax Now when I load the demo page initial parsing of mathematical expressions succeeds but when I change the expression in the code editor to test incremental compilation it simply errors out with code mismatch even for the simplest expression Any hints what might be causing that Hi Eliah maybe this is a stupid question but Im just learning about parsers and lexers now something cool about the scala parser is than I can build a structure of scala objects which I can traverse in a simple way using pattern matching for instance the terms in this blog I can match over Integera Multiplicationabetc I was thinking than would be a solution iterate times the first one traverse the nodes and build a tree of scala objects and then work with thisbut Im not sure if its a good approach or there is a better solution thanks
