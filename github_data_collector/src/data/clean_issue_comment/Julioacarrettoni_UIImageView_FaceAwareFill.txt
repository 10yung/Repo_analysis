Hi Julioacarrettoni Thanks first of all for this awesome library Looks great I just have one problem I use it show images which are downloaded from our server using PinRemoteImage and I get the issue where the original image is shown for a brief moment and then the one which uses the FaceAware feature appears Is there an option to prevent the original image from appearing ie keep showing the Loading Indicator until the final one is ready Thanks again Ofer First off this framework works great and it is extremely easy to use Thank you creating it and making it open source Although I am experiencing fairly considerable decrease in performance though Has anyone else reported such an issue There is noticeable lag slowness navigating to screens where we are performing the uiimageview faceawarefill where there wasnt any before with a standard aspectfill Any insight or guidance would be greatly appreciated Thanks Note My accuracy is set to low still appears to be detecting faces perfectly Minor documentation cleanup Does this work on a button image Seems to work fine till you click on it and then it zooms in Sorry for being a noob
