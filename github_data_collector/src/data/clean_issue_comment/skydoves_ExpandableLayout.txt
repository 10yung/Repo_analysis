Please complete the following information Library Version Affected Devices Generic device Im using this library inside a recyclerview Each item in the recyclerview can be expanded but the content of each item can vary so the height is different for each item The library seems to calculate the height for each item however the height is not correct For each item is always less the the real layout size Expected Behavior Since the content of each item is dynamic the library should expose a method that can re mesure the height of the second layout Databinding is not working please suggest a working databinding code for this UI
