Added basic support for Exchange detection and handling ContentIndexState no longer existing in Exchange when you query it from Exchange it reports back as NotApplicable but when you query from an Exchange server it returns ContentIndexState as instead so I have caught both of these Ive not tested on as I dont run this presumably it will return as either or do though Currently Im just reporting s ContentIndexState as just Healthy so it shows nicely as green but I guess this could be changed to show as Not Applicable and still show as green if preferred this was just a quick hack to get the report working Hello If you want here is my fix for the issue Regards
