When Lidgren Client gets disconnected from server it cannot connect again I have explained this issue here Hello While investigating random timeout connection issues on perfect connections Ive noticed that ReceivedPong could handle only the latest ping request msentPingNumber which is certainly not perfect in some cases Ive also noticed that NetConnectionResetTimeout call in the NetReliableSenderChannel to not working as expectedthe client is dropping connection by timeout set as seconds in some rare but reproducible for some clients cases I will keep investigating this issue Regards I am facing this issue Socket bound to True Network thread started InitiatedConnect user called connect Failed to send packet SystemNetSocketsSocketException x An address incompatible with the requested protocol was used at SystemNetSocketsSocketSendToByte buffer Int offset Int size SocketFlags socketFlags EndPoint remoteEP at LidgrenNetworkNetPeerActuallySendPacketByte data Int numBytes IPEndPoint target Boolean connectionReset in D projects lidgrennetworkgen LidgrenNetwork NetPeerLatencySimulationcsline DnsGetHostEntry also returns IPv addresses In this case the IPv address is first in the list Steps to reproduce download latest codebase open any example in my case I tested the chat client server run and fail Probably this could be caused by having many vEthernets on my machine and wifi Hello I am working on the GUI for my networked application and when the client tries to connect I get the NetConnectionStatusInitiatedConnect in the StatusChangeMessage When the client is not able to connect immediately it will try more handshake attempts and I want to show the user of my app that it is doing this After the StatusChange I only get ErrorMessages that it failed to send a packet I want to show the user Trying to connect And then something like Trying to connect Trying to connect Trying to connect But I cant seem to access any information that the client is resending the handshake attempttrying to connect again I think a StatusChangeMessage would be nice or some other kind of event Any ideas on how to achieve this behaviour Do I have to extend lidgren network for this or can this be achieved with the current version Cant use UPnP to open ports automatically Already checked router config UPnP is turned on and works as intended with other applications I executed a project I wrote with this commit bdb e e f d da d c cde e and it works fine although it fails to correctly update the connection status of the client the latest commit c c b f ec d a c d on the other hand just refuses to connect at all Hello Please forgive me for my poor English I create a simple pingpong test project after host and client create connect client send a empty message to host when host got message then send a empty message back to client If undefine CONSTRAINED the duration is ms When define CONSTRAINED the duration is ms I am wondering why the delay is so big when CONSTRAINED Any help is appreciated Thanks This has been a fairly rare occurrence but we had a few crashes that looked like this SystemInvalidOperationException Collection was modified enumeration operation may not execute at SystemThrowHelperThrowInvalidOperationExceptionExceptionResource resource at SystemCollectionsGenericList EnumeratorMoveNextRare at SystemCollectionsGenericList EnumeratorMoveNext at LidgrenNetworkNetPeerSendMessageNetOutgoingMessage msg IList recipients NetDeliveryMethod method Int sequenceChannel at LidgrenNetworkNetServerSendToAllNetOutgoingMessage msg NetDeliveryMethod method It seems like the SendToAll method is enumerating all connections but perhaps in the off chance that someone connects during that brief moment this crash will happen Side note most of my code uses the SendMessageNetOutgoingMessage msg NetConnection recipient NetDeliveryMethod method method and that one has never crashed thus far When building the LidgrenNetworkMultiTarget project I currently get tons of warnings like NetBitWriterReadUInt byte int int does not need a CLSCompliant attribute because the assembly does not have a CLSCompliant attribute LidgrenNetworkMultiTarget I was able to fix this by adding a file PropertiesAssemblyInfocs in the MultiTarget project folder with just the line assembly SystemCLSComplianttrue It might also be worth noting that the autogenerated AssemblyInfo for this project uses the version instead of
