inconsistent Bash file names in READMEmd The Bash file names appear in the latter part of Installation section of the READMEmd file have to be in kebabcase hyphenseparated case instead of snakecase in order for them to be consistent with the actual file names in the examples directory Message from the collaborator Please review my commit and if necessary rectify as appropriate Thank you sho This pull request is intended to fix issue ValueError Layer weight shape not compatible with provided weight shape and to make the imageanalogies package compatible with keras versions and above I only made changes to the vgg py file The newly added code does the following It checks if your version of keras is version or above If your version of keras is version or above then it converts each element x of the list weights into a numpy array transposes each of those arrays and saves the list of transposed arrays back to the weights list weightsT nparrayxT for x in weights weights weightsT If your version of keras is version not or above the weights list is left unchanged the elements of weights are left untransposed Transposing the weights is necessary for compatibility with keras is version or above The code should still be compatible with earlier versions of keras before version Hi Im getting the following error and not sure how to fix it Thanks for any help Paul
