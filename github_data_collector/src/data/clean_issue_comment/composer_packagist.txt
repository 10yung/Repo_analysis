As a package maintainer I would like to know which PHP versions are used when installing my package to be able to take better decisions about increasing the min PHP version of my package if I see that most of my userbase is installing the package on PHP dropping support for PHP might not be the best choice for instance Given that Packagist already collects download stats and that Composer reports the PHP version in its useragent this is a feature that could be provided AFAICT Requires funding support to be merged into Composer and the composercomposer dep to be updated before this can be merged Displaying of funding info in the UI is pretty basic for now It simply lists all links in the details section Maybe someone can come up with a nicer way to display this Maybe a button in that section that is a bit more obvious and then a modal with all the options img width altScreenshot src Requires the addition of a funding text column to the version table prior to deployment Hello there has I suggested recently on the Symfony Devs Slack I think it would be very useful to have the possibility to filter packages by framework specific version Why should you add that This feature would be very helpful for developers who seek to find a package compatible with a specific version of a framework By example if someone wants to build a website with Symfony who has just been released will find all available packages compatible with this major version This feature will be also really helpful when a new major version of a framework Symfony has just been released and developers who want to contribute to make this package compatible with this new major version will be able to find package who need to be upgraded Is keywords can do the job Has proposed by someone could be used to filter specific version of Symfony by example However this means each package author need to had the perfect keyword in the composerjson file to be able to have a filtering system accurate How could you achieve this The best way to achieve this goal would be to parse the packages listed in composerjson under the require and requiredev keys and analyse the version required The parser would also need to check the package type symfonybridge symfonybundle Lets take a example with the next composerjson file from symfonymonologbundle json type symfonybridge require php symfonymonologbridge symfonydependencyinjection symfonyconfig symfonyhttpkernel monologmonolog requiredev symfonyyaml symfonyconsole symfonyphpunitbridge This package seems to be compatible with the next versions of Symfony and due to the dependencies versions listed above but also because the type is symfonybridge So with this information a user will be able to filter packages by specifying the Symfony version or Current the installation stats are providing a total number and a number per release with evolution charts for both of them It would be great to have a similar stats per major version allowing to answer the question is Twig x used more or less often than Twig x for instance which is exactly my current use case Comparing only the latest patch release of each branch is not enough most used versions of Twig are not actually the latest patch releases right now due to being recent Weve switched all of our repos over to using the webhooks yet packagist still reports them as Legacy AutoUpdate Needs Attention They all update properly currently except one which was set up as some sort of ancient mirror and doesnt apparently fire any of the push hooks at github Anyhow when folks unfamiliar with the state of things goes in and try to sort out the one nonupdating repo they see all the other needs attention things and start mashing buttons and hoping for a combo Is there some way we can reset those Ive tried using the to no avail The account in question is all of the repos linked to Those error message are only there when I am logged in and browse to my packages so something leads me to believe its pulling that info from a cache somewhere When I try to log in into Packagist and choose the GitHub option it asks for permission for admin readwrite access on all webhooks for all organizations I am a member of That has nothing to do with user identification I imagine there is some situation where Packagist might want to add its own webhooks to my repos to learn about version updates or something but asking for that permission on login for all my personal and work repositories looks extremely shady would make me violate my job contract and bars anyone with the tiniest spark of security awareness from using the login feature Please dont do that It also asks for read access to all my organization memberships which also seems unrelated to login although maybe its used for some some group management functionality Anyway that level of access does not seem problematic to me but YMMV packagist github login Currently its possible to get the downloads by version with The problem is that if the day month year is over you cant get the number of downloads of the last day month year Would be nice to have the download numbers by a parameter which gives you a year a month or a day Currently the rendering of readmes has different paths using the Github rendered readme for github repos which ensures that we get the same parsing than on Github as Github is doing it rendering the markdown with cebemarkdown for other packages as we dont have prerendered readme for them This suggestion is about replacing cebemarkdown for the second case Nowadays most nongithub repositories on packagist are probably Gitlab ones And Gitlabs markdown is based on CommonMark with a few extensions of their similar to the Github ones see And Bitbucket also uses CommonMark So using a CommonMark parser would probably be better for compatibility of the rendering But cebemarkdown is not such a parser Looks like Packagist isnt picking up branch deletions today Under webhooks in GitHub I can see several deliveries were made today for example Ive made numerous changes to this repo today of which adding tags did correctly generate new versions in Packagist but several branch removals all of which show webhook deliveries being made did not Ive marked with green here additions I made today and removals in red Ill wait before I manually update in case you want to investigate the datalogs Please let me know if I can safely do the manual update It would be very handy if you could specify several parameters at once for the filter query eg something like instead of and
