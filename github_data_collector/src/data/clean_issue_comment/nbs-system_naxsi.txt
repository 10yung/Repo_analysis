We have a Docker container with a webproxy with nginx and naxsi In order to compile naxsi we need to download the sig file It was okey till some months ago that stopped working We download the sig file with docker curl fSL o naxsitargzsig Where docker ENV NAXSIVERSION NAXSITAGuntaggedafabfc baa f NGINXVERSION That download url stopped working for some reason Thanks for your help Added global whitelist in etcnginxwhitelisttxt one IP per line meaning these IPs will never be blocked and JSON output of logged eventsblocks Can you check my code edits beginner to NGINX and NGINX modules If this or similar feature could be merged or added to NAXSI it would be great Hi Team I am using in my project currently modsecurity to filter out bad IPs and allow good ones Something like this modsecurityrules SecRuleEngine On SecRule REMOTEADDR ipMatchFromFile etcmodsecuritywhitelisttxt id phase allow SecRule REMOTEADDR ipMatchFromFile etcmodsecurityblacklisttxt id phase denystatus msg blacklist What would be the best approach to add this functionality to NAXSI Should I add a Rule or modify the code Can you give some tips on either one both or none when this is not possible are there any performance implications or implications in general Any other possibility to achieve this goal in NGINX setup Thanks BasicRule shell BasicRule wl mzBODYVARchannelid Set the post name equal to channelid pass all the rules but it has no effect it is still blocked BasicRule shell BasicRule wl mzURLX articleeditURL Similarly I match a certain URL and then pass all the rules Does not take effect What is the correct rule nxapi codes are modified for python support This seems to solve issue my environment is centos openresty naxsi its a simple page that accept some post html and parse it to get some useful informations but i found that some requests run success and some blocked I need to write a rule that will whitelist anything under a json node So for example I want to send the following in an HTTP request body and whitelist a rule for metadata that will apply to any child node metadata foo Im hungry foo Im hungry where anything under metadata so foo and foo are user defined Is it possible to do this I cant find anything in the documentation My current rule is BasicRule wl mzURLX v paymentsBODYVARXmetadata which doesnt work Hi all I want to whitelist following ban Then I have created following whitelist rule for core rule id But nginx reload failed BasicRule wl mzURLVARcontent This is the error log error NAXSIEXLOG ip serverwwwdomaincom uri F F Fofficialupdaterollhtml id zoneURL varname content F F Fofficialupdaterollhtml client server domaincom request GET officialupdaterollhtml HTTP host wwwdomaincom When I test the nginx with about whitelist rule it gives following error nginx emerg NaxsiConfig Incorrect line BasicRule wl naxsimasternaxsisrcnaxsiskeletonc in etcnginxnaxsinaxsiwhitelistrules nginx configuration file etcnginxnginxconf test failed eg BasicRule wl which is present at location level can work nomal But MainRule wl which is present at http level cannot work Why
