thank you for the solution I have a problem about the negative down sampling you said to speed up training time I down sample non events at ratio owenzhang because the evaluation is logloss not the F or AUC I think the negative down sampling can make the ratio of positive and negative become very different between train and test this can make the logloss in test become larger
