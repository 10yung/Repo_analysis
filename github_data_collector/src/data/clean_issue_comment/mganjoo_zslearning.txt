Hello The wordTable array is of size x and each vector is of length So that makes of those sized vectors for labels for each class of the cifar dataset Are we to assume that each label corresponds to consecutive vectors unser wordTable Heres what I got after loading the file in python using scipyio Edit Did you use them as column vectors each of length in matlab labelnames array array uairplane dtypeU array uautomobile dtypeU array ubird dtypeU array ucat dtypeU array udeer dtypeU array udog dtypeU array ufrog dtypeU array uhorse dtypeU array uship dtypeU array utruck dtypeU dtypeobject version wordTable array header MATLAB MATfile Platform MACI Created on Fri Nov globals Hi Milind and Richard This is Yuting a phd student from Boston University We are trying to compare our recent work with your NIPS paper on zeroshot learning We try to run the code you provided however it seems to be some errors in running the main script Line there doesnt seem to be a resolution field for variable fullParams I set it to as for the Gaussian classifier Is that OK Line the variables thetaSeenSoftmax thetaUnseenSoftmax thetaMapping seenSmTrainParams unseenSmTrainParamsmapTrainParams validX and validY do not seem to exist I see from line and line that you saved some variables to thetaSeenSoftmaxmat and thetaUnseenSoftmaxmat but still theres no variable named after these mat file names As for the other variables I did not find any trace of them Did I miss anything Thanks a lot for your code and time We look forward to hearing back from you Yuting
