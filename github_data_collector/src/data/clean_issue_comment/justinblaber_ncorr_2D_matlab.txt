How could I output the displacement gradients such as dudx and dudy I need them to compute cauhy strain Although I have installed PCT toolbox and openmp configurations seems to be fine as I run handlesncorr ncorr I get this error Files compiled but it was determined that OpenMP is not actually supported Please reinstall Ncorr in single threaded mode or use a compiler which supports OpenMP Please see that all commands are successful mex c standarddatatypescpp Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex c ncorrdatatypescpp Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex c ncorrlibcpp Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex ncorralgformmaskcpp standarddatatypesobj ncorrdatatypesobj ncorrlibobj Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex ncorralgformregionscpp standarddatatypesobj ncorrdatatypesobj ncorrlibobj Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex ncorralgformboundarycpp standarddatatypesobj ncorrdatatypesobj ncorrlibobj Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex ncorralgformthreaddiagramcpp standarddatatypesobj ncorrdatatypesobj ncorrlibobj Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex ncorralgformunioncpp standarddatatypesobj ncorrdatatypesobj ncorrlibobj Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex ncorralgextrapdatacpp standarddatatypesobj ncorrdatatypesobj ncorrlibobj Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex ncorralgadddispcpp standarddatatypesobj ncorrdatatypesobj ncorrlibobj Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex ncorralgconvertcpp standarddatatypesobj ncorrdatatypesobj ncorrlibobj Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex ncorralgdispgradcpp standarddatatypesobj ncorrdatatypesobj ncorrlibobj Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex ncorralgtestopenmpcpp standarddatatypesobj ncorrdatatypesobj ncorrlibobj Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex ncorralgcalcseedscpp standarddatatypesobj ncorrdatatypesobj ncorrlibobj Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex ncorralgrgdiccpp standarddatatypesobj ncorrdatatypesobj ncorrlibobj Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex ncorralgtestopenmpcpp standarddatatypesobj ncorrdatatypesobj ncorrlibobj COMFLAGSCOMFLAGS openmp DNCORROPENMP Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex ncorralgcalcseedscpp standarddatatypesobj ncorrdatatypesobj ncorrlibobj COMFLAGSCOMFLAGS openmp DNCORROPENMP Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully mex ncorralgtestopenmpcpp standarddatatypesobj ncorrdatatypesobj ncorrlibobj COMFLAGSCOMFLAGS openmp DNCORROPENMP Building with Microsoft Visual C MEX completed successfully typencorrinstallinfotxt Hi Justin Wondering if it would be possible to perform the DIC only in a horizontal u direction to improve the computation time Ive applied image rectification prior to uploading them onto the reference and current image so that they are horizontally aligned such that only udisplacement map is necessary How would we go about executing this Hi I was trying to compile ncorr on visual studio But there is an error in code How can I fix it Threre are several places in code with this issue template typename Tcontainer inline typename subiteratorTcontainersubiterator subiteratorTcontaineroperator thischkvalidincrement increment subp then determine position from it subp thisp thisAptrsub indsubp subh rsub Dfirst subp subh rsub Dfirst return this and the error is overloaded function ncorrdetailssubiteratorTcontainersubiterator is not a type name This isnt really an issue in the code but more of request Do you plan on updating Ncorr to be able to plot the Lagrangian strain on the current image This would greatly increase users ability to present data to audiences Hello I have been using ncorr around years but today what i realized that my department will no longer make matlab available for students Is there any way to run ncorr without matlab Thanks Can this theoretically work in Octave This might be good to boost the utility of your program in the open software universe I tried to run this in Octave by following the manual but I encountered errors handlesncorr ncorr parse error near line of file homejeromegithubncorr Dmatlabncorrm syntax error function handlenameoutstate guisethandleposparent Hi Im using matlab v b and contour plot seems not workingI see only borders without data under it i assume it should be filled with color right Like here Do you have any advices
