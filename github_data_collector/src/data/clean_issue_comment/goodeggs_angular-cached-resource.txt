I am having a resource defined as factory like below productsvcjs function use strict angularmodulemodulenamefactoryfactoryname factoryImplementation factoryImplementationinject resource ngInject function factoryImplementationresource return resource getProducts method GET url params getProductById method GET url params I just replaced resource with cachedResource It is not working Can you help how can I do this Fix for Hi Everybody I receive such errors from my error tracking system for users with iOS Unfortunately I cant reproduce this but I think that this case should be handled Stacktrace TypeError null is not an object evaluating cacheKeyindexOf File appminjs line col in cacheKeyHasPrefix File appminjs line col in clear File appminjs line col in clearCache As per the angularcachedresource it is storing array list of object into each array item as object But want to store full response in localstorage as array Is there any flag or solution possible for this LocalForage is a wrap that support too indexdb websql and others with same localstorage api This makes the HTTP headers accessible when doing a query request reading an array in a headers attribute in the response Im trying to handle login timeouts and idling by prompting an unlock screen overlaid to the page thats shown through an HttpInterceptor on requests Ive also queued the failed requests to send them again manually since your plugin doesnt do that for GET but I mustve missed something cause the resent request doesnt seem to trigger the plugin to update the datapromisewhatever Ive linked to it how can I handle this I really like the approach of Reading from the server and also from the cache The first time this module downloads or saves any resource it will cache a copy of that resource in your browser That means that the next time you try and load the resource the promise will immediately resolve and in the code snippet above youll see the alert with the title of the post right away This should provide you with a nice speed boost The module will however still make a request against the server endpoint When it receives a response it will update the cache entry with the new values and it will also update the value of otherPost in place It will also trigger a digest so that angular can update its views if there are any that use that data Magic Finally if you need to listen specifically for the completed HTTP request you can use the httpPromise on the resource object instead of the regular promise object We have build several Angular apps where we grouped all interactions with REST points in services and we use the basic httpget to get data with promises Its not so simple to switch to the resource way of working to be able to plug your angularcachedresource in Have you come across similar angular plugins that support this Reading from the server and also from the cache approach but then for the basic http Or is there a way that we can implement your logic in our services without converting them all to the Resource method Hi Thanks forr the library I played a few with him and I saw that the library returns first the data from the cache and refresh then the data in the cache Can you have the inverse behaviour Return the data from the server and if there isnt no connections return in fallback the data in the cache
