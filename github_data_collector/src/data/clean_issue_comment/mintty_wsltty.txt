Initially I would launch wsltty and quickly maximize the window eg with Win when it appeared but before my shell starts currently just measuring from when my bashrc starts executing at which point it would promptly exit binwslbridge Exit Quickly dragging the corner to resize the window doesnt seem to cause it to exit Once WSL has started up I can maximize or restore the window going forward without issues As far as I can tell its not a config issue as starting with an empty config file also triggers it though once I started faffing with the config it became trickier to reproduce consistently Now when it does successfully open without exiting the terminal size doesnt get updated so launching eg tmux or vim only uses the first cols rows as defined in my config as the default window size As before maximizing after WSL initialises works fine and subsequent resizes fix WSLs view of the terminal size going forward Could be another case of I replaced my bashrc with stty size on its own and it also confirms my default window size when I trigger an early maximize Adding minttys w max option to the launch command does successfully maximize the window and stty size then reports the correct size of Using v x though the wsltty build number disagrees unless its truncated mintty x pccygwin wsltty Launching with the WSL Terminal shortcut C Users User AppData Local wsltty bin minttyexe WSL configdirC Users User AppData Roaming wsltty details summaryConfig filesummary LocaleenGB CharsetUTF Columns Rows PgUpDnScrollno CursorTypeblock FontIosevka Term FontHeight BoldAsFontyes ForegroundColour BackgroundColour CursorColour Black Red BoldRed Green BoldGreen Yellow BoldYellow Blue BoldBlue Magenta BoldMagenta Cyan BoldCyan White BoldWhite AllowBlinkingyes Termxterm color Answerback BellType BellSoundyes Holderror Scrollbarnone Transparencylow OpaqueWhenFocusedyes FontSmoothingfull ClicksPlaceCursoryes ClickTargetModshift details I installed VoidMusl from into WSL After I installed it it I ran the configure WSL shortcuts script from the start menu This added entries for VoidMusl Terminal and VoidMusl Terminal to the start menu as expected I have since removed Void I cant find a way to remove its shortcuts I can only find a script for removing entries from the context menu but not the start menu configure WSL shortcuts merely creates new shortcuts for all of the currently installed distros and does not remove the invalidold entries In the start menu one can rightclick and select Uninstall but all that does is bring up Windows AddRemove Programs settings which doesnt help with wsltty shortcuts mc midnight commander under WSL ubuntu hangs permanently on with extreme cpu usage showing for wslbridge Works on This is true for both the i and x versions and confirmed on multiple systems windows pro You can test with r x You should be able to write in commands then but nothing happens It works fine with I use mintty with cygwin and was just trying out WSL default terminal is rubbish when I found this Changing the user name would be possible but Id prefer to avoid it if it can be easily fixed Im guessing this is just a variable that hasnt been quoted properly If I get a chance later Ill have a look through the scripts myself Note I get similar problems when trying to install with chocolaty and from the releases here Thanks Error reporting in windows of ARM After wsltty installi exe is installed the system reports this error and cannot run it Would it be possible to publish builds for ARM Even a bit build would be convenient for those of us running the new Windows on ARM laptops The software is amazing for me on my x laptops and I would definitely appreciate the ability to run it on these newer platforms Hi this is more of a question currently when I start tmux in my default WSL console I cant have a scroll bar Does wsltty solve this issue I mean if I type tmux from wsltty console will I be able to scroll with a mouse If not is this something that can be added as a feature Thanks I recently downgraded from to and thus downgrade from wsl to wsl Wsltty does no longer work i have uninstalled deleted all local files etc and reinstalled multiple times and still cant get it to work How can i solve this issue I have my home directory symlinked to a location outside the WSL filesystem This worked fine until wsltty started using wslbridge now the symlink is apparently resolved and thus I end up in the symlink destination instead of when starting wsltty Moreover set PATH so it includes users private bin if it exists if d HOMEbin then PATHHOMEbinPATH fi in profile acts as if HOMEbin does not exist even though it does This also worked correctly before wslbridge I am using
