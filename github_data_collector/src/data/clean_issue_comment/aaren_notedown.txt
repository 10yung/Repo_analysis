I forked Notedown to knitty And theres neither entry points nor module names conflicts Fixed docs accordingly Ubuntu Python notedown Python I have this ipymd notebook with a simple oneline long header This is an example of a long header with many many words This really is an example of a long header with many many words notedown incorrectly produces the following Markdown This is an example of a long header with many many words This really is an example of a long header with many many words I see two problems Big problem there should be not line break after This really The say HTML rendered output should not show This is an example but This is an example like in the notebook right I could not find where in the code the header is broken More generally the Markdown from Markdown cells should probably be left untouched too no From your Readmemd markdown Editing in the browser new You can configure IPython Jupyter to seamlessly use markdown as its storage format Add the following to your config file cNotebookAppcontentsmanagerclass notedownNotedownContentsManager Now you can edit your markdown files in the browser execute code create plots all stored in markdown For Jupyter your config file is jupyternotebookconfigpy in jupyter For Jupyter lab bash jupyterlab generateconfig The method you provided works nicely with jupyter notebook but is not working like that for Jupyter lab Could you please extend the support to Jupyterlab Switched travis CI to Ubuntu Trusty and more recent version of R This should allow pull request to pass CI When exporting from Notebook to MD the lines are wrapped to characters When the Notebook contains tables with rows longer than characters the lines are wrapped but this causes issues with how the table is rendered Github for example Most rendering assumes the wrapped line is a new row in the table and the table is not rendered correctly Could a command line argument be added to allow setting the line wrap On or off or width Correct formatting without line wrap H H This is an example Of what happens with line wrap H H This is an example Of what happens with line wrap Incorrect formatting with line wrap H H This is an example Of what happens with line wrap H H This is an example Of what happens with line wrap Ive seen that you offer support of Rmd notebooks in Jupyter by modifying the jupyter config file That is very nice already Dont you think it would be nice to have official support by Jupyter for these notebooks In this direction I have opened Regards The LICENSE is currently not included in the source tarball When I tried to convert a jupyter notebook which contained Chinese characters UnicodeEncoderError occurs like this I have tried to install notedown using the two methods provided in README precompiled
