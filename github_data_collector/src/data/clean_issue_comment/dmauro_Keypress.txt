Hello I couldnt find the key codes for playpause next and previous so I merged keycodedictionary with the keys found on I dont know if thats something you would want to do in the library but thats how I use it so I figured I would leave a note here Modified with key codes from keycodedictionary That key has no keycode break backspace delete tab clear enter shift ctrl alt pausebreak caps lock hangul hanja escape conversion nonconversion spacebar page up page down end home left arrow up arrow right arrow down arrow select print execute Print Screen insert delete help semicolon firefox equals equals firefox firefox a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z Windows Key Left Chromebook Search key right window key Windows Menu Right sleep numpad numpad numpad numpad numpad numpad numpad numpad numpad numpad multiply add numpad period firefox subtract decimal point divide f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f f num lock scroll lock arabic semicolon page backward page forward refresh closing paren AZERTY key home key minus firefox muteunmute decrease volume level increase volume level next previous stop playpause email muteunmute firefox decrease volume level firefox increase volume level firefox semicolon equal sign comma dash period forward slash grave accent or numpad period chrome open bracket back slash close bracket single quote left or right key firefox altgr git left back slash GNOME Compose Key XF Forward XF Back nonconversion alphanumeric hiraganakatakana halfwidthfullwidth kanji unlock trackpad ChromeEdge toggle touchpad Technically not an issue with Keypressjs but nonetheless makes it harder to use EasyPrivacy which is a very common adblockingcontentblocking list contains a filter that blocks any script named Keypressjs keypressjsscript You can of course evade this by renaming the script to something else but it might be worth reaching out to them to see if they are deliberately blocking your script which would be strange since its just a library and doesnt do anything malicious on its own and if they could remove or tweak that filter This is just one example Im having the issue with a number of keys like other numbers and K I am NOT using the number keypad I am using preventrepeat isunordered isexclusive issolitary and the onkeydown function isexclusive is strange for instance on CTRL if I use preventdefault I get nothing If I dont use preventdefault it changes to the first tab the default use of CTRL The debugger shows that they are registered Hi I just discovered this is available now Any chance it could be integrated into the API That would be amazing I will try and get it directly from the event and see what happens but itd be awesome if it were directly integrated Is it possible to increase the delay time of a combination I have longer combinations on my web app like a r c g or a r c g k and they take a bit time to think press I am using below code to listen on meta m key event but it doesnt work if there is a bootstrap modal on the page listenersimplecombometa m e consoleloghello estopDefault When I load the Keypress script in my own site or even on it does not work at all Browser Firefox Quantum bit OS Ubuntu Error messages TypeError windowkeypress is undefined in mainjs Trace anonymous anonymous Testcase What I did keydown shift first then keydown s What happened You pressed shift and s together was logged twice What is expected That the message be logged just once Additional info The reverse is not true keydown s then keydown shift message logged just once With simplecombor I cant refresh the browser with ctrl r Actually the event fires regardless of any modifier keys and blocks the browser refresh Replace shell scripts closure compiler with webpackuglifyjs npm run prepublish Run jasmine tests with karma npm test Fix packagejson to point main to minified library as UMD ie should be usable in browser and CommonJS context Published to npm eg usable with script src
