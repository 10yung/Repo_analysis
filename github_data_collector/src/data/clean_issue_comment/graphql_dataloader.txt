 What problem are you trying to solve DataLoader must be constructed with function which accepts Arraykey and returns PromiseArrayvalue but the function did not return a Promise of an Array of the same length as the Array of keys Describe the solution youd like In practice using a NoSql database like mongodb some referenced document missing is not a serious problem but this length check make things terrible for example user id ObjectIduser user id ObjectIduser user has been deleted but associated data has not been cleaned yet post id ObjectIdpost author ObjectIduser here reference user is not exist now post id ObjectIdpost author ObjectIduser post id ObjectIdpost author ObjectIduser now if I make a dataloader for Users the array length obviously not equal const usersLoader new DataLoader keys async keys Users return await Usersfindid in keystoArray cacheKeyFn key keytoString Describe alternatives youve considered My questions are Is this length check necessary or is a little bit over coupled feature whats the correct pattern to deal with document missing with dataloader I have the following query graphql userid id username commentslast How can I handle pagination here id body author username replieslast How can I handle pagination here id body How can I handle pagination in those cases Should I use DataLoader Until now everything that I found on the web suggests using the splice array method but if I use it my server will run out of memory as I should paginate the data on the SQL query am I right So how I am able to query my database with such GraphQL query Do you handle those cases in any of your projects I am really struggling with that It is even possible to use DataLoader in this case And if I not use it I my server will suffer a lot with the N problem Hi is it possible chain two dataloaders I have one resolver where I need using two dataloaders is it possible I cant use SQL join because its slow async row dataSources const partialData await dataloader dataSourcesloadrowid if partialData null return null return await dataloader dataSourcesloadpartialDataid Why not providing a mongomongoose code example in the examples folder as this seens to be a very common usage scenario
