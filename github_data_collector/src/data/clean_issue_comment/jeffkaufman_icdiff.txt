The test checkgitdiff gitdiffonlynewlinestxt e e assumes that its run in the icdiff git repository which is not always the case It assumes a repository to already exist sets configuration options and refers to certain commits Im maintaining icdiff for Alpine Linux where the project is part of the aports repository and we build from source archives In those circumstances the current git repo is aports not icdiff which it then also modifies git config The tests obviously fails It would be better to create a small repository with known contents and run the tests in there similar how git tests itself Another issue is that it runs git difftool extcmd icdiff before exporting pwd to PATH causing the command to fail Handling errors there makes sure that actions influencing error reporting apply for both direct calls of the icdiff script as well as via entrypoints Addresses my comment on It keeps reinstalling It might be nice to use if available to display image diffs diff provides i option to ignore caseonly differences It would be great to have that option in icdiff as well diff color auto tool icdiff difftool icdiff cmd usrlocalbinicdiff r IF pbgopbdocpbswaggerpbcpplock striptrailingcr linenumbers LOCAL REMOTE As a user of the program I would like to run the program with a flag that displays all supported encodings such that I can choose the right one easier Colors can be now specified via environment variable ICDIFFCOLORS using the same format as in command line Hi I wanted to have a man page for icdiff so I created one by manually converting the usage message and other info from the README Ive decided to share this with you so that you maybe could include it in the project Unfortunately I couldnt yet find a proper way to get setuptools to automatically add the file to the machines manpath The file can be rendered by running man icdiff after cloning the repository locally icdiff is great But do we have any plans to expose the APIs like difflib
