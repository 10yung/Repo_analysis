Byron This tool is awesome Thanks for your brillient work Currently we have to install the entire set of rust SDK to compile and install it This is a bit cumbersome for nonrust users This also prevents us from using it on some server environment So would you consider adding support for binary releases Output in interactive mode gets corrupted when scanning a big directory TiB of data Like the first entry should be cbravo A lot of entries are corrupted by a dir called bvds probably because the with of the first columns changed so it didnt overwrite characters that where there somedirwithlotsoffilesanddirs items T dwm x ravo T bvcbravo T dsvpotier TB bvdsvet re GB cfbvds GB cflerin GB dkoldere GB dmauduit KB DSStore KB DSStore Total disk usage Entries scanning Hello At work the IS team creates a snapshot directory in each users home That snapshot directory is a symlink to a remote disk and does not consume my disk space but its huge as it has hourly daily monthly etc backups created automatically It would be nice to have a exclude flag like ncdu Thanks for this project Please add license files Maybe they are exist but i cant find a repo points me there Awesome application Would be nice to have redraw on terminal resize not sure how difficult that would be with termion I think it would be nice to have the usage bar from interactive mode support the different eighths sections instead of just full or empty I already have a hacky version that adds this functionality I would be really cool to get information on file and directory counts Im not sure if anyone else wants this feature but Id certainly like to develop it Symlinks that point to another disk are still counted for current one resulting in total disk usage bigger than the disk capacity One could probably implement something like it using termions asyncio Something we would have to do as well is to have a stateful window during traversal thus it wont come so very easily Just ran dua After a while it printed TB IO Errors my local disk is not that large By uh several orders of magnitude Going to and running dua B lostfound B mnt B root B srv KB dev KB scripts KB run MB tmp MB etc MB boot MB sys GB bin GB sbin GB lib GB lib GB opt GB usr GB home IO Errors GB var TB proc IO Errors TB total IO Errors Seems like proc is reporting very weird sizes By the way the different between dua and cd dua was surprising even though correct as per the help message
