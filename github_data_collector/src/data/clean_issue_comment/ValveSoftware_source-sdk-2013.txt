The connections seem to close off after GB I try to download QT from here If its not possible to submit the whole package would you submit a patch to qt In the SDK line clearly states Only do these effects if were not submerged Followed by the line if UTILPointContents GetAbsOrigin CONTENTSWATER which checks if the entity is in water instead of out I dont think I need to say how to fix it Hi Based on what I have read it looks like macOS Catalina slated for release in the next few months will drop support for bit applications I believe this impacts this SDK which will mean that my game Estranged Act I and others will cease to run natively on macOS after the user upgrades their OS A few questions Is that assessment correct I only see bit dependencies in this repository for macOS Will this impact HalfLife Episode Episode Team Fortress and Portal If it does and Valve plans to fix those titles will that work be upstreamed into this SDK Edit since this is confirmed to be affecting older Valve first party titles a few questions based on that Will this be addressed for older Valve first party titles If it will be will that work be merged into this SDK Are there any plans to merge the Vulkan support as described below to this SDK Thanks Alan When Im trying launch game with tools nop parameter I got engine error I tried making vscripts for map and saw that theres problem with envfade entity You cant do fade in for one player fade if stayout flag is enabled mpsrcgameserverEnvFadecpp and spsrcgameserverEnvFadecpp have the same bug Current Code void CEnvFadeInputFade inputdatat inputdata int fadeFlags if mspawnflags SFFADEIN fadeFlags FFADEIN else fadeFlags FFADEOUT if mspawnflags SFFADEMODULATE fadeFlags FFADEMODULATE if mspawnflags SFFADESTAYOUT fadeFlags FFADESTAYOUT if mspawnflags SFFADEONLYONE if inputdatapActivator inputdatapActivatorIsNetClient Line below is missing important flag FFADEPURGE UTILScreenFade inputdatapActivator mclrRender Duration HoldTime fadeFlags else UTILScreenFadeAll mclrRender Duration HoldTime fadeFlagsFFADEPURGE mOnBeginFadeFireOutput inputdatapActivator this Working Code void CEnvFadeInputFade inputdatat inputdata int fadeFlags if mspawnflags SFFADEIN fadeFlags FFADEIN else fadeFlags FFADEOUT if mspawnflags SFFADEMODULATE fadeFlags FFADEMODULATE if mspawnflags SFFADESTAYOUT fadeFlags FFADESTAYOUT if mspawnflags SFFADEONLYONE if inputdatapActivator inputdatapActivatorIsNetClient Contains FFADEPURGE which allows you to do fade in if youve done fade out with stayout flag enabled UTILScreenFade inputdatapActivator mclrRender Duration HoldTime fadeFlags FFADEPURGE else UTILScreenFadeAll mclrRender Duration HoldTime fadeFlags FFADEPURGE mOnBeginFadeFireOutput inputdatapActivator this Reference from fadein and fadeout command functions Fade Out UTILScreenFade pPlayer clrFade flTime FFADEOUT FFADEPURGE FFADESTAYOUT Fade In UTILScreenFade pPlayer clrFade flTime FFADEIN FFADEPURGE Hello Ive noticed that on LinuxMac old models can lead to rendering crashes namely the infamous Failed to lock vertex buffer in CMeshDX LockVertexBuffer Engine Error Im not exactly sure if its an error with the MDL format or the vtx files but I believe its a backwards compatibility issue thats just not handled on LinuxMac However there was this map that was ported from The Ship to SDK which was an old game and had models from like The map would repeatably crash with that engine error until I decided to decompilerecompile the models it used The crash went away Ive also noticed the models in the Source SDK base on Steam in the HL VPKs contain very old models as well as low as version MDLs which I believe is era I know SDK is probably a low priority but it would be great if all the models could be recompiled with the latest version of studiomdl for SDK What exactly is this file Its absolutely massive so big it wont fit on our mods GitHub repository KB Should I be worried about deleting it Ok so i know there are a million other posts regarding this issue but i have read literally all of them and have never got it working ONCE I tried different engine versions i tried building cubemaps in gmod nothing has worked so far pls help When can we expect modules like the GameUI studiomdl ServerBrowser HLMV etc to be available for the public Anything but the engine itself Many mod authors would benefit from these modules rather than applying terrible hacks I know people have had this issue before but I cant get it fixed using their suggestions I have the prepost build events off the path is DataDbcspsrc so there are no spaces or signs It just appeared one day and now I can never compile my dlls Here are some screenshots Screenshot Screenshot
