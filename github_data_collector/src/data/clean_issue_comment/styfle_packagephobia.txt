There have been a few requests to increase the amount of data the Package Phobia is tracking add file count and directory count add publish date show badge on every cnpm package Google Analytics shows the current monthly unique users is about but I suspect this actually much higher considering ad blockers will prevent GA from collecting stats and many developers use ad blockers ZEIT currently sponsors the compute but I pay for the database out of pocket about year The next tier up with redislabs would be about year I would be willing to switch to a different database if a DBaaS wanted to sponsor this project Otherwise I will probably apply for the GitHub Sponsors program Put a if you would be willing to donate to this project so I can see if this upgrade is feasible img width altZrzut ekranu o src Details tag could be replaced by component with position absolute and showhide toggle button img width altZrzut ekranu o src Labels could appear cropped eg with textoverflow ellipsis and the full name would appear when you hover over the chart It seems that currently the results page title description and all tags are the same as the index page It would help if title and description included the scanned packages info This should allow us to make further optimizations autoprefixer minification etc Also we could try moving the results CSS to a separate file so that its cached and keep the index page CSS inlined Just thinking out loud BTW Another gain will be that well have one place to handle the CSS minus the bars heightwidth and any other inline styles that cannot be moved of course Proposed look How to switch I suggest two new subdomains npmpackagephobianowsh for the NPM registry githubpackagephobianowsh for the GitHub registry packagephobianowsh would work the same as npmpackagephobianowsh Another solution The node foundation is setting up a package maintenance team and we would like to have a point of contact with the package phobia team The node package maintenance team has been tasked with writing the set of rules via which a verified team can step into and assist critical node packages if maintainers request help We are thinking of incorporating the package phobia data into our procedures and would like a point of contact to talk further about it scripts perinstall in packagesjson could define a command to execute before installing It will cause a RCE Today I noticed some slowness and some intermittent connection issues I thought maybe zeit was down but it turns out the server load has increased quite a bit A lot of that is coming from Chinese mirrors npmtaobaoorg cnpmjsorg But these packages dont look real strange logs So should I attempt to block these based on referrer or maybe add an API key so I know where traffic is coming from hey styfle would be cool to also show number of files directories created during npm i this number is often in the k range which is nuts some filesystems are notoriously slow to create huge filesystem trees as well as deleting them ehm Windows
