When adding fragments in which the other sequence has a sticky end at its end the features in other are shifted in the wrong direction since the ovhg is positive not negative This pull request fixes this issue in dseqrecordadd and in dseqrecordlooped I will try to create an example assembly workflow to demonstrate the problem and how it is fixed if you would like EDIT It seems I managed to include a typo in my commit message and are sorry about this Dear sir Good day to you First I need to appreciate you for your pydna module really it is very useful module for every body study molecular biology but I have fin critical issue when i run Gel class from pydnagel on the pycharm editor not give any result figure of gel electrophoresis and also the same issue with original python IDLE however when i run it with Wing IDE make a conflict with Tkinter module Best regards Yours sincerely Mohamed Abdelmoez Ahmed Soliman Bioinformatics Researcher Hi Bjorn Having a lot of success with PyDNA so thank you I was wondering if you would please consider implementing a reverse function at least I couldnt find one in the docs to be clear I do NOT mean a reversecomplement This has come up in an example where I want to switch the direction of a cassette in order to limit cross talk between promoters on the same plasmid I have tried creating work arounds for this by doing a reversecomplement and then by switching the watson and crick strands but it doesnt work for some reason Note I am seeking a way to do this that PRESERVES FEATURES otherwise it is not valuable Also I was wondering if you knew that the fillin function only fills in on producing strands Maybe this was done on purpose but Im not sure why Is there anyway to display the figures you have below the code in the pictures below or did you just draw this out by hand Some of my assemblies are being weirdI am trying to learn the package and it would be useful for troubleshooting and general purpose if the ascii figures were built in attributes for both commonsubstrings and terminaloverlap I tried to plasmidsequpper but it seems to have broken the class later on when attempting an assembly that was previously working I then received the error Seq object has not attribute circular In general is this the acceptable way to edit the seq Another case I had was like Which seemed to work fine unless it is what caused my error Thanks for your help Bjorn Hi I think there is bug in the cut function when the restriction site is on the ori When I run the following code plasmidpath testgb test pydnaparsersparse plasmidpath dsTrue testcutBsaI I get IndexError Traceback most recent call last ipythoninput aadbfecceed in module loggerwarningNo features found in s this make selection based on reporigin impossible inputseq cutseq inputseqcutcutter usrlocallibpython distpackagespydnadseqrecordpy in cutself enzymes enzymes enzymes frags selfseqcutenzymes if not frags usrlocallibpython distpackagespydnadseqpy in cutself enzymes swl lenselfwatson frags frags newfrags fragspop while sumlenfwatson for f in newfrags swl newfragsappendfragspop IndexError pop from empty list The attached file is a genbank If I move the origin of the genbank file there are no problems Hi there Thank you for making pydna Ive had fun using it to automate some cloning reactions It seems like pydna is something that really should exist in Biopython proper Have you talked to those developers to see if they would be interested in including it All the best Tim Jupyter Notebooks and reproducible data science add a list of primers to the primer list by adding a function to myprimerspy read primers from string or file read old primer list number primers from end of list add number to primer name id locus like ScCYC termEcoRIfw for primer
