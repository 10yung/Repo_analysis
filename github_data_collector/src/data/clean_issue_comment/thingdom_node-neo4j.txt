 Are planning to bring any support asyncawait syntax Saying this neo j queries are not concurrent but is there any alternate solution to that ctxbody gets to be populated by data Ex javascript const showAll async functionctx next await dbcypherquery err results ctxbody results This example probably does not make much sense but his does javascript const showAll async functionctx next const results await dbcypherquery ctxbody results EDIT has an alternative for this wrapping dbcypher with Promisepromisify But still an upgrade needed Resolves conflicts with default JS Error class fixes Hi when I query using attribute filter itll work fine For example const query MATCH userUser email email RETURN user join n const params email userexamplecom assume email exists But when I passed inside WHERE statement it doesnt seem to work const query MATCH userUser WHERE email email RETURN user join n const params email userexamplecom assume email exists I needed this because I need to create query to find node by id At the moment my workaround is to concat directly to the query which is not recommended const query MATCH userUser WHERE iduser id RETURN user join n Just wondering is this behavior expected Because I read the documentation this should be supported Refer Hi I have been working with the REST API client interface for Neo J i am getting issue while fetching or inserting data to the neo j through REST API client interface it causes problem in nodemodulesneo jgraphdatabasejs line for i i len resultslength i len i i It causes error as cannot read property length of undefined Do u have any idea I get this error after upgrading the Nodejs version from v to v TypeError ErrorcaptureStackTrace is not a function at ClientErrorError as constructor UserskdeWorkspaceicservicenodemodulesneo jlibnewerrorscoffee at new ClientError UserskdeWorkspaceicservicenodemodulesneo jlibnewerrorsjs at FunctiondirnameErrorErrorfromObject UserskdeWorkspaceicservicenodemodulesneo jlibnewerrorscoffee at UserskdeWorkspaceicservicenodemodulesneo jlibnewGraphDatabasecoffee at Requestcallback UserskdeWorkspaceicservicenodemodulesneo jlibnewGraphDatabasecoffee at Requestselfcallback UserskdeWorkspaceicservicenodemodulesrequestrequestjs at emitTwo eventsjs at Requestemit eventsjs at Requestanonymous UserskdeWorkspaceicservicenodemodulesrequestrequestjs at emitOne eventsjs at Requestemit eventsjs at IncomingMessageanonymous UserskdeWorkspaceicservicenodemodulesrequestrequestjs at IncomingMessageg eventsjs at emitNone eventsjs at IncomingMessageemit eventsjs at endReadableNT streamreadablejs It might be the V issue bumped up version in Nodejs to v thisError functionsuper extendsError super function Errormessage neo j thismessage message null message Unknown error thisneo j neo j null neo j thisname neo j thisconstructorname ErrorcaptureStackTracethis thisconstructor I guess we should call the global one globalErrorcaptureStackTracethis thisconstructor Here Ive upgraded the dependencies and fix things broken in Neo j x I tried a sample code piece executing in the same file as my mochachai calls but placed before the describeit sequences in mocha That returned a consolelog that places as the first line in the callback But the pieces that were nested within mocha commands would not show the consolelog statements from the callback I am using node and Neo j sample code is below mostly lifted straight off example page thanks dbcypher query MATCH uUser email email RETURN u params email aliceexamplecom err results consolelog the only loginfo my thought if err throw err var result results if result consolelogNo user found else var user result u consolelogJSONstringifyuser null this patch enhances the library by allowing use of the graph format the REST API support passed in via the resultDataContents field please note I ve added a test but am not clever enough to make it pass
