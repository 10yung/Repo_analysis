 Hi Does msgpackc use structure Is any chance that msgpack pack data could cause alignment issues I am running msgpackc on iMX Linux platform I have several messages using different data type uint t uint t etc when I process those messages it caused following kernel error I was not clear what could cause the alignment problems as I dont use any structure in my application Nov kernel Alignment trap not handling instruction e f at b c b Nov kernel Unhandled fault alignment exception x at x Nov kernel pgd bdb e Nov kernel pgd Thank you Im using cjson C library for json creation and processing can I use mspack on cjson We have been experiencing Segfaults when running fluentbit which looks to be ocurring in the msgpackc code Sep ip uswest computeinternal docker engine caught signal SIGSEGV x b d b in msgpackpackobject at libmsgpack srcobjectcc x b f in splunkformat at pluginsoutsplunksplunkc x b f in cbsplunkflush at pluginsoutsplunksplunkc x b dcda in outputprecbflush at includefluentbitflboutputh x b in coinit at libmonkeydepsflblibcoamd c x f cf in at The issue appears to be trying to dereference msgpackobjectkv which is nil case MSGPACKOBJECTMAP int ret msgpackpackmappk dviamapsize ifret return ret else msgpackobjectkv kv dviamapptr msgpackobjectkv const kvend dviamapptr dviamapsize for kv kvend kv ret msgpackpackobjectpk kvkey ifret return ret ret msgpackpackobjectpk kvval ifret return ret return Rather than segfaulting if we add a check for nil pointer we can return an error instead hi redboltz i want use c language to package some data by msgpackc when i read samplecc this file i dont understand some apibecause i can not find intruduce for this apijust like this picture could you tell me some information about this apihow to use it and what parameter means ks Hi is there a version of msgpack which only uses stack and no heap We need it for a embedded medical device where heap allocation is prohibited Thanks CW Dear developer Is there a way to retrieve the fields of the unpacked object one by one as this done for packing I know the type of the packed object so after unpacking id like simply to do something like int err int x msgpackunpackintpk err Currently I must explore the self describing msgpack object for type entry and value much like I parse a JSON file Another question if I send a series of packed objects through the network is the library able to retrieve the packed objects one by one is it able to detect packed object boundaries Thanks When CMAKEINSTALLPREFIX is relative such as install headers get installed to buildinstallinstallinclude I believe the correct fix is the removing CMAKEINSTALLPREFIX since cmake should already be handling that implicitly FOREACH file msgpackcHEADERS GETFILENAMECOMPONENT dir file PATH remove INSTALL FILES file DESTINATION CMAKEINSTALLPREFIXdir add INSTALL FILES file DESTINATION dir ENDFOREACH
