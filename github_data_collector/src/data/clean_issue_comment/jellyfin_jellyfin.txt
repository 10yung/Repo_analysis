messages and PRs please review and our documentation For some reason paths not mapped on that endpoint but it will be nice to have for enabling native paths in jellyfinmpvshim Changes Describe your changes here in sentences Issues Tag any issues that this PR solves here ex Fixes Doover of click for old discussion Changes For now it adds a project with an Entity Framework Visual Editor based entity model Note this only contains some of the media types and some of the fields those are easy to add later My main philosophy for this is to keep the database structure as restrictive as possible as this forces good datahygiene as it were So no JSON blobs no generic tables that are keyvalue stores if we want that we should use Redis or something etc Images History details summaryOld Revisionssummary b a diagram f diagram e d diagram b cd diagram c diagram details e diagram TODO LIST Add user related permissions and preference from existing database schema so far only xml based ones have been added Add user linked tracking of watch status and resume points for media in a media agnostic way aka allow for resuming audiobooks and comics as well as movies and tv shows Implement storage of system wide settings Avoid node specific settings like bound IP ports hw accel etc while migrating settings like default UI culture metadata language etc Implement storage of multiple languages for metadata including images This would allow admins to define server wide fetch languages allowing for better internationalization support The admin could say they want languages and then users can decide which order they want these languages to be when displaying metadata Implement user definable fallback that can have multiple steps for UI and metadata language Currently US English is the only fallback if you chose a language other than it Ideally users should be able to fall back through a list of languages of their choosing with US English being the final fallback as it is now Implement a generic grouping and collections system that will allow users and admins to group media in arbitrary ways As an example you could group Futurama into parts premovies movies and post movies then group these together such that if you watch the last episode of premovies up next appears shows the first movie But Ordering must not be required Maybe a user just wants to group the ScoobyDoo movies into one folder This should effectively take over the role of playlists since it serves the same purpose but is more flexible Describe the bug Jellyfin newest version play back at chrome v
