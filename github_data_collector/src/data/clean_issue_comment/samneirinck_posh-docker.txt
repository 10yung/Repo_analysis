Every time I open a powershell window I get this error ImportModule The specified module poshdocker was not loaded because no valid module file was found in any module directory Any thoughts on how to make it go away Hey samneirinck I know a lot of docker users that would love this updated to current CLI commands and subcommands options etc Maybe we Docker Captains can help spread the word and get you some help with fixes and new features but I have two questions first Are you still willing to lead this repo by accepting PRs commenting on issues etc It would be great if we could use the same PowerShell Module name and repo Can you describe a list of issues or needed features to get it working with old and new command format and options CC StefanScherer Apparently there is a conflict between these two modules After installing TabExpansionPlusPlus poshdocker stopped working Removing ImportModule TabExpansionPlusPlus directive from PowerShell profile fixes the issue Order of import of TabExpansionPlusPlus and poshdocker doesnt affect the problem Great extension and I love it The README outlines that options would be tab completable but Im not able to get it to work Docker commands like start stop etc auto complets like a charm but Im not able to get the respective options to auto complete eg When I type docker start att and press tab key I should see docker start attach but it isnt Im running powershell on Windows but Ive also tested this on Windows Server and also no love Hi samneirinck It would very convenient if ConvertFromDocker were in a separate module I am authoring a module DockerHelpers where I would like to take a dependency on poshdocker but cant as explained below DockerHelpers module uses ConvertFromDocker for some of its implementation But DockerHelpers should not add tab completion to the powershell console So currently Im copying ConvertFromDocker into DockerHelpers module not ideal for a number of reasons Alternatively Id be very happy for ConvertFromDocker to be contributed to DockerHelpers Obviously that would mean poshdocker taking an external dependency However powershell InstallImport commands would make that transparent to the consumer of poshdocker If you were willing to contribute then Id make you a contributor to DockerHelpers so that you can modify the sources Thanks Christian This really sucks for Using where object against Support for the dockercompose command would be great Add tests to check if new functionality doesnt break older docker versions The Docker client now has a new structure with sub commands For example docker container help docker container run docker image help docker image ls How can poshdocker be enhanced to support tab completion for these sub commands as well
