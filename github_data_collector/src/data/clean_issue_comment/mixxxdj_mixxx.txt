A successor of trying to fix the uncommon and possibly broken unsound SkinContext design If linked against QT the fader handles can become invisible depending on the position of the handle Fixes lp Copying parts of my comments from launchpadnet There was a svg viewport fix in worth investigating Another aspect of the bug is that stretching images inside mixxx do not work as they used to be As seen in OP s video The crossfader slider stretch is off compared with QT Also at least on macOS there are major performance issues with this specific QT version On my machine mixxx is at CPU even while idle just trying to render images It appears there have been some changes to the graphics stack As said apparently there is an issue with mixxx internal STRETCH image function The crossfader slider graphic slidercrossfadersvg does not stretch expand correct to the sliders widget size but the slidercrossfaderAutoDJsvg active when using AUTODJ and defined in styleqss does Post img width altScreenshot at src Pre img width altScreenshot at src This fixes eslint warnings for Mixxx JS files that are not controller mappings and the Roland DJ mapping Im aware that the coding guidelines state Do not send us patches that are purely cosmetic with respect to source changes this is a waste of time since it does not benefit users directly However this also fixes an undeclared variable in midicomponents Id consider this a bug and I hope this is okay this time Mapping files for Hercules DJControl Inpulse Changes to v Code cleanup Changes to v Fix seektostart and cuemaster behavior Tweak scratch seek and bend behavior User settigns Controller knobslider values are queried on startup so MIXXX is synced Fixed vinyl button behavior the first time its pressed v Original forum release This adds a custom eslintjson thats better suited for linting controller scripts It will automatically be picked up by Codefactorio and follow our JS coding conventions more closely than the default config You can also use it locally ie bash Lint single file eslint rescontrollersRolandDJ scriptsjs Lint all js files in the repository eslint The issue was that we have calculated the track duration via different functions This leads to different rounding issues making equal checks fail This fixes a high priority bug that is mandatory for the release In addition this also fixes an issue where AutoDJ stops on high system loads conditions This was my first assumption for the root cause of this bug This is a alternative solution for a KeyError in sources when configure is skipped The commit is only in master so we must be remove it when merging into master Fix two regressions The rateperm buttons in the UI stopped working because the rate slider connection ignores updates from the engine itself This is correct behavior because doing so would create infinite signal loops Second fixed the visual rate indicator showing up as before a track is played This adds an training mode This should enable you to train with your database and improve but do not add your training to the play count As the play count should be related to the count that I have played this song on eventsbroadcasts The design is done in a way that uses the Mixxxs Control System functionality to comunicate between the gui and the actual counter implementation This is my first contribution to mixxx So feel free to give me feedback Changes should be backwards compatible and original behavior is not changed when training mode is disabled Hi this mapping support portable MIDI controller joyMIDI Thanks Mixxx wiki joyMIDI page
