only had it partially working in the past and now that Ive ported my code to TypeScript its all not working now I really wish this was more of a drop in solution and included things like a default configuration that supports all angularjs constructs directives components services providers etc a default set of navigable templates to render the docs a simple configuration object with things like title etc consistent parsing across JavaScript and TypeScript a simpler customization experience In general nothing else I use in my whole dev ecosystem works like dgeni I find myself constantly digging through source code to try to figure out why things dont work links to things are deadhave bad paths etc I hope this doesnt come across too whiny but I really like having autogenerated docs but I always spend an inordinate amount of time just trying to get dgeni configured Hi Is there a simple example of Dgeni similar to that shows how youd use it with an Angular application using
