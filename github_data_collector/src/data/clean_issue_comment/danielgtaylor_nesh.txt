Doing some cursory Googling this still seems to be the best nice node repl around but the last code push was like and there are a bunch of outdated package warnings when using it warning nesh lodashnode This package is discontinued Use lodash warning nesh intdoc lodashnode This package is discontinued Use lodash warning nesh babelcore minimatch Please update to minimatch or higher to avoid a RegExp DoS issue I figure before I fall in love with it is there any chance of it actually being currently maintained Andor are there more active alternatives you would point me to instead Gitbash Windows TERM is xterm Changing to cygwin didnt fix it Cursor up does work correctly if Nesh is launched via powershell cat srcstoragejs export const sqrt Mathsqrt export function squarex return x x export function diagx y return sqrtsquarex squarey OK this is a pretty basic object Ill try to import it projectsStarsApp Magni jcollum nesh b Babel on Node v Type help for more information babel

features are much better than coffescript we could try to use this Its always reproducible on my machine I tried to reproduce it with other code but failed Currently the exact reproducible code is javascript function constructf let newObject Objectcreatefprototype newO The nesh will crash when you press tab key right after the newO Heres the screenshot Installed nesh using npm install g nesh

datadatacomtermuxfilesusrlibnodemodulesneshlibpluginsautoloadjs heart Ill probably write a PR for this since its just mostly scopyingsforking their code and can be completely optional via the promise togglability Hey Im using a rdparty plugin of sublime text named worksheet It can do inline evaluation code such as nodejsetc By given the following paramsit worksrunning on a js file located at D drive on Windows X worksheetlanguages JavaScript Babel cmd nesh b prompt babel ignore n However everytime I run this evaluationit will give me a warning that Error in plugin history Error ENOENT no such file or directory open D Users mzvast babelhistory If I copy the js file to C drive then everything is fine SoIt seem the nesh not getting the processenvHOME right ThenI set a symlink from C Users mzvastbabelhistory to D Users mzvastbabelhistoryeverything is fine again But this is hackingNot a solutionSo anyone encountered this issueHelp me figure it outthx I understand current implementation of history is by lines only same as in bash or python REPL but came from python world I usually use ipython which is a rd party pip package instead of the default python shell that provides additional features like history persistence and this nice feature multi lines editing in history if node doesnt want to improve its default REPL shell line editing experience I would wish this nice feature can be done by some rd party project like this Node Enhanced Shell or by a plugin console localbinipython Python default Oct Type copyright credits or license for more information
