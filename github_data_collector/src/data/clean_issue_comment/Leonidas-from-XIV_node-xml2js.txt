Can you please add the sample XML to the README in the XML Builder Usage section Add raw decorators support for builder Hi I cannot find any information on the question in the title I have a bunch of xmlfiles that I want transformed in a nodeexpressejs environment using the same xsltfile over and over again The files are all TEIfiles containing marked up text I thought about using ejs and create a div classcontainer filesforEachfunction files div Enter transformed xml file here div ol div I hope you can clear this up best wishes K Node Engine Hi I try to use a raw key but I get an error Error The root node has no parent Use doc if you need to get the document object at XMLElementmoduleexportsXMLNodeup nodemodulesxmlbuilderlibXMLNodejs Here is a code to reproduce const Builder requirexml js const obj data raw this is a raw string let result new BuilderbuildObjectobj Do you have any idea how I can use a raw string with xml js Apparently everything use txt Do you intend to support xmlbuilders decorators I have a control character in my XML and the builder seems to error on it The character is just a value in an attribute the XML is otherwise valid In my case it is this character which is ASCII character Enquiry Should the builder not remove these All control characters except LF and CR arent really wanted in text content Hey there The following code produce TypeError obj charkey match is not a function javascript xml js requirexml js var parser new xml jsParser parserparseStringBufferfrom c f eff f e c f f e c f f eff e f ead ce f e ce c ff fe ad f aad c f ead hextoString TypeError obj charkey match is not a function at SAXParseronclosetag nodemodulesxml jslibparserjs at emit nodemodulessaxlibsaxjs at emitNode nodemodulessaxlibsaxjs at closeTag nodemodulessaxlibsaxjs at SAXParserwrite nodemodulessaxlibsaxjs at ParserexportsParserParserparseString nodemodulesxml jslibparserjs at ParserparseString nodemodulesxml jslibparserjs It was found by jsfuzz Cheers Yevgeny I need to serialize only part of JSON object to XML The other attributes are metadata I need for processing I thought I could do that by hiding attributes in function but the function is also serialized to xml using toString I have doubts about usefulness of this behavior This is what Id like to achieve javascript const builder new xml jsBuilder rootName Something ignoreAttrs type const serializedObject attr attr type metadataType type function return metadataType Expected xml Something attr attr attr attr Something Actual xml Something attr attr attr attr typemetadataTypetype type function return metadataType type Something Alternatively processor functions for builder would be nice I have to manipulate an existing XMLFile which contains comments How can I do this without loosing the comments in the file Hi How do you add the namespace when creating the builder I have the following code that add the namespace but doesnt have a good output const xmlObj urlset xmlns urls const builder new xml jsBuilder return builderbuildObjectxmlObj It generates this weird thing at the bottom img width altsitemap xml src With the following code I dont get the namespace const builder new xml jsBuilder rootName urlset xmlns return builderbuildObjecturls img width altsitemap xml src Any way to fix this
