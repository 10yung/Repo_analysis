Trying to hook it into Travis for the last weekcant find any documentation on how to activate it how it points to Travis with credsno creds or URLs to your GitHub account and how to troubleshoot common problems It just doesnt seem to do anythingjust looks at memocking me Fix compatibility issue with mysql based on Big dump to resynchronize with averell version Since we made a number of modifications I dont see any way to break this down into neat little pull requests at least not within my available time Changelog includes secretsymlBackendSettings configuration replaced with betterplaces configuration gem Reasons in e d f b cfd e f d bbdf commit message New plugins for jenkinspingdom as status tables Update to ruby updated gems Some bug fixes It would be great if you could review and merge this so that we can continue to work on the same code base Is this dashboard IE compatible If yes and its not too much trouble for what version of IE is this dashboard compatible for Thank you Ok heres another one for you The previous implementation of the sensu data source would return an error if you specified a server filter but the event list didnt contain any events from that server master on line In this state you actually want a green result because it means there are no errors on that server I did some refactoring of the code as well Im not a Ruby programmer so I have a feeling there are some nonRubyific style in there Also I tried to test all of the cases and I think they all work eg withwithout server filter withwithout event filter etc Give this one a thorough review before accepting it If the user presses enter while naming a dashboard a br tag is added to the name that cannot be removed Many people press enter thinking it will commit the name change so this bug shows up very frequently Take a look at all the test dashboards on the hosted site for examples Hi Frederik I added a TeamCity CI provider It is unit tested as well as manually tested against TeamCity x If you want to verify it you can download TeamCity for free In order to use the TeamCity REST API without credentials you have to enable guest access You should configure the widget with the TeamCity host eg without trailing and the project id If you hover a project in TeamCity you see a link like In that example peeone is the project name that needs to be configured when setting up the widget I although updated ruby to I hope this is fine Further I added gem sqlite in order to skip installing mysql To clean things up I extended gitignore Regards Leif Thanks smile I want to use the number widget to get only the latest datapoint from a graphite target is there a way to accomplish this I dont mind modifying the code but I can go around it Basically I just want not to add any aggregate function and just get the real number of the latest datapoint It would be nice to have the option to lock a specific widget to its place or at least a whole dashboard so that things dont move around accidentally
