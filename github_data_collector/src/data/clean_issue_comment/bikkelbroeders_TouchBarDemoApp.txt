The TouchBarDemoApp seems to be broken on the new inch MacBook Pro When TouchBarDemoApp is running the Touch Bar goes completely blankblack and doesnt come back to life until TouchBarDemoApp is closed I assume because the inch MacBook Pro Touch Bar is a different width to the original some code needs to be modified to allow for this Any ideas bikkelbroeders Not sure if this project is dead or not if it isnt I could use some help everything looks as it should be with one exception the touch doesnt work on touch bar The onscreen keyboard works fine but the bar is not responsive to touch the content changes with the applications so its not frozen The iPad is Air and its connected to Imac on Catalina The Client does not show the TouchBar on launch If I go to the Home screen and reactivate the app it starts working I m running from the latest source code The problem is that on app launch startListening is called twice in a row ViewController viewDidAppear UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification notification The second call fails with TouchBarClient Failed to listen on localhost Error DomainNSPOSIXErrorDomain Code Address already in use Here s what my print debugging looks like when I start the Client ViewController viewDidAppear stopListening null startListening PTChannel x aeac closed listenOnPort callback PTChannel x aeac listening UIApplicationDidBecomeActiveNotification stopListening PTChannel x aeac listening startListening PTChannel x db closed listenOnPort callback PTChannel x db closed Failed to listen on localhost Error DomainNSPOSIXErrorDomain Code Address already in use Maybe a fix should be to check if is already listening and then skip unnecessary stoprestart If the App is executed on the iPad is throws an error TouchBarClient Assertion failure in CUIThemePixelRendition initWithCSIHeader BuildRootLibraryCachescomapplexbsSourcesCoreUICoreUI CoreThemeThemeStorageCUIThemeRenditionm TouchBarClient CUIThemeRendition initWithCSIDataforKeyartworkStatus got exception CUIThemePixelRendition initWithCSIHeader unknown pixel format TouchBarClient Assertion failure in CUIThemePixelRendition initWithCSIHeader BuildRootLibraryCachescomapplexbsSourcesCoreUICoreUI CoreThemeThemeStorageCUIThemeRenditionm TouchBarClient CUIThemeRendition initWithCSIDataforKeyartworkStatus got exception CUIThemePixelRendition initWithCSIHeader unknown pixel format TouchBarClient Assertion failure in CUIThemePixelRendition initWithCSIHeader BuildRootLibraryCachescomapplexbsSourcesCoreUICoreUI CoreThemeThemeStorageCUIThemeRenditionm TouchBarClient CUIThemeRendition initWithCSIDataforKeyartworkStatus got exception CUIThemePixelRendition initWithCSIHeader unknown pixel format TouchBarClient Assertion failure in CUIThemePixelRendition initWithCSIHeader BuildRootLibraryCachescomapplexbsSourcesCoreUICoreUI CoreThemeThemeStorageCUIThemeRenditionm TouchBarClient CUIThemeRendition initWithCSIDataforKeyartworkStatus got exception CUIThemePixelRendition initWithCSIHeader unknown pixel format TouchBarClient Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInvalidArgumentException reason NSPlaceholderDictionary initWithObjectsforKeyscount attempt to insert nil object from objects First throw call stack x c b x e x ba x ba c x ab x d b x x x b d x ba d x f bb x a x b d x a b x ac x aab x adb x c dff x c ed x c d b x b x b x c d x b x a x f libcabidylib terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException lldb The file is TouchBarTouchBarClientSupporting FilesmainmReturn value of UIApplicationMain PS TouchBar for Mac runs normal and displays the TouchBar on the screen if FNkey is pressed Suggestion Adaptive iPhone small screen Add touchpad mode I noticed the changelog says this issue is fixed in V but it turns out theres still an issue Ive tried changing the toggle key but its the same problem with all of them It sometimes works and it sometimes doesnt Two things Every key except the fn key works Unfortunately that is the key I need to use How do I get my function keys back The entire row is not accessible after uninstalling Thanks Is that mean D cannot be support Would it be possible to have the touchbar only work on the desktop so that it doesnt obstruct the display of fullscreen apps and videos It did this in an earlier version but I was wondering if it would be possible to add a toggle to enabledisable it in fullscreen and have it only function on the desktop like before
