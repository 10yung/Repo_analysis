 Because now I am working on a iOS project written in pure swift I like JLRoutes so I translate it to Swift all usage is the same as JLRoutes See issue If this repo ist still maintained feel free to merge The pattern matching breaks when I register a route with a trailing slash myappsearch It seems that the reason are the different implementations dealing with slashes Trailing and leading slashes are removed Only the trailing slash is removed Therefor the patterns dont match Can I pass objects directly when passing parameters inside the app If you pass as a pattern which has been working blissfully for years the route definition will blow up under xocde beta with a range out of bounds exception After updating from release to using Carthage my project has several JLRoutes related warnings img width altscreen shot at src Xcode Swift macOS Correct the comment
