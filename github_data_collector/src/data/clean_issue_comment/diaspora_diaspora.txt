I am using Diaspora mobile and it works fine Sometimes the loading time is about a second On Firefox I get a white screen which is not so nice in the morning grin My idea Could we implement a splashscreen on loading time bountysourceplugin Want to back this issue Post a bounty on it We accept bounties via Bountysource bountysourceplugin When you have only one registered aspect then people belonging to that aspect dont get shown with the name of the aspect but with the generic All Aspects I dont know if it was meant to be like this I just find it confusing bountysourceplugin Want to back this issue Post a bounty on it We accept bounties via Bountysource bountysourceplugin the username is not null is not needed since there is already in userrb which denotes that username will not be null Also in migrate file it denotes createdat will not be null As a result this query can be simplified to Userall to save the query time on the two paramater bountysourceplugin Want to back this issue Post a bounty on it We accept bounties via Bountysource bountysourceplugin Some users may deliberately want to pick a pod where inactive account closures are enabled some may want to pick pods where that is disabled We should expose that information somewhere for example on statistics NodeInfo or somewhere else bountysourceplugin Want to back this issue Post a bounty on it We accept bounties via Bountysource bountysourceplugin Fine uploader is not maintained anymore and we are still stuck with the problem that image resizing is not working on Firefox for Android since a PR of mine never was brought into a released version So I decided to look around for alternatives and found Uppy a powerful library and successor of FineUploader Since we are already using Pica for resizing its no problem to not have any resizing plugins in Uppy included I refactored major parts of the code to fully integrate uppy using a custom Resizer plugin with the following rules if the file is smaller then the allowed max size nothing is done and the file is uploaded as it is if the file is bigger then the allowed max size but the dimensions of the longest edge is smaller than px we just recompress it as JPEG without resizing its propably a huge png file if the file is bigger then the allowed max size and the dimentions of the longest edge is greater than px we resize it before uploading The whole logic stayed the same so its no difference for the user experience I also improved a few thing eg the input file buttons are now created on server side via HAML insteald of adding them by JavaScript afterwards Unfortunately Uppy is not available in railsassets so I had to add the whole package to the codebase As soon as is finished we could change this to use uppy from npm But if you have better solutions for this Im happy to see them This PR closes I have no experience with ruby programming or diaspora internals so this code needs a thorough review railsassetsorg has unfortunately a sad history of letting their SSLcerts and even the domain expire causing installation and upgrade issues for our users In May I made a significant donation towards setting up reliable SSL certification renewals and a monitoring on such after a downtime in but this was not very productive as they managed to have their domains DNS responses be NXDOMAINs for a while in July and just now the SSL certificate expired again The fact that whoever runs railsassetsorg these days fails to both keep the service running and accept help if they are unable to do so I feel like it is a fair conclusion to say we cannot and should not rely on this service Downtimes in their service cause our CI new installation and existing pods upgrades to fail and I have no reason to accept that As much as I liked the Rubygemsonly approach of assets management I think its time for us to move away from that and switch to the more standard approach of railswebpacker in combination with yarn bountysourceplugin Want to back this issue Post a bounty on it We accept bounties via Bountysource bountysourceplugin The weekly user stats tab of the admin panel shows users registered during a week and links to their profiles However the link is useless in case the user deleted their account Clicking on such a link just brings up an info message saying the account is deleted From a usability perspective is would be good to remove links to deleted users or display their usernames crossed over If this issue gets support Id volunteer to prepare a tentative PR bountysourceplugin Want to back this issue Post a bounty on it We accept bounties via Bountysource bountysourceplugin None
