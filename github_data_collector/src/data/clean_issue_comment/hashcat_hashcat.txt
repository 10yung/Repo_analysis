Current result for mode is macAPmacSTAESSIDpassword When I capture several handshakes WPA and recover them via hashcat they have all the same macAPmacSTAESSID and I cant know which WPA line has matched useful for me to play with capture tools and options Would it be possible to add to the output something to differentiate them For example the MIC or PMKID for WPA Thanks It would be nice if it was possible for hashcat to apply rules from the inline rule engine after passwords are generated with a rulefile to eliminate bad candidates For a more detailed example where this might be useful please see Could you implement a GPU CRYPTO hardnested attack for Mifare Classic NFC keys This tool does this but it works with CPU and its slow Kernel build fails with these details and this message Mesa Linux gcc Device buildoptions D KERNELSTATIC I OpenCL I usrsharehashcatOpenCL D LOCALMEMTYPE D VENDORID D CUDAARCH D HASADD D HASADDC D HASSUB D HASSUBC D HASVADD D HASVADDC D HASVADDCO D HASVADDCCO D HASVSUB D HASVSUBB D HASVSUBCO D HASVSUBBCO D HASVPERM D HASVADD D HASVBFE D HASBFE D HASLOP D HASMOV D HASPRMT D VECTSIZE D DEVICETYPE D DGSTR D DGSTR D DGSTR D DGSTR D DGSTELEM D KERNTYPE D ATTACKEXEC D ATTACKKERN D unroll Device buildoptionsmodule D KERNELSTATIC I OpenCL I usrsharehashcatOpenCL D LOCALMEMTYPE D VENDORID D CUDAARCH D HASADD D HASADDC D HASSUB D HASSUBC D HASVADD D HASVADDC D HASVADDCO D HASVADDCCO D HASVSUB D HASVSUBB D HASVSUBCO D HASVSUBBCO D HASVPERM D HASVADD D HASVBFE D HASBFE D HASLOP D HASMOV D HASPRMT D VECTSIZE D DEVICETYPE D DGSTR D DGSTR D DGSTR D DGSTR D DGSTELEM D KERNTYPE D ATTACKEXEC D ATTACKKERN D unroll Device Kernel m pure df dckernel not found in cache Building may take a while clBuildProgram CLBUILDPROGRAMFAILURE unknown in function gpudecompress void structpwidx addrspace i addrspace structpw addrspace i unsupported initializer for address space Device Kernel usrsharehashcatOpenCLm purecl build failed proceeding without this device It would be nice to know exactly when or how long from start a password was cracked for statistics purposes and oddly enough report outs people are very interested in how much better one password is than another I know that a simple timestamp doesnt correctly convey if one password is better than another but its something I have been asked for multiple times Curve is used in many POC cryptos such as BurstBHD to generate plotter id Could we have a batch generation feature to allow creating random curve privatekeypubkeys Would you guys be willing to add support for sha saltsha passsalt in the next update Hi I think BIP would be a great addition to hashcat The use case would be people who have old paper wallets in this format and who forgot their passwords SIP Digest Authentication hashmode works well for HTTP Digest Access Authentication however my passwords are Base encoded Therefore I would like a hash mode say which simply Base encodes the password including the padding before the MD usernamerealmpassword calculation This way I can use the standard password mask functions before the Base encoding and the passwords found will be unencoded Placeholder issue for adding the following algorithms TigerTiger functionally the same Tiger Tiger
