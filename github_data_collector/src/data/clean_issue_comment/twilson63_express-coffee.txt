mongodb has to be configured at travis in order for tests to pass though to lock down the dependencies like bash coffee debug servercoffee expresscoffee index page is run slower x than pure expressjs

what the problem is I was thinking of making some changes in the somewhat near future and replacing some somewhat core dependencies like connectassets assetrack assetrack is much easier to configure and write plugins for connectassets v looks cool but the development is slow and assetrack already offers the same options and then some bootrapstylus axiscss Axis is a Stylus library that is somewhere in between bootstrap and nib consolidatejs Express doesnt need consolidatejs to configure it but I figure if we have it in the code as a sample itll be easy to swap templates Thoughts
