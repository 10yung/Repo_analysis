 Could this repo get deleted Or could the repository description more prominently mention the archival nature of the repo Maybe add a link to the new repo githubcomtypesafehubscalalogging as well Its easy to miss that the bottom of the README says to go to the new repo Its acting as a honeypot for wellmeaning people like unoexperto and myself Guys could you please push version to MavenSonatype repo Current version is M Thanks Replacing the whole READMEmd by a redirect to version x is a bit confusing for everyone still using Scala Also it would be interesting to know whether there are other important differences between v and v x apart from the supported Scala version Please update READMEmd on Using ScalaLogging section to use version on Sonatype OSS release see and various concurrency improvements We had this issue in specs where Scalalogging was used with the Yrangepos compiler option I suspect that the macros in Scalalogging need a bit of position setting to make this disappear Unlike scala itself and akka which I am using the scalalogging jar file is missing OSGI export manifest headers which means I am unable to use it in OSGI environments similar to all log level error warn Loggerinfo scala def infomessage String params AnyRef Unit macro LoggerMacrosinfoMessageParams I think we must change params AnyRef to params Any And in LoggerMacrosinfoMessageParams params cExpr AnyRef to cExpr Any In LoggerMacroslogParams Change params Seq cExpr AnyRef to Seq cExpr Any Then check if we need to convert params to type Seq AnyRef before delegate to underlying using WILDCARDSTAR syntax See method akkaeventLoggingformat Why there is only AnyRef in API def debugmessage String params AnyRef Unit macro LoggerMacrosdebugMessageParams is there any way to log something like this val i val i loggerdebugi and i i i whitout using toString method on i and i
