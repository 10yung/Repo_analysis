 what s the meaning of the third to fifth rows the repo does not contain the training code with VggVox architecture In the paper the dimension of the final embedding is mentioned as and in the code the final computed embedding dimension is but in the provided code dimensional embedding is used for computing distance Hi I am curious about the proportion in the verification dataset How many the positive same speaker pair in the dataset compared to the negative different speaker pair Thanks Hi I want to compute Equal Error Rate as a measurement error but i couldnt find it in your code Could you tell me how to compute this measurement Hello I am curious as to which license enables you to use Youtube videos for creating a dataset Motivated by your work I am also interested in data from Youtube for research purpose Can you please guide me to the relevant tutorial or laws through I can read more on this subject The paper doesnt mention removal of DC component However you seem to be doing it during preprocessing in the code Is the removal of DC component necessary Hi From mfccspecm it seems that you compute the Fourier transform with Matlabs fft function of mslong windows and keep the entire spectrum which is Hermitian symmetric to compute the features that are then fed to the network Usually we only keep the Fourier coefficients corresponding to the positive frequencies as other coefficients are redundant due to Hermitian symmetry Can you confirm that it is indeed the procedure you follow Thanks a lot by advance for your answer Best Simon demovggvoxverif Downloading the VGGVox model for Verification this may take a while Warning Directory already exists In demovggvoxverif line Undefined function or variable dagnnContrastiveLoss Error in dagnnDagNNloadobj line block constr Error in demovggvoxverif line loadoptsmodelPath net dagnnDagNNloadobjnetStruct
