I get this error QNetworkReplyImplPrivateerror Internal problem this method must only be called once when setting middlewares like document thats like a bug when I use in scrapy python i set DUPEFILTERCLASS scrapysplashSplashAwareDupeFilter HTTPCACHESTORAGE scrapysplashSplashAwareFSCacheStorage in setting too sorry for bad English kmike I m extremely unsure about this change I have no idea of the side effects it may have I am trying to add test coverage to This change adds such coverage and ensures that cookietoharhartocookieharcookie harcookie works if no path is specified On the other hand setting as a default path comes from Requests where it s still used Their implementation does have a difference that we lost when we simplified our code they set path if the path parameter is not received but if pathNone is received that None value is used instead but I m not sure if that is relevant to our use case and it would not make cookietoharhartocookieharcookie harcookie work either I see that the standalone splash has support for chromium choosing the engine through the args supplied to splash How do I switch engines with scrapy splash Corrected a typo When I use responsefollow callback responseurl is not correct It makes force you to use SplashRequest and join url to follow link Since SplashRequest extends Request but the follow method become useless it make more code to follow link The request url is detail url but the responseurl in callback is not the same as the request url It seem url is not prefilled from request url Continuation of Related to although since it works at the spider level not at a wider project level I wouldn t say it fixes it I have experienced the following errors Website loads perfectly fine with Chrome Splash always throws this error Splash Loading screen never finishes despite high waiting time Splash Are there any plans to fix these issues Thanks Covers commits until I assumed instead of because there is a backwardcompatible API change
