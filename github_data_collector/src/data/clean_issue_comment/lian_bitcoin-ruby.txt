I am having difficulty generating a new transaction from the example because the data returned by either an api or decoding the transaction from my own node is insufficiently mapped to how the BitcoinPTxfromjson library expects the values to be Is there more documentation w regards to litecoin over bitcoin I made sure Bitcoinnetwork litecoin Ive also shimed the json to hopefully match the expected values of BitcoinPTxInOut but the hashes arent matching This is the litecoin transaction from my node txid a f f b c a ef bdfd b a d c e cd f bcaa c hash a b d f df f e f c b daa a a fe ef a fd version size vsize locktime vin txid bbcd c b b f aceb c db f b cfc c cd c dc c f vout scriptSig asm hex txinwitness d c b bfd d b d cba f d f df eaa e bf bcddf cb f e d c d eeef f d cefbeec f b e ea b d a e e e e a daa c a ff ce e sequence vout value n scriptPubKey asm OPHASH bcd d f b a e dbaac fe c OPEQUAL hex a bcd d f b a e dbaac fe c reqSigs type scripthash addresses MR ZKb eJm k sPUqHmTcVgszYcHBmJq value n scriptPubKey asm b a dfbd f ae e d e f hex b a dfbd f ae e d e f type witnessv keyhash is from addresses ltc q qammthmtfxug gj dyfgk sf vesk v JuR hcAhBuewXbVNxJRdyFHZHxAGaxHWv ltc qwa esk yrhaatrm u zwwntfu jsvf s l wl blockheight blockindex confirmations doublespend false fees hash a f f b c a ef bdfd b a d c e cd f bcaa c inputs addresses ltc q qammthmtfxug gj dyfgk sf vesk v age outputindex outputvalue prevhash bbcd c b b f aceb c db f b cfc c cd c dc c f scripttype paytowitnesspubkeyhash sequence witness d c b bfd d b d cba f d f df eaa e bf bcddf cb f e d c d eeef f d cefbeec f b e ea b d a e e e e a daa c a ff ce e outputs addresses JuR hcAhBuewXbVNxJRdyFHZHxAGaxHWv script a bcd d f b a e dbaac fe c scripttype paytoscripthash value addresses ltc qwa esk yrhaatrm u zwwntfu jsvf s l wl script b a dfbd f ae e d e f scripttype paytowitnesspubkeyhash value preference low received T Z relayedby size total ver vinsz voutsz Story As a Developer I want to interact with the BitcoinSV blockchain Acceptance Criteria When Developer specifies bitcoinsv in settings And the Developer specifies a test net or prod Developer can perform all Tx and Block transactions successfully list each method ensure tests I ran the example and it wouldnt work without this method defined It seems that webbtccom is not providing fresh data for almost three years Its better to remove it from the README I have a script and it looks like this a af a a f e a a ae d f d ac How can I create an instance of class Script from it It has to be parsed I believe but how Post to SO too This may be helpful see Im going to relay my transaction through this gateway They want me to send them hex data How can I convert what buildtx produces into hex Please update the README May I suggest you raise exceptions instead of returning nil in for example scriptrb Those nils are just making things worse since later its difficult to understand why attributes are nil Its just a good practice to avoid nil in objectoriented programming Thanks What is wrong with my code ruby txn buildtx do tx txinput do i iprevouttxn iprevoutindex isignaturekeykey end txoutput do o ovaluesatoshi oscript s srecipient GzqkR zNQUzHLpE PLPjVNJ FHC bpDH end end Im getting RuntimeError Script type must be hash pubkey p wpkh or multisig Usersyegorrvmgemsruby gemsbitcoinruby libbitcoinbuilderrb in sighashandallkeysexist Usersyegorrvmgemsruby gemsbitcoinruby libbitcoinbuilderrb in signinput Usersyegorrvmgemsruby gemsbitcoinruby libbitcoinbuilderrb in block in tx Usersyegorrvmgemsruby gemsbitcoinruby libbitcoinbuilderrb in each Usersyegorrvmgemsruby gemsbitcoinruby libbitcoinbuilderrb in eachwithindex Usersyegorrvmgemsruby gemsbitcoinruby libbitcoinbuilderrb in tx Usersyegorrvmgemsruby gemsbitcoinruby libbitcoinbuilderrb in buildtx I suspect there is something wrong with the format of the signature key but would be great to get a more meaningful message or at least fail sometime earlier when Im building the transaction Crossposted to SO Add tocustomscript method because in some situations you might want to include the script directly like signing a transaction using buildtx with a custom output Example
