 REQUIRED Step Describe your environment Xcode version Not relevant Firebase SDK version Not relevant Firebase Component Crashlytics Component version Not relevant REQUIRED Step Describe the problem The method FIRCrashlytics recordCustomExceptionNamereasonframeArray is not exposed in the public header file while it is exposed in the old Crashlytics SDK We currently use this method in our apps to report when the main thread hangs Weve realized that when one of the iOS watchdogs kills our app we have no way of knowing why exactly it happened Moreover we dont know how often our apps are killed by the iOS watchdogs as these are not reported by Crashlytics or Apple We were mostly concerned with the main thread watchdog ie if the main thread is not responsive for more than x seconds the app is killed So if you have a deadlock somewhere in the main thread you might never know about it these crashes are probably counted as OOM sessions Our solution was to run our own internal watchdog that periodically checks if the main thread ran since the last check and if not a stack trace of the main thread is generated The stack trace is then given to the above mentioned method to be uploaded to Crashlytics This has worked very good for us in the last few months and fixes showed an increase in OOMfree sessions although these fixes had nothing to do with memory We ask to consider making the above mentioned method public again Note that we only send the main thread stack It would be nice to get and report the stack traces of all the threads See API review doc for context Summary of changes Move all UI code from display SDK to the nondisplay SDK in a folder called DefaultUI Leave blank display SDK for developers who upgrade theres a warning in the nondisplay SDK to remove this

Describe your environment Xcode version Firebase SDK version Firebase Component InAppMessaging Component version REQUIRED Step Describe the problem Steps to reproduce Create first campaign set type as banner in Target set App this app and User Property pro does not contain true in Scheduling remove the default event onForeground and add a custom event Set a breakpoint in the code at the only place this custom event is ever reported set start date as now end date as Feb save campaign as draft On simulator erase all content settings Start app on simulator make sure custom event breakpoint is never hit ok make sure user property pro is set to true ok Verify in web consoles DebugView that simulators user property pro true ok Stop app on simulator Get instance ID from xcode console reopen draft campaign from step add instance ID as Test Device hit test Start app on simulator verify custom event breakpoint is never hit ok Expected behavior On the first screen of the app no message is shown because the custom event was never reported and also the user property excludes this user from being targeted Actual behavior The bannermessage is immediately shown on the first screen of the app ignoring targeting and scheduling I have also tried on real devices no difference from simulator Is this a bug or expected functionality of test devices If the latter how to test it I cannot launch this campaigncode without testing that it works REQUIRED Step Describe your environment Xcode version Firebase SDK version Firebase Component Remote Config Component version REQUIRED Step Describe the problem Remote Config values fall back to default values after a few hours We have an iOS app that relies heavily on Firebase Remote Config to display some of the UI options I set some user parameters in Firebase analytics then do a fetch on app startup Upon app launch the values are fetched correctly After running in the background for a few hours bring app to foreground The remote config values fallback to default ones Workaround kill app and relaunch Steps to reproduce Logs pasted below It looks like when fetch got called again it fetched default values somehow Instabug Logs

After migration from Fabric to Firebase I encountered multiple problems with Crashlitics I followed this guide and used test implementation part to verify if it works fine Effect is crashfree statistics are going down as expected not seeing any crashes on dashboard list invalid behaviour To sum up I am using debug format DWARF dSYM I removed infoplist old Fabric section not a single

to be there Source code changes only Unit test and test app changes to follow Splitting original PR into multiple Background FIROptionsprojectID is needed for Firebase Installations SDKFIS SDK to be sent with API requests FIS SDK is a dependency for Firebase Instance ID SDK IID SDK starting from IID SDK IID SDK does not require FIROptionsprojectID It means that introducing a new dependency enforcing projectID to IID SDK technically is a breaking change and should not be introduced until a major release Workaround FIS SDK uses FIROptions GCMSenderID in case if FIROptionsprojectID is missing to avoid breaking changes see To be done Update FIS SDK to enforce FIROptionsprojectID for the next major release Firebase Describe your environment Xcode version Firebase SDK version Firebase
