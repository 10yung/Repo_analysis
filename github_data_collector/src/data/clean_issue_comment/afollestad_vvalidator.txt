Resolved issue I stumbled across your github account recently and Im currently rocking at least of your libraries including this one Id like to request new features though Pure for the sake of completeness you should add an assertion for phone numbers An almost exact duplicate of isEmail this assertion isPhone could use the PatternsPHONE regex A more serious request Is it possible to add a native assertion for input inputLayout to compare two fields For example when you have a field Password and PasswordConfirm the second one could be compared to match This one could be compareToview EditText where the param expects the EditText or TextInputLayout to compare to eg the Password field Additionally it could have an ignoreCase option I can create a pull request myself but I dont have much time right now as Im working on a project for school Hi I am currently using your library I found it really nice to use but I am missing internalization support Currently default messages are hardcoded in English but to offer some translations I am seeing a few problems Without changing internal code using Assertiondescription method I cannot access the assertion state to offer a different description to each constraint so I cannot replace for example LengthAssertion descriptions with it When subclassing Assertion itself to provide my own implementation I cannot access ValidationContainergetString as it is internal that means I cannot provide internalization myself in my own subclasses at least not without hacks With above in mind my current proposal is x Change ValidationContainergetString visibility from internal to public x Provide a ValidationContainergetString variant that accepts extra arguments to format the string Migrate current default descriptions to StringRes so people can submit translations Id like to discuss what you think about it or if you have another plans with a more richer solution but I can submit a PR myself if you think its good to go it would be nice if you can add method to override error message in global function so i wouldnt use description every time i make a validation because in my requirement example form inputLayoutRidtilemail isNotEmptydescriptionData tidak boleh kosong isEmaildescriptionFormat email salah inputLayoutRidtilpasword isNotEmptydescriptionData tidak boleh kosong submitWithRidbtnsubmit if i have global function to set error message for spesific validation it will help me so much
