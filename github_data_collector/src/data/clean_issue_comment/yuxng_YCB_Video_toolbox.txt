 Thank you so much for sharing when I run the code showposeresultsmit will be reported the errorReference to nonexistent field modelpath As follows showposeresults loading D models Reference to nonexistent field modelpath Error in showposeresults line fileobj fullfileoptmodelpath objectnamesi texturedobj can you tell me whats that meansand how to get it worksthanks Hi Where does the object axis lie in the YCB models included with this dataset Has it been centered at the object Hello Im testing some icp methods on your dataset In evaluateposeskeyframem there are translation error metric and rotation error metric I wonder if the test in it is a pose or just the last column of transfomation matrix T because in function add test represents the last column of T But if I use the definition in function te it seems that it just measure distance difference the cloud travels but not distance between ground truth cloud and our estimated cloud I remember somewhere I saw that the focal length of one of the cameras was but I cannot seem to find it again Can you give a pointer to where this information is stored When trying to run evaluateposeskeyframem the function quat rotm is missing I also could not find it defined anywhere in this repository though it is used in the other evaluation scripts This dataset is too big to download on my system Is there anyway you can provide a smaller version of the dataset for test purposes Thanks HelloSorry to bother Ive noticed your paper on arXiv but I couldnt find the source code download link on your website or your paper is that because you havent release your source code yet If so is there a schedule of releasing your source codeThanks
