It would be super cool if there was a button that you could press that would launch a random game from a specified category If this project was retargeted against NET Core then it would run natively on OSX and Linux and generally be more portable This would resolve LOVE this project its pretty amazing However one of the main reasons I want this is to properly separate my VR games where Steam and the developers consistently failed to tag their VR games with the store tags for VR Could you add these VR related categories tags and game titles to the system I am currently following the instructions to scrap the store so hopefully it will catch them at that point if its possible currently For some reason my steam reset my cames to no categories so gonna dive in and fix this I did use the rallion version then discovered this new one Rallion and Theo has the same error Here is the error I have on boot Here you can see I have no other choice than Genre Also happens from the top selection bar under autocat On the bottom status bar it says Updated DB Entries from appinfo Profile loaded Failed to update from config files if this has any effect I seen a post deleting the files in steamappcache but this had no difference for Depressurizer Found in version Just Cause Multiplayer Mod Steam ID shows up in the depressurizer database and in the Steam client but does not show up in the main depressurizer games list as something that can be categorized ERR Exception when performing local update DepressurizerParseException Unexpected character found when expecting key at DepressurizerVdfFileNodeLoadFromBinaryBinaryReader stream Int streamLength at DepressurizerVdfFileNodeLoadFromBinaryBinaryReader stream Int streamLength at DepressurizerPackageInfoLoadPackagesString path at DepressurizerGameListUpdateGameListFromOwnedPackageInfoInt accountId SortedSet ignored AppTypes includedTypes Int newApps at DepressurizerFormMainUpdateLibrary Full log at Id love to contribute to this repository Is it in active i use latest version
