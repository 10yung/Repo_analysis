My code is returning a struct lets call it Data from within a Custom Derive subcrate and had to implement quoteToTokens for Data to make that possible As my struct was the newtype pattern over a VecDatum it would have been amazing to start from an example that did something similar with some other wrapped VecT I wanted to donate back the code I ended up with which should at least illustrate the documentation gaps in my head I still dont know if I implemented this in a best practice way but I wanted to make an issue to suggest more examples with implementing ToTokens may be useful
