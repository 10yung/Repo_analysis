repo from the Security Alerts page details borekb as discussed in Gitter To make third party plugins that use a custom database prefix different than wpdbprefix compatible with VersionPress you can now define a property prefix in schemayml in order to prefix the table name of the entity with a custom one Links to several plugin definitions by community members have been added as well I tried to create a wordpress docker image with versionpress on it Im only interested on versionpress files so I created a mount point of git on wordpress root folder varwwwhtmlgit and versionpress db folder vpdb on wpcontent folder varwwwhtmlwpcontentvpdb On the checklist says This website is already versioned in Git even though the git folder and vpdb is empty And also when i tried to activate it it will try to delete the mounted folders which throws an error since it is not a normal folder Im proposing is instead of deleting the folder it should only delete the files inside it Another thing is when the docker image is deployed under a load balancer it will not be successfully activated because mostly of the load balancers have limits on response time Please take the above situations on your design so that versionpress can be used on docker images More power and God bless us all
