build raises error Liquid Exception no implicit conversion of Symbol into Integer in layoutsdefaulthtml as per Digging around in alternatesrb it appears that lines expect the o object to be a hash and attempt to run gsub on the data element of that hash However in my case the o object is actually a string and replacing the block with ogsubNODER NODE raw appears to fix the issue I am raising this as an issue because I have only recently started using jekyllassets and have not taken the time to understand the whole codebase so I dont know whether this is the right way to address this issue or what sideeffects it might have Could someone with more knowledge of the project sanitycheck this finding and let me know if I should submit a PR Hi envygeeks I read your comment of this very day thank you for the effort I actually have still to use your plugin I have a question if eventually you may have already address it Suppose I have different Javascript files some of them but not all of them could be groupd and merged into one file Can I use your plugin to instruct how to merge js files Example assetsjs assetsprojectonejs I want the files in the second folder grouped in proj js the one in the first as mainjs Is it possible Hi I would like to ask about the current state of this project Is this project still maintained I ask because the latest stable release is over a year old and there is no update for the past several months It would be nice if this project gets more maintenances especially for the support of Sprockets and Jekyll Any feedback would be appreciated Thanks Updates the
