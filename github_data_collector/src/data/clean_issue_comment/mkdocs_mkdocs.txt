mkdocsyml is nav Home readmemd after build the public dir is html css fonts img js readme indexhtml the readmemd is compile to readmeindexhtml Hi I am having a structure in my docs like this docs docsmytestsomecontentmd having a headline My Content so the navigation will look like this mytest My Content I still want to use the autodetection of mkdocs so the navigation elements are created automatically but I also want to give the directory an explicit name in the navigation eg My Test My Content Is that already possible Different environments may have different configurations such siteurl It would be great to be able to set any attribute via env var Some plugins implement this on their own but OTB solution would be very needed This is more general then Current solution looks funky sitename pythonobjectapplyosgetenv CIPROJECTPATH repourl pythonobjectapplyosgetenv CIPROJECTURL reponame pythonobjectapplyosgetenv CIPROJECTPATH Something like following is more readable sitename CIPROJECTPATH The docs says The serve event is only called when the serve command is used during development It is passed the Server instance which can be modified before it is activated For example additional files or directories could be added to the list of watched files for autoreloading How can I add files or directories I tried this python def onserveself server config kwargs for element in selfconfig watch serverwatchelement return server With this in my mkdocsyml yaml plugins search mkdocstrings watch srcmkdocstrings It detects the changes but since I gave no function to serverwatchdir func the site is not rebuilt I checked the source code of mkdocs and I see that you are using a local function that we cannot reuse ourselves without rewriting it and What would be the best way to add a directory with this same builder functionality Should I simply copy paste it On add The MkDocs Plugins wiki page lists many rdparty plugins that you can use filename which markdown file contains dot can not find file eg vuejsmd change name to vuejsmd this is ok why not auto append md Previously MkDocs used field boost to boost the title field by for search results However when lunrjs removed support for field boost in it was removed from MkDocs when we refactored search into a plugin As documented in olivernnlunrjs the feature was restored to lunrjs in version Therefore we should restore the boost to the title field We should also update lunrjs to the most recent version Thats an easy fix However at the same time that lunrjs restored field boost they also added support for boosting a document In other words if boost is applied to a document that document would get returned higher in the list of search results It occurs to me that we could implement this with a metadata value by adding support for a boost or search priority or other better name as a metadata key The key would then be added to each entry in the JSON data used to build the search index When building the index the value of that key could be applied as document boost That would allow site authors to better control search results to ensure that certain pages always appear higher up in the results However Im not sure if there is any demand for such a feature Field boost will definately be restored but we may only add document boost if we get demand for it here Please reply below Hi Mkdocs It seems that the attribute level for pagetoc items is not the level of the hx in the markdown documents but the global level With a title markdown title level title level titile level If there is not title markdown title level titile level Is there anyway to get the real level of headings markdown title level title level titile level markdown title level titile level Regards
