This implementation uses the new helper method of Bitmap called finduptonunset This method looks for the biggest continuous bits unset in the bitmap and returns the start of the region back to the caller I implemented this the simplest way possible and it seems to work It is more of a proposal than anything else as it is the result of me messing around with the ext filesystem The main idea is that when we want to allocate a big chunk of blocks it is better to allocate the blocks as close to each other as possible So the new allocation method finds the biggest fit possible and then repeats the process in case the actual block count could not be found in a continuous region Finally the method still respects the preferredgroupindex as it tries to allocate the blocks there first and then proceeds to other groups when no more blocks are available This super WIP MR adds ldelfso First of all Thanks for your selfless help This the issue Ive encountered Screenshot from I have to mention that after I run BuildItsh in Toolchain directory I got this Screenshot from Im using ubuntu LTS Screenshot from Thanks Popup mechanism needs to be improved For example in the filemanager when deleting a file or directory the popup modal does not prevent the filemanager from beeing used with the keyboard It should lock whats behind and navigating with the keyboard arrows for example should change the confirmation popup focus instead at some point probably during the introduction of theming Boot into a fresh virtual image ubuntumate desktopamd for example Prepare environment sudo apt install git vim git clone depth Following serenityBuildInstructionsmd sudo apt install buildessential curl libmpfrdev libmpcdev libgmpdev e fsprogs qemusystemi qemuutils Try to build toolchain cd serenityToolchain BuildItsh homeubuntumateserenityToolchain PREFIX is homeubuntumateserenityToolchainLocal SYSROOT is homeubuntumateserenityToolchainRoot serenityToolchainTarballs serenityToolchain bu md a b bcc e fcc fae ba a Skipped downloading binutils gc md e b a d ddcfd a bc Skipped downloading gcc Skipped extracting binutils Skipped extracting gcc serenityToolchain serenityToolchainBuild serenityToolchain serenityToolchainBuildbinutils serenityToolchainBuild serenityToolchain checking build system type x pclinuxgnu checking host system type x pclinuxgnu checking target system type Invalid configuration i pcserenity system serenity not recognized configure error binbash homeubuntumateserenityToolchainTarballsbinutils configsub i pcserenity failed This patch adds the methodology from ports to the toolchain Its much easier and convenient to build the toolchain apps by using the packagessh script in each package subfolder For convenience buildessentialsh and buildoptionalsh can be used to build the entire toolchain parts A few changes to LibC that allows the useradd Userspace utility to run This makes it a lot easier to append to etcpasswd without manually editing it as well as having to know the format for the entries TextEditor only needs to open files that the user selects in a GFilePicker or dragsndrops onto its window disregarding fonts and icons they could be explicitly made accessible by eg bindmounting them into a chroot Wouldnt it be cool if an app could ask the the system SystemDialog to run GFilePicker for it and send back an opened file Im trying to get Serenity to boot on a physical machine I have now managed to copy the files from the usb drive to an hdd partition and to start booting serenity with an existing grub on that machine Im doing it this way because it seems the machine isnt able to boot from usb drives at all Now the boot stops at initstage because I have the serentity files on the th partition of the drive and apparently serenity allows only for partitions This is the exact message Im getting initstage invalid partition number expected to Details to my setup On the machine theres a Linux installation with following partitions devsda boot ext devsda ext devsda swap devsda usr ext Ive put the Serenity files from the USB drive on sda and copied Serenitys bootkernel to sda as kernelserenity and added to the grub menulst of sda title SerenityOS root hd kernel bootkernelserenity rootdevhda
