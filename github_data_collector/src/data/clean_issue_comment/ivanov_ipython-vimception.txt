 The feature described here doesnt seem to work Has anyone managed to get this working I installed vimception as described in the readme But once I start clicking into cells the cursor just stays there and everything stops working I cant type or anything all I can do is leave insert mode and switch to other cells but then I cant edit those either edit I can report some more details now Entering ipython insert mode i can actually type stuff but there seems to be no way to switch between vim command and insert mode only ipython command and insert mode If I execute code that results in an error message like asdfasdfasdf then everything stops working altogether I think using the above format or some variant might make it a lot easier for your users to get started The preview is at The original instructions delete a notebook cell when the kernel is restarted in an existing notebook and when vimception is alway loaded This code fixes this By updating to version vimception stops working Pressing i insert mode sends kernel interrupting signal Added throwcatch to blur event handler to deal with exceptions that see med to be short circuiting the process and causing stranded cursors CtrlV should turn visual block selection mode on which does not happen OS XSafari Hello Ive installed vimception and the extension for codefolding in ipython It seems to be that only one of them work at a time Can you confirm that they do not work together love the plugin I use ch to backspace as my keyboard doesnt have a backspace Any way to do that Is cc obligatory due to how ipython notebooks modal keybindings work Would it be possible to use esc as well Id be happy to contribute if possible
