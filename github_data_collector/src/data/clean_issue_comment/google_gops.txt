Its superceded by the standard os package in go I just noticed that the documentation does not have list golang versions supported by this package It cannot run using other golang versions apart from go shell go build githubcomgooglegopssignal module requires Go go build githubcomgooglegopsinternal module requires Go Add access control when remote cmd when only gops agentListen enabled but no gops command connects to this agent when we run ps without any args its output includes column header like this ps PID TTY TIME CMD pts bash pts ps currently gops does not have column header those newcomer users may not know meanings of st and nd column gops memstats couldnt get port by PID dial tcp connect cant assign requested address when i use addrlong time no response i use go version go darwinamd i remember it works beforeperhaps i updated the go version gops panics if anything other than help was invoked without specifying the pidaddr of the target gops stats panic runtime error index out of range goroutine running mainmain EInstallsgotoolssrcgithubcomgooglegopsmaingo x a This adds a check and prints the usage if it was not specified go run maingo cmdgo stats gops pidaddr of target process not specified gops is a tool to list and diagnose Go processes gops cmd pidaddr gops pid displays process info All commands require the agent running on the Go process Symbol indicates the process runs the agent exit status I use gops on the centos and when I use gops trace pid itll pause when Opening browser I hope there is a way to connect browser to the gops such as links elinks etc Because its not safe for us to export a certain http port So we need use gops on the server instead of local windows computer How should i deal with this error Error killed GOPATHbingops go version go version go darwinamd go env GOARCHamd GOBIN GOEXE GOHOSTARCHamd GOHOSTOSdarwin GOOSdarwin GOPATHUserswilliamgocode GORACE GOROOTusrlocalgo GOTOOLDIRusrlocalgopkgtooldarwinamd GCCGOgccgo CCclang GOGCCFLAGSfPIC m pthread fnocaretdiagnostics Qunusedarguments fmessagelength fdebugprefixmapvarfoldershkhn zx pb s zcdr cr gpTgobuild tmpgobuild gnorecordgccswitches fnocommon CXXclang CGOENABLED PKGCONFIGpkgconfig CGOCFLAGSg O CGOCPPFLAGS CGOCXXFLAGSg O CGOFFLAGSg O CGOLDFLAGSg O This PR adds communication over HTTP so it would be possible to use existing server to serve gops traffic All previous modes are preserved asis so both local and rawsocketremote modes are still there Ive refactored client code a bit so that both socket and HTTP modes would be possible to use now theres a Client iface implemented by ClientTCP and ClientHTTP that is passed to every gops commands function instead of raw TCPAddr To use it run gops like this gops pprofcpu
