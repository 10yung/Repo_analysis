can we use postgres Ive updated dependencies notably hyper The ssl feature flag has been removed from hyper and I am unable to fully test but things seems to be working for me GitHub changed the way Markdown headings are parsed so this change fixes it See bryant readmesfix for more information Tackles bryant readmesfix Hi Ive been using Pencil for the last few months and Ive built a web app that has now entering production stage As Ive been building my app Ive maintained a fork of Pencil which has allowed me to quickly add features that Ive needed The fork can be found here These changes include but are not limited to Specifying the number of threads used important in production even when using a reverse proxy since connections to the DB might block and I was surprised that Hyper spawned only one thread on a singlecore server Serving partial files in response to the Range header Im serving partly dynamic content so just offloading this to Nginx or to some CDN was not feasible Rough support for serving HTTP Not Modified and specifying cache expiry time when serving files Updating dependencies supporting Hyper which got rid of the dependency on old SSL versions Debug trait implementations for some structures Afterrequest handlers getting a reference not only to the Response but to the Request too this is handy if you use the TypeMap in Request to pass data from prerequest to postrequest handler Implemented routing by GET parameters I also made some changes that may prove controversial Implementing some methods for the dictionaries for getting ownership of the parsed arguments etc Id prefer if arguments fields etc were parsed in a noncopy way This way you couldnt the take the ownership but if you needed it you could clone At the moment the data is copied once when parsing and second time when accessing Taking ownership prevents the second copy but it would obviously be better but requires more work if the data was copied when a copy is really needed Exposed some private fields Accessing fields through accessors is often painful in Rust especially if mutable access is needed since accessing one field locks the rest Direct access to fields is more flexible Again if the request was more immutable and parsed zerocopy the fields should accessed only with shared references and exposing the fields only with accessors would be sensible I havent really looked into how much work implementing more zerocopy parsing would be Yet Id like to contribute these changes back to Pencil and help releasing Pencil However as the changes are just stopgap solutions to my problems I need to brush them up a bit if I were to contribute them However I want to have a confirmation from the maintainer fengsp if he is willing to merge the PRs if I were to contribute stuff since I dont want to do needless work D What do you think Cargo allows you to run examples like this cargo run example http and would be a better option then using a separate project Now you can view the docs here The AfterRequestFunc type signature is now fn Request mut Response This change allows information from the request to be used in typical postrequest tasks such as logging in a standard format or reporting request timings Specifically I needed to log in the Apache common log format which includes request info the response status code and the size of the response body in bytes Hi I am having issues with where to place static files when I cargo run I am getting an error thread main panicked at Template not found hellohtml homefullmetakdekucargoregistrysrcgithubcom ecc db ec pencil srcapprs The directory structure is Cargolock Cargotoml src static target template fn main let mut app Pencilnewworkspacewebpencildemo I know it might be trivial Id appreciate any help I have no experience with Flask Hi Im trying to define a RESTful API and defined a route like this appputapiwordsidintpublish setpublishwords setpublish However it seems that having query parameters like publish is not supported In my opinion they should EITHER be supported this would be nice or the call should fail to signal that they in fact arent supported
