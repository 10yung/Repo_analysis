Dear author Thanks and cheers for developing this package I have the question as to how to use the package to download complete mitochondrial genomes from the NCBI This is because I am going to working with DNA metabarcoding and I am interested in developing some new primer pairs for certain animal groups I have seen that there are some types that we can specify in the code such as cds or rna but I havent seen the option for mitochondrial DNA Best regards Dear author I want to download the GRCh protein sequence is it possible HSproteomerefseq getProteome db emsembl organism Homo sapiens path filepathncbidownloadsproteomes Best Shixiang Hi there I am wondering if there is a way to retrieve Encode regulatory regions from a specified genomic region with the parameters mart ENSEMBLMARTGENOMIC dataset hsapiensencode and attributes cvalue seqregionstart name value seqregionend encoderegion Using biomartrbiomart to retrieve the information does not work because it requires the genes parameter I dont have any gene list and Encode regions do not always found within genes anyway Id appreciate it if you know a way to achieve this Thanks for the good work This issue depends on the numbers of genomes cds rna etc that are to be downloaded As the process goes on the amount of RAM used by the rsession progressively increases to a point where the entire system slows down On a system with GB RAM lowend systems Ive managed to download successfully but I need to restart system after the process is done as everything is super slow afterwards So far Ive not managed to download higher numbers than that as the system becomes non responsive I think it must be some variable that must be increasing in size as the process goes on and can be easily cleaned up after each download maybe to reduce RAM usage Also note that the RAM usage at times intermittently decreases ie its not continuously increasing but over a long period of time it increases a lot eventually overpowering the system Hi I am trying to download several CDS files from genbank but I am not getting all of them because some species do not have a CDS file however the getCDS command acts as if they were downloaded I am using lappy to pass a list of species using their taxonids to getCDS I first checked that these species have a genome assembly using the assemblysummarytxt file I think that most of them do not have a CDS file although there is a genomic assembly and that is where the problem lies lapplyassemblymonocotgenbank getCDS dbgenbank reference F path filepathncbidownloadsmonocotCDSgenbank For most of the species I get the CDS fasta file Starting CDS retrieval of from genbank MB CDS download of is completed Checking md hash of file ncbidownloadsmonocotCDSgenbank md checksumstxt The md hash of file ncbidownloadsmonocotCDSgenbank md checksumstxt matches The genomic CDS of has been downloaded to ncbidownloadsmonocotCDSgenbank and has been named cdsfromgenomicgenbankfnagz But for some others I get the message Starting CDS retrieval of from genbank MB The genomic CDS of has been downloaded to ncbidownloadsmonocotCDSgenbank and has been named cdsfromgenomicgenbankfnagz And there is no fasta file to be found However doc dbgenbanktxt and doc dbgenbanktsv files are in the folder Is there a way of checking if a species has a CDS file available As a result of using lapply I get a list at the end for all the species ncbidownloadsmonocotCDSgenbank cdsfromgenomicgenbankfnagz ncbidownloadsmonocotCDSgenbank cdsfromgenomicgenbankfnagz ncbidownloadsmonocotCDSgenbank cdsfromgenomicgenbankfnagz When I check the warnings after the command ends I can see this Warning messages The download session seems to have

ftpftpncbinlmnihgovgenomesallGCA GCA ASM v folder for example I see that there is no cds file there and I think that is the reason of why I am not getting them they dont exist but the getCDS command is not checking correctly if they do so it gives the message as if they were downloaded I know sometimes NCBI blocks connections that do many queries so maybe some of these files do exist but if I run the command again it tries to download all of them again I hope my problem is clearly explained and I hope it is easy to fix too I find this tool really useful for what I want to do and it has saved me a lot of time even with this error Thanks PS I have also used the metaretrieval command to get CDS from RefSeq Land plants but I cannot use it for genbank queries Thank you for the nice package However when I try to run a standard biomartr query on my local computer its successful R version macOS librarybiomartr getGenomedb genbank organism GCA reference FALSE But when I run the same command

Hello Really great package Its now part of my working flow for all analysis Im working with plants so I use Ensembl Plant a lot One thing Im curious is is there any way to specify the release version of Ensembl Plant Similar with Ensembl Ensembl Plant also updates regularly I want to keep my result replicable in case they update their database For example in the newest Release the Setaria italica genome was updated It seems they do have several archived sites like Release and Release An example of my code to retrieve gene description is below It would be awesome if the version info could be implemented maybe its already done R biomartgenes genelist mart plantsmart dataset zmayseggene attributes cdescription externalgenename externalgenesource filters ensemblgeneid Thank you Best Ji Hi

recover unfinished retrieval it seems to cost quite long time to scan previous job I wonder if we can just let the program leave them out and continue It will save a lot of time By the way I like your package so much Please keep updating Best regards Chi
