Just tested with Octave and the scripts to create tsv in the matlab code folder do not work because the table function is something different in Octave Might be good to improve that no related to The matlabCode snippet directory is becoming a little bit unorganized is it ok to reorganize according to modality Folders per modality would include ieeg eeg func anat general other Am playing catch up with the BIDS derivatives RC trying to wrap my head around it to structure some of my data Realizing that I am about to write a pretty much write a matlab scripts functions for that would it make sense if I put it in this repo too Addition of images describing the relation to source data raw data derivatives see issue I had made this figure to add it to the BIDS specs But before I make a pull request there I was thinking that we could work on it add it to the starter kit and then make a PR to the specs What do you think link on google drive SVG file made with inkscape if you want to edit it further BTW Is there a good way to version control figure making gitannex bidsrawderivativesource Hi ParkPatrick dorahermes emdupre and anyone else who is following the development I think the sidebar in the wiki contains too many links its scrolling off the bottom of the screen and isnt really as useful as youd hope it to be Heres a list of whats on it right now Home Frequently Asked Questions FAQ Glossary Glossary The BIDS Folder Hierarchy TheBIDSfolderhierarchy A guide to the different files and how they are organised in the BIDS directory structure Tutorials Tutorials Links to detailed tutorials to help you get started with BIDS Metadata File Formats Metadatafileformats About JSON and TSV files and creatingreading them Dataset Examples datasetexamples Links to BIDS compliant datasets with some sourcedata EEG Formatting Examples EEGFormattingExamples BIDS Validator Info bidsvalidatorinfo BIDS Apps Help BIDSAppsHelp Helpful links and a FAQ about BIDS Apps BIDS Extensions BIDSExtentions Publications Publications Community Resources communityresources A collection of resources from the community including slideshows presentations graphics etc Useful Links Usefullinks A collection of links to useful code other repositories relevant to BIDS Contact Contact Note that Ive done a little reformatting taken out header formatting and just made links bold to make it take up a little less space but Id like to propose that we shorten this list to Home Frequently Asked Questions FAQ Glossary Glossary The BIDS Folder Hierarchy TheBIDSfolderhierarchy A guide to the different files and how they are organised in the BIDS directory structure Tutorials Tutorials Links to detailed tutorials to help you get started with BIDS Metadata File Formats Metadatafileformats About JSON and TSV files and creatingreading them Dataset Examples datasetexamples Links to BIDS compliant datasets with some sourcedata BIDS Apps Help BIDSAppsHelp Helpful links and a FAQ about BIDS Apps BIDS Extensions BIDSExtentions More information about how to add to the BIDS specification Community Resources communityresources A collection of resources from the community including slideshows presentations graphics etc Contact Contact Get in touch Ive also updated the wiki home page to point to the pages dropdown menu that shows all the pages so maybe theyre easier to find that way What do you all think BIDS Tutorial Series Part a Introductory Walkthrough prompts to download DICOMs from the Nathan Kline Institute NKI Rockland Sample Multiband Imaging TestRetest Pilot Dataset For me is not possible to do the download and I get this error img width altnitrcerror src I was wondering if this is a general issue then would be great if it is fixed Thanks I was just wondering what the type of data should go in Dataset Examples should Raw NonBIDS data be in there The term raw is a bit confusing since BIDS is meant for raw data ParkPatrick KirstieJane I dont know what type of file the Graphical Representation of BIDS Brainhack NYC NY USA N Markowitz should be Its part of the community resources in the wiki When I download the file it doesnt have a suffix and I dont know what programme to open it in The main landing page for anyone searching for information about BIDS is ParkPatrick has done great work updating the BIDS Starter Kit README with lots of useful information about the background and motivations for BIDS and this information could also be brought over to the main website as suggested by chrisfilo in our discussions in The pull request would have to go to rather than to this repository but I thought having the discussion of what to transfer over might make sense Any thoughts on what should be included on the main website
