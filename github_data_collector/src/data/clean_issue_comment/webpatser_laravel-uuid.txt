add default method register fixed laravel Validatefunction returns true with parameter value The result is the same with any given parameter of length Tested with version on Laravel Hi all I have encountered error after adding UuidServiceProviderclass in providers and Uuidclass in alias of configappphp and running config cache with php artisan configcache The error is as below Symfony Component Debug Exception FatalErrorException Class Webpatser Uuid UuidServiceProvider contains abstract method and mus t therefore be declared abstract or implement the remaining methods Illumi nate Support ServiceProviderregister As I look into the UuidServiceProvider class looks like the register method is missing which is required in Laravel ServiceProvider It seems counterintuitive that it is not possible to generate a specific version of a UUID using the UuidVERSION constants eg UuidgenerateUuidVERSION As this library currently supports PHP the use of private visibility constants isnt possible without a major version bump One solution is making these constants private possibly static properties This would remove them from the public scope and avoid any confusion around their use The other possible solution is to add them as cases in the switch statement that determines which type of UUID to generate php switch intver case case selfVERSION return new staticstaticmintRand Thoughts I get strange results when using Uuidimport on a uuid returned from an SQL Server uniqueidentifier filled by the SQL default newsequentialid like this uid Webpatser Uuid UuidimportApp Deploymentfirstid Webpatser Uuid Uuid dduid Webpatser Uuid Uuid bytes b k x D x x x n T hex null string b b ec e dc d abc urn null version null variant null node null time null App Deploymentfinduidstring null The last bit should have returned the model from which I previously got the uuid The actual uuid as I see it in SQL Server Management Studio looks like this though SQL B B ECE DC D ABC PHP B B EC E DC D ABC The first two blocks seem to be in reversed order When using the first uuid I can find the model as expected App Deploymentfind B B ECE DC D ABC App Deployment Am I missing something here
