Firefox There were a number of tabs open from before the update that had FireflyIII open inside I thought they were just from cache but looking at the logs maybe some of the requests were successful I then refreshed the page and got the same whoops error Screenshot Bug description I am running Firefly III version and my problem is When dealing with multicurrency bank accounts account view in the dashboard doesnt handle it quite well In fact everything is displayed in the default currency x scrot The green line at the top is a bank account in a currency that is times the default currency used by the other bank accounts blue and orange This basically make useless the view because its quite hard to see the flow of blue and orange accounts For example the orange account is the one with the highest number of transactions Looks like nothing is happening Solution The chart should show each bank account in the default currency accounts not in the default currency should have the amount converted I love the reconcile feature it helps me catch transactions I forgot to record This happens at least a few times during my monthly statement review and that usually means refreshing the page to see freshlyadded transactions I wish the reconcile page would refresh listed transactions without clearing my check marks or changing the ending balance Im envisioning a refresh button somewhere on the page Current situation I am importing transactions for an asset account There are some transactions which is money from loans or mortgages I tried to change the deposit transaction to a transfer but I could not change the sourceaccount to any loan only to the default assets like saving accounts Solution Add loans to dropdownlist in change to transfer window Question Or is this something that is not on the list because of some behaviours I dont have in my mind yet Bug description I am running Firefly III version and my problem is I choose the Chiense Simplified to be the default language but it does not display on the sign in page This happens sice version when I first use At first I thought maybe you just did not set the translatioon on this page But today when I finnaly wanna change it to Chinese by modifying resourcelangzhCNfireflyphp I saw that it has already been translated on both local file and Crowdin Then I realize that this is a translation bug Please fix it It will be so much appreciated Replace the version and describe your problem or your issue may be closed Steps to reproduce Change it to Chinese Simplified Log out See the log in page Just still display in English

doesnotdisplaytranslation homepage Bonus points Earn bonus points by checking the boxes x Nobody reported this bug before I have added a stack trace from my log files x I have added a screenshot x I was able to replicate it on the demo site I donated money this is a joke wink Not just ID and descr but date amount etc From reddit fireflyIIImobiletransactions From Version Firefly III beta Some places I can see it Account Detail Transactions Transactions Search Not sure if this can be fixed by a div classtableresponsive I looked on the demo site and could not find any info as to what the heck a virtual balance is and what kind of scenario would it be used in An actual example wold be much appreciated TIA Description It will be nice to keep an history of previous import configurations files and suggest a list of these configuration files on the importation page Solution Store in database configuration files defined during import What are alternatives Currently its necessary to keep these files in local to reimport them later Additional context Nothing Bonus points I am a Laravel developer I can develop it Bug description I am running Firefly III version and my problem is Replace the version and describe your problem or your issue may be closed Steps to reproduce What do you need to do to trigger this bug Restart firefly Watch the logs Chown and Chmod firefly storage directory takes very long and causes IOWait on drive This is a very heavy load on the server on startup and seems unneccessary since the directory shouldnt change and in my case is inside the docker container Only the upload and export directories could have changed permissions since those are mounted to the container Chownchmod those would not take long Extra info Please add extra info here such as OS
