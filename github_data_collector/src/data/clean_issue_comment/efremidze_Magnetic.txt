Environment iOS Version INSERT iOS VERSION HERE Devices INSERT DEVICES HERE While using this library I occasionally roughly half the time I run the exact same procedure in my app get an error in the console reading UIColor created with component values far outside the expected range Set a breakpoint on UIColorBreakForOutOfRangeColorComponents to debug This message will only be logged once Ive followed the directions by setting a breakpoint and could find nothing there and confirmed that my own code has no time where I create a UIColor with a value more than Additionally I found this StackOverflow answer indicating that Im not the only one experiencing this I dont think its a big deal at all as its not causing a crash but I thought Id at least raise awareness of it Provide a short

to check the following boxes by putting an x in the Checklist x Ive tested my changes x Ive read the Contribution Guidelines CONTRIBUTINGmd x Ive updated the documentation if necessary Motivation and Context Why is this change required What problem does it solve If it fixes an open issue please link to the issue here Please describe how you tested your changes If you are submitting a link to your app for the README you can omit this section Thanks for the delightful library In preparing for a user test I noticed a few minor usability issues with VoiceOverVO MultiLineLabels are read as individual label elements as opposed to a single label Selection state of a node isnt presented to a VO user There is no easy way for a VO user to quickly confirm selections which is a benefit of this library for a nonVO user Description Describe your changes in detail To address the above issues I have made the following changes Made Nodeswift class set accessibilityElement to true overriding its childrens accessibility settings as well as enabled the property to group its children This allows multiline labels to be read as one if the nodes accessibilityLabel is not set but thats set as well Additionally this PR adds an accessibilityPath that is by default computed to be an ellipse inside the sprite shape but can be overridden or removed if subclassed Added accessibilityTraits to be selected when a Node is tapped ie in the isSelected property For iOS and above MagneticViewswift is initialized with a Selected custom rotor using accessibilityCustomRotors Note that for iOS the entire Magneticswift scene has the added property accessibilityContainerType to be list This lets a VO user know when they are entering and leaving the list of items I wasnt entirely sure if OS specific code is allowed in this library but given that this makes tangible benefits to a VO user Im hoping its alright Tested on Xcode and iOS betas Happy to make changes as needed
