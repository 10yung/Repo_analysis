When installing the plugin with npm lodashdebounce and classnames are dependencies and are installed However they are also bundled in the built version A lodashdebounce and classnames could be moved as devDependencies B or better a version should be provided with lodashdebounce and classnames not bundled These are commons packages that are likely to be already available in a complex app that way they can be shared and reused Short description I was trying to add a label for the suggest input but it didnt have the expected behaviour input focus on label click because I couldnt set the input ID Placeholder is fine but in some cases Id rather use label for better UX It can be implemented by adding a simple inputId prop option import React from react const Loginform handleSubmit event eventpreventDefault return div h classNameformtaglineCatch Of The Dayh form onsubmitthishandleSubmit h classNameheaderLogin Formh div classNameemail input typetext placeholder Your Email address classNameemailbox input div div classNamepassword input typepassword placeholderpassword classNamepassboxinput div div classNameforgetpass p hrefForget passwordp div div classNamesubmit button typesubmit placeholderpassword classNamesubmitbutonSubmitbutton div div classNameforgetpass p hrefNot Resgistered yet Resgistered Nowp div form div export default Loginform why give error that handleSubmit is not define please help me I was trying to add airport type using types but since there are only supported types I obviously cant any ideas on how should I do that Do you intend to support other types Problem Styling is so difficult here especially when trying to work with design system components such as Material UI Suggested solution The solution that I suggest is to expose the input and suggestion list in the component rather than wrapping it inside the GeoSuggest component The reactplacesautocomplete does this well but this package is much more complete than the other one which feels abandoned Short description I want to mock this input during a test and interact with it and select a place I need this because Im writing tests for a form that uses this input Expected results I wanted a way to mock the google API results so during my test after changing the text inside the text input a list of mocked places would show up and I would be able to simulate a click on one of them and get a mock location Actual results There seem to be no ways to do any of this besides changing the input text value Additional Information I managed to mock enough of the Google maps api to make the input appear on screen but I dont know which functions I need to mock to get some fake results for testing purposes We use testinglibraryreact so we cant mess with the state directly so Im currently unable to test any forms that include a location picker For the geosuggest input allow the attribute dataid to be added to the component Please fill out the title field according to our commit conventions Description Fixes a bug where happened when Checklist Mark these as checked by replacing with x All tests passing Created tests which fail without the change if possible Extended the README documentation if necessary Commits and PR follow conventions Short description I have an array of events scenario each event has a location for which I am using this library to capture the geo location However I am wondering how to identify which index of geo suggest instance needs to be updated Unless I am missing something I think it would be helpful to return index of the instance during onSuggestSelect Short description Add the option to set the input field to typesearch Expected results It would be great to be able to set the input field to the search type in order to have the clear option available This should be super simple unless it interferes with anything else Actual results Currently this is not an option in this utility Additional Information Here is an example of what it might look like download the property could be inputType Type String Default text Options are text and search Set to search if you would like to have a clear button on the end of your input or searchTypeInput Type Boolean Default false Set to true if you would like to change the input field to typesearch and have a clear button on the end of your input Please provide a prop to input locale to google API
