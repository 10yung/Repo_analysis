 What type of PR is this check all applicable Refactor x Feature x Bug Fix Documentation Update Description The app works only in portrait mode before this There was a flag which was set so that the app never switched to landscape mode even when user rotates the phone Probably because originally we were not saving webviews state and then restoring it This might have caused the webview to reload the app from scratch and not preserve where user was in the app Since the state saving and restoring was added some time ago This now works smoothlyish even after we remove that flag which sets it to portraitonly One problem that happens is that user is initially greeted with the splashscreen on rotating the device until the webpage loads Related Tickets Documents ScreenshotsRecordings if there are UI changes There are UI changes but the Android screen capture doesnt correctly pickup the orientation change so not posting any Since there are no UI changes inside the app it has just started functioning in landscape mode too now optional What gif best describes this PR or how it makes you feel Dog happily typing on laptop Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I was actually on my bed upside down and I tried viewing an article on my phone on landscape mode and it just didnt work That was not cool Describe the solution youd like I would like to be able to view articles on landscape mode the same way it is been done on the PWA Describe alternatives youve considered The only alternative was using the PWA which works fine Additional context I would suggest
