PREP changes the option file to optionsavetwofiles disabled but its not changed back when it is done num str must have a numerical input in some versions of matlab Line causing error Warning The following error was caught while executing onCleanup class destructor Error using restoreEEGOptions line Cannot restore EEG options No matching files were found Backup options file C Users KAYROB AppData Local Temp eegoptionsbackupm Current options file C Users Kay Robbins eegoptionsm Error in prepPipelinecleanup line restoreEEGOptionsbackupFile currentFile Error in prepPipelinecleanupbackupOptionsFilecurrentOptionsFilewarningsState line finishup onCleanup cleanupbackupOptionsFile currentOptionsFile Error in onCleanupdelete line htask Error in prepPipeline line computationTimes struct detrend lineNoise reference Error in level StudycreateLevel Study line EEG computationTimes prepPipelineEEG params Error in runESSLARGPrepPipelineNoInterpolation line obj createLevel Studyess Dir forceRedo false In prepPipeline line In level StudycreateLevel Study line In runESSLARGPrepPipelineNoInterpolation line Hi as far as I could see it there is currently no way to add back the online reference during the pipeline In order to base the average reference on N onlineRef channels I simply added onlineRef to paramsreferenceChannels and entering N in paramsevaluationChannels onlineRef is just a vector of zeros The pipeline stopped with a matrix dimension mismatch error This was because PREP checks also referenceChannels to be usable in findUnusableChannelssignal referenceOutreferenceChannels which is a good idea but will at the end produce the error when reindexing channels that are not bad and one or more reference channels that are found to be bad but do not occur in evaluation channel list signaldatatargetChannels signaltempdatareindex line of interpolateChannels I think simply replacing referenceChannels by evaluationChannels in findUnusableChannels is not a good idea as the reference signal should be clean Is there another to do it Best Norman If reference or earlier step fails postprocessing should not occur This must be fixed Also structure has both postprocess and postProcess fields Simple fix for having the Cancel button do nothing instead of opening the save dialog If accepted you could also change the documentation that led me to propose this fix Each button allows you to override the default parameters When you press the Ok button or unfortunately the Cancel button PREP runs Use the x button on the upper right to quit without running the pipeline
