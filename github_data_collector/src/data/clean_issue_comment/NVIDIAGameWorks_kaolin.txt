Currently the DIBR only returns the differentiable color and mask I wonder how to get depth from it Signedoffby Zheng Qin clavichord hotmailcom Currently threeinterpolategrad calls threeinterpolatekernellauncher which is a bug This PR fixes this problem by calling threeinterpolategradkernellauncher instead This PR is duplicated with but is signed Please close the old one As a proof of concept I rendered an object in blender and reused the same object position and camera parameters to render an image in Blender I tried to regress a texture in both Lambertian and VertexColor modes directly without any networks It seems like in VertexColor mode the colors are jumping in large steps and in the Lambertian mode there are stuck pixels despite perfect object alignment This is slightly concerning as an experiment using neural mesh the colors change very smoothly GIFs of the optimization using DIBR SteveJunGao TommyX wenzhengchen is this the correct behavior Signedoffby Avik Pal avikpaliitkacin Does the present version of Kaolin works on a non GPU based Linux System If not is it planned to be supported I tried to run kalvisualizeshow on the server but it seems not working So is there an alternative way like saving the rendered images this should be inpvoxels Hi I cant find your Atlasnet implementation Could you point me to it Thanks Lucas The default pytorch collate function cannot deal with pathlib objects For this reason substituted them with their string representations in the output dicts
