you add tests for your changes Nope Note that we wont merge your changes if you dont add tests Does this PR introduce a breaking change Nope If this PR introduces a breaking change please describe the impact and a migration path for existing applications What needs to be documented once your changes are merged Nothing List all the information that needs to be added to the documentation after merge When your changes are merged you will be asked to contribute this to the documentation Please dont delete this template because well close your issue Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of webpack Bug report Please ask questions on StackOverflow or the webpack Gitter Issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed What is the current behavior If you have two entries one for your worker and another one for your main file where code is shared between those two and if you use split chunks so that shared code is split in a different file the worker hangs undefinetely because simply the common file cannot be loaded and there is no way for it to be loaded Using import is not a good alternative as you lose the type definitions which means you are forced to create some nullloader for the type definitions or some custom definition file which is really not good at all Also you need a hack to even make it work which is not optimal Not to add it depends on Promises and code in common usually includes the promises polyfill since you are within a worker that shouldnt be an issue but still not optimal If the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce Create a project with two entries Load a second entry as a worker It will hang forever A great way to do this is to provide your configuration via a GitHub repository The most helpful is a minimal reproduction with instructions on how to reproduce Repositories with too many files or large webpackconfigjs files are not suitable Please only add small code snippets directly into this issue is a good place for longer code snippets If your issue is caused by a plugin or loader please create an issue on the loaderplugin repository instead What is the expected behavior You should be able to use of importScripts if you are inside a worker you should specify if an entry should use importScripts to fullfill its imports OR You should be able to inject the code required for initialization selfimportScriptsdistbuildcommonjs just the same that you would do by adding it in the DOM eg by using an injection file instead that would be bundled but wont hang that file would execute importScripts just as in the normal DOM available version you would create a script with the commons file AND You shouldnt depend on the DOM for dynamic imports if importScripts is available it should be used instead It should work is not a helpful explanation Explain exactly how it should behave Other relevant information webpack version Nodejs version

Please ask questions on StackOverflow or the webpack Gitter Issues which contain questions or support requests will be closed What is the current behavior I have a win and a freebsd as a dev servers i use win to edit code it mounts the project root folder from freebsd via samba I have to use freebsd because it performs much better for php postgresql application but im not suitable to edit php vue files under freebsd terminal I really cant leave win as daily use and editing code and kde or gnome are really not good enough Now when i change some vue code in win editor and save i see the change is reflected in freebsd server and npm noticed there is change i see it recompiled but the page in my browser is not reflected of the change in chrome dev console i see the keepalive webpackhmrclient request has the output too but it only has meaningful output for the first change made by win further files changes on win are not reflected in browser anymore it has meaningless output for further changes like this h ac a ebf ba bb c If i hadnt made changes via win editor after npm server started every single change made by vi editor under freebsd are reflected in npm and browser But after i change the file in win then it only works for the first time change further change dont work anymore it dont work even if i go back to freebsd change the file therenpm failed to notice the change made by vi editor Refresh the page doesnt help Only restart npm helps If the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce create a nuxt app in freebsd and install the samba server configure the app root directory to be able for win to connect to start npm in freebsd change the files in win after mounting the samba directory A great way to do this is to provide your

repository instead What is the expected behavior every change to sambamounted file made via win editor should be reflected in browser without page refresh not producing meaningless ajax content by HMR

if this feature need to be implemented in a plugin or loader instead If yes file the issue on the pluginloader repo Features related to the development server should be filed on this repo instead What is the expected behavior When running wepack allow for dev to set path to the webpackprogress file What is motivation or use case for addingchanging the behavior In our release and build servers we run webpack webpack mode production progress for many different projects The issue is that all projects are built using their own user for security reasons When webpack runs with user foo a file tmpwebpackprogress is created ownd by foo When the next project us built by user bar that user has no permissions for the file and the build failes with Error EACCES permission denied open tmpwebpackprogress Without knowing exactly what this file does and Google has not been of much help there seems to be a need for allowing us to set the file path name of wepbackprogress Alternatively the file name could be appended with something project specific How should this be implemented in your opinion Some configurable flag Are you willing to work on this yourself sadly no
