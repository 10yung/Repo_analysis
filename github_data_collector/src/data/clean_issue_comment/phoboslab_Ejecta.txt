Hello Is Ejecta still supported in and does it support tvOS Thank you in advance Is it possible to create a container html element so that I can integrate D html I believe I did setup everything correctly apart from Paid Apps Agreements Tax Billing According to stackoverflow this is the reason why testing IAP on sandbox user is not working I think it would be wise to give any information to the developer why the request is failing Ive debugged the native part of the binding and the productsRequest callback method or rather delegate Im new to objc is never called Following stackoverflow further Ive added this piece of code to the implementation of EJBindingIAPManager voidrequestSKRequest request didFailWithErrorNSError error NSLogIAP request didFailWithError error userInfo objectForKeyNSLocalizedDescription But it still gives me nothing I have single log in the xcode console apart from IAP Requesting product info fvvextraTime I think there should be a developer friendly message send to the js regardless of what kind of error happens whether its the developer not setting up thing correctly or apple server not responding in time Right now youd have to timeout the request by hand on js side and show generic error to the user What would be the way to catch all request errors in this situation I just started learning objc yesterday so I feel a bit lost Hello I know theres an issue from about that As I understand it was just after iOS release with performance improvements that made Ejecta seem obsolete But there is one issue SafariWKWebViewCordova games on LPM Low Power Mode are limited to fps on iOS even if you have one rotating sprite on the screen It took me about a day to figure how to port my pixijs Cordovawrapped game to Ejecta and with some finishing touches Im gonna be pushing it to AppStore review tomorrow Im getting fps on LPM with Ejecta on iPhone rather than and its not very optimised game I believe and therefore has weird framedrops Im gonna let you know whether Ejecta is valid in from my perspective later whether it will pass the review and Ill get steady fps with Ejecta but Im interested to know is anyone else actually still using this technology Or does anyone know any better solution It seems like it has been abandoned around but right now from my perspective it looks like its the only sane way to make iOS games that run fps on LPM phoboslab what is your opinion on this Would you consider maintaining the project if it turns out to be the best solution the LPM problem With iPhones becoming more and more performant lack of JIT in Ejecta becomes less of an issue BTW I know there is cocos dxcreator egret engine etc and ofc cordova Ive inspected those and Ejecta the most appealing solution IMO right now BTW Im using webpacktypescriptpixi and legacy coffeescript for this project if anyones curious Its a very smooth development experience so far I really appreciate all the work put into Ejecta If I set the font on a D canvas using something like ctxfont pt Helvetica Neue Then the weight part of the string is misinterpreted as pt and the facename is ignored See the code on line of EJBindingCanvasContext Dm Adding support for this will also require that the weight is incorporated into the fonts hash calculated on line of EJFontmm too I am using stream in my weex project the apps crash everytime I try to run it on iOS simulator It works fine on android though If I comment out the stream code viz commenting the code where I am using stream and import is still uncommented the application works fine on both the platform Considering that stream code is working fine on android concludes that there is nothing wrong with my Vue code maybe I am not doing some iOS specific thingy Here is the code streamfetch method GET type json url res ifresok thisisLoading false thisisError false thisnumber resdatanumber thisname resdataname else thisisLoading false thisisError true The error which I get is on the following line callbackRsp setObject OPENED forKeyreadyState progressCallbackcallbackRsp TRUE The error is Thread EXCBADACCESS code address x Occuring on progressCallback line What I can think of is that it could be because of some package which I need to install or maybe version number of something is messed up because on playground it is working absolutely fine Any help would greatly appreciated Hi Im going to build an iOS app with nativescript and I want to use ejecta in my app but how can I import ejecta into nativescript iOS latest Ejecta Console errors I am getting in Xcode IAP Restore transactions JS ERROR Error restoring purchases Cannot connect to iTunes Store IAP Requesting product info fullgame IAP Purchase fullgame x JS ERROR Error buying product Cannot connect to iTunes Store Has anyone tested IAPs with Ejecta and iOS yet I would love to help in any way I can I just want to know if I am doing something wrong or if an API changed For reference I am using SplatJS game engine and the part of Splat that references Ejectas IAP API is here Adding support for Path D would be extremely useful for reusing complex paths instead of creating them on the fly each time we want them drawn Hello OpenAL can not set currentTime in milliseconds Because ALSECOFFSET is set in currentTime and setCurrentTime in EJAudioSourceOpenALm floatcurrentTime float time alGetSourcef sourceId ALSECOFFSET time return time voidsetCurrentTimefloattime alSourcef sourceId ALSECOFFSET time I want to set currentTime in milliseconds So Id like to change the code as follows floatcurrentTime float time alGetSourcef sourceId ALSAMPLEOFFSET time return time voidsetCurrentTimefloattime alSourcef sourceId ALSAMPLEOFFSET time What do you think of the code above Please comment it BTW since I am not familiar with OpenAL I do not know how to obtain sampling rate or monaural stereo from the current context sorry Thanks
