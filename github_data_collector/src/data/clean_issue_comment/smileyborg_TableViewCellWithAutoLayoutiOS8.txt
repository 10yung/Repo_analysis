 Hi Im working with UITableview for chat application its working very well in update and insert cell but when scroll the tableview bottom to top tableview cell jerking and no smoothly scrolling Note Im not using storyboard and ive used to custom cells Objective c So Please any solution Regards Do I was doing some testing with landscape mode on the iPhone X simulator which is why I revisited this project after a long time Not sure if youll care about this PR but I did a quick port of the codebase up to Swift Xcode I also did an additional port to Swift Xcode which is in a different branch Hope it helps Ive turned bodyLabels class UILabel into UIButtonAs you can see in pic pic As you know UIButton also has its intrinsic content size just like UILabel I just want to have the cells subviews exert pressure and make the content view expand to fit them But the cell height became same and of course went wrongAs you can see in pic and pic Can anybody tell me why and what should I do to solve this problem pic pic pic pic pic pic I could not find a license Is it possible to write a license I am working on iOS app in which i have very large data to be loaded in UITableView After reloading the UITableView with section it only loading limited number of rows and section I have to scroll to particular contentOffset of UITableView Set content offset only supported by very limited number of cell Fix Xcode selector error and swift warnings When using your demo as is with current Xcode and eg iOS Simulator iPad Air on iOS B the margins are wrong compared to the separator insets img width altscreenshot src After trying this I used the nib instead and made the following adjustments as you had hardcoded points as margins which should work CellIdentifier Preserve Superview margins checked Content View Preserve Superview margins checked LeadingTrailing Constraints Each leadingtrailing set to constant but pinned to superviews margin instead of superview Expected Margins automatically adjusted Actual img width altscreenshot src img width altscreenshot src I am trying this for about a week do you know of any official way to get the margins right with iOS and Btw Margins are broken when used in Form Sheets with iPhone in Landscape with iOS x too they differ from the separator insets as well Any idea When I set the vertical insets to some higher value the contraints of the UITableViewCell break Not shure what is causing it It seems to be the size of cells content view But leveraging that size upwards doest lead to a solution TableViewCellWithAutoLayout Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you dont want Try this look at each constraint and try to figure out which you dont expect find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it NSLayoutConstraint x e V UILabel x e Thonburi Names UITableViewCellContentView x d fc NSLayoutConstraint x da a V UILabel x e Thonburi UILabel x d b c Lorem ipsum dolor sit ame NSLayoutConstraint x da bc UILabel x d b c Lorem ipsum dolor sit amebottom UITableViewCellContentView x d fc bottom NSLayoutConstraint x e fa UIViewEncapsulatedLayoutHeight V UITableViewCellContentView x d fc Will attempt to recover by breaking constraint NSLayoutConstraint x da a V UILabel x e Thonburi UILabel x d b c Lorem ipsum dolor sit ame
