for all animations which support rightleft eg SlideInLeft and SlideInRight there should be a variation for startend eg SlideInEnd and SlideInStart to support righttoleft layouts I am getting this error when I use animation to show a view how do I fix it I use this code for add view to main activity View add GinflaterinflateRlayoutloading parent true contentLoading addfindViewByIdRidcontentLoading YoYowithTechniquesRubberBand onStartanimatorcontentLoadingsetVisibilityViewVISIBLE duration playOncontentLoading But contentLoading animation is wrong and not work correct when I use the method onEnd or onStart and so on YoYoAmimationComposer will add a callback in callbacks which maybe cause the risk of memory leak In my opinion We could add a method means removeListenerAfterEnd or other to remove callback in callbacks what do you think I tried using interpolator but it has no effect using compile is going to be obsolete and I felt this library is very useful so it should be implemented with new gradle standard of implementation view viewsetVisibilityViewVISIBLE YoYowithTechniquesSlideOutUpduration onEndnew YoYoAnimatorCallback Override public void callAnimator animator viewsetVisibilityViewINVISIBLE playOnview
