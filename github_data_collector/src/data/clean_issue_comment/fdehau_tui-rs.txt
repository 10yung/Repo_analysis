Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I would like to declare constants for a few styles which could then be used everywhere easily rust const SOMESTYLE Style Stylenew fgColorRed bgColorBlue modifierModifierDIM Currently I have to utilize the lazystatic crate for that Describe the solution youd like Adding const to Stylefg Stylebg Stylemodifier and adding a pub const fn new Self which does the same as Styledefault would allow that Describe alternatives youve considered lazystatic which is unnecessary overhead I already tested my solution and could assemble a PR This adds the option to have a selected item in a Table which can be highlighted with a style and symbol a parallel feature with the SelectableList type The constructor was not changed to avoid breaking existing code Selectability can be configured using the builder pattern as is common in the rest of the code base asciicast Addresses Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Ive been using tuirs to work on bottom and one of my graphs is set to take up of the terminal height and the terminal width Its legend contains only entries On full screen its fine the chart label will show and all is good However shrinking to half width or half height seems to prove to be too much and will hide the legend despite plenty of room remaining Describe the solution youd like Unless theres a reason Im missing I think it would be nice to increase the threshold that triggers legends to not be drawn In chartrs I see that youre currently setting the threshold to be of the graphs layout Would it be possible to increase it or would probably still work IMO Ive used a fork of this project and set it to that and it seems fine but I would personally prefer it if it was in the main project or at least get an explanation to why it isnt possible to do so Describe alternatives youve considered For some components Ive just moved them out of the chart into their own sections In most cases this is fine for example with CPU displays it makes more sense to put them as their own separate table of entries since high core count CPUs are more common and cramming legend entries into a chart is a bad idea However in my earlier case it just makes little sense to allocate an entire table chunk just for measily entries especially when the graph has plenty of room Additional context Heres an example of full screen working fine Half width hides it already Thanks None None I am rendering cpu and memory events and would like them to stream in from the right to the left However if I populate the dataset by appending new events to the end the data doesnt always fill the screen since the data size does not necessarily match the final width of the rendered box This allows rendering the elements from starting from the right with left to right remaining the default Closes This commit only adds support for linecharts for the braille marker Fixes issue Changed the default key on userinput example to Esc rather than q to prevent the program from quitting when users enter a word that contains q Describe the bug Trivial issue the userinput example uses q as the exit key so you cant type anything with the letter q Maybe make the exit character esc or Ctrlc Wouldnt hurt to do the same in other examples To Reproduce cargo run example userinput type a word with q like quintessence Expected behavior The input is accepted Desktop OS Linux Terminal Emulator xfce terminal Font Monofur nerd font mods Crate version Backend termion Additional context Id be happy to make a PR with this change and to the other examples if youd like Describe the solution youd like It would be nice if tuirs provides a terminal widget where i can create a tmuxlike interface
