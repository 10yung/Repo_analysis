Could you tell me why I need to input two kinds of images in DemoTWSCSigmaRWCC mWhat do they represent What is the meaning of info boundingboxes I try to run the code in matlab abut there is a question Functions cannot be indexed using or Indexes in the code of for j sizeinfo boundingboxes Thank you I have a question that where the InoisySRGB comes from in hwch sizeInoisySRGBCould you help me solve it Do we need to set parameters inDemoTWSCSigmaAWGN Hi Xu Im now working on sparse coding image denoising however I find that in your program Parlambda is always set to which means you actually dont use ADMM to find the sulotion So the function you define in the papar has the close form solution and it can be simply solved by a softthresholding operation Therefore the weights W and W do not actually affect the solution and W only benefits the aggregation process Im not sure whether my above understanding is correct or not Thank you can you give a quick test instructions
