 What were you doing After a SD card crash I finally got round to upgrading to the lates release but noticed that my Logitech Pro didnt work What did you expect to happen Of course I expected the webcam stream to show What happened instead but it only ever keeps displaying this for hours on end Did the same happen when running OctoPrint in safe mode Yes just the same Version of OctoPi Im running on a RPi B Printer model used firmware incl version although irrelevant for the issue at hand Creality CR Screenshotsvideos showing the problem see What happened instead I have read the FAQ

the print but the printer freezes in place for a split second then it moves then repeats When I print from the printers sd card it never do this The image did not come with pip so I am unable to install plugins I can no longer flash with the plugin FirmwareUpdater because the Raspbian image that changes up how the pi reads USBs see here Please be as specific as possible here The maintainers

with the right device name which confirms that both the cable and the printer USB interface works When connecting a USB keyboard to the Pi the device is listed with dmesg which tells me that the Pi

problem If applicable Always include if unsure or reporting UI issues I have read the FAQ Platform Raspberry PI with PI NOIR running latest RC image What is the problem minor BUG camera LED does not light when in use on PI I have observed this on both the the last two image build the only ones I have run What did you already try to solve it Testing on PI B builds the LED lights normally Logs Not applicable Additional Info I use OctoPi to control my D printer A Pi Noir attached to the bed is used to monitor the print job I have been using a Raspberry PI B for this purpose but I just switched to a Raspberry PI I notice that after boot on the B the LED light on the camera comes on This is handy I know that I am booted and ready to go On the PI the LED never comes on Does the PI handle the camera LED differently than the B In other words should the LED behave the same way whichever board is used To be sure this is a minor problem but the LED is a useful status indicator that shows the PI is up and running What were you doing I was attempting to boot my Raspberry Pi B computer like I do every morning Its important to note that this is a problem thats related to both rebooting long delays at the end as well as a freeze during the first boot of the day which is significant Three minutes on this line as its shutting down prior to rebooting restore save the current clock Stuck on this line during the first boot of the day but its probably the next line thats freezing since this one indicated OK OK Started dphysswapfile set up mountunmount and delete a swap file I note that this occurs more often when Ive connected an Ethernet cable as well This may be significant What did you expect to happen I expected a standard boot to service and I expected that there wouldnt be any unnecessarilylong delays in a reboot What happened instead First boot of the morning seems to require at least one reboot all this week for example Did the same happen when running OctoPrint in safe mode NA Version of OctoPi Printer model used firmware incl version Smoothieboard xC Marlin but its not pertinent here Screenshotsvideos showing the problem I have read the FAQ Troubleshooting Ive literally spent hours chasing this down It seems like the fakehwclock in Raspbian tries to checkandsave the current time at shutdown This appears to be the reason for the minute delay sometimes I ran date and note that the time is sometimes as much as seconds off from the time on my MacBook I ran sudo timedatectl setntp True thinking that it might be turned off but I dont think that this has changed anything The default file seen here is part of the OctoPi image cat etcsystemdtimesyncdconf Time NTP FallbackNTP debianpoolntporg debianpoolntporg debianpoolntporg debianpoolntporg RootDistanceMaxSec PollIntervalMinSec PollIntervalMaxSec Does this mean that its not configured I did a manual timedatectl adjustsystemclock and the clock appears to be closer to reality And now Ive just run date again and its slow by minutes grrr Im currently on wifi only for what its worth Ive just now added sbiniptables t mangle I POSTROUTING o wlan p udp dport j TOS settos x before the final line of etcrclocal and rebooted Its still about seconds slow right now after the reboot so I dont think that was the problem What were you doing Connected Ziggi HD webcam UVC it works but when i attempt to control autofocus via ucvdynctrl What did you expect to happen Should have been able to adjust the focus of the webcam What happened instead it ends up in a loop because v l is buggy actual term used in the error Did the same happen when running OctoPrint in safe mode was in SSH to terminal Version of OctoPi OctoPi Printer model used firmware incl version NA Screenshotsvideos showing the

to fix it and that is not possible if they dont know what you did to get it to happen in the first place Ideally provide exact steps to follow in order to reproduce your problem Original issue created here it was closed because its a Octopi issue not Octoprint Already tested this on a new instalation with no plugins installed And NTP is working pioctopiender timedatectl status Local time Sun WEST Universal time Sun UTC RTC time na Time zone EuropeLisbon WEST Network time on yes NTP synchronized yes RTC in local TZ no Cut power off from raspberry pi without using the Shutdown system from UI wait something like or min Boot up raspberry pi Check octoprintlog the timestamp will be equal or INFERIOR at timestamp before shutdown octoprintlog seriallog syslog If you encountered a problem with specific files of any sorts make sure to also include a link to a file with which to reproduce the problem What did you expect to happen I wold expect octoprint to wait for NTP sync but I already understod it may not be possible I already understood too because raspberry pi has not hardware clock with battery is not possible to maintain the clock updated at start up only after online sync with NTP server But I wold expect to at least the time stamp wont be inferior to the one at shutdown For example at octoprint startup with a timestamp smaller than before shutdown What happened instead Some times the boot up timestamp is inferior to shutdown timestamp Did the same happen when running OctoPrint in safe mode Yes Test if you can reproduce your problem in safe mode You can find

Like many of us Im trying to work with Python to make sure that my plugins will weather the test of time So I setup a standard OctoPiimaged rig then basically mv oprint oprintpy virtualenv p python oprint source oprintbinactivate pip install upgrade pip pip install ERROR Package OctoPrint requires a different Python not in Interesting fact For whatever reasons Ive gone through this routine perhaps five times already testing different scenarios and saving each to their own microSD Request What might be nice is a turnkey OctoPi image which pulls the latest Buster Lite as well as the latest OctoPrint rcsomething from the devel branch In theory it would still have the classic oprint as the virtual environment location just with Python instead of Py throughout Kudos if its Pi friendly So basically and with some instructions for how to pull this one would Use Etcher to pull from some URL this IMG Do the standard bootoctopiwpasupplicanttxt thing Boot it up Remoting in would reveal a vanilla OctoPrint installation just now Python savvy I would suggest that this would benefit people in the plugin development space in the interim period before OP is released What did you expect to happen Id forgotten that we dont get Python support until which isnt released to master yet But I suppose I naively expected this to work What happened instead The scenario requires the wouldbe tester to be able to install some asyetreleased OctoPrint version on the devel branch Did the same happen when running OctoPrint in safe mode NA Version of OctoPi Presumably it would have been at that point for OctoPrint and this would have been the daily build which includes Buster Printer model used firmware incl version NA Screenshotsvideos showing the problem NA I have read the FAQ
