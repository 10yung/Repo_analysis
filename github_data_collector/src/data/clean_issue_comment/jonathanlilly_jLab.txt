Hi Jonathan Nice package and thanks for sharing your MATLAB code I am trying to install jLab but the jlabaddpathm seems to want to add a jdata module that I dont have installed Do you know where I can install this jdata module I see hints of it in the documentation but cannot find a git repository that seems to contain this module Jake Line of matsave load the just saved matlab structure but this command on line fails if the current folder contains a space in its name It happens in my case because my entire working directory is within the directory called Box Sync which is setup by the software Box something similar to Dropbox I actually have a symbolic link for Box Sync which has no space but the pwd command of Matlab returns the target not the name of the link just a tiny typo This change is needed otherwise you cannot set the length of the colormap
