Changes pretifier the code added includesexcludesmapping CLI options added androidx webkit package processing added ability to verbose CLI actions It seems that this library by design reads java files xml files and kotlin files but not buildgradlefiles This causes my project to not convert properly since I have the following modules that arent updated reactnativecrossgeolication implementation comandroidsupportappcompatv supportLibVersion reactnativemaps implementation comandroidsupportappcompatv safeExtGetsupportLibVersion reactnativecamera implementation comandroidsupportexifinterfacesafeExtGetsupportLibVersion implementation comandroidsupportsupportannotationssafeExtGetsupportLibVersion implementation comandroidsupportsupportv safeExtGetsupportLibVersion The refactoring tool in Android Studio catches these and changes the files respectively to reactnativecrossgeolication implementation androidxappcompatappcompatsupportLibVersion reactnativemaps implementation androidxappcompatappcompat beta reactnativecamera implementation androidxexifinterfaceexifinterface beta implementation androidxannotationannotation beta implementation androidxlegacylegacysupportv beta I can of course manually run the refactoring tool in Android Studio when required but maybe theres a way to make this tool handle these cases as well after a yarn command I execute on postInstall npx jetify I get no errors but npx never ends After waiting minutes I had to cut it No error or logs I have installed npx globally What am I doing wrong Thanks jetifxy android this could help reactnative bridge package maintainers to easily transform their libraries it would be cool to run jetify on all nodemodules of a yarn monorepo
