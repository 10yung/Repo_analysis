I previously wrote about incorporation with the Spender modified hardened fork of Cuckoo You guys amazingly got this to integrate so it could directly import into threatnote Today I received a rather malicious URL phish through Skype antiVM analysis delay reaching out over Eastern Europe the works a real indicator goldmine The modified fork allows the analysis of URLs PCAPs and Quarantine files some of these features are also now in the Cuckoo release Would it be possible for threatnote to import from alternate streams in Cuckoo modified As best as I can tell it only imports from jobs which are uploaded binaries not URL analysis or PCAP analysis Theres a lot of data Ive got to manually enter at the moment as it wont import due to the type of analysis Cheers BG What are my options for using SSL Is there a way to restrict the register function so its not available to all users Also is there a way to centrally manage users access Is there a way to export indicators to a CSV I can see API key provided in the profile page how is that usable can API be used for import export or search functionality Can we have API documentation the link is broken Great update but miss the search function Would be great to have it back It doesnt seem like the entry for Threat Actor is for email addresses I think a dedicated Object Type would be handy for this Hi what about moving settings to an external file Its a good practice and simplifies configuration Other settings eg db file should ideally be moved there as well After creating a domain indicator for a host in the ru TLD we receive an error when clicking on the new indicator Threat Note errors out with merely country including quotes and the little ambulance icon Other TLDs com it cn all work fine The happens on both the ru indicators I have in my database Threat Note is up to date Can there be a way to integrate into a slack team to allow the automatic tracking of items shared in a team
