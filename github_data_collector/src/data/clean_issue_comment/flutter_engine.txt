Add width and height trace parameters to VulkanSurfacePoolGetCachedOrCreateSurface and VulkanSurfacePoolCreateSurface Also add an allocationSize parameter to the vkAllocateMemory event In Linux we are using the felt tool for preparing the environment to run feltdart This batch script does the similar operations for window Such as running gclient sync gn ninja pub get When running on Fuchsia respect the argument values that Skia passes into the Flutter implementation of the SkEventTracer interface Bug Previously layout had been using the cluster index returned by Minikin which is only unique within each call to Minikin layout This can produce duplicate cluster IDs within a line containing multiple text runs GetGlyphPositionAtCoordinate then returns incorrect results because it thinks the affected glyphs are part of the same cluster Fixes Fixes This removes logs such as and will route flutter logs to fuchsia syslog klog INFO WARNINGsrcsysappmgrserviceproviderdirimplcc Component fuchsiapk gfuchsiacomflutterjitproductrunnermetaflutterjitproductrunnercmx is not allowed to connect to fuchsialo ggerLogSink because this s klog INFO ervice is not present in the components sandbox klog INFO Refer to for more information This can be used to evaluate smoothness of touch input processing Work In Progress PR still requires tests Details flutterflutter From the Instruments we found that the UI GPU thread run in a low priority which may often be preempted by other thread and take less CPU time For example The UI thread running time is s but the preempted time is s According to the Apple documentation the UI and GPU thread should be assigned to Userinteractive while the current QoS is Default In addition when the platform view is enabled the GPU task runner is same as the platform task runnerSo we should not create another GPU thread As an alternative to the data buffers a path to an ELF library can be provided to reuse the existing vm ELF loader Work towards providing release mode for linux and windows Caveats I dont have any tests yet Im unsure whether we should expose the current settings which allows providing a vector of various search paths currently it is just char Fixes cc ankitdave This still needs a test but working when tested manually Im a little torn on whether my defensive guards around cycles are overlypessimistic The framework should never allow this to happen but if it does happen the engine will crash with a stack overflow and the engine API has no asserts in place to check it otherwise Fixes
