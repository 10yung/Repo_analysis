Im working on an application involving heavy amounts of GeoJSON and GIS data Id be interested to know if its possible to add spatialite and GIS focused querying to WatermelonDB Id of course handle the implementation interested in where I would start and if Nozbe thinks its even possible Suggests its possible to add extend Sqlite with Spatialite but I know there would be additional work involved I have used this awesome library in react Getting this error Unhandled Promise Rejection DataCloneError The object can not be cloned When i am using this library in Safari in an iframe Below are the logs from the console DB Worker Initializing IndexedDB Error Diagnostic error SecurityError IDBFactoryopen called in an invalid security context diagnosticError indexjs logError indexjs Try Catch

altScreenshot at PM src Error is on this line thisworkerContextpostMessage type type payload payload Safari is not able to convert the payload Any ideas how to fix this Thanks in advance Greetings Ive encountered problems with Redux with collections of tens of thousands of objects The weakest part of ReduxAsyncStorage I guess is the RN bridge and state persistence When the state grows to Mb of serialized JSON the whole app starts to choke on each state change Android platform shows the worst performance Ive tried different persistance modules all the same So Im looking for a replacement The code base is quite big and Ive used reduxsaga extensively Is it possible to use WatermelonDB with reduxreduxsaga side by side without rewriting everything from the scratch Are there any pitfalls Id like to migrate some parts of the app to the new framework gradually Thanks Hi as promised in hereby I provide a pull request for encrypted databases on android Its tested cicheck and in a test project and working Nevertheless I want to address some things It works with or without password but in all of the cases its using another SQLite implementation for android In my tests it works perfect but I wanted to tell you The new library requires to be mentioned in the licenses see I did not change documentation at all Its up to you where to mention this The password can be simply set in the SQLiteAdapter new SQLiteAdapter schema defaultSchema dbName myDB password ABC If none is given the DB is not encrypted Quite easy and backwards compatible I adjusted the iOS methods accordingly to be the same as in Android The parameter password is given there as well but simply not used I think this makes sense for possible future changes also there Feel free to change what you want I hope its a valuable contribution and I would look forward to be mentioned in the contributors section but of course thats not a must Best regards Andreas I ran into this while trying to migrate my project to watermelonDB when attempting to create a record my code let record await dbactionasync record await dbcollectionsgetitemscreater Throws Converting circular structure to JSON starting at object with constructor Item property changes object with constructor BehaviorSubject property value closes the circle I was originally getting this when trying to set my fields so I started commenting code out to narrow it down and with the above call where it assigns to record await seems to be the culprit for unknown reasons If I change the create call to this it works fine await dbactionasync await dbcollectionsgetitemscreater Any ideas why or tips for debugging further Although Im using batching in my code I realized that a lot of actions are queued when it comes to higher load in our react native app Therefore I asked myself if theres a way to flush the action queue I would do the same when the app is sent to the background or requested to quit by the operating system Thanks in advance Andreas I am playing around with the experimentalUseIncrementalIndexedDB true flag for the LokiJSAdapter and first thought that this was flushing my local storage database but interestingly if I disable the flag my data reappears So I assume it creates a second database Is there a way for me to migrate the default IndexedDB to the Incremental one Hey amazing project youve got here I was looking into using this with Expo and saw that it is not possible currently as discussed in However since the architecture with adapters is quite flexible couldnt the bundled native db driver be replaced with the one provided by exposqlite which actually is the same project as That would make WatermelonDB compatible with expo while letting you get rid of the native code parts in the project It could also be added as an additional adapter of course Would this be a possible way forward img width altScreenshot at src Hey I implemented the pattern on how to delete objects exactly like your documentation states it And usually it works but from time to time I receive the error you can see above which really confuses me a lot because I am calling it from inside an action The code you see above isnt called from any other actions its invoked when the user clicks on a delete button
