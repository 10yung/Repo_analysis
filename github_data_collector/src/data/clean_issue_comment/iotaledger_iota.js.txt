behind Greenkeeper details Your Greenkeeper bot palmtree Description The present account module allows to make a payment to a CDA with the sendToCDA method However there is no provision to send a messagevia the message field of the transaction along with the tokens to the CDA Requirements A field in the CDA object to allow sending message to the CDA while making the payment Am I planning to do it myself with a PR Yesbut i need a bit of guidance for the same prepareTransfers doesnt check for Kerl addresses in value transactions only the bundlevalidator does it I need to check if an address was ever withdrawn from Is there a convenient way to do this or do I have to use the httpclient to send the command directly to IRI Thanks Description I noticed that the IOTA Python library has implemented these commands in a none snapshot resistant and none intuitive way To keep the behaviour of the client libraries consistent I tested these commands with the JavaScript library I noticed odd results if a start parameter is given but no end for addresses that have a balance but no transactions due to a snapshot getInputs stops searching at such addresses and does not continue to search for more inputs It certainly would be expected and convenient if it would continue to search for more inputs newAddress returns such an address This is strange because it will not return such an address if there is a balance and a zero value transaction Also I would not consider such an address as new getAccountData stops searching at such an address and does not return the balance This seems like a bug to me It should return the balance and continue searching In my opinion getInputs and getAccountData should stop only if they find an address where it was not spent from and has no balance and has no transaction newAddress should return the first address that was not spent from and has no balance and has no transaction Motivation The methods should work in a consistent and expected way All IOTA libraries should implement it in the same way Am I planning to do it myself with a PR No I want to discuss and clarify how IOTA libraries should implement these methods and implement it that way for the Python library The devDependency typesnock was updated from to This version is not covered by your current version range If you don t accept this pull request your project will work just
