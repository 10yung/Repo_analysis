I just installed the solarized theme doing the registry add first then updated the links then copied the SetSolarizedDarkColorDefaultsps to my profile folder and then added required text to the end of my profile Everything looked great after running OutColors but once I started using it all of the flags for powershell commands are defaulting to the DarkGray for font color This is making it unreadable for me I looked in the SetSolarizedDarkColorDefaultsps but I do not see that being used except for background colors PS C WINDOWS system git tfs clone tfs IntraWebFormsAmexReporting branchesall workspacec repos Hi Command Updatelink is unknown with my PowerShell Any idea I got this error ObjectNotFound UpdateLinkString CommandNotFoundException Adds a Shell parameter to UpdateLink It takes two values Windows is the default and maintains the existing behaviour Unix assigns Solarized colors to the same ANSI color escape codes as the terminal emulator themes linked to from The Unix option allows Solarized themes for Unix tools like work correctly and is designed to be used with Cygwin or WSL After using the light theme enter the following command and the numeric part will not be echoed eg curl fsdexe After upgrade from Windows to the Ubuntu bash reverted to the original colors So I run UpdateLinkcmd C Windows System bashexe light again But it gave me the following

code other cmdcolorssolarized Please see the commit messages Im not sure how we got to this state maybe Windows changed but it seems that the notion of dark flipped on us The original color scheme broke down in the Bash on Ubuntu on Windows terminal as all the colors were mapping to their dark versions which are used as the Solarized background tones This is a workinprogress as Ive only fixed it for the Dark colorscheme so far Ill add screenshots of the before and after and comparison to my MacBook terminal but I wanted to share this early to see if anyone knows why our colors were so off After applying the dark color scheme including the registry update when I open cmd and enter a command then press the up arrow key I only get a blank line and not the last command If I open cmd via WinR everything is working as it should and the colors are still solarized I guess for that case it uses the registry settings and not the updated shortcut lnk I reproduced this on two Windows machines EDIT On PowerShell this problem does not appear When running the script on Windows with the following command UpdateLinkcmd c users admin alias commandlnk light The following error results The term GetLinkps is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet function script file or operable program Check the spelling of the name or if a path was included verify that the path is correct and try again Adding a to the path in UpdateLinkps fixes the issue temporarily lnk PSScriptRoot GetLinkps Path lnk PSScriptRoot GetLinkps Path There is probably a better way of doing this or setting PSScriptRoot to It looks like the color mappings in this repo between powershells colors and ansi color codes do not match those used by powershells virtual terminal system For example when WriteHost ForegroundColor Magenta test is executed powershells virtual terminal emits ESC mtest also known as brmagenta or High Intensity Magenta The mapping in the readme file and code lists the mapping as magenta magenta Below are the correct mappings in full termcol Powershell black Black red DarkRed green DarkGreen yellow DarkYellow blue DarkBlue magenta DarkMagenta cyan DarkCyan white DarkWhite brblack DarkGray brred Red brgreen Green bryellow Yellow brblue Blue brmagenta Magenta brcyan Cyan brwhite White As title indicates the REG files cannot be imported Error is Cannot import xxxxxreg the script file is not a Registry script Only binary archives of Registry can be imported via Registry Editor I open the file with Sublime Text and found it is encoded with UTF with BOM I saved it with UTF without BOM and all is fine It may has something to do with my OS locale Spanish Spain
