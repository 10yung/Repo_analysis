 So after configuring telegram with id and token i get this wierd error not sure if its a server side issue on my side or if it just doesnt want to connect to telegram An error has occurred while sending the Telegram notification Unknown This message appears while im trying to test the connection API is a letters numbers and symbols combination and ChatID is a number configuration right ChatID should be located under user config and API in config if im correct this should be documented more in case i missed something out and i taught it was straight forward this way If there is a log for only the telegram notification i cant find it and log i empty Also the server im running this trough is not on port or in case thats a issue to make this work Ive added the ability to check UDP services just needed to tweak fsockopen since it assumes TCP by default so essentially Ive added a MySQL enum field which defaults to TCP edited the templates added the English localization I was nearly going to implement auto selection by port via javascript but it would be inconvenient to the user if they wanted to override it wrestling with event listeners so I assume TCP by default unless the user overrides it by selecting UDP since most people are monitoring TCP services Let me know if you need more tweaking or suggestions Nayef Resolves Because this raises a warning it wont send a notification Please review Describe the bug For RDP and FTP services got error Connection timed out Could not get headers probably HTTP x error Expected behavior Real state of services expected telnet xxxxxxxxxxxx Trying xxxxxxxxxxxx Connected to xxxxxxxxxxxx Escape character is xxxxxxxxxxxx FTP quit Goodbye Connection closed by foreign host telnet xxxxxxxxxxxx Trying xxxxxxxxxxxx Connected to xxxxxxxxxxxx Escape character is quit telnet Connection closed Desktop please complete the following information Version Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I would like to receive notifications in a federated service such as xmppjabber Describe the solution youd like i just want to implement another notification method cloned from telegram Describe alternatives youve considered i can also use email but i dont see it as often as xmpp i am using telegram but i dont like to use nonopensource proprietary services When updating any information of a server the changes dont register in the database at all With debug on no errors are output nothing comes into the log it comes back to the server list screen but no changes have been made The same happens when addingremoving servers changes arent pushed through to database When editing user accounts or config settings all changes push through fine the cronjob also updates server detail without any issues I also managed to clear the log but there no new log entries after that although Ive done managementconfig changes the cronjob has run and Ive done a manual update within the website PHP v MySQL v PSM v Issue has been happening since ish just ran a full upgrade from there PSM is a great tool but somewhat limited in what it can check and there are lots of requests for new check types certificates etc Also everyones needs are unique when it comes to how exactly checks and alerts should happen It is possible to add custom check for which PSM would run usercreated shell script and update status depending on what it returns It would add a lot of flexibility Certificate checks domain expiration local server state eg low disk space or process not running Then users could share best scripts maybe create library of select ones here It would be easy to adapt existing scripts for use with PSM User uploadscreates shell scripts in dedicated PSM folder When creating new custom check user specifies external script name and expected results OKWarningDown if similar to current website check and timeout PSM runs the script when check happens updates the status according to set parameters ie if script returns code set for warning status is set to Warning if script returns code for down status is set to Down even if it keeps happening continuously If script times out PSM considers check unsuccessful and kills the script If it happens more times than warning threshold then status is set to down PS I saw but in my opinion it is not quite the same I think many users would lack expertise to write custom check methods themselves while various monitoring scripts already exist or can be created more easily When I add a new user it Throws the You cant remove the last administrator error and makes the user an administrator This can be changed back to user afterwards Hi there I would like to monitor Lets Encrypt certs to ensure that websites are loading and displaying correctly Would anyone know how to setup a monitoring service that would trigger an alert if a certificate was not valid failed to auto renew It seems that the standard monitoring still finds the website active with or without a valid certificate as the error warning are browser based and not bot based I presume Any help would be greatly appreciated Brad
