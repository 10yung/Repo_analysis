Pull resquest for Because res was initialized with a size of lenifs the UI displayed empty interfaces When testing low latency lines digits precision is not enough By displaying digits after decimal point ethr latency test helps me to find out some of our switch would incur about us latency Currently unicode network interface name is not displayed correctly Please change the code xoff xoff xoff Thanks a lot iferr Hi I am running a UDP network performance test with ethr The client reports sending speed but the server reports only bitss Why is that UDPTCP ports are open so the traffic should pass The same experiment with HTTP works well I need to know the speed of receiving Server ethr s ports control tcp udp http https RemoteAddress Proto Bitss Conns Pkts Latency UDP UDP UDP UDP UDP UDP UDP UDP UDP UDP Ending Bandwidth test from Client ethr c IP n p udp t b ports control tcp udp http https l KB ID Protocol Interval Bitss UDP sec G UDP sec G UDP sec G UDP sec G UDP sec G UDP sec G UDP sec G UDP sec G UDP sec G UDP sec G Whats the behavior supposed to be for the buffer parameter on a bandwidth test Ive been taking tcpdumps thinking that it would increase the actual packet size but that doesnt seem to be the case My test looks like ethr c ethrserver t b i l mb d s ethr c ethrserver t b i l mb d s ethr c ethrserver t b i l gb d s The packet length ramps up from to and never changes based on what buffer size I give it I saw an issue that was closed Im curious as to how one would go about crafting a packet size or what the buffer size is doing If there is no way to do this would you guys be open to PRs implementing that functionality Thanks hi is it will support QOS traffic later iperf support QOS on linux Q parameter in windows there are another logical for QOS Hello IP version output to display when server side is in use Eg ethr s Accepting IP version ipv Listening on for TCP bandwidth tests Listening on for TCP conns tests Listening on for TCP latency tests Listening on for HTTP bandwidth tests Listening on for HTTPS bandwidth tests Listening on for control plane ethr s Accepting IP version ipv Listening on for TCP bandwidth tests Listening on for TCP conns tests Listening on for TCP latency tests Listening on for HTTP bandwidth tests Listening on for HTTPS bandwidth tests Listening on for control plane ethr s Accepting IP version ipv ipv Listening on for TCP bandwidth tests Listening on for TCP conns tests Listening on for TCP latency tests Listening on for HTTP bandwidth tests Listening on for HTTPS bandwidth tests Listening on for control plane ethr s Accepting IP version ipv ipv Listening on for TCP bandwidth tests Listening on for TCP conns tests Listening on for TCP latency tests Listening on for HTTP bandwidth tests Listening on for HTTPS bandwidth tests Listening on for control plane Can be useful for dropping specified packets from client side Personally after some tests I have ratio of initial connections due to multiple TCP CLOSEWAIT connections hours in ss tunlp output Clients Android Android Pie Server Ubuntu Server Compiled from latest commit a Steps to reproduce Start the server Initialize the first client with ethr c IP p udp Initialize the second client with ethr c IP p r udp second client will print this output panic runtime error invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference signal SIGSEGV segmentation violation code x addr x pc x a e goroutine running mainestablishSession x x e x e x xf x b x f c x fb rootgosrcethrclientgo x a mainrunClient x x e x e x be x x fc bfa xd rootgosrcethrclientgo xc mainmain rootgosrcethrethrgo x Then the server will be waiting forever for the UDP packets One more thing when client sends the UDP packets it will fill the pipe in my case client tried to send Gbit of data in one try Hello Itll be useful to have final extended summary on server and client sides instead of current brief Eg for ethr s Ending Bandwidth test from clientIP Min minvalue Max maxvalue Avg avgvalue Dur duration Eg for ethr c serverIP Ethr done Min minvalue Max maxvalue Avg avgvalue Dur duration Doable Thanks
