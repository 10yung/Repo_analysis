I just did a fresh reinstall of youtubedlgui on Windows using the Windows installer When I try to download a youtube video the status says Finished while Percent says and the file doesnt appear Im guessing that youtubedl is throwing some kind of error which is supressed by youtubedlgui I recommend that you dont supress errors like this so that the user has some chance to fix them I used the newest version but it does not work with a single private video in a playlist Instead the complete playlist will be downloaded but if I modify the URL and want a single video this wont download Tartube is a fork of youtubedlgui Tartube is still being actively developed so if you have a feature request bug report and if you dont want to wait for work on youtubedlgui to resume then you should consider opening an issue on the link above I might be able to help you MrS m n there are some issues about language available in the installer and GUI vs the number of languages available in github repository The language availble in GUi are ARSAczCZenUSesESfrFRitITjaJPkoKRptBRruRU For me the same number of languages should be availble in Installer languages now are but are really DE not ncessary GUI languages now are only GUI vs github languages available After run the installer I checked that csCSitITjaJP languages are not included in GUI Please update the instalelr to include CZITJP languages in GUI Installer language vs Gihub languages available ArabicItalianPortuguese BrasilianRussian are missing as instalelr language Pelase add them German installer language is not useful because there is no deDE GUI interface MrS m n Please merge it Id like to be able to download portions of a video instead of an entire video For example if a video on YouTube I wanted to download was minutes long Id like to be able to be able download only the part of that video say from the minute and seconds to say the minute and second mark Would someone be able to incorporate these two into Youtubedl x I think my problem is NOT with youtubedl x Ive verified and i assure that Im running youtubedlgui x I assure that i am using the latest version of youtubedl x Searched bugtracker x Ive read the FAQs file What is the purpose of your issue x Bug report Feature request request for a new functionality Question Other Bug report What operating system do you use Windows List of actions to perform to reproduce the problem Open Options Click the Filename format dropdown Select Custom Specify a custom file format Click Close button What is the expected behavior There should only be a custom file format set What happens instead Setting a custom file format wipes out all the preset provided file formats and makes them the same as my custom file format So for example if I click the dropdown for file format and pick Title ID it is now the same string as my custom format I am using the Portable version of youtubedlgui Even if I completely delete the folder the application is in and unzip a fresh copy of it the formats are still wiped when I start the application This takes away the ability to look at the preprovided formats and use them as a base for building custom formats
