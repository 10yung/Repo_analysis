My usage of ffsend is to quickly send archives from the CLI To that end would it be possible to make ffsend upload the default action so that we can just write ffsend file to upload the file An apt repository for those using a Debianbase distribution who dont use snap would be great Since packages are already been generated for other platforms perhaps a tool like fpm could be used to convert to the other Guides exist to walk through the setting up of an apt repo too though of course the apache server doesnt have to be used another or a preexisting server can be used instead Thank you for your effort on this amazing tool However ffsend is not working behind HTTP proxy environment D ffsend V ffsend D set httpproxy D set httpsproxy D echo httpproxy D echo httpsproxy D ffsend download error failed to follow share URL ignoring error failed to download the requested file caused by failed to select API version to use caused by failed to send request to fetch server version For detailed errors try verbose For more information try help D curl DOCTYPE html html langenUS head titleFirefox Sendtitle base href meta namerobots contentnonenoarchive meta namegoogle contentnositelinkssearchbox meta httpequivXUACompatible contentIEedge meta charsetutf meta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth initialscale curl has no problem connect to but ffsend does not even send request to fiddler Hello Im wondering if you have considered support for reading from stdin or a named pipe to avoid having to write a file to disk For example all of the following fail with various errors echo foo ffsend upload name footxt echo foo ffsend upload name footxt ffsend upload name footxt echo foo Thanks Noah The README for the project mentions a roadmap file But no such file exists Itd be cool to view the roadmap for this project it sounds super interesting
