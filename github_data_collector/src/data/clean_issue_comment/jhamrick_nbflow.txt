Scons does not properly detect whether a notebook needs to be rebuilt when using the timeout option scons timout Instead all notebooks will be rebuilt regardless if changes were made or not Directly providing a dict timeout to the setup in the SConstruct file does result in the same issue Issue occured on Arch Linux using Miniconda with Python Hello there I like to use pydoit as my build system it supports Python and is quite extensible This PR adds a module to nbflow for pydoit The folder doitexample shows how it works It uses a dodopy file which follows a similar pattern to the scons example python from nbflowdoit import createbuildtasks def tasknbflow yield from createbuildtasks analyses Major kudos for your arch making this really easy to write Todos Needs tests x Works only with Python which conflicts with he scons module and example notebooks See here for instructions on putting Python and kernels side by side Should possibly be its own package something like nbflowdoit x A couple bugs have been fixed which I need to push downstream more PRs incoming If keeping in same project update README Cheers Camille Can nbflow detect dependencies that cant be generated by nbconvert I have a use case for a notebook flow that has interaction early on Eg An interactive notebook with a widget in stage defines a set of windows that I use to visualize data in stage The window definition is best done interactively so it cant be run by nbconvert if I understand that right In my playing with nbflow a dependency must be generated by a notebook with nbconvert in order to for the dependency identified by scons That is I defining depends in stage to a text file that I create with a text editor Updatingediting that file did not trigger a build when running scons So I guess Im hoping theres a way to get scons to identify the dependency in this use case Any thoughts would be welcome Im experimenting at this point BTW I saw your talk at the BIDS meetup last week Great stuff Currently nbflow only supports scons but theres not really any reason why it cant in principle support other build systems For example I could support waf and then there would be python support tada
