Hello I have been using your website interface to graph my data but would like to switch over to graphing in R to take advantage of choosing some details like the color of the plots Is there a function to analyze the data with the median instead of the default mean in R I cant seem to find it if its out there already Thanks for this wonderful resource Miwa Hello Is there a way to add a darker average line for the multipaired two group plot Thank you Ben Hi I would like to include in the rawplotylabel special characters and chemical formulas I have tried few approach but so far no lack do you have any suggestion thanks D Hello The issue I needed flexibility in the choice of colours for the raw data in an estimation plot AND a colour vector long enough to cover a number of data groups the number of colours in the bigger RColorBrewer palettes The following worked for me In code file RplotR from GitHub I replaced the original line ggplot scalecolorbrewerpalette palette with ggplot scalecolourmanualvalues repc A CE A CE CF C CF C This was suitable for data groups paired by color alternating blue and dark orange as in the DABEST paper by Ho et al Nature Methods Im running dabestr from CRAN and had to read in the nonmodified plothelpersR and flatviolinR files to make this work in addition to the edited plotR file Hi guys Im currently changing some of my analysis for a publication using estimation statistics and estimation plots Firstly it is fantastic I could use some help on two little issues hope they are not naive enough cant say Im an Rexpert Im trying to use parmfrow to plot multiple plots sidebyside but Ive failed so far Cant figure out why Could you guys help me with this one The default color for the bootstrap sampling distribution in Gardner Altman plots is grey and I cant find a way to change this However in Fig e Ho et al it is red Was it changed manually in another software I read that color setting is an issue for v but if there is an alternative available it would be of great help Thank you Substituted Swarmplot code to add function that plot points with add error bars SEM or SD intended for multilevel designs Hello Ive been trying to add error bars to the individual points for technical replicates in an experiment It seems the plot function generates a ggplot object but its not mantaining the original variable names maybe requiredabestr requiredplyr requireggplot GroupCtrl rnormn mean sd GroupTest rnormn mean sd SimulatedData dataframeGroup factorcrep rep Replicate factorreprepc each PeakArea csapplyGroupCtrl functionxx rnormn mean sd sapplyGroupCtrl functionxx rnormn mean sd sapplyGroupCtrl functionxx rnormn mean sd sapplyGroupTest functionxx rnormn mean sd sapplyGroupTest functionxx rnormn mean sd sapplyGroupTest functionxx rnormn mean sd levelsSimulatedDataGroup cControl Treatment SEM functionxreturnsdxsqrtlengthx GroupedData SimulatedData groupbydots cGroupReplicate summarizeAvrgPA meanPeakAreaSEM SEMPeakArea unpairedmeandiff dabestGroupedData Group AvrgPA idx cControl Treatment paired FALSE p plotunpairedmeandiff p So far so good but if I try to add error bars p geompointrangeaesyminAvrgPASEM ymaxAvrgPASEM Error in FUNX i object AvrgPA not found Any workaround this Thank you so much I followed the code in vignette and got this error when I tried to plot I was able to get dabestobject but cant plot it The development version also has this issue Any advice Thanks I appear to have sorted out issues related but have found a new issue in v When doing a multipaired plot if a color column is passed to the plot function there is no way to change the palette Eyeball test says that plotR should have ggplot scalecolorbrewerpalette palette on line Reprex designed for consistency with my current real data librarydabestr librarytidyverse demodata dataframeid repseq each group repcamber blue times c phase repcbaseline ptx times each score rnorm mean sd sex repcMale Female times each demodata demodata unitegroup cgroup phase sep demodabest dabestdemodata group score idx listcbluebaseline blueptx camberbaseline amberptx paired TRUE idcol id Black and white plotdemodabest Set colors plotdemodabest colorcolumn sex Should be Dark but is in fact Set plotdemodabest colorcolumn sex palette Dark Love the package It makes a comparison in a paper Im contributing really easy to visualize I would like to use the Bayesian bootstrap so as to be consistent with the other analytics in the paper In the context of the plotdata the difference between the methods will be indistinguishable but statistical reviewers would know its technically incorrect Rasmus B th has a package already for this at and probably there are some others that might be easy to integrate Thanks for considering this
