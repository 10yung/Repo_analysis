Need an iOS support for SwiftPM for the project note Macv is the minimum availableno what I did I updated READMEmd Compatible iOS version what I checked I checked behaviors on the simulator and the real device Xcode simulator iOS iPhone Xs iOS Reachabilityswift works fine Please merge this pull request if it has no problems I connected to the hotspot alone without the presence of the internet but its results come under Reachability state It didnt identify the nonavailability of the internet Could you please help me with this Even though it was connected with hotspot it needs to check internet availability is there in that or not On iOS app background getting message in console ReachabilitySample Cant end BackgroundTask no background task exists with identifier x or it may have already been ended Break in UIApplicationEndBackgroundTaskError to debug swift import Combine import Reachability import os class ReachabilityStore ObservableObject private var reachability Reachability Published var reachable Bool false Published var reachableViaWifi Bool false Published var reachableViaCellular Bool false init reachability try Reachability reachabilitywhenReachable weak self reachability in guard let self self else return selfreachable true selfreachableViaWifi reachabilityconnection wifi selfreachableViaCellular selfreachableViaWifi oslog Reachable via publics selfreachableViaWifi WiFi Cellular reachabilitywhenUnreachable weak self in guard let self self else return selfreachable false selfreachableViaWifi false selfreachableViaCellular false oslogUnreachable do try reachabilitystartNotifier catch oslogUnable to start reachability notifier Or Is there one Unless Im missing something I dont see a target in the main xcodeproj although there are folders containing samples Thank you Hi I noticed the last update change none to unavailable that mean none should be removed but Xcode ask me to add both on switch I did do clean build but noting change untill I add both also let reachability Reachability is force me to remove and see it not optional Cannot force unwrap value of nonoptional type Reachability and after I change it to let reachability Reachability Call can throw but errors cannot be thrown out of a property initializer the previous version was working fine When running unit tests on Xcode Xcode GM Seed on Mojave Asynchronous wait failed Exceeded timeout of seconds with unfulfilled expectations Check invalid host This is unit tests run on iPhone Xs running iOS Simulator iOS Simulator What version of ReachabilitySwift are you using Current TOT How is it installed Manually CocoaPods Carthage Unit tests run from the provided project No install required Does it occur on device or simulator Which device Simulator unit tests Tried on iPhone iPhone Xs What OS version are you running on Mojave How often does it happen Every time you run unit tests Are there steps you can take to reproduce it git clone Open provided project Run unit tests I cant seem to get whenReachable to work even though I added var reachability Reachability at the class level outside any function I am also debugging on device not a simulator class AnimatedLaunchScreenController UIViewController var reachability Reachability override func viewDidLoad superviewDidLoad reachability try Reachability reachabilitywhenReachable reachability in DispatchQueuemainasync printreached NetworkManagerSharedInstancedecodeJSON SplashViewheartAttack true Getting this error when submitting builds to the App Store with the latest version of the library ERROR ITMS This bundle is invalid The value for key CFBundleShortVersionString beta in the Infoplist file must be a periodseparated list of at most three nonnegative integers Please find more information about CFBundleShortVersionString at Screenshot at Workaround Manually change the CFBundleShortVersionString in infoplist from beta to
