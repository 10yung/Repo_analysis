Security Alerts page details Custom script extension is failing to download execute installapachesh DETAIL I am attempting to provisioning the architecture outlined here Provisioning fails with custom extension error in step of the above If I logon to the linux VM I see in varlogazurecustomscripthandlerlog errorhttp request failed Get REDACTED dial tcp io timeout Finally if I look at the downloaded scriptfile in varlibwaagentcustomscriptdownload I see installapachesh of length zero No content In the AddsForestps script the SetDnsServerARcordsForWebApps should make the ZoneName and ComputerName and maybe IPv Address values script parameters or driven by other script parameters if possible This would allow flexibility in using the reference architecture with different domain setups It would be nice to get a reference architecture for big data analytics that utilizes azure data lake powerbicom and to enable analytics across data produced by different systems within an Enterprise The command to check the DNS name was failing because the authors subscription id was a part of the command I added a SUBSCRIPTIONID parameter and leveraged that parameter as part of the curl command to check the validity of the gateway DNSNAME Github Raw URL returned Updating with correct script location update readme to use databricks add neighborhoods file to repo no longer present in referenced web site minor fixes Hi team Have been working in detail with the hybrid architecture with great success Out of curiosity is there a way to CHAIN the deployment scripts so that they execute one after the other with timed perfection Maybe with a PowerShell wrapper which waits until each one has successfully completed
