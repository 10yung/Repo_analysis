Not sure if Im just doing something wrong here but I tried running the algorithm today on a dummy tileset I made and got some results I wasnt expecting Ive uploaded a zip file with what I was using here Basezip I modified samplesxml with this entry xml simpletiled nameBase width height I also had to modify the for loop in Maincs to let me run the algorithm times as there seemed to be a lot of contradictions One of the results I got looked like this I dont understand how I got this though as there are no neighbor constraints that include basecorner on both the left and the right Hi Im trying to add a tile to my tileset that does not have symmetry Here is the tile diagonal straight I believe that this tile has none of the symmetry types X I L etc Please correct me if I am wrong However I cannot seem to define this in the dataxml file In fact is it true that because of this line There is not currently an option for a tile with no symmetry Thanks
