Is there a plan to update the D DX AffinityLayer to support the DXR API Hello Fallback layer is removed Can you comment why I have test on amd and winver and my device reports that it is not working On NVidia I had no issues Develop Update version of the sln file recommended in the readme Using the Git Extensions program on Windows I get this pair of errors error unable to create file SamplesDesktopD D RaytracingsrcD D RaytracingRealTimeDenoisedAmbientOcclusionRTAOShadersDenoisingCalculateMeanVarianceSeparableFilterCSCheckerboardSamplingAnyToAnyWaveReadLaneAthlsl Filename too long error unable to create file SamplesDesktopD D RaytracingsrcD D RaytracingRealTimeDenoisedAmbientOcclusionRTAOShadersDenoisingDisocclusionBlurDepthAwareSeparableGaussianFilter x CSAnyToAnyWaveReadLaneAthlsl Filename too long Manually downloading the zip and pulling these files out works but itd be nicer to avoid these long file names In addition to use SPACE to toggle the sample should also use ALTENTER which is the classically implemented hotkey for window vs fullscreen since the early days of DX To be byte aligned the padding should be as in D D ExecuteIndirecth Hi All Im wondering if there are plans to support MulitGPU and or Multithreaded Rendering any time in the near future Or at least it would be interesting whats blocking the support as the feature list says that thread safe command context is still experimental Regards The constant buffer resource does not need to be Its only a suggestion to use blue noise mask instead of Sampler Sampler D D RaytracingRealTimeDenoisedAmbientOcclusion Single blue noise x D texture shifted randomly in each frame D D RaytracingRealTimeDenoisedAmbientOcclusionBN
