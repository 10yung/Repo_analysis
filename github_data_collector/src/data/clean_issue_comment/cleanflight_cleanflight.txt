 Important considerations when opening a pull request Pull requests will only be accepted if they are opened against the master branch Pull requests opened against other branches without prior consent from the maintainers will be closed Please follow the coding style guidlines Keep your pull requests as small and concise as possible One pull request should only ever add update one feature If the change that you are proposing has a wider scope consider splitting it over multiple pull requests In particular pull requests that combine changes to features and one or more new targets are not acceptable Ideally a pull request should contain only one commit with a descriptive message If your changes use more than one commit rebase squash them into one commit before submitting a pull request If you need to amend your pull request make sure that the additional commit has a descriptive message or even better use git commit amend to amend your original commit All pull requests are reviewed Be ready to receive constructive criticism and to learn and improve your coding style Also be ready to clarify anything that isnt already sufficiently explained in the code and text of the pull request and to defend your ideas If your pull request is a fix for one or more issues that are open in GitHub add a comment to your pull request and add the issue numbers of the issues that are fixed in the form Fixes issue number This will cause the issues to be closed when the pull request is merged If you have already had your PR merged in BF then no need to currently create a new PR here Remove this Text Backport of IBUS protocol changes already implemented in BF The PR created on request of FlySky they want to have receivers compatible New FlySky receivers AFHDS and latest AFHDS a are using bits free bits in every channel to pass additional data thus increase total passed channels to Missing logic has been implemented it is still compatible with channels receivers The fix is critical because if new channels are being send in the frame they are causing invalid value recognition Information about change I got from first hand talked directly to FlySky Important This is not the right place to get help with configuration issues Your issue will be closed without further comment Please get help from other user support options such as asking the manufacturer of the hardware you are using RCGroups or Slack registration at or other user support forums groups eg Facebook Hello i cant set PWM RX INPUT in betaflight i set it but when i restart it reset PPM RXWhy this and RC version dont working on CC D v is working and flashing but if im flashing v i have only green led after and no USB device im using configurator v A Description This is a feature or enhancement request to add a new serial RX protocol This would be to enable the Yuneec Serial protocol allowing people to use their commercial Yuneec ST ST andor ST radios with cleanflight based DIY drones While this is probably a relatively small group of people who want to do that I also think this feature would be fairly easy to add because there is already existing code for the protocol for the PX firmware see the ST source code here I know the code works to get RX channel data from the yuneec rx because I used that code linked above as an arduino library and programmed a esp to convert the output from that channel data into PPM It would be nice to not have to have an additional microcontroller to interface the Yuneec RX to a Cleanflight compatible FC B Steps To Repeat NA C Video Links NA D Forum post

elevator too fast or agreesive position and the drone starts move but in this time the board disarme and you have to turn off the switch and rearm again Arm the quadcopter Take off Move the sticks of aileron or elevator too fast when the drone calculates the angular motion he desarm It only occurs when the gyro calculate the angular motion If you move the sticks of controller and hold the drone it looks fine List of parts SP Racing F Deluxe FC Firmware Cleanflight ESC Sky RC a Receiver FlySky i mode PPM Motors kv GOOLRC Standard settings Loop time and Gyro Observation If the Super rate is up
