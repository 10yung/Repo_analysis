 Reason for change For a CI pipeline I was trying to scan just container images but without the healtcheck and docker trust check dockerbenchsecuritysh i test c containerimages e check check This wasnt yet implemented so I took a stab at it Technical explaining The magic is in the sed sed ne i d d p functionslibsh i is the checkname for example containerimages so it matches on containerimages until This results in console sed ne containerimages p functionslibsh containerimages check check check check check check check check check check check check check end But I am just interested in the checks so just print the checks console sed ne containerimages checkp functionslibsh check check check check check check check check check check check check check end And then I just did the same grep trick as checkexclude to exlude test v was just released The image needs to be signed by Docker have a latest and a version tag added to the image and published docker compose fixed In some evironments there may be a very large number of images containers etc not satisfying a given test For example in one environment we saw k images not satisfying mostly because the customer was never cleaning up old images To avoid overly long lists of items add a new option n LIMIT that limits the number of items included in JSON output When the limit is reached the list will be truncated and a trailing truncated will be added Heres an example id desc Ensure the hosts network namespace is not shared result WARN details Containers running with networking mode host k sPODstorageprovisionerkubesystemef ef c e f f k sPODkubeproxyxfln kubesystemee c c c e f f truncated items k sPODstorageprovisionerkubesystemef ef c e f f k sPODkubeproxyxfln kubesystemee c c c e f f truncated Signedoffby Mark Stemm markstemmgmailcom In version compose has another restart configuration version services redis image redisalpine deploy restartpolicy condition onfailure delay s maxattempts window s And this configuration doesnt make changes in docker inspect docker ps quiet all xargs docker inspect format Id RestartPolicyName HostConfigRestartPolicyName MaximumRetryCount HostConfigRestartPolicyMaximumRetryCount f a b cRestartPolicyName MaximumRetryCount d bce b cjRestartPolicyName MaximumRetryCount e cbfa hRestartPolicyName MaximumRetryCount a a d RestartPolicyName MaximumRetryCount So test is failed The testing is more or less a manual operation today This consequence of lack of testing are inconsistent output and more than once have simple code changes caused incorrect results Verification of tests have also been forgotten I am using ubuntu with docker version Docker version ce build e fc a I have created a separate partition for docker still security check warns about Here is the output of docker info command Containers Running Paused Stopped Images Server Version ce Storage Driver overlay Backing Filesystem extfs Supports dtype true Native Overlay Diff false Logging Driver jsonfile Cgroup Driver cgroupfs Plugins Volume local Network bridge host macvlan null overlay Log awslogs fluentd gcplogs gelf journald jsonfile logentries splunk syslog Swarm inactive Runtimes runc Default Runtime runc Init Binary dockerinit containerd version a b edcd eb de e e e e runc version f bd b df c a fa init version fec Security Options apparmor seccomp Profile default Kernel Version azure Operating System Ubuntu LTS OSType linux Architecture x CPUs Total Memory GiB Name AZLXSPTAPTDEVAP ID IM BT UUO S AAPGA UX VKM GSKQOM AEMERSMMTJJBLU Docker Root Dir datadrivedocker Debug Mode client false Debug Mode server false Registry Labels Experimental false Insecure Registries Live Restore Enabled false WARNING No swap limit support Currently only has a latest tag We use this image and ec d ce bbd b b d c db broke how we assert whether checks we want to succeed indeed do Of course it was not hard to fix but still it would be nice to be able to reference a specific version tag on docker hub The company Im working with have been using dockerbenchsecurity and dockerbenchtest on Linux with great results Were now heavily migrating a bunch of Windows apps across to Docker and it would be really useful if this tool could be used on Windows also I know a lot of the host recommendations would not make sense or would need to be modified to fit Windows Is this something thats being planned
