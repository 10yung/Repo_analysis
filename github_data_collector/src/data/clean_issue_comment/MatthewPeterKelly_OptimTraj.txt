Hello I attempted to run the MAINsimulatem and MAINminForceTrajm files in the quadRotor d demo but received the following error in both cases Index in position exceeds array bounds must not exceed Error in dynamics line q x Error in MAINsimulatetzdynamicszctrlFunzp Error in odearguments line f fevalodet y args ODE I sets args to yp Error in ode line odeargumentsFcnHandlesUsed solvername ode tspan y options varargin Error in MAINsimulate line soln ode dynFuntSpanz I know the OptimTraj library should be compatible with any release of MATLAB but I encountered this error using both the a version and the b version Is there a change from earlier versions that might be causing this error Hi I wrote the matlab function which calculates dynamics for an inverted pendulum and I would like to use OtimTraj to find a Swingup Trajectory however as I run the simulation I see this warning from FMINCON Your initial point x is not between bounds lb and ub FMINCON shifted x to strictly satisfy the bounds Hier is how Px looks like and after that this warning Warning Matrix is close to singular or badly scaled Results may be inaccurate RCOND e Hier is how I set the initial conditions and boundries as an Input I use the Carts acceleration clc clear addpath OptimTraj dist maxForce duration problemfuncdynamics txu invPendDynamicsxu problemfuncpathObj txu u Forcesquared cost function problemboundslow problemboundsinitialTimeupp problemboundsfinalTimelow duration problemboundsfinalTimeupp duration problemboundsinitialStatelow pi problemboundsinitialStateupp pi problemboundsfinalStatelow problemboundsfinalStateupp problemboundsstatelow piinfinf problemboundsstateupp piinfinf problemboundscontrollow maxForce problemboundscontrolupp maxForce problemguesstime duration problemguessstate problemboundsinitialStatelow problemboundsfinalStatelow problemguesscontrol Do you know what might be causing the error Make it clear to users how to install this library Add a INSTALLmd file Move source code into a src directory Add a simple installation script to add the library include a flag to optionally install examples There are many NLP solvers that can interface with Matlab potentially allowing users to try to solve problems using a core solver other than FMINCON Two possible interfaces are with Knitro and SNOPT links below Knitro SNOPT Is there a recommended way to cite OptimTraj in academic research A BibTeX entry would be especially useful The commercial MATLAB optimal control solver GPOPSII has been integrated into OptimTraj It may be useful to also integrate the commercial MATLAB optimal control solvers DIDO and PROPT into OptimTraj DIDO PROPT ADiGator is free opensource MATLAB software that computes vectorized gradients and even Hessians via automatic differentiation It was developed by the author of GPOPSII to make it easier to supply vectorized gradients and Hessians to GPOPSII Perhaps ADiGator could be integrated into OptimTraj so that OptimTraj can optionally use ADiGator to generate vectorized derivatives of the optimal control functions eg dynamics path objective etc This would be very useful as it is often very difficult to manually derive and implement vectorized gradients and Hessians Some of the OptimTraj methods ie trapezoid hermiteSimpson rungeKutta are able to exploit usersupplied gradients of the dynamics path objective etc functions Are there plans for the OptimTraj methods to also accept Hessians of these functions Do you plan to compute estimates of the costates and provide those with the OptimTraj solution in addition to the states and controls The costates can be useful if one wants to use an indirect method Many optimal control solvers such as the MATLAB solvers GPOPSII DIDO PROPT ICLOCS and FALCONm and the C solver PSOPT do provide costate estimates in the solution GPOPSII DIDO PROPT ICLOCS FALCONm PSOPT The MATLAB code fminsdp would make it really easy for OptimTraj to easily switch between several different rd party NLP solvers like IPOPT SNOPT KNITRO and fmincon assuming the user already has them installed The documentation says that fminsdp is designed for smallscale optimization problems but as long as there are no matrix inequality constraints which is the novelty of fminsdp fminsdp should be able to solve largescale NLP problems like those formulated from an optimal control problem by OptimTraj via the thirdparty solvers The fminsdp and fmincon interfaces are almost the same so you would basically just have to replace the fmincon call in the OptimTraj code to fminsdp
