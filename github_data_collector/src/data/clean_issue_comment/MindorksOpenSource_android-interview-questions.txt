Hi all I found that there is a better visualized article on activity launch modes with a more descriptive explanation Is it possible to link to this article on the Activity What are launch modes Add some new interview questions The github link provided with the question Differences between abstract classes and interfaces is not available anymore Please removeupdate it Add the difference between Serializable and Parcelable The descriptions are inverted Instantiation is when you allocate memory in the heap for objects Initialization is when you assign a value to the objects fields To my knowledge answer to this question What are the access modifiers you know What does each one do is wrong default is more restrictive than protected because defaults scope is within the same class and package whereas the scope of protected is the same class same package and other packages as well through inheritance So the order of the access modifiers from the least restrictive to the most restrictive should be public protected default private What is the right answer for design questions Design WhatsApp I think it would be great to separate the questions between junior middle and senior This is really awesome It really helps to prepare for the Android developer interview When will we have answers Some questions are hard or too general to me its difficult to find the answer Thanks
