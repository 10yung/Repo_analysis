Hi I am getting an installation issue R Ubuntu librarydevtools installgithubcbailtextnets Downloading GitHub repo cbailtextnetsmaster from URL Installation failed error in running command Thanks Currently the PrepText function accepts either words or groups as the node type It would be useful to be able to create and visualize twomode networks by using both of these as nodes The author of the udpipe R package referenced this package for network visualizations It claims to be suited to quickly render large networks as well as provide interactive features so might be interesting to look into Carried pruned through the remainder of the function Changed communitiesmemberships to communitiesmembership memberships is a matrix Reordered plotting so that edges are plotted before nodes
