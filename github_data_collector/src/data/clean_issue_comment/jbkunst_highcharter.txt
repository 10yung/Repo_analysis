think theres a problem with setting labels for the z axis in a D column chart When I specify min max and categories for the z axis via hczAxis only zeros get printed as labels instead of the specified ones I observed this behaviour for versions and the current dev version Ive included a fiddle as well as a reproducible example in R libraryshiny libraryhighcharter shinyApp ui fluidPage fluidRow
