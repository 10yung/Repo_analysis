Hi there it could be great to postpone backup in case of an active streams on Plex As already effective with cloudpl w with throttle feature Thank you I have this error in the wizard setup for nextcloud Error while trying to create admin user Failed to connect to the database An exception occurred in driver SQLSTATE HY Access denied for user octareknextcloudcloudbox using password YES I used everything exactly as in the wiki page and i can connect to mariadb from mysqlclient from any container System Information Cloudbox Version Develop latest Operating System Debian Describe the bug Have run tag but no joy System Information Cloudbox Version Develop latest Operating System Ubuntu Server LTS Linux Kernel generic jq version jq a b cbe bc Copyright Free Software Foundation Inc Describe the problem Cloudbox can only use remote out of the box Multiple mount support natively would be useful Describe any solutions you think might work Adding multiple options via commas or some other syntax in settingsyml could create additional systemd services and equivalent warmup files rclone version latest remote remote remote Describe the problem Traktarr currently only allows syncing of Trakt lists with one root path for Radarr and one for Sonarr It also only syncs to one instance of Radarr and Sonarr This creates limitations for the following scenarios If you run multiple instances of RadarrSonarr such as an instance for K content you need to run just as many Traktarr instances If you have multiple root paths eg moviesEnglishHD and moviesKlingonHD you need to run a separate instance of Traktarr for each path Describe any solutions you think might work Traktarr is fairly lightweight and having multiple instances running is not an issue Each instance would run from a separate config file but otherwise should be identical This seems like an easy solution to implement without having to overhaul the Traktarr script to be able to manage multiple instancesroots Additional context Its not difficult to manually start new Traktarr containers possibly even just duplicate them within portainer but having it as part of Cloudbox would be nice since its possible to create new instances of RadarrSonarr for k content without doing so manually Edit I also realized that Traktarr is not actually running in a docker container even though it exists in Cloudb xs Dockerhub repos I pulled it manually and mounted the opttraktarr directory to config in the docker container Running it with the given entrypoint and the command run runnow seems to work fine as long as you authenticate Trakt outside the container Is it not possible to use the container rather than installing to the system by default For posterity if anyone else wants to set up multiple dockers Install traktarr via cloudbox per the wiki Navigate into opttraktarr and run sudo python m pip install r requirementstxt Create folders mkdir opttraktarrconfigs opttraktarrlogs opttraktarrcaches Copy the sample config into the new config directory cp opttraktarrconfigjson opttraktarrconfigsinstance json Note make as many copies as you need different instances of traktarr running and name them whatever you want instance is just a placeholder Authenticate trakt for each config file python opttraktarrtraktarrpy config opttraktarrconfigsinstance json logfile opttraktarrlogsinstance log cachefile optcachesinstance db traktauthentication Go into each config and modify your Sonarr url to and the Radarr url to You will not be able to run these configs outside of Docker after this as the url is for the Docker network Modify each config as needed Run the following docker command for each instance Note that these are the settings I use for traktarr but you can change the last line to whatever suits your needs eg if you want to respect blacklist just remove ignoreblacklist docker run d restartunlessstopped nametraktarrinstance netcloudbox e PUID e PGID e UMASK e TZAmericaNewYork e TRAKTARRCONFIGconfigconfigsinstance json e TRAKTARRLOGFILEconfiglogsinstance log e TRAKTARRCACHEFILEconfigcacheinstance db v opttraktarrconfigrw cloudb xtraktarrlatest run runnow ignoreblacklist adddelay Check opttraktarrlogsinstance log and make sure everything is working smoothly Would love some of the following SSH hardening options during server setup Specify a pubkey to provision for the provisioned user Specify an alternate port for sshd Disable root login via SSH Disable SSH login with passwords It would be nice making cloudbox available in the local network and not only purely through domains This would mean that the settingsyml should be enhanced by network localcloud As I already saw in the updated tasks changes like publishedports plexdockerports we could add a switch to read the ipport configuration of each app through deployment Describe the problem Only Resilio Sync is supported when the opensource alternative Syncthing works just as well and also has a docker image Describe any solutions you think might work Supporting Syncthing would be nice to have especially for those who prefer using opensource technologies Cloudbox is growing and the default build requires nearly a dozen subdomains and their corresponding SSL certificates the community aspect of Cloudbox is also growing leading to even more demand for single domain SSLs If we enabled the option to use a wildcard SSL certificate instead of using single domain SSLs for every subdomain we could simplify certificate management Im following the guide in the wiki and the final step is st configure Organizr It requires us to use homepagephp But this file seems to be missing Please advise
