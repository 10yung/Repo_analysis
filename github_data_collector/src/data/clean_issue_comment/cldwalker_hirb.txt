Looks like a bunch of PRs are sitting for a while was wondering if this gem is still maintained Thanks Description In a Rails environment with hirb and tableprint installed I get the following error when the call to tableprint returns In other words directly after a Table has printed a NoMethodError is called from hirb After a simple query like tp Bookall at Exploration After the callstack is a debugger showing the Float type while being in HirbString bash NoMethodError undefined method length for Float from databundlegemshirb libhirbstringrb in size from databundlegemshirb libhirbpagerrb in

users WHERE emails LIKE Nexampleuserexamplecom ORDER BY createdat ASC In this case the appropriate users id was shown as but it was actually Another user actually had the id So when looking at the table andor copypasting the ID for further use you might tread very wrong Its especially dangerous if you delete the user with that ID only to discover you had actually deleted the wrong user Suggested solution Display or similar for the ID when truncating it like its done in the other columns So you realize its been truncated PS If you inspect the output columns you see that more columns have the same problem emai crea etc The gem needs to be in the Gemfile in order to do require hirb Doing BasicObjectnew gives this error Hirb Error undefined method respondto for BasicObject x fa c ed a I have a lot of columns in my model I love Hirb Now Hirb cant do all of its magic because I have too many columns But lets face it I dont want all the columns I only want certain columns I searched a bit in the docs and tried the following rb HirbadddynamicviewWadget helper autotable do o fields id name token importantcolumnsonly end Though when I called my Wadgetall this spec is still not activated as expected I suspect its because ActiveRecordBase is there I realize Im probably expanding Hirbs scope a little by asking this but this is something I think thats not unreasonable to provide especially with the prevalence of AR Id like to add this to the wishlist a way to indicate to Hirb fields I want and this touches on with fields one doesnt want Ideally this could be done in the config file but Ill leave to the creator the liberty to say what he would accept What I would propose is to either make what I tried work either by having adddynamicview prepend the list in order of priority or having Hirb choose a view by the most specific or being able to specify this in YML config yml views fields activerecordbase exclude updatedat createdat secretcolumn wadget only id name importantstuff Its probably not the ideal structure but its an old application with a lot of legacy
