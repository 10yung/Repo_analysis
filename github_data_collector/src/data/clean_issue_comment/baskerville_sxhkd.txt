Extra description needed Using the following config you can trigger this behaviour by pressing the pattern once Then with every press of b the notification is send Pressing Escape does not help to exit the chord It seems that the order of the patterns has a influence in this When you switch them the chord does not work at all steps to reproduce bug control super alt l b notifysend bug expand a window by moving one of its side outward control super alt l notifysend trigger bug Hi there Ive recently installed sxhkd on a new Arch install only to discover that the keyboard I was using a Cooler Master CK GKGL UK doesnt seem to work with sxhkd and that was the only application I found that it doesnt work with To be clear I can type using this keyboard and I can use keyboard shortcuts with any application but sxhkd does not respond to shortcuts If I unplug this keyboard and use another one such as the corsair K LUX keyboard Im typing from right now everything works as expected Im not sure what other information you might need from me to investigate this further but do let me know because Id love to get my dailydriver office keyboard back in action I want to make keybindings that are only working for different desktop states Here are some examples below When VSCode or Chromium is open SuperQ should play CtrlW on the app Else SuperQ should quit the application When the focused desktop is empty C key should open Chromium Else C key should be replayed on the client The first can be present all the time in the config But the second shouldnt add more hassle for example if I write a text I dont want to run every time a bash script when I press the C key Thanks Using this tip you will be able to simulate some vim digraphs using sxhkd and xdotool meaning it would work in any terminal application including the shell and not just in vim Here is an example When you need to add digraphs you will find symbols in this file usrincluderfbkeysymh potentially with the help of UnicodeTable a vim plugin and or he digraphs in vim poor mans vim digraphs w sxhkd shift ctrl k aeiou apostropheexclamgreatercolon xdotool key clearmodifiers aeiouacutegravecircumflexdiaeresis for uppercase there might be better ways A difference here with vim is that you will have to keep shift pressed throughout the end of the sequence notice apostrophe becoming quotedbl other characters are already using the shift key shift ctrl k shift aeiou quotedblexclamgreatercolon xdotool key AEIOUacutegravecircumflexdiaeresis shift ctrl k c comma xdotool key ccedilla shift ctrl k shift c less

clearmodifiers OE Remarks you can not use native Ctrlk as in vim or you will lose the digraphs ability in vim The above example therefore used shift ctrl k you will have to manually enter all digraphs you need in your sxhkdrc file I only include a few a them here using a shell to run xdotool each time one of those digraph character is output may seem costly I recommend it for occasional use only For uppercase version of Eacute Agrave you will need to maintain the shift key pressed through the end of the sequence see comment in above snippet There might be other ways The timing seems important sometimes it wont work if you are to fast or too slow I am not sure how to improve this Maybe due to the way of sxhkds way of working with it seems that this randomly works or doesnt work It may also be my mappings Might also be related to xdotool fixed with xdotool clearmodifiers seemingly the shift in Shift Ctrl k a exclam ie Shift was intercepted by xdotool when typing eg egrave resulting in something like EGRAVE ie not working most of the time or Egrave ie working only sometimes based on your timing I will leave this idea open and maybe someone with a better understanding of sxhkd can help us improve this For my occasional use of this it works quite well enough Im trying to toggle both fullscreen and floating in the same binding This is the code so far super shift f if bspc query N n focusedfloatingfullscreen then bspc node t pseudotiled else bspc node t floatingfullscreen fi The shift binding doesnt work Without shift it works though If I separate the code in bindings it works Its a non issue to me because I made it work with bindings but it can be a bug I dont know Using bspwm and sxhkd I want to use button on my mouse as a modifier key so I can change the volume by holding it down and scrolling but it doesnt seem possible The straightforward binding of button button amixer D pulse sset Master button button amixer D pulse sset Master changes the volume on every scroll event and does nothing when button is held Trying to get around this I tried sending fake modifier presses instead I have CtrlSuperShiftScroll set to change volume but the release command is never sent so after the first press every scroll event continues to change the volume button xte keydown ControlL keydown SuperL keydown ShiftL button xte keyup ControlL keyup SuperL keyup ShiftL The first issue seems like a bug but is there a way to get around this sxhkdIssue When attempting to run sudo make to install sxhkd I get an error saying no such file or directory referring to xcb I have made sure that xcb is installed so Im not sure whats going on This is not really an issue for me but I thought its interesting behaviour and might be worth investigating This is the relevant part of my config I have fish set as my default shell Focus Focus node in direction super hjkl set wdir westset ddir prevset wdir southset wdir northset wdir eastset ddir next if bspc node f wdir bspc desktop f ddir end Focus nextprevious desktop super comma period bspc desktop f prevnextlocal Move Swap current node with node in direction super shift hjkl set dx set dy set wdir westset ddir prevset dx set wdir southset dy set wdir northset dy set wdir eastset ddir nextset dx bspc node v dx dy if status eq if bspc node s wdir set id bspc query nodes node bspc node d ddir bspc node f id end end Move current node and focus to nextprevious desktop super shift comma period set id bspc query nodes node bspc node d prevnext bspc node f id To reproduce killall sxhkd setsid f sxhkd and close the terminal emulator in my case alacritty window Interestingly everything works as normal as long as you dont close the window which is weird since sxhkd shouldnt be a child of it anymore Now for some reason the commands in the move section arent working anymore and I can not switch desktops via super hjkl but I can with super comma period For further debugging I tried this mkfifo tmpsxhkddebug cat tmpsxhkddebug Then in another terminal emu window setsid f sxhkd s tmpsxhkddebug Then close the window and watch the cat output Unfortunately I couldnt spot anything out of the ordinary there
