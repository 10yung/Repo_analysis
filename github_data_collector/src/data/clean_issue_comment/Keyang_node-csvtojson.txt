 These lines Would be much more useful if the error included the filePath variable thisemiterror new ErrorFile does not exist at filePath Check to make sure the file path to your csv is correct I want to be able to validate the headers of an uploaded file by uppercasing and replacing spaces in order to provide a forgiving user experience and then proceed to replace the headers used as keys in the JSON so that I can reference the properties by the correct name I do not want to simply supply my own headers upfront because that then eliminates the inherent ease of use this library provides which is being able to accept the columns in any order file header HeaDER header value value value const myKnownHeaders HEADER HEADER HEADER csvonheader headers validate headers let newHeaders headersmapa areplace sg toUpperCase if myKnownHeaderseveryelem newHeadersindexOfelem idk set the headers that are to be used as key somehow I thought doing csv headers fileHeaders would have worked but the header event just emits my own headers back to me which doesnt work I want to convert my csv file line by line to JSON and after that write it line by line to resulttxt Here is what I am doing import fs from fs import path from path import readline from readline import csvToJson from csvtojson const csvFilePath pathjoindirname examplecsv const fileOutputPath pathjoindirname resulttxt const input fscreateReadStreamcsvFilePath const output fscreateWriteStreamfileOutputPath flags w const inputFileLine readlinecreateInterface input terminal false output inputFileLineonline line const result csvToJson fromStringline thencsvRow consolelogcsvRow return csvRow consolelogresult outputwriteresult Unfortunately every time I am getting an empty array inside then But line exists If I add noheader true then the output is like this field firstName field lastName field email field phoneNumber field John field Doe field johndoecom field field Jane field Doe field janedoecom field But I am sure that header exists and I dont need noheader config Is there any way to use fromString inside readline event Seems like if there is a delimiter character in the last column of a csv except for in the last row then since the field gets wrapped with quotes when it is parsed the second quote is left in For example given this input firstsecondthirdfourth oneaa aabb bbcc cc twodd ddee eeff ff threegg gghh hhii ii The parsed data is first one second aa aa third bb bb fourth cc cc first two second dd dd third ee ee fourth ff ff first three second gg gg third hh hh fourth ii ii As you can see ff ff is parsed as ff ff The other values with delimiters in them are parsed fine since they are not in the last row or the last column Because the latest version of this library is incompatible with the angular version I have replaced bluebird with native promises as proposed in Keyang please review the changes Ive made and merge if everything is working Hello preFileLinefileLineString lineIdx if lineIdx return fileLineStringreplace g return fileLineString Im using preFileLine to remove spaces in CSV column headers For example column column ab cd test test should result in column column ab cd test test When there are several rows in the CSV file everything works fine Still when there is only one line in the CSV the spaces are also being replaced in it As far as I can see this happens because of lineIdx for the second line stays What I have noticed is that it happens for any number of rows in CSV because for the last row in a file the lineIdx counter is not being incremented Bumps

how I can convert the gallery field in the CSV into a JSON array The field is a list of image URLs separated by pipes I have the following CSV Capture At the moment the result I get from csvtojson is result I am trying to create the following If somebody can point me to the right direction Capture Simple question is it possible to have rows converted into seperate JSON files instead of all the rows in a single JSON file as an array
