The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

can disable automated security fix PRs for this repo from the Security Alerts page details I am running some code containing ES modules in mjs files in a docker container with node and the experimentalmodules flag I am able to import opentracing from opentracing and things work as expected The issue appears when testing the code I am using Jest and therefore need to transpile the code through babeljest The setup I have works well except for opentracing In that case opentracing ends up being undefined and things like opentracingTags result in an error Im not sure exactly whats going wrong but it seems to be related to the default export handling If I comment out the ObjectdefinePropertyexports esModule value true line in libindexjs of opentracing things work well They work correctly too if I add a exportsdefault exports in that file Without touching the opentracing nodemodule I was able to make things work in the test environment by calling import Tags from opentracing but that does not work in the production environment ie no transpilation process Please let me know if I can provide additional information to dig into the issue Implementations of many other languages have something like forEachBaggageItems on SpanContext go java cpp However js does not I am working on an implementation of a tracer that handles our organizations specific needs but ideally would use the interfaces defined by opentracing Maybe I am missing something but I dont see how that would work the way the types are defined now with classes instead of interfaces Eg if I define my own Tracer class that expects certain properties on the SpanContext TypeScript will tell me that these properties dont exist import Tracer as OpenTracer SpanContext from opentracing class Tracer extends OpenTracer startSpanoperationName string options ISpanOptions let parent SpanContext spancontextparentId parentspanId Property parentId does not exist on type SpanContext If the opentracing types were interfaces custom implementations could implement them and this wouldnt be a problem A consumer using my tracing implementation could not expect a span returned by my tracers startSpan to be of type opentracing Span Could you provide a few pointers on how you propose to create a custom tracer implementation that still uses the opentracing types Thanks
