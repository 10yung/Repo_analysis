MTStatusBarOverlay will fill all my screen when it appears That is because UIWindow init will set its size MTStatusBarOverlayframesize to screen size after it calls initWithFrame method So I changed the code like this That means all the code in MTStatusBarOverlay init will be called after UIWindow init This did solve the problem BTW I found this problem in iOS Changed initWithFrame to init because in init method super calls resizeWindowToFullScreenIfNessesary and it sets frame as full screen Added setting clear background color to self because after tap and view shrink there are black background of self Since upgrading to Xcode and deploying on iOS the UI becomes unresponsive as long as a message is displayed on the status bar Is this a known issue or is there perhaps something wrong with the way Im using it Fix for iOS on which the overlay takes over the entire screen When testing the overlay in iOS on iPad the overlay takes over the entire screen andor is positioned incorrectly I have created a sample project with just the sample code IBActionshowStatusidsender MTStatusBarOverlay overlay MTStatusBarOverlay sharedInstance overlayanimation MTStatusBarOverlayAnimationFallDown MTStatusBarOverlayAnimationShrink overlaydetailViewMode MTDetailViewModeHistory enable automatic historytracking and show in detailview overlaydelegate self overlayprogress overlay postMessageFollowing myell w on Twitter overlayprogress overlay postMessageFollowing myell w on Github animatedNO overlayprogress overlay postImmediateFinishMessageFollowing was a good idea duration animatedYES overlayprogress iOS only if you start an app in landscape with the status bar showing then rotate to portrait there is an issue A large black box appears major refactor for iOS remove old OS style status bar background hex image remove old OS style label shadow add ability to set custom textbackground color overriding default coloring that depends on UIStatusBarStyle add demo project add demogif i admit it could be a new function requirement rather than a bug Thanks
