Seems like some images not valid img width altScreen Shot at PM src When I am right aligning the textfield text become right aligned but placeholder isnt and sometime placeholder enter into right side and only some texts are visible I am using swift After installing the pod lot of errors are displaying is there any update on this pod Thank you i copied sources to my project but return use uncleard type MKTextField or i cannot write instanse var for build button img width altscreen shot at src img width altscreen shot at src Ripple effect was added to button and upon navigation back to same view the mask is still visible img width altscreen shot at pm src Since the repo is no longer maintained use this in your Podfile instead ruby pod MaterialKit git or in your Packageswift swift packageurl upToNextMinorfrom This version is compatible theoretically with any version from Swift to solve and details summaryThis implementation also removed the strong reference cycles which are causing memory leakssummary Im aware of this issue a long time ago but had no idea why just declaring superLayer as weak causes unexpected crashes Thanks to theMeatloaf for his solutions in Swift we only need to manually remove the observers by calling recycle method of MKLayer and MKRefreshControl if a class owns such properties directly I cant figure out a way for us to automatically remove the observers especially when the time deinit of MKLayer gets called superLayer is already nil Therefore if you have a better solution please definitely help And yes in addition to MKLayer and all other classes that has a property of type MKLayer MKRefreshControl has strong reference loop and observer not removed and MKSwitch has a strong reference loop too details Add support to Swift and xcode This should allow you to build on Xcode with swift to resolve Swift will need to come next
