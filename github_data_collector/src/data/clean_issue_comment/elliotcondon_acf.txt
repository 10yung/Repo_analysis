This is a friendly notice for a very minor issue If multisite is disabled via wpconfig as is sometimes done with a test site reloading a wpadminnetwork URL triggers the following ACF error PHP Fatal error Uncaught Error Call to undefined function getsites in F www wp wpcontent plugins advancedcustomfields includes admin adminupgradephp Could you add query parameter wpcontentpluginsadvancedcustomfieldsproassetsfontacfttf because cloudflare blocks loading this fonts and thats why UI breaks Related to issue The issue seems to persist for blocks that use the repeater field Here is a screencast that demonstrates the issue Anything I can do to fix the issue Or is it possible to apply the same fix for the repeater field as was applied for the other fields Edit I linked to the wrong screencast before Hey Elliot thanks a lot for your work every day I have a question about ACF and the future of blocks Would it be possible to add ACF fields to a WordPress core block with the ability to add custom class names to the block container and to add innerwrapping HTML Would it be possible to add ACF blocks to an ACF groupwrapper block The idea is that ACF provides a group block which allow us to add inner blocks Noticed an issue today where the fields in my Field Group appeared out of order after a Sync This only affects the admin inside of the ACF tools not when editing content itself EXAMPLE We have a local Field Group with Ribbon Content Ribbons and Page Anchor Ribbon in that order Uploaded json file to remote server go to ACF admin screen and sync Field Group Edit the Field Group and our ribbons are showing as Content Ribbons Page Anchor Ribbon and then Ribbon FINDINGS After looking in the database I found that all the fields imported to the field group were all uploaded with the same menuorder and so WordPress is seemingly displaying them in alphabetical order instead When I update the menuorder values to in the order I want them they now show up the way that they should have originally USABILITY ISSUE We sometimes use acfjson as a twoway street so its important that the database definitions remain the same between local and live in case we make an edit in live and then pull down the json file to sync to local Admins should not have to worry about whether the field definitions exist in the proper order after syncing from one site to another Thanks for the great plugin we have an agency Pro license and acfjson specifically has been a huge boon to us Im happy to look into a PR for this if you would find it helpful Hello as per the documentation the iframe is unescaped will it be possible to provide a solution based on this Thanks I have two suggestions Group tabs Right now we have Tabs and Group field types Lets imagine a page with parts Intro with title and text body with title and text too Here is what it would look like in the current ACF version acf And in my PHP code fields getfields echo fieldsintrotitle echo fieldsintrotext echo fieldsbodytitle echo fieldsbodytext The problem is that i have to manually prefix every single field in each tab to avoid the problem where two fields would have the same name When you work a lot with ACF its a repetitive task Solution What would be great a checkbox Act as a group in the Tab field otpions When checked there would be a Field Name for that tab and it would just act as a group This way the PHP code would look like this fields getfields echo fieldsintrotitle echo fieldsintrotext echo fieldsbodytitle echo fieldsbodytext and i would not have to copy paste the prefix for each field i add smile Internal Links External link I would love to have a way to limit links to internal pages or external URL on the Link field type Right now the Link type allows to add both I understand you probably have other priorities but would you accept a pull request for any of those features Thanks Using Wordpress and the latest ACF release when I set custom fields to conditionally show based on taxonomy custom taxonomy the fields do not initially show up when creating a new post the correct conditions are met and only show when the page is refreshed Ive tested this on a clean Wordpress install where I created a field group set to show only if a post has a specific category When adding a new post the fields do not show up when the category is selected but show when the post is published and reloaded Im not sure if its something Im doing but if its any help this isnt happening with the beta release disappointedrelieved We make heavy use of local JSON at my company to keep our ACF field groups within our managed codebase Its awesome When we are working on a site locally we actively edit our field groups through the WP interface which means we keep the database in sync with the JSON files After we deploy our themes to the production server the field groups live in the theme directory as JSON but not in the database We also frequently export import the database from production to our local dev environment A minor drawback of this is that the field groups are no longer synced to our local database so we have to visit the sync available section of the ACF settings and resync them manually It would be great if we could automate that process as part of the workflow that we use to pull the production database and import it I investigated how I would write a WPCLI plugin for the task but I discovered that ACF has no accessible function for syncing some or all field groups into the database It would be awesome if such a function existed either in PHP or as a RESTaccessible trigger If it were a function Id expect it might work something like this php acfsyncfieldgroups groupids force groupids array Optional The unique ids of one or more ACF field groups If falsy attempt to sync all field groups in the current themes acfjson directory Defaults to false force bool Optional If false only perform the sync for a given field group if it does not exist in the database If true sync all listed field groups replacing the version in the database if necessary Defaults to false Id love to hear others thoughts on this idea I have an ACF block registered with acfregisterblock with the supports parameter set to supports arrayanchor true The HTML Anchor field appears in the Advanced section of the block settings within Gutenberg as I would expect However if you set the value it doesnt get saved and there is no way to return that value on the front end from what I can tell The documentation for acfregisterblock says that All properties from the JavaScript block supports documentation may be used however the anchor property appears to not to be supported Am I doing something wrong or is the anchor field not supported As far as I can tell the only way with v RC to return an id value to the block is to use block id which returns the ID of the block which isnt great for anchoring as I want a more readable anchor Use case I want to link to workingtogether and not block cbc ddc a
