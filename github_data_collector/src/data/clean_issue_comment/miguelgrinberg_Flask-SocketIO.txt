disconnected Hi I just had a query we are working with Kubernetes and using FlaskSocketio to establish communication between client and server In Kubernetes we have Watch module which gives us a stream of data which can be easily returned through generators and HTTP response Can we use generators with emit or send functions Describe the bug When running Flask in a docker container the web app is served just fine using socketiorunapp However when using the Flask CLI bindings warnings are emitted about the application using Werkzeug and web sockets being unavailable This is inconsequential as I dont need to use any components of the web server itself when running CLI tasks To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Create a docker container with a Flask web app running FlaskSocketIO Using docker exec run a Flask CLI task from within the container Expected behavior A lack of warning message about web socket support I am trying to port this extension to quart I am starting by changing as little code as possible When I try to run the application I get the error in the title Will update with more detail when not on mobile I just thought this might be a known bugfix Hey guys is there a function to know how many clients are conncted thank you Cheers pau Your question How do I increase the level of logging from the emit function My SocketIO call currently looks like socketio flasksocketioSocketIO app engineiologgerapplogger asyncmodegevent corsallowedoriginscaos loggerapplogger Why Periodically the server generates an emit in response to an authentication request from a new client which doesnt appear to get to the client The call is being executed but no sign of the data being sent to the client is evident with the current logging levels applogger level is DEBUG Any subsequent websocket interaction with the server clients already connected after this failure no longer seems to work either but the server continues to function at the FlaskHTTP level without an issue Other information Versions Flask FlaskSocketIO gevent geventwebsocket Python Command gunicorn k geventwebsocketgunicornworkersGeventWebSocketWorker w b dashboardapp D Describe the bug

fighting with making game multiplayer i have to identify connections but each time the player refresh or go to another page i lost the connection i can not send him message anymore Even if the target player stay on the same page if i want use a flash message thanks to flasksocketio i got this you cant use requestsid in an HTTP view because there is no SocketIO context That only works in a SocketIO event handler i have also to avoid cheating by multiconnection Also how can i have a Ajax effect i mean refresh data displayed with destroying the connection How can i display to every clients which players are connected today just the very last one knows who is playing i have many example and tutorial but i am not able to solve this problem thanks I want to test my application against real world usage there are some tools out there like load runner and apache jmeter but they lack support for socketio I have done those Created a bare bones testing application kept sending huge chunks of data to server but this is limited by my upload speed to the internet Configured application to send huge chunks of data to the client again still limited by connections speed Is there a way to test how many users it can support Note I am using socketio to send and receive small pictures and sound files up to KB not just text
