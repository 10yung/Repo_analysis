same method since C comments use different structure Can we please document how to provide documentations for binary modules Under the heading Place role capabilities in a module there is an example This example creates a module and a module manifest The manifest includes a RootModule ContosoJEAFunctionspsm What is the purpose of this Can a PSM file ADD additional functions to a JEA session If the PSRC file defines the role what value does the root module add It would be useful to see this explained on this otherwise awesome page Document Details Do not edit this section It is required for

Technology powershellconceptual GitHub Login joeyaiello Microsoft Alias jaiello One problem I had with this sample is that it requires bit PowerShell for the ODBC driver which is fine but should be in the instructions Another problem is that it requires an olderformat Access DB format which isnt called out A much better sample would be to avoid all of that and make a sample file system provider which is unnecessary since it already exists but would be an easier to understand demonstration The instructions also dont explain that you need to do a newpsdrive command to start the provider and connect it to the MDB file With those fixes I can do a dir to see the tables but I cant dir or CD to a specific table GetParentPath crashes looking for a that doesnt exist Document Details Do not edit

resources states In addition to community resources there are builtin resources for Windows resources for Linux and resources for crossnode dependency As a technical person trying to understand the DSC big picture I have the following questions after reading the above statement What are those community resources They are mentioned here casually without linking somewhere Is there a wellknown set of community resources Or is this rather a generic term referring to any resource that might have been created by a third party there are builtin resources for Windows resources for Linux and resources for crossnode dependency what is builtin and what is not builtin Does the term builtin also refer to Linux In the subheading of the listed resources it says Linux resources builtin is missing In the resource reference left navigation node it says Linux builtin resources instead This should be made consistent Why am I harping on this Because builtin for me means I dont have to do anything Not builtin means I have to install something Is this even right What exactly is built into what How does the GitHub repository DscResources fit into the picture The repo readme states that this is a list of resources from Microsoft Is it equivalent to the builtin resources Is this the community resources Is it a different set of resources And if yes do I have to differentiate between the nonxresources and the xresources those were kind of beta if I remember correctly Looking also at Azure Automation State Configuration DSC I wonder which resources are available there in Azure Is it the builtin ones The GitHub repo ones Since the topics are somewhat connected I wished there was a hint in the right direction here And a bit fringy but also connected whats the deal with the Office DSC resource Is there a connection to the aforementioned topics or is this a project completely separated from it all My goal is to learn about the available resources for DSC know which DSC resources are from Microsoft and which ones are not learn about nonMS resources from third parties or the community if there are known places know which resources I can expect to work in Azure with Azure Automation State Configuration DSC Clarifying the above questions would help a lot Document Details Do not edit this section It is required for docsmicrosoftcom GitHub issue linking ID e a a fcd
