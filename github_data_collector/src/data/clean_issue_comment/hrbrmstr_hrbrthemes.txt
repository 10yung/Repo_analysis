Hi hrbrmstr Ive created a dark FTbased Roboto R markdown template called FT based on the existing ipsum HTML template perhaps this is useful for others as well so Ive submitted a PR It only works for HTML output a dark PDF theme doesnt really make sense IMO Upon installation it should show up as a template img width altScreen Shot at am src knitting then gives img width altScreen Shot at am src Added a new dark FTbased RMarkdown template HTML output only Updated DESCRIPTION README and NEWS accordingly Renamed Ripsumr to RRmdtemplatesr Attempting to incorporate dollar axes using the scalesdollarformat set of functions as a complement to scalescommaformat scalespercentformat I am trying to get PDF files using ggsave PNG files work correctly and display the fonts I want to use like Roboto or Arial Narrow But when I try PDF output using Acrobat Reader the PDF file properties list RobotoCondensed being used but the Actual Font as Adobe Serif See below As you can imagine its pretty ugly What could be causing this One clue is something wrong with Acrobat Reader I tried looking at the file with SumatraPDF and it showed Roboto Condensed output just fine When I was working with a LaTeX compiler the preview window also displayed the file with the correct font But not Acrobat Reader This is a problem as Reader is the most common software for reading PDFs We are contacting you because you are the maintainer of hrbrthemes which imports ggplot and uses vdiffr to manage visual test cases The upcoming release of ggplot includes several improvements to plot rendering including the ability to specify lineend and linejoin in geomrect and geomtile and improved rendering of text These improvements will result in subtle changes to your vdiffr dopplegangers when the new version is released Because vdiffr test cases do not run on CRAN by default your CRAN checks will still pass However we suggest updating your visual test cases with the new version of ggplot as soon as possible to avoid confusion You can install the development version of ggplot using remotesinstallgithubtidyverseggplot If you have any questions let me know Strip text on facetted plots is a bit hard
