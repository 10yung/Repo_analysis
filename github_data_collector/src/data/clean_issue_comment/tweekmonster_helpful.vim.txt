Hello This plugin is really useful thank you I have been wondering about writing some kind of program which can look at a vim plugin and tell you the minimum versions of vim and neovim required A bit like helpfulbufferversion as far as I can tell Do you have a feel for whether this might be fairly achievable I dont want to get sucked into a bit time commitment if possible so I thought I would ask the expert first I dont know if there is ever any reason to load it for other filetypes It seems to me that its useful only for these filetypes
