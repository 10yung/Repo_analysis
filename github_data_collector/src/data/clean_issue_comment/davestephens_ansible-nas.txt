Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe When I enabled the plex docker image for a long time I was mystified why my server was invisible to plex clients even when connecting to the server on port Turns out you need to issue some commands to register your server with plex itself This is summarized here and someone provided a script to do this For me the sequence of commands run inside the plex container using Portainer worked and now my plex server is working beautifully download the script curl L o plexclaimserversh make the script executable chmod x plexclaimserversh go to in your browser and get the claim token and replace PLEXCLAIM with this token in the next command please use use the double quotes around your claim token plexclaimserversh PLEXCLAIM Describe the solution youd like Some kind of note in the documentation that this needs to be done else the plex server wont be functional Describe alternatives youve considered None so far but Im a plex newbie What this PR does why we need it AddEnable Avahi daemon in order to broadcast hostname for mDNS resolution mDNScompatible computers will be able to resolve the NAS address through hostnamelocal It also enable autodiscovery of Samba shares by other computers on the same network Any other useful info More information on ArchLinuxs wiki Vagrant tests are now using the same file structure as regular ansible targets This way vagrant tests can act as documentation It also simplify customized deployements in Vangrant by avoiding modifying allyml Over the next few weeks once and are merged Im going to make a start on adding some new containers to ansiblenas Im going to leave a list here of the potential ones I might be working on and would like other suggestions if you dont want to raise your own issue for it or shout outs so I can prioritise if you see something you want done sooner than others Im well aware that a lot of these images Ill potentially be adding are either quite similar softwares several wiki type images photo gallery images etc or alternatives for images we already have like adding qbitorrent even though we have transmission I feel that ansiblenas would have more global appeal if the software stack were more flexible for first time users For reference Ive marked the ones I intend to work on sooner as high priority If there are requests for particular images Ill try to prioritise those too Once completed and submitted as a PR Ill edit this and strikethrough the entry Linuxserver Images These are some of the best tested easiest to use and most stable images on dockerhub Ill be aiming to add the majority of them ttpshubdockercomrlinuxservermylar high priority high priority Other Docker images Im wanting to work on integrating high priority would require testing with additional VPN providers see for issues around this container and adding it will take some work high priority I want to avoid bitnami wherever possible as they use a github hosted yml file you curl rather than letting you set up the containers the way you actually want To use their images their hosted yml would need to be replicated customised and monitored for key changes this means the images are less stable as a big update from them could break the install Having said that they have the only reliable looking phpbb docker image as above high priority suggested by Malpractis on gitter they may provide a PR with this this one might need some thought as per mailcow will need some thought simpler than the above two as it is a single container OK so this is my current list of what I think is useful software thats available in mostly popular therefore well tested images I cant guarantee that just because I listed it I can make it work Some of these are reliant at the moment on dockercompose which slightly defeats the object of ansible and Im unsure whether Im happier to rewrite the dockercompose files into ansible and attempt to maintain them against the upstream versions or whether it would be simpler to use an ansible task to envoke the dockercompose There may also be configuration issues stability issues or other unforeseen issues with any of these images So no promises Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Hello As Im understanding the purpose of Heimdall it is to provide a rich integration of supported applications running on the server and proposing an easy way to access without having to remember all the ports In this vision I find it strange that I have to remind myself the correct port to access the dashboard and ofter have to peek in the ansible files to figure it out Describe the solution youd like I wonder if Heimdall should be available on ports by default Im sure there are reasons why it hasnt been done is it security port conflict but cant think of one that would be a major blocker Im certainly missing something With mDNS support activated it makes it really conveniant to head to and get served by the Heimdall dashboard Thank you Thanks for sending a pull request Here are some tips for you If this is your first PR against AnsibleNAS please read our contributor guidelines Ensure you have tested new functionality using teststestvagrantsh If the PR is unfinished add WIP at the beginning of the title or use the Github Draft PR feature What this PR does why we need it Which issue if any this PR fixes Fixes Any other useful info A little bit of tidying up We shouldnt ever be using XXXroot in tasksyml Tested in VM and working ready to merge Opening this as an issue since I dont have time to troubleshoot it at the moment Currently the ZNC docker fails with unrecoverable config error I believe this is because we are missing the docker run it v znccfgzncdata znc makeconf step Potentially znc will need a template Fix As we are likely moving to a version of ansiblenas that should be much more updatable without needing to merge changes to the allyml file manually we should be in a position where we never need to edit the tasksyml files Ive needed to tweak some of the memory limit settings on the containers and being able to tweak the restart policies is very useful when you have a misbehaving container
