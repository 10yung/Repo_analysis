Instructions how to build the fonts from source These are a handful of links about variable fonts If Gidole is to tread the variable fonts path it could hopefully address and other variantrelated issues While using the font in a web application any combination of char e g a or x results in a character with a grave accent There are similar issues with a caret ie sign in combination with another character The issue is very much similar to the one described here regarding the noto sans fonts Ive included the typeface as follows css fontface fontfamily Gidole src urlfontsGidoleGidoleRegularttf formattruetype fontweight normal fontstyle normal Using Noto Sans screenshot from Using Gidole screenshot from Interestingly this issue only pertains to the ttf fonts available for download The Gidole homepagemakes use of a woff variant of Gidole hosted here that does not suffer the same problem Dear Larsenwork Your fonts Gidole and Gidolinya are absolutely amazing Will you be able to convert them into web fonts against a payment Kind regards Francis Gidolinyas curves and fixedwidth would make it useful as a single line font for engraving using CNC machining and drawing animations Most vector programs can only convert text to outlines and there is no simple method to convert glyph outlines to a single stroke I found some techniques to trace the centerline path though none of these would properly preserve the Euler spirals of the Gidolinya letters and are not elegant solutions Any ideas on how to achieve this with SVG paths Ive run into a weird issue with the font where there is insufficient clearing between the sapostrophes single quotation mark and neighbouring glyphs Ive seen this across several apps as shown in the image below Interestingly IE and Wordpad seem to render the sapostrophes single quotation mark with the correct spacing I dont know whether its a quirk with the font rendering system or whether its something with the font itself Anyone else can replicate this issue Platform Windows image edit its actually the single quotation mark not the apostrophe We currently use a similar font that doesnt have nearly as many weights would love to have a rounded version though Hi I like your Gidole font I had to look up what DIN was though because Im not a font expert So I suggest here a quick explanation and also a link to your Gidole website Cheers Benson Gardner Hi The font looks very nice but I couldnt fond it on any CDN There are two common used CDNs where one can place Gidole for free and By creating additional small files the next versions of Gidole published on GitHub will be automatically posted to the CDNs Everything is very easy and I could help in doing it if it would be required One need just add the Gidole files to the corresponding GitHub repositories orand via a pull request Best wishes Oleg Hi Andreas Thanks for the great font Ive used it for French documents its awesome Will you add later ligatures support Have a nice day smiley
