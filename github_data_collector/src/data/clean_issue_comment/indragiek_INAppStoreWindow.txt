I use the default traffic light buttons on OSX For some strange reason when I do beginSheet on my app and show an NSWindow the traffic light buttons go to the top Right now the height is on the titleBar Is there a way to fix this This problem reproduce with the latest code And some app such as SoureTree WeChat has the problem alsoreason and solution as below The problem caused by the call of convertBaseToScreenINAppStoreWindowm line it works well if caculate the offset of window move without the convert NSPoint now window convertBaseToScreentheEventlocationInWindow NSPoint now NSEvent mouseLocation Hi Where do I start to add this to my existing project I havent found a guide yet Thanks To reproduce Set System Preferences General Appearance to Graphite Run SampleApp Note that traffic lights are monochrome in other apps but colorful in SampleApp When using INAppStoreWindow in a document based application on the window theme widgets are positioned incorrectly briefly when showing a sheet I tracked down the cause of the issue and unfortunately the only place to hook into NSWindow to correct the behavior is in voidupdateCollectionBehavior So the fix I have in place looks like this voidupdateCollectionBehavior super updateCollectionBehavior self layoutTrafficLightsAndContent Of course the problem here is that the method is private and therefore may cause problems with App Store applications Faced with trouble with one user that runs yosemite with NSAppKitVersionNumber which is less than in code I think you should better detect OSX version via NSFoundationVersionNumber objectivec floorNSFoundationVersionNumber NSFoundationVersionNumber Hello i have a question titlebar Is this a bug I change the color for the title text but the color for Document Edited State Title Edited does not change Im looking for a solution for the problem hope someone can help Ive run my app built on Xcode on Yosemite and Ive noticed that the three buttons in the topleft are positioned incorrectly they sit in the topleft part of the title bar like in standard apps and they jump to centerleft of the bar when the window is moved Is this a known issue or something youve fixed on master If we are full screen then move them where we expect them to be On Yosemite when the window is in full screen mode the window buttons are on a different window other than the INAppStoreWindow If we set the frames of window buttons they disappear from the floating titlebar when the mouse is moved up to the menu The patch fixes the issue by checking if the window buttons are in a normal window
