while xaxis moves forward the line will dangle up and down This is shown in the sample picture also github sample As noted in I have added the required css Anything more I have a graph with lines The scale of each line is very different and the scale varies for different users Hence I want to allow the user to scale the data using a slider This part works perfectly and I am able to update the values However now I want my label to be changed so that it reflects the scale For eg if original label was frequency and it was scaled by I want the label to be frequency How can I do the same Hi In the current setup the only way to attach extra information like some description to each point is to use annotations The major issue with this is that when the mouse is hovering on top of points the corresponding annotations are not displayed when there are a lot of points and there is an annotation per point its practically impossible to determine which annotation corresponds to which point My request is to either automatically display annotation when hovering over the points or enable attaching another field extrainfo per data point and when the mouse hovers a point display extrainfo in a div which is specified by the user Note Thanks for this library ASR If we expect opacity to be a number when seriesopacity these ternaries would be falsey and set seriesopacity to by default Check to
