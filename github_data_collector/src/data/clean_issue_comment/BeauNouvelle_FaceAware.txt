Can I use this for tvOS When focusOnFaces is set When layoutSubviews is called Face detection is already quite expensive on resources and to double up on that just isnt acceptable especially with the number of apps out there now using this library Would be cool to also zoom to the face so that the headneckshoulders is visible Great for Avatars
