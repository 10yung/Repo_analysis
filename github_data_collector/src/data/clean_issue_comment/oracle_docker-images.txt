containerregistryoraclecommiddlewareweblogic repository does not exist or may require docker login denied requested access to the resource is denied Hello First off thanks for the great image Im having a couple issue some which i could solve but wanted to report and some I havent been able to solve yet The container is running on Windows First Issue I encountered was once I Stopped the container starting was implossible Once I found your website I noticed the docker stop t command this wasnt included in the readme but solved it for me The other issue is I cannot connect using sqlplus as sysdba using it results in password request docker exec it c bash sqlplus as sysdba SQLPlus Release Production on Thu Jan Version Copyright c Oracle All rights reserved ERROR ORA TNSnet service name is incorrectly specified Enter username Now this is a small issue as I can connect using oracle c ba ab ORACLEHOMEbinsqlplus s systempasswordlocalhost ORCLCDB as sysdba select from dual without ORACLEHOMEbinsqlplus s I cannot connect My final problem is I cannot seem to be able to change the MAXSTRINGSIZE Steps taken ALTER SESSION SET CONTAINERCDBROOT ALTER SYSTEM SET maxstringsizeextended SCOPESPFILE shutdown normal Once the DB is shutdown it get the message that SQL PLus is no longer connected Trying to reconnect is impossible ORA TNSnet service name is incorrectly specified Help would really be appreciatedwhat am I doing wrong Relates to issue If unable to test for supported Docker version test for supported Podman version If errors are encountered at any stage exit For background of podmanbuildah see Buildah libs in Podman have had multistage build support for some time but improvements were made in and its as good a place to start as any The first podman RPM shipped with OL included buildah libs so it could be raised to that version I may have overcomplicated it let me know your thoughts Hi I successfully built the docker image for OracleDatabase se The issue is when I start it Ive tried this on different machines on a Mac and one a Linux system and in both cases it takes more than minutes to start I started it with docker run p p e ORACLESIDxwiki e ORACLEPDBxwikipdb e ORACLEPWDxwiki oracledatabase se note I also tried by mapping a local directory for the DB files with the same slow result The part that is extremely slow is this part Prepare for db operation complete Copying database files complete Creating and starting Oracle instance complete complete complete complete complete Completing Database Creation complete complete Creating Pluggable Databases complete complete Executing Post Configuration Actions complete We used to use a Oracle g docker image execute test XWiki on it to validate that we support the Oracle DB and it was working ok about mn to start it Wed like to validate against a more recent version which is why Ive been trying using version for the past days However with a startup time of minutes its impossible for us to use it for our tests We start and stop the container hundreds of times across all our test suite hundreds if not thousands of tests across different modules So some questions Is that startup expected Is that what everyone is experiencing I should note that the machines on which I tried it are quite large and beefy machines with lots of CPU and RAM and I didnt put any resource limits Is there something that can be done to speed it up so that it starts in about minutes Thanks a lot Vincent XWiki open source commmitter Verifying OS Kernel Parameter semopm FAILED

but a docker image that requires minutes to start is just plain ridicules And unusable Images of MySQL Aurora Postgres etc all start and are available in seconds At the heart of this is the fact that you think its ok to createconfigure the database during docker run instead of docker build The database should be created and configured during docker build I dont understand why you believe this is not an option Just use dynamic listener registration instead of a listenerora file and the dynamic docker hostname should be detected and used at startup time Has it ever been considered to support Oracle readonly home in combination with Docker read only root fs Build the docker image and set ORACLEHOMEbinroohctl enable Define tmpfs bind mounts or volumes for the usual suspects eg var tmp ORACLEBASEhomes ORACLEBASEdbs ORACLEBASEaudit ORACLEBASEcfgtoollogs alternatively adjust the move script to include the dbs audit and homes folder Regards Stefan After opening this issue I have managed to automate anyhow the creation of users and tables during the container startup I understand that my action is not contemplated by the creators of image databaseenterprise slim and I will accept that you do not take in charge this issue The new users are callable if I access the container with docker exec it XXXXXXXX bash and invoke sqlplus from the command line giving their username and password The db on the container is working perfectly as far as I can see Things are different starting sqldeveloper from my PC and connecting the db in the container I cannot manage to create new connections as the couples usernamepassword that work fine in sqlplus cause an ORA invalid usernamepassword logon denied User SYSTEM continues to work flawlessly I have created this question on Stack Overflow specifying all the details of my actions and I would appreciate if you could comment on that Test result using and
