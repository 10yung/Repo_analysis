for including to upstream but anyway you may consider it When you link a picture you can see directly from the chat without opening it As of my understanding they are stored within the chat because even after the picture is deleted I can still see it Is there a way to download them with the tool The idea is to add a filter parameter that allows you to choose whether a Filetype is going to be backuped or ignored So that you can download only Documents type Images type Video Type or a combination of those but ignore the rest The program detects the filetypes as long as I have seen in the debug logs Is that really possible nowadays I have started using it very recently and perhaps have missed it Thanks for your job really useful and necessary Because now its a Kotlin app v video is not downloaded and there should be an option to download any specific chat It would be great if telegrambackup could have an option to use the real file name eg greatFilemp instead of being named after the ID of the message just works time to update While downloading the media the tool crashed with this error It crashed because it tried to create a file with a character in it thats banned from being used in filenames on windows See here for more info An error occured javaioFileNotFoundException REDACTED files REDACTEDsomethingdownloading The syntax of the file volume or directory is not correct
