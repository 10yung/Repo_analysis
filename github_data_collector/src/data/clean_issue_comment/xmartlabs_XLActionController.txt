Hi I noticed if calculated contentHeight in ActionController we didnt use collectionViewcontentInsetbottom I think its not correct For example you can see DynamicsActionController that it uses collectionViewcontentInsetbottom for calculate contentHeight But both this class use setUpContentInsetForHeight So now var topInset height contentHeight safeAreaInsetsbottom for ActionController ignore collectionViewcontentInsetbottom and the alert attache to SafeArea without a inset I tried to fix it i set Device Orientation is Portrait but when the XLActionController show it can auto rotate i use PeriscopeActionController style but PeriscopeActionController is not open class i cant override it i must add these code to class ActionController swift override open var supportedInterfaceOrientations UIInterfaceOrientationMask get return portrait i use these code swift let bottomPadding UIApplicationsharedkeyWindowsafeAreaInsetsbottom if bottomPadding print actionControllercollectionViewboundsheight UIScreenmainboundsheight bottomPadding let bottomView UIViewframe CGRectx y actionControllercollectionViewboundsheight bottomPadding width UIScreenmainboundswidth height bottomPadding bottomViewbackgroundColor white actionControllercollectionViewbackgroundViewaddSubviewbottomView I found a layout issue in Spotifys action controller you can see it if you run the example on iPhone Pro in simulator and in section Spotify also Ill send a screenshot for more info info the Start radio button is under cancel button img width altScreen Shot at PM src Any chance to add support to SPM hi i want the background color of the dismisscancel action button and the safe area to be the same how to do it Before submitting issues Make sure you are using XLActionController latest release or master branch version Make sure your Xcode version is the latest stable one Check if the issue was already reported or fixed We add labels to each issue in order to easily find related issues If you found a match add a brief comment I have the same problem or When submitting issues please provide the following information to help maintainers to fix the problem faster Environment XLActionController Xcode and iOS version you are using In case of reporting errors provide Xcode console output of stack trace or code compilation error Any other additional detail such as example code that you think it would be useful to understand reproduce and solve the problem Having the option to specify accessibility labels and accessibility identifiers would not only make this project more usable in projects that need to cater to users with handicaps but would also simplify UI testing in projects using XLActionController This adds support for SwiftPM manifest based dependency managers Specifically this adds support for installing via Accio but will probably also work with SwiftPM once its integrated into Xcode Please note that this project is part of Accios official integration tests within the Demo project How to disable this animation effect I want to remove the padding that happen when the XLActionController is presented I provided an image below img width altScreen Shot at PM src Xcode version I am using and XLActionController last version
