 Issue Summary The documentation for migrating forked apps from version x to version is incorrect It states that the name attribute of the AppConfig subclass in appspy should be renamed to namespace but this is not correct and in fact doing this means that the forked version of the app is no longer used Issue Summary When a ProductAttribute with type boolean is set to requiredTrue it requires any underlyingProductAttributeValue to be set to True otherwise the Product youre trying to createchange wont save in the dashboard I dont think the required field makes sense for a boolean field in this case A Boolean field could still be False but be required to be filled in as False Its all a bit confusing It makes sense purely on a form where you might need to check a checkbox to submit the form But in this case its a field in a database thats required Steps to Reproduce Go to dashboard On any ProductType defined add an Attribute with type True False and set the Required field to True Create a new product with this ProductType and set the attribute on the product to False The dashboard interface says its required to be set to True and as such the option for False is not possible Proposed solution Dont allow ProductAttributes with type boolean to be set to requiredTrue Technical details Ive tested this on an older Python version But couldnt find any reference of a fix for this in the

Breadcrumbs for child products are not properly generated because the child product is not assigned to any categories The template should use the parent products categories if it is a child product Issue Summary Writing to products attributes with productattr can lead to data loss Steps to Reproduce Create a productclass with attributes the second one you create must be optional Create a product and do not fill the second optional attribute Now write to the nonoptional attributes with code like this p Productobjectsgetpk pattrsubtitle lama pattravailable False pattrsave One of the attributes
