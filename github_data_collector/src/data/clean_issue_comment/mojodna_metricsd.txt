Currently every histogram creates the following metrics percentile percentile percentile percentile percentile max mean median min stddev How can I change this list to say only feature percentile max mean median min The prefix config variable only changes the prefix for the sample metric Has the added benefit of now using the same prefix for the sample metric as for the other metrics was metricsd vs metrics MetricsD is unable to parse the following metric FooWebServiceHostQueueWorkerExternalAnalyticsEventMessagePendingMessages g ERROR netmojodnametricsdserverMetricsServiceHandler Exception in MetricsServiceHandler scalaMatchError FooWebServiceHostQueueWorkerExternalAnalyticsEventMessagePendingMessages g of class javalangString at netmojodnametricsdserverMetricsServiceHandleranonfunmessageReceived applyMetricsServiceHandlerscala at netmojodnametricsdserverMetricsServiceHandleranonfunmessageReceived applyMetricsServiceHandlerscala at scalacollectionIndexedSeqOptimizedclassforeachIndexedSeqOptimizedscala at scalacollectionmutableArrayOpsforeachArrayOpsscala at netmojodnametricsdserverMetricsServiceHandlermessageReceivedMetricsServiceHandlerscala at orgjbossnettychannelChannelsfireMessageReceivedChannelsjava at orgjbossnettyhandlercodeconeoneOneToOneDecoderhandleUpstreamOneToOneDecoderjava at orgjbossnettychannelChannelsfireMessageReceivedChannelsjava at orgjbossnettychannelsocketnioNioDatagramWorkerreadNioDatagramWorkerjava at orgjbossnettychannelsocketnioAbstractNioWorkerprocessAbstractNioWorkerjava This separates out the timer metrics into their own category because codahale metrics collects timers as both a histogram on the time and a meter on the rate If the prefix is set to hostname the metricsd statistics will be prefixed by the first two words of the FQDN of the hostname At chegg thats hostnameenvironment Either via syslog or HTTP using l met measure elements more When I send some very big values and then send normal values the percentiles wont change to normal sometimes in a very long time See the image The yellow line is the values Im sending and the blue line is percentile And I suppose it should decline after the peak As histograms are biased to the last min data values But the percentile is a fixed value for a long time After about min it declines In my real usage when there is a very very very high peak this kind of impact will be much longer for many days percentile keeps to be a fixed value Would it be better if percentiles can be configured to be based on past few minutes instead of using the biased algorithm from Metrics example When a gauge hasnt been updated its value should be reported as rather than its most recent value When metricsd starts up it should load current counter values from carbon Graphite
