I saw this functionality in TagUi and wanted to ask if it would be here Operating system and bit MacOS Catalina Description Is it possible with robotgo to get the selected text in MacOS Ideally I want to be able to select a text somewhere on screen browser editor maybe even terminal and then press a special key combination to do something special with that text Performing an action on a specific
