First thank you for such a useful package I am not familiar to bitstamp data so have this question I assume extdata logxz is the raw market data recording it already has trades in it Why does the package spend time on inferring the trades from orders img width altScreen Shot at PM src the inferred trades count is img width altScreen Shot at PM src parsesh explicitly filters trades and generates the orderscsv img width altScreen Shot at PM src the log has trades which is different from number of inferred trades the individual orders and trades are usually directly provided by exchanges so why does the package spend time on inferring trades from orders Bitstamp provides APIs for Live Orders and Live Ticker ie trades as described here Sometimes Live Orders API outputs incorrect data as shown below Here is the trade record received from Live Ticker API The record contains price and amount of trade as well as buy and sell order IDs Here is the records from Live Orders API for orders participated in the above trade both screenshots are taken from PostgreSQL database where the data received from API are saved Correct row corresponds to sell order fill column equals to trade amount timing is ok etc Incorrect row corresponds to the buy order It is incorrect because it reports the cancellation of the buy order for amount column didnt change comparing to the previous event for the order That is equivalent to zero fill no trade Thus processData function should probably handle the data from both APIs together to produce reliable results These orders are shown as long stripes default The picture showing correct depth default An order that started out as a market order came to rest in the order book and has not been filled since then is classified as market instead of marketlimit Below is an excerpt from Example limit order book data lobdataevents showing changed events for market orders that do not have a corresponding limit order event matchingevent equals NA It appears that the trades corresponding to the above events are missing from lobdatatrades The total number of market and marketlimit events with matchingevent equals NA is while the number of trades in lobdatatrades is Thus approximately of trades are missing processing csv Warning messages In matchTradesevents jumps swaping makers with takers In deleted deletedid in createddeletedids volume created createdid in longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length In setOrderTypesevents trades could not identify orders recently made available by IEX full depth of their order book
