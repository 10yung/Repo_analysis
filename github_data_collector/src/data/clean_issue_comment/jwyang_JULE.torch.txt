 jwyang hi when i try to use this file deepseminmfnonlinearm I found it fail to run due to missing function deeprecon Could you help me with this problem thx I have spent one day on configuring the environment for your torch code when i go to the last step ie install luaknn it failed Whats the problem Im so tired Do you have the dataset YTF Could you privide it for me if you hadThanks Hi Thank you for the code I had a doubt regarding the Affinity function used in the reformulated losseq From what I understand after computing the triplets by organizesamples function they are fed to the criteriontriplet to get the loss In TripletEmbeddinglua are the Affinities Axixj and Axixk in eq represented by deltapos and deltanet I am a bit confused because I could not see the actual Affinity functioncalculated in the aggclusteringc and as mentioned Graph Degree Linkage paper to be used while calculating the loss Thanks Hi I see that in the organizesamples function you are using trainingDatalabels Should I pass arbitrary value if I dont have labels Lalit If we want to use this package but not using GPU drivers whats the best solution The luaknn package is specifically for GPU and the only other package I found is which I have not been able to figure out how to install the makefile just looks like a test suite and its not included in luarocks despite being referred to by the official docs Best option I can think of right now is to code the knn myself In the lines aggclusteringc file you first get the length of cluster i and cluster j which are saved in Yisize Yjsize respectively But I am confused that you use THTensorget dY j n to call the element Y jn in which the maximum of n is Yjsize but the column size of Y is Ysize There is only class in my clustering result when I run my data classes It is an urgent question Please help me as soon as possible Thank you I look forward to your reply as soon as possible Thank you Hi I find this paper to be very interesting Im part of a research program at the University of Barcelona and we want to try this network for Egocentric vision we have our dataset in a folder structure were each folder represents a category in our case daily activities I have no experience working with hd f files can you please help me with the code to create the h file Also do you think that JULE will work with egocentric vision Thank you for your time and good work ow can I use your trained model to extract imagemy dataset features then save them for further clustering Thank you in advance for the answer
