Fix vague translations I am implementing a simple integration with with the Pymunk physics engine and I am wondering if you have any interest to integrate it with pyxel as an optional module eg pyxelphys or if should I keep it as a separate project installable using pip What currently works Functions to draw pymunkShapes using pyxel rendering engine API to create pymunk objects using functions similar to the ones in pyxel eg physrect physline phystri physcirc An automatic mainloop for users that simply want to run the simulation without any game interaction akin to pyxelshow What I may implement in the future Creation of joints motors etc Integrating texts and images Simple event system to register collisions and physics events Simple scheduler to manage animations and events

problem is Im always frustrated when trying to rotate pyxelbltI may be very new to Python but not coding and I cant figure out how to rotate this image Ive created and loaded properly into the engine because of a lack of documentation Can I wrap a pyxel object specificially the BLT function to rotate and manipulate at will without using the pyxeleditor because there is insufficient documentation on how to make it work as well In two days Ive waded through a lot of code and nothing is written well enough at the moment I just want to make a spaceship with a vector and that can spin on at the center of its location Retro asteroids or a retro version of Geometry Wars is my end goal Describe the solution youd like A clear and concise description of what you want to happen I would like to rotate or find all the coordinates of pyxelblt objects Should I use numpy or another engine Describe alternatives youve considered A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered To rotatepyxelblt and within my rotate class calculating all the new coordinates like a picture or D object is my dream but at least find all points of my pyxelblt object or image and manipulate how I wish within my window Ive managed to rotate my spaceship around a point or any given points I want but it always faces up and I could potentially use bltx y img u v w h colkey and then negate W and negate H to create the illusion of graphic spinning upside down and mirroring vertically But I would like to avoid this as it would potentially make my code unusable in the future Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here Please more documentation on how to use Tilemap and Pyxel Editor and thank you so much so far everything looks so good but I cant manipulate it well enough for my specific liking I believe updating documentation maybe to say this works as a linear game instead of a D game would be an important thing to note Im sorry if I sound mean but Im very new to Python and almost done with my game This is a post for communicating with the translators of the documents Hello I was developing a game with pyxel today And I found a bug when using tilemapget I thought it might have happened because of the complex code in the game and I experimented with simple test code but I got the same error test code
