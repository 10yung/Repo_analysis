im pretty sure this is useful right Using ZSH on Debian after loading the BASH completions file in zshrc trying to autocomplete msm commands results in an error I have ZSH loading the completions file with the following lines at the end of my zshrc autoload U X compinit compinit autoload U X bashcompinit bashcompinit source etcbashcompletiondmsm When I try to complete a command by typing console sudo msm tab I get console sudo msm etcinitdmsm parse error near msm command not found managerproperty sudo msm all config help jargroup restart server start stop update version Further tab presses allow me to select an option but further garbage is output to the prompt Im starting out setting up a Spigot server and Im trying to figure which version of Minecraft Server Manager I should use anybody know Thanks The server runs fine but logs arent being created Changing the permissions of the log directory doesnt seem to do anything I just saw a very simple PR from that is still open on this project The last commit was from last year Does this project need assistance Is it dead Are people using alternatives Thanks When trying to set a server config value the sed replacement could fail causing the value to not be set For example here I am trying to set a server specific config for the invocation of the java command with the jar argument pointing to a test jar in my home directory msm mcnewb config msminvocation java XmsRAMM XmxRAMM XXAggressiveOpts jar homeinstestserverjar nogui sed e expression char unknown option to s Here is the current sed line The expansion of the value variable is breaking the sed replacement pattern because it is using as the pattern delimiter The at the start of the jar path appears as an additional unknown option to the search s command Here is a simplified sed replacement that uses instead of as the pattern delimiter which allows the value to contain slashes sed i s g SERVERCONF The default java invocation uses unrecognized CMSIncrementalPacing and deprecated UseConcMarkSweepGC VM options under Java From the etcmsmconf file DEFAULTINVOCATIONjava XmsRAMM XmxRAMM XXUseConcMarkSweepGC XXCMSIncrementalPacing XXAggressiveOpts jar JAR nogui When trying to start the server it would say Starting server Done but it doesnt actually start Because java doesnt even start up nothing is sent to the log file which made it very confusing on why it was failing When manually running the command I am shown the actual error message java Xms M Xmx M XXUseConcMarkSweepGC XXCMSIncrementalPacing XXAggressiveOpts jar optmsmserversfooserverjar nogui OpenJDK Bit Server VM warning Option UseConcMarkSweepGC was deprecated in version and will likely be removed in a future release Unrecognized VM option CMSIncrementalPacing Error Could not create the Java Virtual Machine Error A fatal exception has occurred Program will exit This is on a fresh install of Ubuntu Server with apt install defaultjdk and apt install defaultjre installing Java v java version openjdk version OpenJDK Runtime Environment build Ubuntu ubuntu OpenJDK Bit Server VM build Ubuntu ubuntu mixed mode When I ran the command again but without the XXUseConcMarkSweepGC XXCMSIncrementalPacing arguments the server started up without issue Since Java is now the default version it is likely more people are going to encounter this issue Suggestions Check the java version and if it is then dont use these options The asuser function should log a message if the su command fails The asuser function or the serverstart function should capture stderr to the log when trying to start the server just in case there are problems like this msm jargroup getlatest minecraft Downloading latest version Checking minecraft version JSON su jq command not found Done Failed No files were downloaded Any ideas I already tried creating a fresh new jargroup using minecraft in place of the URL Much thanks sudo msm theworld jar minecraft Downloading latest version Checking minecraft version JSON Done Failed No files were downloaded All from the auto installation Permissions seem fine Installing wget via yum on RedHat to allow the script to bootstrap itself Also added binsh to touched files
