I have a class subclassing TextView Using rialto does not seem to work there as string resource annotation processing isnt invoked there as the TextView subclass isnt converted to a RialtoTextView during View inflation And as RialtoTextView is final I cannot subclass that one instead of plain TextView to make it work Is there a specific reason why RialtoTextView is final From what I can see this would also affect subclasses of Button and EditText
