hello everyone First congratulations for this great idea I successfully ran the example in this repository that launched my default browser and rendered the app Now I would like to packaging the shiny files before desktopdeploying it For that I included a launchApp function when packaging launchApp function shinyshinyAppui server This package lets say MyPackage could be attached and the function launcApp can launch the app manually in the R terminal Then I manually add this package into the applibrary and changed the appR function as MyPackagelaunchApp Once the appnamebat is launched the browser opened and closed automatically What did I miss Grateful if you could guide me on how to packaging first the shiny files before desktopdeploying it Thank you Hello everybody I have trouble using globalR I defined some constants there and saved the file as proposed in the application structure in appshinyglobalR But when starting the app the defined constants are not accessible Do I have to tell shiny to load globalR Hello Lee Pang Thank you so much for creating this framework I managed to deploy it successfully on my Windows desktop However when I transferred the program files to a secured environment the program stops after it reaches the file in distscriptwsfjsrunjs The following steps were logged bat file was allowed to run distscriptwsfrunwsf was allowed to run distscriptwsfjsjson js was allowed to run distscriptwsfjsjsonminifyjs was allowed to run distscriptwsfjsrunjs was allowed to run The process terminates afterwards Wanted to check if the runjs file requires any additional configurations or external dependenciesspecial settings Cheers For instance devtoolsinstallgithubrepo garthtarrpairsD ref e fd ac c bc c d eaea instead of devtoolsinstallgithubrepo garthtarrpairsD This is helpful for packages changing at a fast pace and to ensure robustness over changes and reproducibility of scientific computations Would it be helpful to use packrat packrat For instance allow something like devtoolsinstallgithubrepo garthtarrpairsD Add an example iss compiler configuration for InnoSetup so that users have a starting point for building an installer for deployment Implement configurable options to allow users to disable logging entirely specify what is logged stdout stderr stdout stderr Hello thanks for your work My question is if it is possible to use your solution to open an gWidgets tcltk App I tried and can see the Desktop App for half a second but then it closes again by itself with the last log message Application terminated normally Thank you for any hint Great idea Im definitely going to play with it Unfortunately most of my clients trust me to do the R they just want answers Thought when an app is deployed to the client there is an assumption that things work as they did when the app was deployed Unfortunately if you automatically update installed packages this might break things What do you think about checkpoint dependency handling either always or some mechanism for opting in For instance packages that make significant changes to the function names defaults or API often increment the packages major number a simple upgrade will see a higher number and update regardless of the untested ramifications this will have on the other deployed packages As much as I dont use checkpoint for my normal use its because I control my own environment When I give it to clients I can only assume that they will keep using it well beyond the timeline I foresaw or agreed by which time some dependencies will have made huge changes to their API Hello First of all let me congratulate you on putting the different pieces together and make it easier to deploy RShiny to non RUser This is more of a question rather than an issue Is it possible to generalize this framework to work on other OS eg OSX and Ubuntu Does Rportable exist for nonwindows os Cheers
