Recently I was looking at the paper entitled Convolutional neural network architecture for geometric matching However when I implemented the neural network mentioned in the article I encountered a problemHow do you generate a random affine matrix When I used your generated matrices I trained of the PCK on the network but when I tried to use my randomly generated matrix PCK became and I could not believe it I really want to know how you guys did it Can anyone answer me hi when i run the demotrain It appear The FILTERS depth does not divide the DATA depth I have try to solve it for many days and dont get the solution Could you help me
