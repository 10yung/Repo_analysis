server fe JRE Oracle Corporation on Linux el x Deployment rpm OS CentOS Linux Core centos Arch amd This adds a missing DateTimeUtilssetCurrentMillisSystem to avoid a sporadic test failure in DBJobTriggerServiceTest The SearchesCleanUpJobWithDBServicesTest is using DateTimeUtilssetCurrentMillisFixed to set the time to a specific value This requires the usage of DateTimeUtilssetCurrentMillisSystem to reset the time to the current time Otherwise tests running in the same JVM using the current time might fail I noticed that the DBJobTriggerServiceTestdeleteCompleted test method failed from time to time on a new Jenkins worker machine This is probably due to a changed execution order because the machine is faster than the older worker machine Still strange that it didnt show up earlier Store Alert search timerange and Event type Alert Event Both in local storage letting users come back to the page and have the same

desired details I had a look at Context menu for fields is off in search sidebar for long field names and could not really find a dynamic solution We are using reactwindow to render only a part of the probably large field list The related list component needs to render the list items with position absolute Which means there is no elegant way to define a dynamic width for the list There is also no way to have list items with a dynamic height otherwise wrapping the list items would be a possible solution Another possible solution is setting the Dropdown placement to bottom It would fix the described behaviour but is not working perfectly for list items near the bottom of the browser window I also prefer a consistent placement of the field action context menu The only workaround I can image right now is setting the list width based on the field with the longest title but this solution requires some not so dynamic calculation and feels kind of hacky Because we plan to implement an overlay solution which opens the context menu near the cursor increasing the lists width seems to be the most pragmatic solution right now This works for field names with a length of up to characters
