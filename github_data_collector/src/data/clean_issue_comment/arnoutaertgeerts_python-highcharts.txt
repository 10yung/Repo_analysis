The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

downloads its v release saw massive adoption The year was also one of collaboration as discussions began on merging Lodash Underscore Much of Lodash v is proofing out the ideas from those discussions Lodash v would not be possible without the collaboration contributions of the Underscore core team In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with several members contributing to both libraries For lodash v we wanted to cut loose push forward take things up a notch Modern only With v we re breaking free from old projects old environments dropping old IE support kB Core Lodash s kitchensink size will continue to grow as new methods functionality are added However we now offer a kB gzipped core build that s compatible with Backbone v for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink More ES We ve continued to embrace ES with methods like isSymbol added support for cloning comparing array buffers maps sets symbols converting iterators to arrays iterable In addition we

This is a very good project why dont you update it chartsplotseriesseriesoptionsoptionsheight showinlinetypebar I drew a chart in Jupyter Notebook and the chart seems to be too small I tried to change the height attribute but nothing changed How to solve this problem Sorry for asking a basic question is it possible to create charts like this Hi Arnout Can you point me to an example that shows how to add annotations to a timeseries chart highstock I have been struggling to get this to work but so far nothing yet The data is in the following format values flags Timestamp OK FAULTYZERO FAULTYZERO OK OK This is what I have been doing so far dfresult validationexecutezeroreads print dfresult flags valuecounts flags dicttypeflags data dictxstrk titlev for k v in dfresultiterrows if v OK options dicttitletest annotationsflags chartsplotdfresult optionsoptions showinline stockTrue I want to show the non OK flags only from the flags column with a label showing up just above the value in the chart thanks for your help Regards Edwin It is a great package it is common in high stock that plot lines which share x axis using multipane for example yaxis line range and line range e e in this case the two line could not be in one pane because y range differs too much Cant seem to find a way to hide Search bar Settings button Exporting traditional way through highcharts config does not work no option in settings Watermark same as above Are any of these possible Im trying to add some drilldown and was wondering if its supported or am i doing it wrong i suspect the latter Using python ipython pip pip install charts ipython In import charts ImportError Traceback most recent call last ipythoninput eb a e in module import charts Usersajpanaconda libpython sitepackageschartsinitpy in module version from plot import plot plotasync line area spline pie from server import runserver ImportError cannot import name plot Is there something Im doing wrong Can I help fix something I was hoping to use this in Jupyter Do you think this would be possible
