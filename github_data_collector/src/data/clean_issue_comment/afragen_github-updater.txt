I cant connect to my private bitbucket theme and plugins I tried to change my BB app password and enter that into the Github updater settings page but it will not save them but revert to the old bitbucker loginpw Even after deleting the plugin reinstalling and also deleting the corresponding item in the database itself it STILL reverts to the old bitbucket loginpw Even changing the settings in the database directly wont work Im having an issue connecting to an enterprise Bitbucket server None of my themes and plugins can connect to the server I have tried setting the Bitbucket URI with these formats I have entered my username and password of course None of the themes or plugins can connect to their repos as you can see by the red mark I copied a multisite to a different domain changed the urls and everything GitHub Updater was already installed and then removed the old theme and plugin and reinstalled it with GitHub Updater Everything went fine at first installed theme plugin from GitLab but now now idea what changed i cant see the plugin and theme in the GitHup Updater configuration Also when i try to reinstall them the third input for the access token is not appearing so i cant reinstall Clearing cache doesnt help and when i activate the change branch option save it deactivate it and try saving again i get an Warning arraymerge Expected parameter to be an array null given in wpcontentpluginsgithubupdatersrcGitHubUpdaterSettingsphp on line Warning Any idea where i can start looking for the configuration data of GitHub Updater and maybe figure out if sth is missing This originated from a Slack conversation with sc ttkclark It s probably easier to contain the conversation here In thinking about how to engineer this solution it might be best to add to the class CLIIntegration with a couple of new commands plugin branchswitchgit and theme branchswitchgit with similar arguments as plugin installgit Install was easier as we already had that class UpdateBranch switch might be a little trickier There s no class currently for it Perhaps use the URL for branch switching and send to a wpremotepost Not sure I have created a GitHub Updater team for Slack Anyone can join and any member can send out invites Any member may create a new channel Please lets keep actual issues here but any other discussion should take place in Slack Please click here for an invite The golden rule applies Everything is quite unrestricted at the moment If I find the need to restrict something I will let everyone know I hope you all choose to participate I enjoy the feedback and the engagement GitHub Updater is now dogfooding its own Language Pack updates Translation files reside in a separate repo Translators The main plugin will always contain the most recent POT file as will the official Language Pack repo Im getting prepared for the next release and many new strings have been added Please make PRs to afragengithubupdatertranslations Well I think Ive gotten TravisCI working and now all I need are some unit tests to make this work This is a great opportunity to contribute Thanks Im going to need some help with this
