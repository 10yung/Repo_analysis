 In working around I set the WAKATIMEHOME environment variable to a directory like HOMElocalsharewakatime At the same time I moved wakatimecfg wakatimedb wakatimelog into this directory When I next started Atom I saw an error message that my API key was not found In the Atom settings view I reentered my API key I noticed the file HOMEwakatimecfg was created while WAKATIMEHOMEwakatimecfg was not modified It seems that when atomwakatime invokes the wakatime Python core the latter correctly picks up WAKATIMEHOME so that the db and log files are modified in the correct directory But the Atom plugin reads and writes the cfg file in the wrong place Searching the code in this repo shows that the environment variable is not used For now I work around this issue with a symlink ln s HOMElocalsharewakatimewakatimecfg HOMEwakatimecfg Ive combed through some of the other issues and have tried reinstalling the plugin using different versions of the wakatime python package disabled the spellcheck plugin turned debug logging on and off and I still have problems on Ubuntu whenever I save a file Seems to lock up on every invocation of the python module for whatever reason Im running Ubuntu with Atom I love waketime thank you Using Atom I became confused in settings I set Api Key but the default message was shown instead of my Key I thought something might be wrong so I checked cfg file It was fine I expected my Api Key was shown I believe this would be best How do you think Hi your app is great would be awesome to have these statistics shown inside Atom without leaving it Keep up the good work
