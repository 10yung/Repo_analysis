a more generic image for the front page in READMEmd is it possible to configure the access of the users to DevOps Platform UI For example when a user belongs to Developer group in LDAP access the DevOps platform they cannot view other tools in the UI while if a user belongs to Admin group heshe can view all of the DevOps toolsThey want to configure the access of the users to DevOps Dashboard UI For example when a user belongs to Developer group in LDAP access the DevOps platform they cannot view other tools in the UI while if a user belongs to Admin group heshe can view all of the DevOps tools Hi I have a virtual machine with the following capacity CPU with GBRAM and I would like to setup this ADOP Platform on VM this machine onpremise without an internet connection Could you please let me know the steps Question How to download a copy of ADOP C if the VM has no internet connection Is there any other alternatives What is the hardware requirement CPU GB RAM sufficient What is ADOP C software requirement Does it need to have this component on the VM Docker Machine Docker Engine Docker Toolbox Docker compose Steps by step to download and install ADOP C on VM Regards dwcw Github Actions has been made available and it is worth trialling out as a CI tool for testing the provisioning of the platform as opposed to Travis especially since its more native to Github This may also alleviate the OOM issues with Travis when trying to build this PR updated compose file to point to the latest nexus image This PR includes changing adopsonar from version to which changes Upgrading
