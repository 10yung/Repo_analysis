Would be lovely to see a Desired State Configuration Composite Resource wrapper around eps Would allow one to be able to declaratively stateinstantiate files from eps template Something akin to the following DSC pseudocode could be used for config management of a nodes service configuration for instance epsBindingParams EpsTemplate MyConfigFile Name someConfigini Path someConfiginieps Binding epsBindingParams And given the same input bindings and path the final eps output ought to always be the same ie pure function so comparing the hash of the eps output against any existing target fileondisk should suffice as the Get and Test scenarios of a DSC Resources required Get Test Set methods Also thanks straightdave for your efforts re EPS PowerShell module in general much appreciated Error output should be better and more helpful for template writers See for details This should be done at the same time as better documentation for template troubleshooting see At least How to debug a template How to get verbose output General idea of how the templating system works
