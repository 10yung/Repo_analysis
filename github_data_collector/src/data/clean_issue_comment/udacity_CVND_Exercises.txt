There seems to be a mistake in the Implementing HOG notebook and the related one with HOG examples Namely I am referring to this code fragment Add up all the histograms for each cell and count the number of histograms per cell for i in range numcellsperblock for j in rangenumcellsperblock avegrad itotby i jtotbx j hogdescriptorreshaped i j histcounter itotby i jtotbx j I want to draw your attention to the fact that average gradient array is initialized as avegrad npzerosycells xcells numbins whereas numcellsperblock is a number of cells in x y direction Thus the code computing the average gradients is mixing x and y dimension because i is iterating over numcellsperblock which refers to x dimension but then i totbyi expression is used as an index in the y dimension The code doesnt produce any errors as long as numcellsperblock ie number of cells is the same in x and y dimension But once we try to change that to something like it results in broadcasting error due to dimensions mismatch I suggest changing it to for i in range numcellsperblock x for j in rangenumcellsperblock y avegrad jtotby j itotbx i hogdescriptorreshaped i j histcounter jtotbyj itotbxi Issue While Running Project Notebook on google colab I was getting following Future Warning contentdataloadpy FutureWarning Method asmatrix will be removed in a future version Use values instead keypts selfkeyptsframeiloc idx asmatrix Solution replace asmatrix with values in dataloadpy at line no there was a spelling error There is a typo in the word example in line Lets see how face detection works on an example in this notebook Updated the code according to newer version of OpenCV Fixes In Contour detection and features file the rd code cell must be updated as it gives the following error not enough values to unpack expected got Update the code cezannec In the notebook Green Screen Caripynb while I am trying to block the area for showing the car which shows that I cannot block the mask area from the background image
