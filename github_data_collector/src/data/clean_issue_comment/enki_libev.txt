Hi I am getting epollwait Bad file descriptor this causes my application to close Hi I have a doubt Usually the udp connection is always writable but If I add the udp connection write event to epoll via eviostart then when can trigger a writable event I am confused about this line of code c define VARxtypename VARname type name I searched the entire project and can t find definition of macro VARname type name could you please make a short explain enki after patch successfully compiled using armlinuxandroideabigcc GCC x prerelease I watch a file via inotify when it is updated i open it via evioinit and eviostart when all data is read i close the file eviostop closefd if a other inotify event is comming when i open the file with evioinit and eviostart in this time the callback is not called i need to call it explicitly via evinvoke but this is a bad solution if the file is huge this will block all my other events watchers timers sockets signals etc
