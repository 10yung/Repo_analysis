I tried to use this gitrepository in an external folder and import it in unity f as an package It turns out it goes in an endless loop trying to create the settings asset In the Editorlog of unity it loops through that Start importing AssetsDeformEditorResourcesDeformSettingsasset using Guid fd d f be d b fbdfdddac Importer Done importing asset AssetsDeformEditorResourcesDeformSettingsasset target hash dc a bef adffdb b c in seconds Import parameters got modified during import UnityEditorAssetDatabaseCreateAssetObject String DeformEditorDeformEditorResourcesCreateAssetObject String at ThirdParty Deform Code Editor DeformEditorResourcescs DeformEditorDeformEditorSettingsEnsureSettingsAsset at ThirdParty Deform Code Editor DeformEditorSettingscs C buildslave unity build ModulesAssetDatabaseEditorV AssetImportManagercpp line Filename ThirdPartyDeformCodeEditorDeformEditorResourcescs Line It seems there are hardcoded paths in the creation that forces the user to use it in the AssetsDeform folder and not as a package The package should generate the default material somewhere in the Assets folder so that if Deform is installed via the manifest file the user can change the shader on the default material If possible the generated material should detect the render pipeline and have its shader set accordingly I am trying to create a breaking wave using the Twirl deformer Below is the current output using the Twirl deformer Deform plugin Required output Required output Below are the differences between the current and the required output Smooth blending with the ocean surface No depression below the crest I am looking for suggestions or thoughts which can help in achieving the required output Thank you Regular automatic normal generation in Unity meshRecalculateNormals does look better A sphere didnt get hard corners with automatic normal generation Every deformable has its dynamic mesh serialized as a unique mesh This bloats scene file size Its unnecessary because the dynamic mesh can be generated from the original mesh MeshDataDynamicMesh isnt serialized but the target Mesh Filter or Skinned Mesh Renderer uses it and is serialized Somehow the targets mesh reference needs to be overridden when serialized to point to the original mesh Then at runtime the dynamic mesh can be generated The transform handles shouldnt get in the way of the deformables transform handles Controls could exist for the deformer and deformable but a toggle between the two would be acceptable as well When typing to filter the displayed deformers in the Creator window it would be nice to be able to press the down arrow key to select the next element in the list and up for the previous Pressing enter would be the equivalent of clicking the selected button The sine deformer should have a limited and unlimited mode like some of the other deformers bend twist twirl etc
