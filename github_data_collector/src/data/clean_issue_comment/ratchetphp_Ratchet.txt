In PHP a Throwable interface was added that allows catching and handling errors in more cases than Exception previously allowed So if the catch statement contained Exception on PHP x it means it should probably be rewritten to reference Throwable on PHP x Contains commit from Lets bump PHP to secure supported version So we can make further improvements to the lib without pain Eg see There is v released with PHP support so should be no deal to consumers I tried to keep changes at minimum but eg its impossible to decently test code with inigetiniset so I had to do small modifications see Changelog Hello I am receiving various error codes and netERRSSLPROTOCOLERROR when creating a connection var conn new WebSocketwssXXXX when pointing to my ip address I can get a connection from WS but since my implementation is loaded of HTTPS I cannot go with WS I tried enabling proxy pass with Apache and all other signs show OK also considering WS connection worked from the console I would sincerely appreciate any support no other issues aside from that really excited to see it work Thank you updates Well since I am able to connect from WS I am calling it an issue somewheres elsemay

I try to connect using WebSocket the connection is opened and then it immediately closes Also When I create a new socket with different port then Im able to access both using http and ws Is it possible to run HTTP Server and WebSockets on the same port and if yes how to implement it Thanks So Im trying to send updated serialized data via websockets to the clients browser Unfortunately my

that connects to the LocalSocketServer and Im seeing all of my serialized data updating However after trying to let it run for about hours the server seemed to have crash in task scheduler getting a xFF error Wondering if using the addPeriodicTimer method isnt the best way to go Im trying to avoid dealing with a ZeroMQ approach I mean why do I need to do that if I can just add a reoccuring timer that will constantly push data every second Thoughts Hi Is there a plan to raise compatibility for Best Regards David There is a new option in burp suite we can send the particular socket message to repeater or intruder to send multiple spam message using socket connection Is there anyway to avoid this kind of socket spam If i use some php check on the backend it will eat all my server resources Becoz it should check each message of hundreds of chatters So give me a solution to avoid this issue and fix the websocket spam Hello can you help me One client have a server that send me a JSON in
