As currently we can use springgravity for bounceOut or elasticOut but can we do bounceIn or bounceOut also InOut would be interesting as well Hello there First of all i would like to express my gratitude for this amazing library also Im a big fan of your work I was playing around with dynamicsjs for the first time and noticed that my code does not work on chrome but does on firefox the code that throws the error is the following dynamicsanimateel background red the error is the following Uncaught TypeError Cannot read property rgb of undefined at einterpolate dynamicsminjs at einterpolate dynamicsminjs at tinterpolate dynamicsminjs at tinterpolate dynamicsminjs at q dynamicsminjs at m dynamicsminjs at P dynamicsminjs Im Not sure if its something that Im doing wrong if yes then i cant figure it out This PR Modernises all dependencies couldnt get it to build on my machine with the existing ones Fixes a bug where calling dynamicsstop in complete for example with another interleaved animation in place caused a crash Also added a test This happens frequently when combined with react animations since the react lifecycle componentWillLeavecallback will call componentWillUnmount once callback is called synchronously which usually should call dynamicsstop Hello Im just playing around with your nice library very cool but is it somehow possible to rotate arround the x axis rotateX has no effect Im trying to use dynamicsjs and in my example im using it with hammerjs Everything works so far but the completecallback fires when animate starts not when it ends I have the example on codepen Codpenexample Do i do something wrong or is it a bug Hello need simple example Example change background color Thank you I try to use css percent value and the result is bad The animate func try to animate to the value if you put on a width for example it will translate to px and in the end of animation set Strange result For example Android doesnt supports documentvisibilityState without the webkit prefix creating an animation with a delay will never be triggered on these devices because isDocumentVisible will not return false Is it an idea to check for visibilityState in document and then return the document visibility or true for older browsers Open this example And leave it for minutes In my case Chrome Windows DevTools open the svg slowly grows bigger than the pin Maybe thats because the previous transform d is not identity matrix when the new transform d is applied
