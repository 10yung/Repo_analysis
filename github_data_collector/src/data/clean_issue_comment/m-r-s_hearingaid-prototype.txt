Hi Ive been trying to get this project up and running for two days Unfortunately I cant get the jackd started There is always the error message JackAudioDriverProcessAsync read error stopping I tried both the complete image and an installation via stretch lite In both cases the same result The sound card itself is fine and also the microphone amplifiers work Anyone else have an idea Thank you Henri Hello im really new to openMHA but currently working for preperation of my bachelorthesis on a jackbased audio processing client which is intended to developed a simulator of hearing aid device and then my prof recommended me to learn this software and hoping that i can create my own plugins dunno what it means but maybe apply my own algorithm in openMHA client i can already run my own algorithm in this hearing aid prototype but how do i create plugins and runs it thanks for the answer in advance The problem with corrupted recording is probably a threadsafety issue In unixoid systems mv is generally atomic while cp is not Hello With newer hearing aids such as Oticon Opn supporting bluetooth connectivity can this be used to develop a remote mic or interconnected table mics for meetings similar to Phonaks Roger Mics or Oticon ConnectClip This mic would stream audio to the bluetooth hearing aids This would greatly help with understanding speech in noise in meetings and understanding speech from distance lecturers Thanks The inversion filters figured in Inversionfilters are set in the config Hi again Im trying to compile openMHA and install it but I get a missing header file error for not being able to find sndfileh I simply used the git clone command cd openMHA then wrote the configure sudo make I also tried configure make am I supposed to get the files elsewhere it is most likely that Im doing something wrong If so please tell me Is it possible to install OpenMHA on pi without setting up the bluetooth controller It appears to be method for directly adjusting some parameters but for the configuration we plan to make any sort of adjustments through wifi connection only I would like to know if it will run without the bluetooth script Thank you Im newbie in hearing aid development and aundio IF I bought audio injector and set up with Raspberry Pi Id like to know the recommended microphone and amplifier mobile ready Also audio Injector has ECM type mic is there any problem with this mic
