Improved by adding support for selection runs What if the previous run was a runselection The implementation should be robust enough to support any previous execution I have added atomrunner webkituserselect none atomrunner pre webkituserselect initial which first disables option to select anything within the package area Then for the pre area it enables the option to select the generated output This allows you to generate output and copy and paste it somewhere Ideally you should instead add a button to copy the output to clipboard My patch implements support for the FILEACTIVE macro shamelessly stolen from the script package at which I wasnt able to configure properly and consistently FIY This is my first attempt hacking inside the atom ecosphere which is why I havent made the effort of implementing more macros also this macro is the only one I currently need When switching between files it is useful to be able to run the last run script without having to switch back to it ChildProcesskill doesnt stop forked subprocesses This commit uses treekill to properly handle forked subprocesses on all platforms Hi I implemented a custom convenient way to run my custom script npm test and I though it would be nice to share it with everyone Thank you for this great package Carlos
