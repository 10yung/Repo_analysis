apologies for pedantry I saw a link to your repo in the Open Group AAF doco and like the look of this not tried it yet This is a feature request Overload template file name and directory file name with arguments Use case would be to use adr command to manage other type of markdown files eg sh alias prdadr templatefile prdtemplatemd dirfile prddir This way we could create PRD files with the very same tool while steel being able to create ADR files sh adr new Use adrtoolset to manage PRDs as well prd init docarchitecturedrivers prd new Needs to be testable prd new Needs to be expandable prd link Mentioned in Cant break adr list lists existing ADR documents prd list lists existing PRD documents This fixes the error I get when trying to run the init command on osx using either systems bash or homebrews Error message was adr init docsarchitecture usrlocalCellaradrtools binadrdir line too many arguments docadr recordarchitecturedecisionsmd Probably more things should be quoted in this codebase Providing a different perspective on the feature request in Were looking into using this tool to manage a centralised adr repository for adrs spanning multiple repos and teams For organisational purposes we would like to reflect our internal team structure through the usage of subdirectories Would it be possible to have the adr new command accept a relative path to the root where adr init was runwhere adrdir points to I do recognise this would probably create problematic interactions with the link and supersede functionality but Im open for a discussion on those potentially problematic areas I am somewhat confused by this clause in the LICENSEtxt Content that this tool adds to your project is under the Creative Commons Attribution CC BY licence Does this only apply to the automatically generated phrasing of the ADRs It surely does not apply to the content that you fill in does it It may be helpful to clarify this Docker image based on alpine Linux so it has MB total It uses multistage build to run tests It would be ideal if we could include the status of each ADR in the table of contents The intended use is markdown adr generate toc s Architecture Decision Records Record architecture decisions recordarchitecturedecisionsmd Accepted Implement as shell scripts implementasshellscriptsmd Accepted Single command with subcommands singlecommandwithsubcommandsmd Accepted Markdown format markdownformatmd Accepted Help comments helpcommentsmd Amended by Help scripts helpscriptsmd Packaging and distribution in other version control repositories packaginganddistributioninotherversioncontrolrepositoriesmd Accepted Invoke adrconfig executable to get configuration invokeadrconfigexecutabletogetconfigurationmd Accepted Use ISO Format for Dates useiso formatfordatesmd Accepted Help scripts helpscriptsmd Amends Help comments helpcommentsmd I made the decision to only keep the last line under the Status section so that amendments are properly printed with their links Hi I am unable to get adrtools working with cmder on Windows Is it supported Hi I definitely love this But would it be possible to add some i n support so that the adr generate toc command outputs a locale aware title the adr init creates a localized version of the first decision Thanks in advance
