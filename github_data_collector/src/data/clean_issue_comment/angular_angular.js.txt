WKWebView Opera XX All browsers where this could be reproduced and Operating System if relevant NA Anything else eg stacktraces related issues suggestions how to fix I know the guidelines say to submit questions to stack overflow but this is a direct question for the current maintainers of the AngularJS framework and the community As we all know AngularJS is reaching EOL at the end of June With that my understanding is that the AngularJS team wont support the framework anymore including fixing security vulnerabilities As I work for a Large Corporation I have the pleasure of being required to maintain various compliance standards One of these states that we cannot use any library or framework that is no longer maintained In our use case it means that we only need to ensure that security patches are applied in order to maintain our compliance standing What I wanted to know is whether or not there were any plans for this project to be handed over to another entity for security updates I understand that this is open source and that folks can fork the project but I wanted to understand my options as we have about k lines of code leveraging AngularJS I know that for other things like Python there are companies offering support contracts past the EOL date that can be purchased for enterprise usage Is this something that is going to happen for AngularJS or will we be able to maintain the framework past EOL for free Thanks again and apologies for filing this in the wrong place None AngularJS is in LTS mode We are no longer accepting changes that are not critical
