In addition to the list of constraints draw rectangles properly depending on the given constraints to better visualize how the constraints interact Instead of View or View it would be neat if we could change it to something easy to remember Right now I have to write down the memory address of view launch the view debugger and cross reference the address from wtfautolayout to find out that view actually is CustomHeaderView For a couple views its pretty easy but gets difficult as more views are on the screen If a UILabel has text that contains an apostrophe the parser fails with UNEXPECTED INPUT EXPECTED Example NSLayoutConstraint x UIView x fcae d height active NSLayoutConstraint x V MyAppUIButton x fcae f No Thanks active names UIView x fcae f NSLayoutConstraint x a V MyAppUIButton x fcae f No Thanks active names UIView x fcae f NSLayoutConstraint x b V MyAppUILabel x fcae ece Keep track of your friends active names UIView x fcae eb NSLayoutConstraint x bb V MyAppUILabel x fcae ece Keep track of your friends UIView x fcae f active NSLayoutConstraint x c V UIView x fcae f active names UIView x fcae eb NSLayoutConstraint x e V UIStackView x fcae d active names UITableViewCellContentView x fcae d NSLayoutConstraint x f V UIStackView x fcae d active names UITableViewCellContentView x fcae d NSLayoutConstraint x f UISVcanvasconnection UIStackView x fcae d top UIView x fcae d top active NSLayoutConstraint x UISVcanvasconnection V UIView x fcae eb active names UIStackView x fcae d NSLayoutConstraint x b UISVspacing V UIView x fcae d UIView x fcae eb active NSLayoutConstraint x fd UIViewEncapsulatedLayoutHeight UITableViewCellContentView x fcae d height active if you change friends to friends the parser is again able to handle the input Please add a checkboxes to mark constraint as correct It ll help to figure out the problem whet there are more than constrains UIViewEncapsulatedLayout constraints are commonly added by collection views et al but are also the resultant constraints from translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints In projects where constraints are being added to old framebased layouts knowing this can be really helpful
