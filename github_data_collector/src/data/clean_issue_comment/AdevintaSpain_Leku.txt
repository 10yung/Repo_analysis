request related to a problem Please describe The idea is to pick locations instead of one like an origin and destination but routing is not needed Describe the solution youd like This is somewhat similar to but routing is not needed Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Right now when we open the location picker it already pinned the default lat long Describe the solution youd like There are three scenarios Location service is on and we have the users location The pin should be on the users location by default Location service is on but we dont have the users location In this scenario we show the default location but we dont pin anywhere on the map As soon as we get the users location if users didnt select any location yet we will pin the users location Location service is off and we dont have the users location Like scenario we will show the default location but we dont pin anywhere but when user press the users location button we will ask the user to turn on the location service and then as soon as we get the users location we will pin it It would be awesome if we get a snapshot after picking a location As I know Google Map already supports this feature and we only need to return it in the onActivityResult method The solution that I like Get a bitmap file in onActivityResult method
