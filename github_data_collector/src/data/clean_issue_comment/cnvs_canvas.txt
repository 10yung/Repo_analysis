Im not sure if its already mentioned or not in the readme but I think its worth to be mentioned here I already built the administration backend and also made the basic blogging feature within it Now if I want to migrate to Canvas I would expect that there will be backends one for my administration site and another one for Canvas Is there any way to integrate Canvas backend into my existing administration sites without using iframe Thanks austintoddj This repository is wonderful I would like to know how I can contribute to the development of the project Have you considered the next features Does this project accept donation or sponsorship This is a beautiful blog But is better to it can keep the space and TAB of the beginning of the article it is better to center the picture On Canvas panel there are some translate issues It takes timezone successfully but the texts are not localized eg momentpostcreatedatfromNow this will produce english text I want to build blog site and canvas is just perfect for me But I have some question and didnt find any answer or document or something Is there any document How to switch theme like dark mode in suggested by canvasio site Is there any search option for posts Is there filter for post because I have to give right for some user to post How to add editor functionality like List and table Personally a nicetohave for me but would be cool See Liquid Tags were introduced by shopify and have been widely adopted in a lot of editors CMSs and comment editors online Liquid tags allow for a really rich publishing and consumption experience To that end it would be really cool if Cnvs was able to do something like this make sure you click on the icon on the bottom to see the liquid tags guide where this is adopted from The goal being to be able to allow embeds of any of the following Internal ArticlePosts Ex here CommentsEx Tags Topics Users ex External popular ones only listed below Videos like Youtube Twitter posts Medium posts Slideshare slides Soundcloud audio snippet Spotify song or audio snippet Internal ArticlePost Embeds Ex using the full link of the article link using the slug like this link kazzboostyourproductivityusingmarkdown be Comment Embeds example All you need is the ID at the end of a comment URL To get the comment link click either the timestamp or the menu button in the top right corner on a comment and then click Permalink Heres an example devcomment d a Tag Embeds All you need is the tag name tag git Topic Embeds All you need is the topic name topic ux User Embeds Example here All you need is the username user jess External I took the most popular ones that made sense to me Video Embeds All you need is the id from the URL YouTube youtube dQw w WgXcQ Vimeo vimeo Twitter Embeds Using the Twitter Liquid tag will allow the tweet to prerender from the server providing your reader with a better experience All you need is the tweet id from the url twitter Medium Embeds Just enter the full URL of the Medium article you are trying to embed medium SlideShare Embed All you need is the SlideShare key slideshare rdOzN kr yK eE Soundcloud Embed Just enter the full URL of the Soundcloud track you are trying to embed soundcloud Spotify Embed Enter the Spotify URI of the Spotify track playlist album artist podcast episode you are trying to embed spotify spotifyepisode V XZWqZQJvbddd n mf See this PR here I know we have since added topics to cnvs based on this ticket But I think topics could greatly benefit from having a tree structure with topicssubtopics of course those that dont need to make use of that functionality wont but for a lot of content sites this would be useful to have For example see these URLs You could have several subtopics under news like world US financial politics etc Same applies to entertainment and other topicssubtopics As mentioned earlier with tags you dont have a hierarchy with topics you doand topics give you a lot of flexibility and allow the user to browse content by looking through the topicsubtopic tree which can be presented in a multitude of ways in menus in sidebars etc Topics can also be shown in URLs like myblogtravelinternationaltriptocyprus or myblogrecipeseasybakemyfavoritesoup where travel and recipes are category slugs As far as backend admin of topics and subtopics it could look like how wordpress does it here Im not a huge fan of wordpress but this is one feature they do well on austintoddj I hope this sufficiently explains the background behind the ask and I hope this feature will make it into cnvs which imo is the best laravel cms at the moment austintoddj this is more of a question for you Heres another real usecase I ran into I am trying to update the authors users table by adding new fields for image author username bio etc postauthorimage imgauthorskpjpg author image URL relative or absolute postauthorurl authorkp author URL so frontend can point to postauthorbio KP is the founder of author bio Also I am trying to update the posts table with additional fields like so postisPremium or for freepaid content for example I still want to be able to inherit all the goodness of this package as its development continues by simply running composer update to update my version of cnvs going forward This means I want to extend these tables in a way that does not involve forking cnvs or modifying the source code Is what I need as simple as just creating migration files for users and posts Your thoughts are appreciated Btw I still think is highly desirable no matter what the answer to this one ps you really should make me a core member of cnvs at this pointlol
