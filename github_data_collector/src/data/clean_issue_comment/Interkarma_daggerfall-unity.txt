Describe the bug UI Window override registration allows mods later in load order to have their window take precedance over earlier mods This is the opposite behaviour to that intended by TheLacus and teh other mod systems This is a reminder so I dont forget to fix it FIx for and then some like lowering players noise volume when sneaking Note playerMotorspeed is determined by both world conditions and players input While its only required during FixedUpdate for modifying movement players input can change with each Update so that input must be recorded separately Except in LevitateMotor that can adjust movement with each frame If we care we could update speed with each Update too One very small adjustment I wanted to make was the fact that the headbobbing animation if enabled would continue to play even if the player is in the air I found it more noticeable if you are jumping while riding on a horse and the camera still continues to shake This simple added condition to check for if the player is grounded or not should fix this issue Seems to help hitting enemies at very close range Forums Im testing C C Y which relies on a rumor to find the right culprit It uses both anyInfo and Rumors to get to the goal The peasants werent giving me the info I needed so I went to the Spymaster Even with him I had to ask times to finally get the answer to the quest Without the Spymaster this would be very difficult to find out particularly since many quests dont tell you when to ask for rumors or not you sort of stumble into them I propose reducing the number of ambient rumors ie faction feuds new rulers etc to a more reasonable level to ensure quests can inject needed rumors as a solution Describe the bug Save Explorer utility doesnt work because an exception is thrown To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Open Daggerfall Tools Save Explorer Beta Additional context DaggerfallConnectSaveSaveGames has a reference to GameManagerInstanceTalkManager which is not defined in Editor GameManager could not find GameObject with name TalkManager UnityEngineDebugLogErrorObject DaggerfallWorkshopGameGameManagerGetGameObjectWithNameString at AssetsScriptsGameGameManagercs DaggerfallWorkshopGameGameManagergetTalkManager at AssetsScriptsGameGameManagercs DaggerfallConnectSaveSaveGamesOpenSaveInt Boolean at AssetsScriptsAPISaveSaveGamescs DaggerfallWorkshopSaveExplorerWindowIsReady at AssetsScriptsEditorSaveExplorerWindowcs DaggerfallWorkshopSaveExplorerWindowOnGUI at AssetsScriptsEditorSaveExplorerWindowcs UnityEngineGUIUtilityProcessEventInt IntPtr Move creation of topics in the talkmanager from quest parsing to quest starting This allows parsing of quests without having to clean up the talkmanager afterwards See Description For buildings with non ground level doors at higher terrain altitudes I think its altitude it happens in Wrothgardian Mountains and not in Daggerfall if an interior save is loaded and the player uses the door theyre placed at ground level which is actually inside the building geometry I found the problem with my upcoming new location but have successfully reproduced it with the current code and a vanilla location To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Go to Hollech in Wrothgarian Mountains region Ensure you are member of DB guildjoin DarkBrotherHood and enter the hall Save next to one of the upper doors that lead outside Load that save and click the door I have a savefile at point to demo this SAVE zip Expected behavior Be placed on top of the building rather than inside Desktop please complete the following information OS Windows Version Latest master branch Additional context I have tried to figure out what the issue is but its connected to the world compensation stuff in StreamingWorld and I dont understand how it is supposed to work Going to need this to be looked at by you Interkarma sorry What I have found is that StreamingWorldRepositionPlayer method calculates the y to set the player transform to to be way up in the air world compensation is at this point since outside world is being built Something must then snap the player to the terrain but I couldnt find out what This puts the player inside the building geometry which unfortunately in my new quest is a set of stairs that traps the player Jumping forward while walking retains the same speed while doing so However jumping forward while sprinting does not The first sprinting jump is at the same speed as sprinting but every consecutive jump afterward is done at walking speed Easier to notice with a character with a high jumping skill Very noticeable if setrunspeed Current pattern of jumps Walking Short Short Short Short etc Running Long Short Short Short etc Expected pattern of Jumps Walking Short Short Short Short etc Running Long Long Long Long etc OS Windows DFUnity Version Not savedependent but heres a decently running skilled character in the Wayrest castle courtyard with plenty of space to run around and test this behavior SAVE zip
