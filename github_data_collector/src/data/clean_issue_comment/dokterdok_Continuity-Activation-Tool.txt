Your Issue THe Continuity Activation Tool doesnt seem to work and causes kernal panics on startup in High Sierra I found a post complaining of the same issue in Mojave with no solution either I followed the instructions to install After installing the mac starts up about half way then suffers a kernel panic about half way I hold down the power button to shut off start again and face the same problem over and over Steps done to try to fix the issue I restarted in recovery and reinstalled the OS Have tried CAT in the past with MBP Mid inch ended up bricking and had to restart from scratch

Bluetooth features have been detected code This tool can try to fix this Hello Anyone had tried to work with an iPhone with iOS beta I will explain my experience Mi MBP works with High Sierra and CAT since the day this macOS version appears I never have troubles and all works fine except sometimes an slow AirDrop devise search Now happens all contrary Continuity feature works fine but only when goes to the file mail message single Note or a Safari site All in both sides Including Copy Clipboard When a Note or email is been written is shared to the other devise without torubles as well But there is not a way to connect to internet with Handoff yet OS Version beta Mac model MacBook Pro early Dongle or replaced card Replaced BT Card Used donglecard BCM PCIEBT CAX I am testing at this time and if there is not chance to fix will downgrade my iPhone Regards Hi all After replacing both Airport card and WiFi antenna HandoffAirdropetc work flawlessly thanks for this awesome patch Just a note to folks who have done this fix when my computer slept due to low battery when traveling it awakened with a WiFi No Hardware Installed message Tried resetting both PRAM and SMC to no avail then replaced some hardware Finally ran the csrutil disable disable System Integrity command in Recovery mode in order to reinstall Continuity and it magically fixed the WiFi WiFi stayed fixed after reenabling System Integrity csrutil enable Just a headsup for anyone who suddenly encounters this problem and is worried they ruined their hardware Macbook Pro Early Sierra GHz Intel Core i Continuity

High Sierra Please if anyone can help Id very much appreciate it I am hoping to get this issue sorted so then I can upgrade my GPU to GeForce GTX and upgrade to Mojave
