Good day Is it posstible to make image video preview Something like this Thanks Working within projects when logging time against a task is there a possibility of providing a category perproject to classify the hours This would help using the time tracking feature to export the data for a format for invoicing where the invoices need to specify a classification for time If a pull request would be welcome I would be willing to provide this feature Is there a way whereas I can assign either a Contact or Company to a Group instead of a Person The use case is to setup teams of People to manage one or more Company or Contact entries within the system if the Person login details can be used to set the default Group assignments for the Contact or Company Good day We have a problem with our cummnuty server Weve uploaded ppt file MB at server But when we try to open it there is an error All files like docxlspptpdf cant be opened and cant be downloaded form the server When we send external link to our clients they cant download documents more Mb How to solve the problem Hi Guys where can i activated the Oauth option i would like to connect my Onedrive and Linkedin Loginoption s Best Ferdinand On what is based the user limit of the community edition Is this an hard limit What explain the difference with a development edition Browser doesnt load some images on community edition self hosted on Ubuntu Server When I copy image link i get Sorry the resource cannot be found The problem is that URL for theese images is in lower case ie My server is behind HAproxy but this is isnt workin anyway I connect from LAN behind HAproxy After using the automated installer script at not only does the script ignore any and all valid parameters it also installs a paid edition of the server software after fixing up invalid connection strings that caused the script to fail bash opensourceinstallsh ics true icp true ims false ids false dip es false mysqlh mysqlrp I only needed to install the Community Server as the Document Server was already installed on another container and I have separate servers for DB Redis and Erlang The install script still attempted to install everything and the dependencies of same docserver postgres redis rabbit etc After the install was cleaned up I landed on a portal and was asked for a licence file which does not pertain to the Community Edition in the slightest Using RHEL x I am running docker image of Onlyoffice document server on Ubuntu I also expose OODS to the internet via Windows VPS I configured IIS to run OO via reverse proxy IIS rewrites html links and disables some ACCEPTENCODING headers values Nothing fancy I followed this article to get it running in this mode I works fine with nextcloud and bitwarden OODS works fine to the point when I want to open some document Link to the Editorbin file is broken and loads via which is incorrect since this is local IP of internal server I works fine when I open it from internal network file is loaded via domain so I suspect that IIS reverse proxy rewrite it somehow But I browse through all the html and js files and cant find any mention of IP I think that this file is loaded via sdkjs file since this is only place with Editorbin string but again there is no IP as far as I can tell So how this file is loaded really How can I rewrite this url or not rewrite if this is reverse proxy issue I tried to run IIS with config from OODS official configuration but this is even worse since all of js files do not load at all Hello we use the docker image of Community and Document server behind an Apache proxyserver When I want to share a document the created shared link is broken because the hostname is just an underscore I attached a picture onlyofficeshare We are using internal hostname and DNSserver If i replace the underscore with the hostname everything works as expected Any suggestion how I can investigate this issue Version information latest docker image onlyofficecommunityreleasedate onlyofficecommunityversion Thank you in advance Thomas
