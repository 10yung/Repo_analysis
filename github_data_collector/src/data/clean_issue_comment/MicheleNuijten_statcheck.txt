Errors are caused if there is a space between two numbers after a test statistic and before a decimal in a reported statistical test result Scanned several thousand papers and this only occurred once so its unlikely to pop up too often Examples r statcheckstatcheck z p Extracting statistics Error in if lower i missing value where TRUEFALSE needed r statcheckstatcheckt p Extracting statistics Error in if lower i missing value where TRUEFALSE needed supCreated on by the reprex package v sup It would be nice to have a be able to call statcheck with the optional verbosity FALSE parameter that suppresses the following messages It would be nice to have a dataframe variable saying whether the parsed formula is in valid APA style A simple way to reach it would be to match Raw with the validAPA regex To have a cli program it would be nice to have the element of the input vector from which the statistics is extracted eg the line number I implemented an example program here please forgive my poor R Example output format would be filenameorg info F p filenameorg info F p filenameorg info F p filenameorg info F p filenameorg error The expected value is filenameorg info F p filenameorg error The expected value is filenameorg error The expected value is filenameorg error The expected value is filenameorg info F p This can be used inside emacs with flycheck like this elisp flycheckdefinechecker statscheck A linter for statistics command statscheck source errorpatterns error linestart filename line column error message lineend info linestart filename line column info message lineend modes textmode markdownmode orgmode addtolist flycheckcheckers statscheck Hi Thank you for this great package I was having a look at the code and noticed some possible improvements implemented in this PR I did not test them as much as I would have wanted because I did not have enough test files so please be careful before merging this But those are relatively simple changes so I dont expect any issues I can rebasesquashcherrypick if you only want to merge some of these commits Commits are group by similar changes so it will probably be much easier if you review one commit at a time After scanning a directory with files in it I got this message There were or more warnings use warnings to see the first The output of warnings is attached warningstxt Error message Error in readCharfilefileName fileinfofileNamesize useBytes TRUE cannot open the connection In addition Warning message In readCharfilefileName fileinfofileNamesize useBytes TRUE cannot open file CUsersNickDesktophtmlML Math male me female therefore math me ProQuesthtml Invalid argument Filename is ML Math male me female therefore math me ProQuesthtml The character causing a problem seems to be Original article Allows for scanning of docx files Requires textreadr library In this paper a Spearmans rho was wrongly extracted as Chi Provides a useful testcase for future developments PubPeer Paper Alternative to xpdf which does not require installation of separate software
