I am using React Typescript reduxzero But I experienced some difficulties when trying to make async calls in actions I think the error is becauseAction needs to return PartialState and it doesnt allow Promise export type ActionS state S args any PartialS In the following code I am returning a PromiseState const actions store StoreGlobalState asyncGetUsers state GlobalState return client getusers thenpayload users payload catcherror error That results in an error that says Type state GlobalState Promise users User is not assignable to type ActionGlobalState Type Promise users User has no properties in common with type PartialGlobalState Let me know if my understanding is correct If it indeed is because of Action doesnt support Promise what do you suggest to do instead Thank you Hi We are trying to use reduxzero Preact through UMD According to the documentation we put below scripts into our indexhtml However the createStore function is not available as both of script below are trying to create attribute reduxzero to window Im thinking we probably miss out something here Could anyone help provide the example of using reduxzero through UMD Thanks the store script src for preact script src componentWillMount has been renamed reactdomdevelopmentjs Warning componentWillMount has been renamed and is not recommended for use See for details Move code with side effects to componentDidMount and set initial state in the constructor Rename componentWillMount to UNSAFEcomponentWillMount to suppress this warning in nonstrict mode In React x only the UNSAFE name will work To rename all deprecated lifecycles to their new names you can run npx reactcodemod renameunsafelifecycles in your project source folder Please update the following components Connect I have some code that uses preact and redux via script tags Im trying to use reduxzero instead of redux but I dont see any guidance on how to use the code this way The provided examples with import etc all throw errors This link explains how it works with preact It looks like mapToPops is required by connect from the React examples What if I have a component that needs actions but doesnt need to read props What is the idiomatic empty mapToProps is it mapToProps state state I was wondering if its a good idea to add reduxdevtools options parameter here I have a situation that I needed to load stores in a page and somehow it would be better if I can rename the stores appropriately I looks like if I try to dispatch an action from devtools it doesnt work Can you confirm that The component returned by connect doesnt allow for refs ie Component reffoobar React gives warning Warning Stateless function components cannot be given refs Attempts to access this ref will fail
