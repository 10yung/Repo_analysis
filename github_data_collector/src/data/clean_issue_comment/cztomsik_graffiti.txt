 deno can load native modules now probably use stbimage because its just one c header file and it should not make building any harder there are crates already one from servo project but that is ys outdated and one other which provides a lot of other functionality we dont need so its probably better to just do own it can be converted to rust if necessary c rust Text support is very far from how it works in the browser now textNodes are simply concatened This story could also allow mixing elements with text nodes not sure if its really needed but it would improve compatibility a lot text should probably have its own layout node maybe even surface text style has to be obtained from its parentNode and when the style is changed all of the text nodes has to be updated too so it cannot be done before the text node is attached changing textdata should update surface with the text from all adjacent nodes sibling text nodes should be collapsedjoined so that flex stretching works correctly when in column mode This is needed for vue angularjs x and probably few others x NodeCOMMENTNODE x NoderemoveChild should not try to remove surface for comment nodes x NodeinsertBefore needs to pass correct index to the native excluding comments DocumentcreateComment we should pool already created surfaces not sure if its going to be implemented in core or in react reconciler and in vue Our docs are very out of date this has to be fixed before v Image urls are everywhere chat applications news readers show placeholder download image replace image when loaded preferably in Image component itself with minimal changes to the core for now this was in slackapp when I select a channel with a lot of messages scroll down and then select another channel with few messages nothing will be visible and it will be impossible to scroll back in this specific case its easily resolved with key but the same thing could happen if we removed some content from alreadyscrolled container like flatlist this is tracking issue so that its obvious we want to support vue when it gets released I think it should be possible to certain extent to just recompile our tsx components with Vue vnodes are not compatible but jsx might be if we restrict ourselves to functions and hooks ETA March
