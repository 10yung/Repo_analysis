 Gaussians missing parenthesis around sigma Tuned Gaussian parameters slightly so it still looks like old example Switched around indices in G in plot title to get correct reward function ie G intw intw instead of G intw intw Hi In esipynb I noticed that your four Gaussian functions dont have braces around sigma looks like this G npexpXmux Ymuy sigma instead of G npexpXmux Ymuy sigma So you actually multiply by sigma in the exponential function instead of dividing as you would in a normal Gaussian function This doesnt have any consequence for the toy example Im just curious if it was intentional there could be a reason of doing this that Im not aware of
