 Issues When changing TimetimeScale the raycast on the ground doesnt work properly It keeps bounce the character back above Normal TimetimeScale f Normal Wrong TimetimeScale f Wrong Additionally if the framerate is not capped to the bouncing effect will be even more obvious Possible Problem When checking CharacterController Dcs in moveVerticallyref deltaMovement function something weird happens there deltaMovementy was set to be skinWidth Which possibly means the origins of raycast are set up wrong No idea why this only happens when TimetimeScale goes low Apparently the the ray distance is so small that eventually the skin layer is already beneath the platform It make sense to bounce it back to the surface however I dont know why it keeps going up instead of stops there Thank you very much for developing such a brilliant plugin Hi Since all objects change the same Physics D matrix for collisions upon entering Play mode if one character like player set some layers for trigger under CC Ds Trigger Mask they will be overridden by any other character like enemies having different config for the same thing For example currently Player has Layers and set in its Trigger Mask and Enemy has Layer and when I launch the game and see Physics D matrix I can see Player collision matrix overridden by Enemys Hope Ive made myself clear From Is CC D is designed with only main character using it in mind or am I missing something here Any workarounds Thanks If you are on a slope and the top of the player collider hits another one way platform it will push you down until you fall off of the slope Hi For some reason the slope sticking when going down slope doesnt work when going around on SpriteShapes I still move horizontally that causes the body to float often With fast enough speed default sometimes i cant jump when walking downhill because its not grounded I tried debug ray the resulting slope it looks correct like when walking on BoxColliders So im not sure whats causing this The added downward deltamovementy is also the same How else can i try to figure out how to debug this Or have anyone figured out how to make it work with SpriteShape Hi when call Warp To Ground method from other script in OnStart function Unity freeze always after click play game During some debug ill found the problem In the while loop the movement still continue infinitly with IsGrounded always false This problem occur only when in the Unity Project settings Physics D AutoSyncTransform is set to False If turn it to True the problem not exists But i need to turn off this settings for some reasons in my project Thanks Im having a glitch with Tilemap Colliders where if the player gets caught on the edge of a tile they will slowly start rising up to the closest surface Example can be found here Any plan for ECS version Removes requirement of RigidBody D as is no longer being used by the character controller The enemies in my game are regular enemies but dont collide with the character As far as I can see this is supposed to work like that because of the nature of the character controller So how do I detect when I have collided with the enemy I just want for rigid bodies that collide with the character player to get the event OnCollisionEnter D Is there a way to do that Is this line in moveVertically only because CharacterController D supports slopes if isGoingUp collisionStatewasGroundedLastFrame ignoreOneWayPlatformsThisFrame mask oneWayPlatformMask In our game it causes wrong kind of movements because when player jumps he hits OneWayPlatform and jump stay short because of that Is there any drawback if we leave it like this we dont need slopes if isGoingUp ignoreOneWayPlatformsThisFrame mask oneWayPlatformMask
