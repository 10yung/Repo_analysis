Just came across Rete and am blown away Seriously great work Its solving a few problems and ideas I have especially with regards to teaching stream processing to junior engineers and getting my kid coding so thanks and kudos to all involved Im now trying to use Rete as my new hammer for all my nails and found a few great use cases One of which Id like to explore is jungling some graph data I have Initial samples and workflows are working great but I tried wiring it up to a few thousand nodes in an organization hierarchy to be exact and immediately felt the pain Theres no real data in the nodes theyre using the default renderers though it is initialized in a vue app and I dont have any workers engine even setup in the process so Im wondering if its just the number of nodes and connections is getting burly for a browser in general I fished through the issues tonight and found the profiler plugin just barely so Ill give that a crack tomorrow But in the meantime figured Id ask here to see what experience others have had with large graphs even in just the editor not the engine Thanks In our application some of our nodes contain popup menus HTML ltselect gt elements but the scroll wheel would not allow scrolling of the popup menu contents This turned out to be because the Rete Zoom class swallows all wheel events by calling preventDefault thus preventing the subsequent scroll event from being generated To address this the approach taken here is to only treat the wheel event as a zoom event if it occurs over the editor background ie not over a node This is accomplished by adding the following line at the top of the Zoom class wheel event typescript if ecurrentTarget etarget return While this results in an observable change in behavior zooming with the scroll wheel can only be accomplished over the whitespace of the editor it seems justifiable to me in that Rete should allow nodes to make use of the wheelscroll events as they see fit There may be other ways of accomplishing the same goal but this was the simplest I could come up with return await PromiseallObjectkeysnodeoutputsmapasync key const output nodeoutputs key return await Promisealloutputconnectionsmapasync c const nextNode thisdata as Datanodes cnode await thisprocessNodenextNode as EngineNode await thisforwardProcessnextNode Consider the case where outputconnections has the same node multiple times processNode and forwardProcess will be called on that node multiple times If in turn the next node has the same type of case this results in exponential amounts of promises in a wait state Even if the nodes themselves do nothing in their worker it doesnt take too large of a graph to start queuing up s of thousands of promise waits and lock the process while they are resolving One potential solution is to have a set of nodes on the engine that have already been forwarded and not forward if the item is already in the set This seems to solve the problem on my end so far but not sure if there are some potential pitfalls Im missing Is there a better way to handle this This fixes git cloned repo did npm install ran npm run build get lots of errors Is there a

AreaPluginzoomAtthiseditor The first time when observable gets its first data the editor is not centered on screen Capture d e cran a But the weird part is when a new value of data is triggered the editor gets centered Capture d e cran a Any idea of why this is happening only on initial data value Hi I am wanting to look at making use of the Code plugin for rete but am a bit lost as to its implementation I have looked on codepen and cannot see an example there for it you have many other excellent examples just not for the Code plugin Is there a code example preferably with Vue for implementing this plugin I have had a look at the website documentation but dont quite understand how why where the following is used const sourceCode await CodePlugingenerateengine editortoJSON and what the purpose of the following code is it doesnt seem to be used anywhere codenode inputs add node parameter as in worker inputs contains variable names addconsoleloghello add a line of code addnum nodedatanum add a variable with the value nodedatanum Thanks for such an excellent and useful library I find myself using it often but the code plugin has be stumped LOL Hello Thanks for all the good work you are doing with rete js We are using your library for one Drupal module And it is getting a good response Here is the link for the module which we are working on We need some help with one functionality which we want to have in our module We want a loop type of functionality that can loop over a set of nodes We can handle the programmatic part of it but we need help with UI We need a node that can hold a set of other nodes in it I am attaching an image of a rough idea of what we need Can you please help me with how I can proceed with it Looppdf
