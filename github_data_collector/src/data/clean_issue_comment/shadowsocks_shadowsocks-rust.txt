TCP Fast Open is supported in shadowsockslibev Since it is one of the most popular shadowsocks servers implementation it would better to be compatible with it TODO Network Library Support Mio Tokio libc macOS Linux already supported But using TCPFASTOPENCONNECT in Kernel would be a lot more convenient x Windows All APIs are already supported in winapi crate Missing TCPFASTOPEN definition Dont know how to use ConnectEx fallback to connect temporary sslocal could support a proxy white list only proxy those requests that target addresses are in the list sslocal supports white list including TCP UDP Support loading from URLs such as gfwlist Open for contribution dlgooglecom dlgooglecom googlecom youtubecom dlgooglecom Is there any plan to support SSR protocol vcpkg git clone cd vcpkg bootstrapvcpkgbat vcpkg integrate install libsodium openssl windows vcpkg install opensslx windowsstatic vcpkg install libsodiumx windowsstatic rust set RUSTFLAGSCtargetfeaturecrtstatic shadowsocksrust cargo build release As asked in currently our load balancing algorithm is simply Round Robin which is good if all your servers have good qualities otherwise when any of your servers down sslocal will still try to connect that broken server So I think we need a better server choosing algorithm One simple strategy came out of my mind is Ping servers periodically record their delay Choose the server that has the lowest delay Strictly this is not a Load Balancing algorithm anymore But it is always the best to use the fastest server As above I believe the timeout defaults to seconds If using shadowsocksrust as a library And one want to keep the process running after terminating the shadowsocks part Then the shadowsocks sockets are left open and are never properly closed on Windows This is likely due to this bug Im not sure if that bug can be solved in itself thus making mio better Or if there is anything simple one can do here in shadowsocks in order to not trigger the problem But I want to leave this issue here so its documented for now at least
