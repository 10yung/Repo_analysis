Hi I am wondering if this can import netcdf goes data and convert them to GeoJsn If so how doe we do that Thank you Hi I have a problem about adding and showing a raster on the map I would appreciate any help in debugging and tracking down the error source I pull the lastest geonotebook image by run the code pull geonotebookgeonotebook and use default config When I run Maddlayerrd opacity gamma in RasterDataipynb nothing appears on the map I have tried chrome Firefox and edge web browser But I think I read the raster image because I can see the max and min values of the bands besides Mlayers is not an empty collection when I press F to see the chrome web browser console message There is a log reads ktile ec cb a a eeL Globemonth hh vv h v doy to NBARv png GET netERRCONNECTIONREFUSED I enter the container and try to check if there is a file names png but i find none docker exec it containerid binbash find name png Please let me know what additional info would be helpful in debugging this Thanks Hi running the Docker container and following Exampleipynb I immediately hit the following error and the kernel dies E NotebookApp POST apikernels d b a ebc a e f aa ef restart ms referer ERRORtornadogeneralUncaught exception in ZMQStream callback Traceback most recent call last File usrlocallibpython distpackageszmqeventloopzmqstreampy line in runcallback callbackargs kwargs File usrlocallibpython distpackagestornadostackcontextpy line in nullwrapper return fnargs kwargs File usrlocallibpython distpackagesipykernelkernelbasepy line in dispatcher return selfdispatchshellstream msg File usrlocallibpython distpackagesipykernelkernelbasepy line in dispatchshell selfprehandlerhook File usrlocallibpython distpackagesipykernelkernelbasepy line in prehandlerhook selfsavedsiginthandler signalSIGINT defaultinthandler Hi the example notebooks are not very informative in their current state on Github Propose using Binder to bring them to life Compatible with and x Should fix I feel that a line annotation is really missing and I suppose it would be easy to implement considering that Shapely already has a LineString object so it is more a matter of FrontEnd When measuring distances a visual representation would be really helpful Developer Documentation now only shows some figures and it could be much easier to understand if some explanations of those figures are clarified especially the last figuresThanks Hello I am new to GeoNotebook I am at the stage where I try to understand how GeoNotebook works or more precisely what each of the python libraries that are used in GeoNotebook do What I didnt understand is how I can change the projection of the rasters overplayed in Mapnik What is the library that does this is it Mapnik or Rasterio For the vectors is Shapely if I am not mistaken Hello do you guys have any idea on how hard would it be to have the pip instalable bindings for python mapnik Just to give me some pointers so I can do it or else not do if its completely unfeasible This isnt really an issue but how would I display a series of XY coordinates of points Would it be possible to add a pop up window to the display The docs go into depth about displaying raster data but dont really cover vector data from geonotebookwrappers import RasterData rd RasterDatafilepathtofiletiff Maddlayerrd opacity gamma
