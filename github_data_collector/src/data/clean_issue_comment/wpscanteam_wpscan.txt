Before submitting an issue please make sure you fully read any potential error messages output and did some research on your own Subject of the issue Im trying to run wpscan through docker but it does not work Your environment Version of Docker Docker version ce build a ea Operating System OS Manjaro Steps to reproduce docker run it rm wpscanteamwpscan url url enumerate u Expected behavior Output scan results Actual behavior Error loading shared library librubyso No such file or directory needed by usrlocalbundlebinwpscan Error relocating usrlocalbundlebinwpscan rubyinit symbol not found Error relocating usrlocalbundlebinwpscan rubyoptions symbol not found Error relocating usrlocalbundlebinwpscan rubyinitstack symbol not found Error relocating usrlocalbundlebinwpscan rubysysinit symbol not

launching the scan Your environment Version of WPScan Version Version of Ruby ruby p revision x linuxgnu Operating System OS Debian GNULinux n l VM guest Expected behavior Scan should be started I have an access to this domain from my VM Actual behavior Screenshot with error stacktrace is attached wpscan Would be good to add a check for the wpeprivateconfigjson file that apparently contains sensitive information Ive yet to find an example of what one looks like References Homebrew formula currently installs WPScan version we should update it to install the latest version Not about config backups but for backups plugins For example by default Duplicator Pro creates wpcontentbackupsduppro For example BackWPup has a random folver like wpcontentuploadsbackwpup bcce temp UpdraftPlus has wpcontentupdraft Could be interesating to show that as information that maybe there are files there Subject of the issue I did a scan of a site and it returned WordPress version identified Latest released on Which is true for the branch However on and This is an archive of every release we ve done that we have a record of None of these are safe to use except the latest in the series which is actively maintained So perhaps should be flagged as prone to be updated Your environment Version of WPScan Version of Ruby Operating System OS Steps to reproduce Tell us how to reproduce this issue Expected behavior Tell us what should happen Actual behavior Tell us what happens instead What have you already tried Tell us what you have already tried to do to fix the issue you are having Things you have tried where relevant Update WPScan to the latest version Update Ruby to the latest version Ensure you can reach the target site using cURL Proxied WPScan through a HTTP proxy to view the raw traffic Ensure you are using a supported Operating System Linux and macOS Subject of the issue Perhaps this is premature since it is still in beta but may eventually become relevant as it seems to have garnered a significant following and is gaining momentum ClassicPress as of beta is currently detected as WordPress This is not surprising as they havent changed all of their generator tags I expect it to partially if not completely happen by release I mostly bring it up for consideration The page head though not RSS feed meta generator tag for beta currently reads html meta namegenerator contentClassicPress I havent dug into it deeply but I see a couple of version tags in View Source of a stock setup of CP logged out ofc incognito nondefault theme html link relstylesheet iddashiconscss href typetextcss mediaall script typetextjavascript src There are probably other ways to pull a version but I have not yet researched it deeply Another thing that I can think of for when generator tags are stripped it would only tell you if WP or CP not version bash curl I contentlength Your environment Version of WPScan Version of Ruby Operating System OS Mac OS High Sierra Steps to reproduce bash wpscan url Expected behavior At minimum I would expect it to return ClassicPress rather than WordPress Returning the actual version ex beta would be ideal but discovery methods

case the site is in fact a wordpress blog but it may have some kind of security measures I tried to hit wpadmin and got a but robotstxt is available and makes it clear theres a wordpress blog there
