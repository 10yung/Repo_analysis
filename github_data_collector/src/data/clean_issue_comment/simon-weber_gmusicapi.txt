Hi with this PR I want to propose a replacement for the deprecated validictory module fastjsonschema module seems to be faster than jsonschema module too Thanks for this amazing project Ive been using this function to remove playlist entries successfully but I notice that according to the documentation the function removeentriesfromplaylist Returns a list of entry ids that were removed However it seems that the function will basically return whatever is specified as the input parameter As a simple example python apiremoveentriesfromplaylistuhello Will return uhello where I would expect it to return None since no playlist entry ID exists with this value Is my understanding correct here Im using version but from the changelog I believe this also applies for the latest version Cheers This might be an incredibly stupid issue but it looks like users that dont subscribe to google play music arent able to search for songs based on videohits or extract a youtube video Is there any possible workaround for this or do you absolutely have to sub to GPM I currently have a GPM subscription alongside thousands of tracks that Ive uploaded and I want to use gmusicapi to tell me what tracks Ive uploaded vs what have been added from the subscription Ive pulled out a diff of the keys in a track that I uploaded vs a track that I added via subscription Fields in addedtrack not in uploadedtrack trackType explicitType trackType has a numeric value of either or explicitType has a numeric value of either or Whenever there is trackType there will be explicitType However I have come across some tracks that have only explicitType from this pair For these that only have explicitType they look to be songs that I purchased from iTunes Music back in the day Do you know the significance of these fields trackType and explicitType Can these be used to accurately determine a track added from a subscription From my investigation it seems so I am thinking of adding a PR to include a function to report on tracks added from a subscription thoughts I myself am migrating away from GPM so I want to know what tracks to add to my new streaming platform Others might find this beneficial too it could be used in a migrating tool from one platform to another Hi I just installed a docker container which is basically a wrapper for your api jaymoulingooglemusicmanager The issue I had was a lot of duplicate tracks getting uploaded which google music seemed to miss From what I gather this seems a common problem I was just wondering if it would be an idea to add an option to tag the mp files on successful upload or keep a list so theyre skipped on future upload calls Id love to get this working but as it stands its unusable for me Let me know your thoughts Thanks As you may have heard google has released a new service called youtube music which has lots of similarity with play music There are news that google eventually plans to replace play music with youtube music The good thing about youtube music right now is less authorization headache and new information like destinction between singles and albums would be really good this library supported it Just as a recommendation and knowing everyones opinion I can t seem to get Webclientlogin to work I have a account with fa auth I tried with an app password or my regular password Mobile client and Music manager work without issue I am using the webclient because it has reportincorrectmatch and the other clietns dont have that Is there a workaround in the meantime Thanks Currently the Web Client only supports uploading album art It would be nice if we could also change the songs metadata I see thats already documented in the protocol section so it makes me wonder why its not implemented in the library Been using everything fine until a few hours ago when any call to getstreamurl returns with XRejectedReason DEVICENOTAUTHORIZED when using MobileclientFROMMACADDRESS Im able to do everything but getstreamurl Using an actual Android ID seems to work so Google may have changed something to stop us using MAC addresses Makes no difference if FA is enabled or not This is probably a dupe of sorry Im just curious and because there hasnt been an issue about it yet I though Id create one Basically google also keeps taps on every played track over at This does not apply to gmusicapi however Im thinking of Mobileclientincrementsongplaycount The only reason Im curious is well partially because of OCD D because Im not sure how this could affect machine learning related stuff radio stations IFL etc Does anyone know more about it
