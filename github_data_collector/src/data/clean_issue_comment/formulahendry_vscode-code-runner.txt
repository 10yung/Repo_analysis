shortcut ctrl alt m to stop the code doesnt work I tried running infinite loop and see if I can the stop the code but it doesnt stop I am forced to closed the entire thing and re open it again To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Run infinite loop Try the shortcut to see it if you can stop the code Actual behavior The shortcut doesnt work and gives me an error Expected behavior I expected the code to stop running with the shortcut Screenshots If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem Screenshot v While not a bug it seems that the default key binding for the

run the code correctlyit seems that the python version doesnt support change with line coderunnerexecutorMap Expected behavior Description of what you expected to happen code runner support run code with choosed python version Screenshots If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem Hi Excuse me for asking this question here instead of stack overflow Since English is not my first language i cant draft a good question as per stack overflows standards After all i cannot add any code because this is not related to any programming language question I am using Nim programming language I have files in my project and i want only one file to run all the time Rest of the files are include files Now VS Code is running the active file So each time when i want to run i need to activate the main fileSay i have a file named testnim and i want to run that file always How can i do it Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates FYI issues VS Code Version OS

the behavior python printk end when i click Run Codeit will show printk end SyntaxError invalid syntax but it go succsessfully when i debug or run the code without using Code Runner and it also succeed in pycharm Actual behavior SyntaxError invalid syntax Expected behavior run successfully Screenshots If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem settingjson terminal

command cd without the parameter d will not be able to enter the corresponding directory It seems to be used in conjunction with coderunnercwd I dont know if this is a bug or the original intention At present I configure the configuration of the corresponding language in coderunnerexecutorMap and add cd d dirat the beginning Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates FYI issues VS

doesnt work Actual behavior Not saving the file Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates FYI issues Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe My feature request is specific to the needs of people learning the Ada programming language for the first time And yes this is a group of programmers that exists still There is currently a drought of software able to properly support Ada Among the software that can do so are outdated buggy implementations of IDEs GNATGPS or methods that take too much hassle to work Eclipse Visual Studio Code is the closest to a seamless experience for the language Ive experienced only to find that some programmingrelated setup was required A turnoff for many users I was successfully able to compile and run the closed source gnatmake in your extension by loading it in the packagejson file and setting the string for adb files to cd dir gnatmake fileName dirfileNameWithoutExt However this isnt sufficient as the output terminal is frozen as readonly and terminal input is required for some applications Describe the solution youd like As the title suggests Id like to see full Ada support in this compilerrunner since theres no real crossplatform means of compiling and running Ada code If nothing else a way that someone can point me to set up compiling and running Ada code the way I and others use the language Ive searched in the forums and I saw nothing in regards to the Ada language Therefore I feel this request is appropriate Thanks
