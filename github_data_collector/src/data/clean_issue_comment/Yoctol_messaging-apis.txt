The messenger logo link was invalid not found Due to the official docs paymentsettings is not in the Messenger Profile Properties Maybe we should remove Payment Settings related APIs from messagingapimessenger It would be better to support APIs in Slacks native API structures eg conversationsinfo current API SlackOAuthClientgetConversationInfo Slacks native structure SlackOAuthClientconversationsinfo close And then we may want to add shortlived access token and reissue token support for LineClient This is a feature request Id love if there was an integration for Discord API since it became a quite popular platform for communication and it would be helpful to be able to use a common interface to manage it as well as the others that are supported here
