Hi I tried implementing the SSL Pinning configuring the DER certification into the bundle Im getting an error load failed with error Error DomainNSURLErrorDomain Code cancelled NSURLErrorFailingURLSessionTaskErrorKeyLocalDataTask FADE EB F A CA C A NSLocalizedDescriptioncancelled aaa Task FADE EB F A CA C A finished with error code Please help on this Its better to have array indexes in query parameter names such as swifthttpcomarray value array value It fixes an issue when a GET request contains nested arrays like the one below Swift let dict String Any boundingbox coord coord Currently ArraycreatePairs produces names without indexes swifthttpcomboundingbox coord boundingbox coord Which causes boundingbox query parameter root elements as seen below Array Array st Element coord Array nd Element coord With this change we will have following URL swifthttpcomboundingbox coord boundingbox coord Now server reads the array properly as root element as seen below

Hello Im trying to post a JSON array of objects to a server Im pretty sure that server side works perfectly because Im interacting with it using android app I have created Id be very appreciate if you could help to solve the problem I have with creating the same app on iOS using swiftswithttp Here is the method Im parsing an object to array string any public func toDictionary String Any var itemDic String Any itemDic UserId UserId itemDic SelectedItems getSelectedItems return itemDic private func getSelectedItems String Any var array String Any for item in getSelectedItems arrayappenditemtoDictionary return array When I print toDictionary result I can see in console the following output UserId SelectedItems AnswerId ItemId AnswerId ItemId AnswerId ItemId Here is the code how I post the object to the server HTTPPOSTServerApiREPORT parameters modeltoDictionary response in process response The UserId parameter is receiving but the SelectedItems always empty Can you

String Any file Uploaddata imageData fileName img mimeType imagejpeg HTTPPOSTmyurl parameters parameters headers headers completionHandler completion but the backend doesnt receive the image May this be caused by the library Does it work for anyone else First off thanks for this awesome library I want to pass the following dictionary as get parameter param param a When passing only nonarray values such as param it works just fine But when I pass an array of strings the parameters are converted to a url as follows param B Da page param manually making this more legible param a param whereas it obviously should be param a param note the brackets after param A similar thing happens when trying to code the string array myself by escaping quote chars and then manually adding the parameters in the URL directly let urlAppendix param a param The response will actually not have any data at all the URL is nil the text data is empty Any idea why this is not working properly Do I need to do anything differently
