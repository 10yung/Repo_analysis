When using this UIKit buttons in Touch Bar do not have a bezelColor except standard buttons like ESC When commenting layer self class layerClass alloc init in UIView bezelColor works however of course UIViews do not show anymore For me the compiler complained here Adding extern fixed it At Toushay we recently ported a large iOS codebase to OS X via Chameleon In the process we encountered several differences between iOS UIKit and Chameleon This pull request is a compilation of all the changes we needed to make to Chameleon to get our application behaving properly Sorry for lumping a bunch of unrelated changes into one pull request Let me know if youd like me to split it apart or exclude any commits This patch set fixes a drifting issue in the autoresizing logic This behaviour is caused by the rounding bias introduced by the use of floorf function in UIView superviewSizeDidChangeFromCGSizeoldSize toCGSizenewSize It fixes it by keeping an internal CGRect for the UIViews frame using unrounded floats When updating the internal CGLayer for the view it rounds it using CGRectIntegral to prevent subpixel blurring when the autoresizing puts a view at noninteger coordinates It then removes the unnecessary calls to floorf in the autoresizing calculations Fixes BigZaphodChameleon Love this project but Id like to be able to access Passbook on Mac OSX Mountain Lion Will the PassKit Framework be added anytime soon It isnt a very large framework I did some testing and the real iOS at least in the emulator doesnt reorder the subviews to match sublayer order NSLogView n selfwindow subviews objectAtIndex NSLogLayer n windowLayer sublayers objectAtIndex selfwindow exchangeSubviewAtIndex withSubviewAtIndex NSLogView after view swap n selfwindow subviews objectAtIndex Swapped NSLogLayer after view swap n windowLayer sublayers objectAtIndex Swapped magentaLayer removeFromSuperlayer yellowLayer removeFromSuperlayer windowLayer insertSublayeryellowLayer atIndex windowLayer insertSublayermagentaLayer atIndex NSLogView after layer swap n selfwindow subviews objectAtIndex Still the same NSLogLayer after layer swap n windowLayer sublayers objectAtIndex Swapped Seems that the Chameleon implementation of UIWebView doesnt have a scrollView property Its just not there build other iOS libs on Mac such as PSTCollectionView
