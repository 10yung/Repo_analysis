Hello my title sums it up but heres the thing in detail I parse xsd files into a list with XML library heavycheckmark I take a sublist of the first list heavycheckmark I want to turn it into datatree I try a simpleList the nonleaf nodes are unnamed b explicitList this only returns me a node named root Ill upload an example in the next few minutes in my git see the comments FromDataFrameNetwork converts the dataframe to a hierarchical network structure I takes too long to convert to a network object when the number of points is too high Is there a way to speed up the process dataacme acmeITname ITNEW acmeIT Hi I would like to be able to change level names from unique IDs to humanreadable tags in my tree structure A sample of the tree printtjpCPI CPITag levelName CPITag CPI Food Cereals Rice Non Glutinous RiceA RiceB Glutinous I would like to swap the IDs in level names to the readable CPITags I am trying to use the Do function tjpCPIDofunctionnode nodelevelNamenodeCPITag but that throws an error of Error in function unused argument quoteCPI How might I go about changing the levelNames Thanks in advance Hi I am trying to Find a node in a tree with nonunique names Lets say I have this dataacme acmeResearchAddChildIT When i use FindNodeacmeIT It is pointing to different ones in every time Is there a way I can search only in specific level may be in level Another thing I am trying to create the tree programatically like this librarydatatree constructtree functionx gq Nodenewsessions fori in nrowx ifx ictype RECORD gqAddChildx icname else y asdataframex icfields forj in nrowy parent x iname parentAddChildy jcname gq But in this one i keep getting Error operator is invalid for atomic vectors Is there a way I can use variable as node names Thanks Is there a way to speed up this conversion specifically with ToNewick libraryape databirdfamilies systemtimebf asNodebirdfamilies systemtimen ToNewickbf See Datatree allows you to generate plots for trees very easily with the plot command However saving the resulting image in formats such as png pdf or jpeg fails even using Rstudio The issue was mentioned already on the web but the answers provided there did not work for me so I have used screenshots for the time being I will continue to look into the documentation from the inbuilt packages used by datatree but it would be nice eventually if some additional piece of code can be extracted for users of datatree like me who appreciate the selfcontained aspect of the package On some machines when printing a tree the is replaced by U A U B See screenshot below I havent seen this on a mac but have on linux and windows Any idea how to get the to print appropriately img width altscreen shot at pm src Takes more time to generate nodes through asnode from a dataframe Need to optimise for performance
