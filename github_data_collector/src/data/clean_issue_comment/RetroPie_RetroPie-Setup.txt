This change will make radiolists and checklists useable binbash pizzadialog checklist Pizza with cheese on chicken off ham off tuna off dialog clear clear echo Your order Pizza with pizza I have a tv box with armbian installed debian and I dont have a platform that can be use to install on a s x board vero k and odroicc have this kind o cpu but are demanding install dependencies that are not easy to resolve theres any way to create a installation for a generic s xxx board Now that the Mali branch has been merged into the SDL super branch we need to explicitly set enablevideomali as per other Mali platforms After install Dolphin PCSX will be removed due packages dependencies User should be able to just reinstall PCSX but after request the reinstall system will be lead to a broken dependencies state in apt The reason Dolphin build requires portaudio dev and the PCSX package is missing a dependency on libjackjackd i and both packages are not compatible This PR is just changing the PCSX script to explicitly require libjackjackd i so when we request to installreinstall apt will be able to solve the dependencies This is valid for Ubuntu and Debian Similar to other SDL based emulators pass the resolution arguments to the emulator to be expanded by runcommand when started Enable the dispmanx SDL videodriver only for the Raspberry Pi platforms that dont use the KMS driver capricerpi install with sh access for scanlines and high resolution activate for default the title says all Retrieves missing Atari XL XE colour palettes so they are usable in the emulator I had problems installing virtual gamepad because pm installation was throwing errors Method Not Allowed Installing it using the official installation script instead of npm worked for me I never liked the blurry scaling that we get as a sideeffect of our SDL upscale so I found a way to leverage vcgencmd to apply a better looking IMO nearest neighbour scaler this is the same way that Retraorch does it with the dispmanx video driver see Its also probably unmeasurably faster Screenshots From my phone as I couldnt get the internal screenshot button to work Ignore the debug info in the corner Before bilinear After nearest opinions may differ as to what looks better but IMO the look the emulator should be controlled by the emulator config in this case the various n video plugins do support AA etc and our upscaling should not apply additional effects
