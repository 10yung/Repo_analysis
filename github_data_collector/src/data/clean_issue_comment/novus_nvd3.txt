Im using multiBarChart and set reduceXTicks true how can I set count of xTicks this is my result my chart and my code is here var chart nvmodelsmultiBarChart duration reduceXTickstrue rotateLabels stackedtrue showControlsfalse groupSpacing chartyAxistickFormatd formatf d selectchart svg datumprepareData callchart Its not comparable with the latest versions of D v and v which is a big concern Id love to use what you have as its really nice but I get the feeling that maybe this has been abandoned and might be risky for me to invest time into implementing on our projects PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE SUBMITTING A NEW ISSUE ARE YOU ASKING FOR HELP Please use Stack Overflow tag nvd js and include a link to a live minimal example on jsfiddle plunker The live example should use the latest code for nvd Links are below Supported D js version v ARE YOU REPORTING AN ISSUE Please provide below information with the issue NVD version used Browser and OS used Live Example Jsfiddle Plunker Expected Behaviour Present Behaviour Any more information regarding the issue added offset to Y coordinate to display tooltip correctly when page is scrolled NVD version used Browser and OS used Safari Mobile Chrome Mobile IOS I ve encountered a slight tooltip bug on mobile devices primarily IOS using an iPad Air where if a tooltip appears for a particular chart the tooltip never disappears and as I scroll throughout the page the tooltip stays in that same fixed position The tooltip doesnt disappear unless I click on a chart that displays another tooltip The tooltip only disappears upon page refresh A good reference would be the charts at where the same issue occurs on mobile devices The NVD Live demo is pretty and clean But it is not evident not didactic about details Ideal to be Plug and Play for dummy users is to add a link to the simplest complete HTML example with the snippet code into the OnLoad encapsulation and with explicit use of data see typical dummy bug datumdata in this discussion or this NVD bug PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE SUBMITTING A NEW ISSUE ARE YOU ASKING FOR HELP Please use Stack Overflow tag nvd js and include a link to a live minimal example on jsfiddle plunker The live example should use the latest code for nvd Links are below Supported D js version v ARE YOU REPORTING AN ISSUE Please provide below information with the issue NVD version used Browser and OS used Live Example HIGHchart Expected BehaviourDRILLDOWN FEATURE Present Behaviourwe are expecting drilldown feature to show the hierarchy data Any more information regarding the issue drilldown to show hierarcy data us good way it si good to get year wise monthly wise weekly wise i want to use lasso select in scatter plot but when i add d v js in my html page its give some error like this nvd minjs Uncaught TypeError OwatchTransition is not a function at SVGGElementanonymous nvd minjs at d jsorgd v minjs at Y d jsorgd v minjs at ArrayCoeach d jsorgd v minjs at Arrayb nvd minjs at ArrayCocall d jsorgd v minjs at SVGSVGElementanonymous nvd minjs at d minjs at Y d minjs at ArrayPleach d minjs what to do i have NVD version used Browser used Chrome Firefox safari OS used windows linux Problem Expected Behaviour tooltip should come inside the svg not outside Present Behaviour tooltips generated outside the div ie it is not fully visible tooltipissue Problem Expected Behaviour Width of the graph should be Present Behaviour Width is not fully it creates a lot of space from both ends leftspace NVD version used v Browser and OS used Chrome Win I recently upgraded our nvd from v to v so wed get this bugfix for duration not working on pieCharts However it seems that it has had no affect no matter what I set my donut charts duration to it animates instantly While I realize angularnvd is a separate library these are the plunkers I could find to show the problem When I tinker with the angularnvd pieChart example here and a plunker here in a similar vein duration doesnt appear to affect the speed at which the slices of the pie will animate when you toggle other slices onoff although in that example there is an animation to begin with unlike my donut but the speed of it doesnt change no matter what I set duration to Is there a known issue in nvd where duration has no affect on pie charts per chance
