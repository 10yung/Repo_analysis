Hi Do we need to normalize the images of Facescrub and Megaface before feeding them to the model to get features Thank you for reading Hi Feng happynear Thanks for your efforts in FaceVerification Im currently trying to utilize ur code in Megaface dataset to measure ur AMSoftmax model since I use Ubuntu OS and caffe I tested MTCNN on Linux which is all good but I find that you are using a MTCNN windows project to finish alignfacescrubm the hint you gave was MatMTCNN If you are not using Windows you need to modify some of the codes to directly use the Matlab version of MTCNN If you have done such a work Im glad to merge your codes However Im a little bit confused on these words whats the difference between MTCNN and MatCNN Also the code in sphereface alignment use MTCNNbut v not v if I use MTCNN model in original repo will the result be the same Or do you have any clues on how can I directly use the Matlab version of MTCNN If you have the code could you share it with me Many thanks Can any bigold help me The link of washed up list for casia is dead Can u upload a new one Thanks Hello I have some questions about the drawcurvem code I just copy the code and use it in my computer I changed the resultfolder and the featuresuffix But when I ran the code I can not see the curve about the cmc The results are as follows So how can I solve the problem Thank you very much Hi I am curious how to use JointBayesianm I want to use the problem like this run JointBayesianm inputimage jpg inputimage jpg and then it returns same or not Ive read the paper Bayesian Face Revisited A Joint Formulation it seems that I should first extract lbp features or LE features which I dont know how to do it By the way I have the pairlistlfwmat and get accuracy after I run the code which is not the way I want to use Can you give me some advice Thank you HiI am beginnerin path FaceVerificationBLUFRdemopcam in the sixth line what is blufrlfwconfigmat excuse me can you sent the blufrlfwconfigmat to me thanks very much I used sphereface to extract features and I get rank and I have read another issue similar to my question But I am confusing that if I can directly normalize the features by xminmaxmin rather than use the normalizelayer for each image I am doing a project on Face VerificationJoint Bayesian using transfer learning in python From where can I download lbpWDRefmat idWDRefmat pairlistlfwmat and lbplfwmat files Hello I have the computational resource I can train the siamese network if you are willing to share the database and script Sorry for writing as an issue couldnt find any other way to reach you Regards Muaaz Bin Sarfaraz muaazbinsarfarazgmailcom
