The system call to generate MD hash was Macspecific Updated to include Linux and windows calls Im trying to use a few MEX functions but am running into an error in MATLAB saying XXXmexw is not a valid Win application This happens with most of the functions needing CGAL everything else seems to be fine Followed the instructions below Ok did you already download CMake and VS Open CMakeGui Set Where is the sourcecode to gptoolboxmex and Where to build the binaries to gptoolboxmexbuild Click on configure A window opens Select Visual Studio Win for Specify the generator for this project Click Finish in the same window Process the error messages CMake might throw and select the features you want for your build by checkingunchecking the associated checkboxes eg WITHELTOPO Click on configure again If there are still error messages then fix them Repeat until there are no more error messages Click on generate There should be no error messages If there are errors fix them Click on open project which opens the project in VS In VS Compile the project Originally posted by maxfrei in Configuration MATLAB r b VS Tried with VS same problem Boost CMake Any help would be much appreciated U performfastmarchingmeshVF is not working for meshes I gave as input n it kept running indefinitely is there any requirement that mesh needs to be manifold if not why it is not working it is not giving any error also Line indicates that IM for the removed vertices is set to But its actually set so that the removed vertices have a value larger than sizeRV Line should be changed to and VfindIMsizeRV RV to describe the actually implemented functionality The input description for meshremoveduplicateverticesm suggests that epsilon is the uniqueness tolerance significance digit However the current behaviour of the function does not comply with this definition Changing line to this should do the trick SVISVJ uniqueroundV epsilonrowsstable In the example SurfaceSurface Intersection of the

Surface and Surface These edges blue lines look like separate continuous groups in the plot which represents the free boundary of the legs of Surface as shown in the pictures attached What Im wishing for is to post process the data points of these linescontinuous polygons of edges and store it in a C x cell array each line continuous polygons of edges is Nx double inside the C array Sorted from beginning to end in one direction CW or CCW In other words how can I get every group of continuous polygon in a separate Nx double arraySorted from beginning to end in one direction CW or CCW And in general if there was more than continuous lines continuous polygons of edges is it possible to have every continuous line in a separate double array Nx as long as they are connected through a vertex and these double arrays will be inside Cell arrayMx where MNumber of lines continuous polygons Help would be appreciated Thank you so much I have wrote the following code where I used SSurf as an

the intersection lines BEFORE applying my code The results for the second example according to my code was LineSortedall x cell as in the picture below which is wrong I was supposed to get LineSortedall x cell One cell for inner line and one for outer line Here are the intersection lines AFTER applying my code Thank you so much Im almost totally new to programming except for Matlab and I cannot compile the mex files as per the instructions in the mex readme Its probably just my lack of experience but I dont know what programs I need installed and how to execute the commands I am familiar with command lines etc but have never used visual studio cmake etc Could someone please clarify a list of what programs are required and list the steps in the compilation procedure Thank you Garrick ive stl files and im tryngo to do simple boolean operation in matlab im loading the two meshes with meshload and then i get this error while doing meshboolean some suggestion Error using intersect line Not enough input arguments Error in importare line V F meshbooleanVFV F intersect Hi Im using Linux and trying to compile Mex Using came version and libigl has been downloaded under gptoolboxmexlibigl I had this error and not sure why Do you know whats going on here CMake Error at cmakeFindELTOPOcmake message could NOT find LIBELTOPOINCLUDEDIR Call Stack most recent call first
