I tried to build pyrebox on my debian machine and it fails during compilation Here the steps aptget install buildessential zlib gdev pkgconfig libglib dev binutilsdev libboostalldev autoconf libtool libssldev libpixman dev libpythondev pythonpip virtualenv pythoncapstone virtualenv pyreboxvenv source pyreboxvenvbinactivate pip install r requirementstxt source pyreboxvenvbinactivate buildsh It compiles the sleuthkit successfully but it fails during compiling qemu with the following error In file included from usrincludestringh from homecubesecuritytoolspyreboxqemuincludeqemuosdeph from

properly documented and new features such as file system inspection symbol caches volatility are not documented Hi I tried running the current codebase on two machines with Ubuntu and Debian To get a taste of what I mean by extremely slow it takes over minutes to boot a freshly installed Windows on an i QM machine compared to minute in Ubuntus QEMU in emulation mode no enablekvm and same switches used for pyreboxi and vanilla qemusystemi When I start a demo program within mwmonitor say AlKhaser or the standalone PuTTY client I can see the agent transferring the file in the expected path and the entry point for the executable shown on screen then Ill have to wait a few dozens of minutes to see any activity say for PuTTY it took about minutes to reach the Executed first instruction Successfully removed trigger stage and then minutes to show the GUI When I unload the monitor the function call log is generated apparently correctly I only tried it in light mode On the first run ever file symbolsWin SP x was generated with about three errors on missing files I once let mwmonitor run AlKhaser for about two days and it was still executing some of its checks when I killed it Any

scriptexampleminpy doesnt work for my setting My settings PyREBox installed on Ubuntu Guest system Windows x My observations I cant see callback logs after PyREBox is started I checked the code of vmicpp and found that osindex parameter in method vmiinit is set to VistaSP x rather than Win x when volprofile equals to Win x My question is is it because Windows is not supported on current PyREBox or Windows works the same way as VistaSP When I modified source code by changing osindex in vmiinit from VistaSP x to Win x I can see one log message for the creation of first process and then no logs for the remaining processes Please suggest on how to make PyREBox callbacks work in Windows setting Thank you This PR adds a custom command called rap that implements a radare RAP server To start using it add the following module to pyreboxconf MODULES radare rap True Then from the pyrebox shell use the following command to start a RAP server listening on localhost pyrebox custom rap After that you can connect to pyrebox using r with r e iova w raplocalhost pid or proc name The RAP server can be closed from the pyrebox shell with pyrebox custom rap shutdown Hi I am trying to use your project to speed up malware unpacking So I am trying to set up malware monitor Following the instructions I have compile the DbGenerator from the project Deviare after patching it as you saw first just this tool and after that the full project The issue is that to use DatabaseDbBuilder run builddb you need a prepossess headersin this case preprocessW h or just a h file with the headers you want to build the database for The preprocessW h headers are missing at least in my case I have seem many headers file under the directory HeaderBuilder What would be the proper header file to be used with Malware monitor in Pyrebox Cheers Vicente The VM agent allows easier full automation of tests both for windows and linux The tests should be improved so that they can be run automatically x Listing processes during system boot and system operation x Monitoring individual address spaces processes Monitoring individual threads separately x Extracting module information for user processes and kernel as well as symbols Extracting symbols from dynsym dynamic symbols from memory Add documentation on how to generate volatility profiles for linux kernels Add tests for linux VMI process and module creationremoval detection and other relevant callback types Hey all Super interested to play with this I see you have a Dockerfile created Unfortunately I cannot create an automated build against your github account since I do not own it Could you guys setup an autobuild what about the performance Whole system emulation would be very slow i think
