server in Python issue Restore the response argument to excexceptionsUnauthorized pr excexceptionsUnauthorized doesnt add the WWWAuthenticate header if wwwauthenticate is not given issue The default URL converter correctly encodes bytes to string rather than representing them with b issue Fix the filename format string in classmiddlewareprofilerProfilerMiddleware to correctly handle float values issue Update classmiddlewarelintLintMiddleware to work on Python issue The debugger detects cycles in chained exceptions and does not time out in that case issue When running the development server in Docker the debugger security pin is now unique per container Version Released Rule code generation uses a filename that coverage will ignore The previous value generated was causing coverage to fail issue The test client removes the cookie header if there are no persisted cookies This fixes an issue introduced in where the cookies from the original request were used for redirects causing functions such as logout to fail issue The test client copies the environ before passing it to the app to prevent inplace modifications from affecting redirect requests issue The werkzeug logger only adds a handler if there is no handler configured for its level in the logging chain This avoids double logging if other code configures logging first issue Version Released excexceptionsUnauthorized
