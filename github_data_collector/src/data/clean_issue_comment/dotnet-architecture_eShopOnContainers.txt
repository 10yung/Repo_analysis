where are the connect services Identity Services IdentityUrlconnectauthorize IdentityUrlconnectuserinfo IdentityUrlconnectendsession At my job we can only get docker using windows containers working but it seems this example uses Linux containers I am new to this and I have gotten the project work on my home machine How hard is it to switch Do I just change the sql MySQL etc all to grab a windows image instead of Linux or is it more complex than that Any specific reason why AddEventBus instance is not resolved using the ServiceProvider return new EventBusServiceBusserviceBusPersisterConnection logger eventBusSubcriptionsManager subscriptionClientName iLifetimeScope First of all thank you for this awesome project and colaboration I followed all steps from this tutorial and have all services running helthy But when I try to apply solution described in Known issues dont work on MacOS Catalina Im running in kubernetes docker desktop But how should be work I patched ConfigMaps and restart services according tutorial Someone have any idea Which the best strategy running e debug using Ubuntu with VsCode The ideia is learning with this project make ajusts e etc Hi after I do pull the latest version i have this new problem below The ng serve not running I would like make changes in WebSPA projeto running in background full projeto com dockercompose for consuming the api endpoint Notes OS Ubuntu IDE VS Code In the RemoveBackStackAsync method the following expression is evaluated before every loop iteration i mainPageNavigationNavigationStackCount and the NavigationStackCount will change right This means that not all the previous items in the stack will be removed For example in a stack of fourth items only two items will be removed public Task RemoveBackStackAsync var mainPage ApplicationCurrentMainPage as CustomNavigationView if mainPage null for int i i mainPageNavigationNavigationStackCount i var page mainPageNavigationNavigationStack i mainPageNavigationRemovePagepage return TaskFromResulttrue I changed the previous method to the following public Task RemoveBackStackAsync var mainPage ApplicationCurrentMainPage as CustomNavigationView if mainPage null var navigationCount mainPageNavigationNavigationStackCount for int i i navigationCount i var page mainPageNavigationNavigationStack mainPageNavigationRemovePagepage return TaskFromResulttrue Maybe Im missing something but I had to change the implementation for the second approach Hi I moved WebSPA to app services while keeping every other service running on Azure Kubernetes services The first time I tried to click on login it tried to navigate to localhost for authentication and of course failed because there is no identity service running on the app service plan nodesat least this is my understanding I changed IdentityUrl in appsettingsjson to the AKS API server address ie API Server Address but now it times out when I click on login The message I received is below This site can t be reached AKS API Server Address took too long to respond I am allowing all ports sources protocols destinations inbound and outbound security rules for the NW security group in the AKS infrastructure Resource Group Outbound IP Addresses for the App Service itself is limited to IPs though and I dont seem to be able to add other IP Addresses to this IP list what could I be missing or doing wrong TIA Bumps handlebars from to details summaryChangelogsummary Sourced from handlebarss changelog v September th Fixes Security Disallow calling helperMissing and blockHelperMissing directly c Disallow calling helperMissing and blockHelperMissing directly c Features Add new runtime option allowCallsToHelperMissing to allow calling blockHelperMissing and helperMissing Breaking changes Compatibility notes Compiler revision increased b This means that template compiled with versions prior to will not work with runtimes The increase was done because the helperMissing and blockHelperMissing are now moved from the helpers to the internal containerhooks object so old templates will not be able to call them anymore We suggest that you always recompile your templates with the latest compiler in your build pipelines Disallow calling helperMissing and blockHelperMissing directly c Calling helperMissing and blockHelperMissing directly from a template like in blockHelperMissing was never intended and was part of the exploits that have been revealed early in see It is also part of a new exploit that is not captured by the earlier fix In order to harden Handlebars against such exploits calling thos helpers is now not possible anymore Overriding those helpers is still possible If you really need this behavior you can set the runtime option allowCallsToHelperMissing to true and the calls will again be possible Both bullet points imly that Handlebars is not percent compatible to despite the minor version bump We consider it more important to resolve a major security issue than to maintain compatibility Commits v September th Bugfixes The browser property in the packagejson has been updated to
