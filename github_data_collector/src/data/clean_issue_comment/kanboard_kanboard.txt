 Actual behaviour When you try to close a sub task you are reminded that you have another sub task in progress and asking for a choice before continuing useful but the name of the project where it is located is not present and in this case it becomes less useful confused Expected behaviour I believe that adding the name of the project to which the subtask in question refers is very useful and I would also insert a clickable link to access the main task in a new window wink What do you think Screenshots kb Configuration Kanboard version I know this is a duplicate of Definitely worth implementing though It would be nice if the comment would appear in a column between Title and Assignee in the subtask section of the task view I would LOVE for the subtask section to look like this Subtask x Make sure to And also Etc Subtask x Make sure to x And also Etc I dont think this would duplicate all features of tasks and I think it would make subtasks much more useful Please read the documentation Ask questions on the Forum Actual behaviour On a populated Board View approx tasks dragging and dropping a task between columnsswimlanes takes seconds to complete During the task move the processing of thousands of SQL queries generates a CPU spike The severe delay when dragging dropping tasks which is considered to be a main visual advantage of the Board View results in a severely detrimented GUI experience Expected behaviour The omission of superfluous SQL queries should result in a more fluent task handling Logs Attached debug log debug log debug log Configuration Kanboard

reproduce analysis Observation Moving a task on boardA takes about seconds usability acceptable Moving a task on boardA takes about seconds usability severely detrimented Assumption Apparently contrary to and the continued discussion in which seems to focus on the HTTP client aspect it appears extraneous database server operations with CPU spikes of are a cause of the performance

page is instantaneous Collapsing all swimlanes makes no discernible difference Please read the documentation Ask questions on the Forum Actual behaviour There is a wrong define Name in Documentation to deactivate automatic LDAP user creation Disable Automatic Account CreationBy default Kanboard will create a user account automatically if nothing is foundYou can disable this behavior if you prefer to create user accounts manually to restrict Kanboard to only some peopleJust change the value ofLDAPACCOUNTCREATIONtofalse Automatically create user account defineLDAPACCOUNTCREATION false Expected behaviour The implemented define is LDAPUSERCREATION Configuration Kanboard version Actual behaviour User A manager affords Read access to his Project to User B User B manager creates Project Task X User B can duplicate Task X to Project Expected behaviour User B cannot create tasks in a project he only has Read access to In big organizations it is sometimes not possible to change the existing LDAP structure OU groups etc It is not possible to make it satisfying the existing LDAPGROUPMANAGERDN setting in order to get any new LDAP user to be Manager at its creation Adding the LDAPUSERDEFAULTROLEMANAGER boolean setting makes it possible to get any new user to be a Manager when set to true Of course this setting is disabled by default Fix for Added some top level domains to the match function of the AttachmentLinkProvider so that com net edu org io and gov are marked as web links not attachments This will prevent links like from being marked as attachments instead of web links See my comment in the issue this fixes for more details Actual behaviour Instead of showing the Captcha after failed logins or when you want to reset the password it just shows the alttext If you want to see the captcha and right click to view image it just says The image cannot be displayed because it contains errors When you replay the request with curl it returns the following file which seems to be a corrupted jpeg file generated by gd No idea what kind of file that is GIMP gives the most verbose error message when opening it Not a JPEG file starts with x a xff I looked at it with hexdump C and it seems to contain the string CREATOR gdjpeg v using IJG JPEG v quality in the beginning so it seems to be some bug with gd Expected behaviour A Captcha is displayed Steps to reproduce Open See that instead of a captcha image only the alttext Captcha appears Look at the image in the browser download it with curl for further debugging curl H UserAgent Mozilla X Ubuntu Linux

hidden A clear and concise description of what the bug is Expected behaviour Swimlane is not hidden if there is only one even if has the collapsed state Show swimlane toggle even if there is only one A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen Steps to reproduce Create a fresh project Add a task to the Default swimlane Create a Extra swimlane Collapse the Default swimlane Expand the Extra swimlane Delete the Extra swimlane Have a look to the Board Default swimlane disappeared Screenshots Before deleting Extra swimlane MySuperProject Chromium After deleting Extra swimlane If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem Configuration Kanboard version Im not admin on my instance I was unable to find this information Let me know if its fixed now and Ill ask for an update at my side OS Windows Browser Chromium Let me know if you need more details Thank you Please read the documentation Ask questions on the Forum This appears to have been addressed before but despite it looking like it was fixed Im still seeing swimlanes with a minheight of px even when there is only one task in them meaning swimlanes with one task that should fit on one screen takes a lot of vertical scrolling past empty space to see everything see screnshopt below There are instrctions to edit css files and to uncheck the max height option in the actions menu but these must relate to previous versions as I can neither find entries in the css or js that set the minheight nor the actions menu to uncheck the max height option Actual behaviour A clear and concise description of what the bug is Swim lanes have lots of empty space Swim lanes have a minimum height no matter how few tasks they have in them wasting screen space Expected behaviour Swim lanes should contract in height to fit just the tasks in that swim lane to reduce vertical scaling A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen Steps to reproduce Add multiple swim lanes Add one task per swimlane This happens with both the default theme and the blueboard theme Screenshots These are the only tasks in this project there are no other tasks in other columns Logs Configuration Application version
