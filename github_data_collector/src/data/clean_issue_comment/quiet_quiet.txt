I spent a while getting here and these days I meticulously document everything so I dont have to refigure it out two weeks later I thought Id share maybe youll put it on your wiki page or somewhere Thank you so much for sharing quiet with simpler folks like me Building everything including deps from source having the bajillion standard tools required for a common build environment not included here building deps mkdir quietproject mkdir requireddeps cd into requireddeps and read on libsndfile if you want to encodedecode tofrom wav files wget tar xzvf libsndfile targz cd libsndfile

calls encodedecode profilename inputsource the available profiles list audible kchannel audible kchannel helloworld ultrasonic ultrasonic cable k audible ultrasonicwhisper final forwarderrorcorrection caveat it says that libfec is not required but then when i read in the bugs section the author says you basically need it and that all profiles that define either a innerfecscheme or outerfecscheme will crash if libfec isnt around after opening up usrlocalsharequietquietprofilesjson and changing the audible profile to have both fec lines none one can successfully call quietencodesoundcard audible pathtotextfile and hear the encoding coming from speakers woot some example uses play audible encoding directly from speakers quietencodesoundcard audible tmptextfiletxt decode same on

development branch to go off of theres liquiddsp and quietdsp both seem to be for the same thing but referenced differently in the readme the error that it found it but a different version Hi I am trying to build quiet on Windows with CMake and Visual Studio bit I am having this issue The failure seems to be here checklibraryexistsliquid

functions in both quiet and liquiddsp The problem I see is that resamprrrfexecuteoutputblock is required by quiet but isnt available in liquiddsp I followed the instructions and am using the devel

quite a lot of data Only the ultrasonic and ultrasonicwhisper profiles actually managed to get the data back in full and without errors I wasnt even using any cables or microphones or adding any noise the encodedwav file was pristine straight from the encoder Maybe I dont understand the concept but shouldnt this produce perfect results I was using quietencodefile ultrasonicwhisper testtxt to encode content in testtxt However this profile cause the program hanging I have to send TERMINATE signal to stop the process But the program is running OK with ultrasonic profile I checked the difference between them The differences are samplespersymbol centerfrequency and framelength So I do not have idea why this happen Hi this looks like something I really wanted but Im not sure whats the bitrate you achieved Im looking to transfer some big data files say over MB via audio so not sure if this project will work for me programsencodefilec in line memory is allocated in line function returned but

Brian Awesome project thank you I am looking at an application where I can only write square waves Rounding from the samplessinusoidal output gives decent but not great performance I thought Id be able to easily write a square wave directly from symbols but these values are very scattered particularly during the preamble and pn phase Is there a reason these values are interpolated in the way they are Is there a stage where one can extract pure phase shift values without digging into liquid Any general thoughtsadvice on writing square waves would be highly appreciated
