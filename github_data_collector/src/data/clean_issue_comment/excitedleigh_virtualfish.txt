Move definition of the deactivate function inside workon so it is only defined when using a virtual environment Then when deactivate is called it removes itself from the session The docs use the stable branch and it doesnt include certain features which the latest version already provides in my case the environment plugin I believe the autoactivation philosophy is to only have the venv activated when you cd to the directory I saw that the venv would stick to you if you cdd out of a project using the project plugin and the workon command Made so thtat the project workon command tries to cd first and then set the venv if autoactivation didnt do it first Tried to respect case handling feel free to modify Ive been using this on my machine after getting inspired by pipenv so I thought this could be a good addition to virtualfish Basically the vf new command can automatically guess an appropriate virtualenv name using this function and create the virtualenv without having to manually provide a dir name fish function dirhash echo basename PWDecho PWD shasum cut c end For example dirhash ampy fa e a pwd homedevProjectsampy Thanks for this wonderful plugin Hi first of all i would like to tank you for your work with this project Im fairly new to fish and this project and have a problem with installation Following setup instructions ends up by usrbinpython No module named virtualfish in Debian Whats happening aaDEV sudo pip install virtualfish Collecting virtualfish Downloading Requirement already satisfied virtualenv in usrlocallibpython distpackages from virtualfish Installing collected packages virtualfish Successfully installed virtualfish You are using pip version however version is available You should consider upgrading via the pip install upgrade pip command aaDEV echo eval python m virtualfish configfishconfigfish aaDEV fish usrbinpython No module named virtualfish aaDEV Deleting appended string from configfish aaDEV echo eval python m virtualfish configfishconfigfish aaDEV fish aaDEV aaDEV vf The directory homeaavirtualenvs does not exist Would you like to create it Tip To use a different directory set the variable VIRTUALFISHHOME yn y virtualfish Usage vf command args Available commands activate Activate a virtualenv addpath Adds a path to syspath in this virtualenv all Run a command in all virtualenvs sequentially cd Change directory to this virtualenv cdpackages Change to the sitepackages directory of this virtualenv connect Connect this virtualenv to the current directory deactivate Deactivate this virtualenv globalpackages Toggle global site packages help Print VirtualFish usage information ls List all of the available virtualenvs new Create a new virtualenv rm Delete a virtualenv tmp Create a virtualenv that will be removed when deactivated For full documentation see aaDEV aaDEV cat etcissue Debian GNULinux n l I find it strange that i used pip and not pip and installed it eventually for python I think its somehow related to debian distribution and as debian is mainstream distribution it probably would be good to point newcomers somehow to solution With great respect for your work When executing vf new h vf new help vf new version new environments are created with name of the flag instead of displaying helpversion information vf takes the last argument and creates the virtualenv here This is probably related to Ill try to send a PR in the future Using multiple cd calls means one cannot use cd to return to the previous directory vf globalpackages isnt supposed to change directory so it should use pushdpopd instead Fixes Wrap the creation of the installdir configfishconfd in a try sentence in case you already have it in your system ie omf creates the confd directory Also changed the the second parameter to and deleted existsok All this to make it compatible with python X that cant parse existsok Stock Python venv module has an upgrade function that lets you upgrade virtualenvs created via that but that doesnt seem to work with virtualfish created venvs Having a similar mode for vf eg vf upgrade venv would be great
