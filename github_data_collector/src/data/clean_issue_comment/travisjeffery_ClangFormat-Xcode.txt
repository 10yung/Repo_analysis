While working on I realized that clangformat has transformed c define LIMITMAXT GenericT unsigned int UINTMAX unsigned long ULONGMAX unsigned long long ULLONGMAX into c define LIMITMAXT GenericT unsigned int UINTMAX unsigned long ULONGMAX unsigned long long ULLONGMAX and couldnt quite figure out which colon rule needs to be set to leave alone Generic block I set like follow KeepEmptyLinesAtTheStartOfBlocks true but a lot of result like follow voidstopAudioMix GStopAudioMixlivePush there are no empty line after But other format has been applied Is this a BUG Please update this plugin to support XCode I resigned XCode ClangFormat plugin loaded its menu appeared but its not working nothing happens when I try to format code Maybe its because of new editor in XCode It can be really cool to get XcodeClangFormat app for Xcode via homebrew cask This is the documentation Hi I am confused about this line in the documentation Clone this repo build and run ClangFormat restart Xcode I assume it means to run open ClangFormatxcodeproj build the project and run the code After doing that and restarting Xcode the Edit menu does not contain a Clang Format submenu as shown in the GIF Am I missing something obvious Xcode text The result is always like this text Allow format selected range without explicit selection in which case the current state under the cursor will be formatted bug Hi Ive realized that current clangformat bin has a wrong Linux configuration after some investigation this is the source of the change Ive installed clangformat through HomeBrew and it works like a charm but would be nice to have it updated on the plugin for most of the users Cheers I have problems when configured plugin to use File but open projects where there a re no clangformat file The problem is especially when formatonsave enabled I dont wanna toggle this option every time I change project
