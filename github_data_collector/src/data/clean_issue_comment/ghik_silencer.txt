This would be particularly useful in order to silence unused import warnings based on whats being imported eg with regexbased compiler option like PsilencerlineContentFiltersimport scala collection compat Motivation for the change Other tools like a scalafix or WartRemover uses SuppressWarning Its hard to type and remember import comgithubghiksilencersilent if ure not using IntelliJ or other IDE Requires useless provided dependency in classpath silencerlib pollutes maven artifacts SuppressWarningsArraysilencer works like silent SuppressWarningsArraysilencerpattern works like silentpattern WDYT ghik Just wanted to note that adding this flag to scalacOptions caused an error when trying to generate docs sbt doc To fix I have removed this flag from Compile doc scope in buildsbt like so scala scalacOptions inCompile doc scalacOptionsvaluefilterNotSeqPsilencercheckUnusedcontains Although perhaps the flag could also only be applied to the Compile compile scope scala scalacOptions inCompile compile SeqPsilencercheckUnused consider using sbtcirelease to fix broken release once and for all typically the warning would be a deprecation warning imports cant have annotations so it would have to be via some other mechanism a special comment a setting where you specify what deprecated things you want to be able to import warningfree opening the issue partly as documentation that there isnt any support currently
