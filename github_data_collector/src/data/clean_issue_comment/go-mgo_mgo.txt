Hi Im developer of Mongo Go Modelsmgm Its a modelbased wrapper of Mongo Go Driver that Im trying to make it the Best ODM wrapper of Mongo Go Driver package Give it a try and let be in your README if you are ok with it I wrote two functions and a struct to improve the readability of the code and to make the writing of it faster You can find it in sessionwrappergo Storm is a great toolkit for boltdb and I dont use bolt without it I think it is an important option to mention as a viable alternative to mongo Fixes Currently mgo sends a getnonce request to mongodmongos immediately upon connection regardless of the auth mechanism ultimately being used Through MongoDB this is mostly harmless as the allocated nonce eventually expires when the connection goes away however with MongoDB the MONGODBCR authentication mechanism has been removed and ideally the getnonce command would go with it In the interest of BC with existing tools using mgo the getnonce command will be retained for the foreseeable future as a dummy command so that mgo based tools wont break however wed like to remove it eventually and hope that by updating mgo we can do so Changed introuced to introduced If socket was killed it should be removed in session so that new socket can be setup for session As title indicates this is useful to allow a scattergather query to return partial results when a nonzero number of replica sets are down Although no answers were given to this issue I went ahead made the change I had in mind Also give an example of an error returned as a QueryError in production so you can see what eg the Message field may look like
