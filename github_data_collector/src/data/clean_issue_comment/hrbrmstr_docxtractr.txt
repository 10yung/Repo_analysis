Thank you for docxtractr While reading a docx file I have a special symbol tick mark within a table Currently using docxtractr renders them as null character Requesting to see if this can be enabled in this package Thanks a lot for such a great package I was trying out docxtractrreaddocx on doc files in Windows using LibreOffice Version x It was horribly slow due to LibreOffice I guess if I dont open LibreOffice manually outside R Once I close and run the same code in R again its slow r fn roughmessyfilesdocdoc librarytictoc LibreOffice never opened in after last PCreboot tic tmp docxtractrreaddocxfn toc sec elapsed min LibreOffice open tic tmp docxtractrreaddocxfn toc sec elapsed LibreOffice closed after open tic tmp docxtractrreaddocxfn toc sec elapsed It is ok for a single file but if you have bundles of files then definitely not a good thing I was thinking if any alternative way of supporting doc files can be given to users Like use of docx j as mentioned in this repository Then the system dependency on LibreOffice will go away and I believe that will be smoother also Ref from docxextractcmnts to docxextractallcmnts There was a small error in README This package is incredibly handy thanks I dont know much about XML but looking at an unzipped docx file it appears that if the footer exists each section of document has a corresponding footer XML file eg footer xml Would it be possible to add a function that iterates through and extracts a documents footers and headers I suppose but for the motivating use case its the footers Im interested in It doesnt look like footers have IDs the same way comments do but it would be great to be able to retain the section number of each footer Is there any other information that would be useful Thanks in advance
