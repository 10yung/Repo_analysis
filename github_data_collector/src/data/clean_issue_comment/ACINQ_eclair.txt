This PR builds on top of lnd expects ids ranges in replychannelrange messages to strictly follow each other without gaps For example using block heights and not ids would be split into first num first num This is arguably a limitation of lnd clightning does not requires this and its not needed to properly process replies but is easy to implement It would be great if I could connect the Eclair mobile wallet to my Tor only electrs server using Orbot Sadly I cant because it requires a valid SSL certificate Please make an exception if the custom Electrum server address is an onion domain As suggested from others in my initial PR I created this PR to cover up eclaircore and not only eclairmobile This will allow an external signer to fully validate the transaction For example providing the redeem scripts allows checking the OPCHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY delay that a remote commit tx uses our revocation base point etc For more background on the external signer strategy see Use gettransaction for wallet transactions code How to solve this We add new errors that let senders know they need to raise the trampoline feectlv When the error is downstream we select the best error to forward The error message produced now provides the user with a solution Of course its temporary until they receive another nonsegwit UTXO This issue tracker is only for technical issues related to Eclair Please do not open issues for support requests or questions about Lightning or Eclair use our gitter at instead Please check that there is not already a similar issue before opening a new one Describe the issue What behaviour did you expect I expected that the readme file to which this error links would provide some information on how to deal with the inability of Eclair to use a wallet that contains nonsegwit outputs That error is displayed in because I was unable to copy it It serves as a good example on which to base a solution in this particular case More generally however I think any link offered by a reported error the readme file in this case should contain something to indicate what someone can do if they found a solution to the error which they would like to be available to others I What was the actual behaviour provide screenshots if the issue is GUIrelated See I have provided a fix for this in pull request I think the error message can be improved directly to say To use the current bitcoin wallet you must send any existing nonsegwit UTXOs to a new p shsegwit or bech address before starting Eclair so I might work on another pull request to do that This issue tracker is only for technical issues related to Eclair Please do not open issues for support requests or questions about Lightning or Eclair use our gitter at instead Please check that there is not already a similar issue before opening a new one Describe the issue What behaviour did you expect When Eclair pops up a message box like this one it should be possible for the user to select the text of the message and copy it This was not the case with the message above If this is an aspect of the underlying Java environment please let me know so I can report it as a JVM bug The message above was produced with a file called eclairnodegui ecbjar on a Windows machine running JDK
