How can I change the space before or after a paragraph in preview sometimes I find the space is too much I want the spacing to be more compact how can I configure it Markdown title this is a test paragraph everything is ok item item itme New paragraph here Thanks Hey there i recently discovered that Markdown Edit supports custom markdown engines and at first I was overjoyed since this means that I can use MultiMarkdown whenever I need footnotes D But sadly I discovered an issue The first line that is written in Markdown Edit is not parsed in the live preview Please see the images below for reference Second line and any after that is being rendered correctly First line is not rendered correctly The first line of the file I am editing is not parsed by into the live preview No matter what kind of markdown is used Versions I am using Markdown Edit Version MultiMarkdown Version Output of MultiMarkdownexe version MultiMarkdown v Copyright Fletcher T Penney My multimarkdown configuration file relevant lines only CustomMarkdownConverter D Program Files MultiMarkdown bin multimarkdownexe CustomMarkdownConverterArgs Additionally if I parse a file which has markdown in the first line with MultiMarkdown manually it works just fine Heading turns into h id Heading h If I copy the HTML output out of Markdown Edit it is exported as p p Apparently the first line is Always rendered as regular text regardless of the markdown tags that are present If I on the other hand put the Markdown on the second line and copy the HTML the following is my output HTML p p h id h It appears that Markdown Edit puts a single empty pp tag around the contents of the first line regardless of what the actual content of the line is only starting the actual parsing afterwards This means you will only have one column instead of two Perhaps adding another switch button When opening MDE it remembers the last state of the pane visibility cycled through with F If the last state was preview only ie the editor was hidden files dont appear to get processed the preview pane is blank and if F is pressed to view the editor pane the normal syntax highlighting isnt applied to the source Once the editor pane has been made visible even if only briefly this seems to trigger normal processing again and newly opening a file or displaying the help with F result in expected behaviour once again Win Pro bit MDE I havent tried other processing engines but Im using the default nonGitHub engine whichever that is List in list It will not work with spaces Parent s s Child s s Child It works with spaces Parent s s s s Child s s s s Child Anybody here please go to this topic and ask Atlassian to make it works It seem they are very stubborn to update to lasted markdown specs If I make changes to a Markdown file outside of Markdown Edit it currently does not detect those changes and I have to manually reload the file It would be much nicer if it watched the directory containing the file with a FileSystemWatcher in case the file changed for any reason external editor pull from source control etc FileSystemWatcher is already used to watch for changes in the user settings file template file and snippets file but not yet for Markdown source files that are being edited If any changes were detected it should display a message box indicating that the file was modified and asking the user if they want to reload it and discard any unsaved changes they might have if any or ignore it Eg heres the dialog box that Notepad displays when it detects external modifications Notepad screenshot Note that some text editors will edit a file inplace open truncate write close while other text editors will write out a temporary file and then rename it on top of the old file and some others might delete the original before writing the new file so making sure that all of those cases are handled correctly can be nontrivial in latex generates the percent sign However this appears to be unsupported in Markdown Edit For example renders instead of Hi guys best Editor ever but one thing seems to be strange Why do you escape some special charsThese backslahes are shown on other editors I work parallel on NextCloud NotesAddon Eg checkboxes look like my note wich is not really nice Any chance do disable that Such as the title I think changing it to a multitab editor like VS Code can make it easier for people to write documents I often need to open several documents at the same time and write together This is just a suggestion I hope you can consider it Hi Would you mind adding a Dutch spell checking dictionary For example Thanks in advance
