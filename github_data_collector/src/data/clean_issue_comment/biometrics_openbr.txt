Hi When I try to follow the the Face Recognition tutorial with the command br algorithm FaceRecognition compare datapic jpg datapic jpg I get an error from the stasmcpp code Set algorithm to FaceRecognition Comparing datapic jpg and dataRecnitionpic jpg Enrolling datapic jpg to pic cshRcsmem Fatal Failed to load Stasm Cascade SDK Path usrlocal File Function Line Abort trap It is probably something with this piece of code cpp private StasmCascadeClassifier make const StasmCascadeClassifier stasmCascade new StasmCascadeClassifier if stasmCascadeloadGlobalssdkPathtoStdString shareopenbrmodels qFatalFailed to load Stasm Cascade return stasmCascade I cant find any related issues on this and hope someone could help me out a bit Im a beginner when it comes to openbr and opencv I have interest in convert this project to opencv Do you also have this interest Add me as a contributor Is there an example or tutorial explaining to load descriptorstemplates computed outside OpenBR to the clustering algorithm I read the source code for rank order clustering and you have done a neat job The only issue is I am not able to figure out how your neighborhoods are constructed from the templates Any help is greatly appreciated Thanks in advance So this is in v there are warning during the cmake configuration for QT Test and QT OpenGL and during linking it fails I dont think I missed any Cmake Variable I only set the build type Solution CMakeListtxt add Test and OpenGl line in the QTDEPENDENCIES Hi all currently Im working on a project about face recognition using openBr but i have a problem when writing a extra module to frontalize face image using dlib when using this module openBR did not run properly it does not return result when compare template does any one know about this issue Hi all I am new to this project Heres some questions when I installed the application My compile environment MSVC Cmake openCV Qt for VC it seems that the tutorial shows MSVC Cmake openCV Qt for VC of course I cant successfully finish the installation Please guide me to join this project I am NEW to compiling and my dream is to have some effort on coding area This project would be my first big step Have a discussion always my pleasure Dear all Ive been following your great installation tutorial at Im using Debian Linux that I downloaded yesterday from the official repo It uses g v For most of the time things went smooth except for a tiny little problem with contributed code in OpenCV that was easy to fix OpenBR compiled fine except for some wanings Then I proceeded to the tests outlined in item of the tutorial mentioned before Then two big surprises st there was clear misspelling in the file downloading script named downloadDatasetssh it referred to a downloadMedssh script that actually is named downloadMEDSsh nd typo corrected I proceeded to the test per se running make test in the build directory This time the problem was greater as all tests failed besides the initialization Is that correct or maybe there is a step that was not followed correctly All the best Hilton Replacing END by exit seems to be a solution The label is used by some error macros This symbol on nowhere defined within openbr The cxmisch file is not found in the core directory next to boostcpp
