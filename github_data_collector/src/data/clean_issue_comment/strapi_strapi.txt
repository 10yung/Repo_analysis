System Nodejs version NPM version Strapi version beta Database postgresql Operating system MacOS Thanks in advance Hello Thank you for submitting an issue Before you start please make sure your issue is understandable and reproducible To make your issue readable make sure you use valid Markdown syntax Describe the bug Apollo breaks when it tries to query strapi for a dynamic field with multiple types This problem seems to occur only using apollo because in graphql sandbox everything works fine Steps to reproduce the behaviour Strapi Backend Go to Strapi admin panel with qraphql plugin instaled Create a dynamic field with more than component Nuxtjs Frontend Send query using apollo to strapi for dynamic field See errors about missing fields Expected behavior Apollo gets an array of fields with multiple types from the dynamic field Screenshots Screenshot from Screenshot from System Strapi Backend Nodejs version v NPM version Strapi version beta Database SQLite Operating system Linux Nuxtjs Frontend nuxt graphql graphqltag nuxtjsapollo rc Additional context It seems to be more of apollos bug than strapis tho All solutions I found revolves around adding apollo IntrospectionFragmentMatcher to the backend but I have no idea how to correctly implement it in strapi This issue makes dynamic fields with graphqlapollo virtually unusable so I think it would be good if someone would look into it and maybe made some tutorial or mention in docs how to set up dynamic fields correctly in strapi with qraphql Hello Thank you for submitting an issue Before you start please make sure your issue is understandable and reproducible To make your issue readable make sure you use valid Markdown syntax Describe the bug I am developing a shift management app Currently there is only one new ContentType which is like this jobs Important note Creator is a onetoone relationship with User and Enrollers is a onetomany relationship with User I make multiple instances for Users and Jobs And here is the result if I get all jobs Request jobsintotal And here is the result if I get all job which includes trungemployee in enrollers Request trungemployeejobs This should not be correct here as all Jobs Enrollers has the user with username trungemployee Even funnier this is the result if I get all job which includes trinhemployee in enrollers Request trinhemployeejob The only one result does not even have trinhemployee as the employee Additionally I tried the test with enrollers id Request enrolleridjob This should show nothing as I dont have jobs with enrollers id equal to One final test I tried to test it with enrollers id Request enrollerid Is it referencing job id instead of enrollers id here Final note all queries using creator in where with the above conditions result in expected behaviors So I am not sure what is the case with enrollers Steps to reproduce the behavior You can make the same ContentType and some instances to reproduce this issue Expected behavior Expect Request to response jobs with id right now none are responded Expect Request to response jobs with id and right now job id is responded Expect Request to response jobs with no jobs right now job id is responded Expect Request to response jobs with id right now job id is responded Screenshots Provided above Code snippets Provided above System Nodejs version v NPM version
