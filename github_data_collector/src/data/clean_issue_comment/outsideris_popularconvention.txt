trailing commas in lists in JavaScript to make git diffsmerging easier fewer changed lines and this is also supported in other languages like C I think its definitely still in the minority but it would be a cool metric to be able to see separate from the comma beforecomma after convention Could be cool to see that information as well See JavaScript onespace function s s nospace function s These regex check for function vs function without a function name not for function foo vs function foo like advertised Either the regex are wrong or the documentation is Ideal would be to check for function vs function and also for function foo vs function foo Tests JavaScript var onespace function s s function foo matchonespace null function foo matchonespace null function matchonespace function undefined function matchonespace null var nospace function s function foo matchnospace null function foo matchnospace null function matchnospace null function matchnospace function undefined Pie and similar charts are generally considered worse than bar charts in pretty much every measurable way See discussion at Including this linked article Switching to bar charts should be quite straightforward and would make it easier to see the proportions visually We developers get into flamewars over whether to align array structure and variable assignments Statistics of whether statements are aligned or not would be very interesting In ONGR Strict Standards Squiz based PSR compatible we forced unaligned statements because of the argument that one element might git diff a lot of neighbourghing lines Aligned code example we dislike php garry red longVariableName orange blue green javascript var func function var func function rationale for Crockford style is result of no space if you remove name javascript function foo function refer In PHP some people do interface CommandBus and some people do interface CommandBusInterface Like in C you might use ICommandBus Similarly you have EventGeneratorTrait and EventGenerator for traits It is now possible to link directly to a language but it would be even better to be able to link to a particular convention graphsection like line length c Constant Name Constant name is neither all caps and pascal cased suprefsup confused Im not sure what this is going for as it lists snakepascal case in the example Could this maybe be worded deifferently
