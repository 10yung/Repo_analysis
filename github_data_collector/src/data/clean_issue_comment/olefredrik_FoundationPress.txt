chatroom How can this bug be reproduced Step one On Android Chrome Press hamburger icon to open menu Step two Press elsewhere on the screen to close menu Step three Swipe page left to see unsightly white area outside the viewport area I tried adding overflowx hidden to the body but it would not resolve the issue It seems something happens after the JS has fired while closing the menu What did you expect to happen I expected there wouldnt be an awkward white area What happened instead White are remains after menu closes Please List the Following OS version Android Q Chrome Node version node

ordert to have a more recent appcss I have to do npm run package and then upload the packaged to wordpress site I want to produce changes locally and upload only the files that need to be updated not

permissions and there is no need for it You can see my fork Thanks The current code style and PHP compatibility setup is pretty outofdate inconsistent and convoluted The Travis script seems to try use your theme to unit test PHPCompatibility Honestly you dont have to as PHPCompatibility does extensive unit testing itself Just run it once on a high PHP version with a properly set testVersion and youre done or in case you want to test separately for compatibility with PHP and above and compatibility with PHP run it twice but running it the way its done now is really not very effective See As this is a WordPress theme you probably should use PHPCompatibilityWP instead of PHPCompatibility See The Composer file is pointing to the abandoned wimgphpcompatibility repo The package was moved to phpcompatibilityphpcompatibility a year ago squizlabsphpcodesniffer is not a direct dependency for your theme but a dependency of PHPCompatibilityWP Dont require it but let the package which depends on it manage the supported versions The DealerDirect PHPCS Composer plugin has released a new version and should be updated to use Composer treats minors as majors so this needs to be done explicitly See You seem to include a codesnifferrulesetxml file but dont requiredev the needed dependency WPCS for it The WPCS version which the ruleset seems to be based on is very much out of date and a number of sniffs have been renamed since This ruleset will not work anymore The ruleset has a nonstandard name which means that PHPCS will not pick up on it automatically Please consider renaming the file to phpcsxmldist The code is not actually checked against the ruleset via Travis anyway so what is going on here Please consider using the WP ThemeReview ruleset If this is truly intended as a startertheme I would strongly suggest leading by example and setting these things up properly and correctly Please List the Following OS version Node version node v Node v is required v

image the image is larger than this set size Im getting image pixelation So in this case the intrinsic size is always px wide So from what I can tell this is maximum image width But Ive set this size to be fplarge which is px wide So why is the image not rendering at this size The original uploaded image size is about px wide Ive attached a screenshot which shows whats happening Screen Shot at am Hi there is a thread on the main Foundation Github discussing the current state of the project its starting to sound like Foundation has been abandoned which obviously puts the future of FoundationPress in doubt Any ideas whats happening I found myself using the Foundation breadcrumbs component quite often however there was no easy way for me to actually generate breadcrumbs without external plugins I therefore built WordCrumbs a tiny PHP package for automatic breadcrumb generation that supports Foundationstyle HTML formatting If there is any interest in a breadcrumbs feature I would be happy to integrate WordCrumbs in FoundationPress and add a customizer option to enable or disable breadcrumbs Any feedback is greatly appreciated hi olefredrik i think project will be perfect when we have an options for minify version of css and js when compile and build appcss for compile and appmincss for buildarchive appjs and appminjs same
