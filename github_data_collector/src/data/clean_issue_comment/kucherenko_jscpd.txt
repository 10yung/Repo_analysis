Describe the bug Adding Ignored Blocks comments to markup doesnt appear to be ignored To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Have duplicated markup which jscpd finds as a clone Wrap the markup with jscpdignorestart jscpdignoreend Run jscpd Expected behavior jscpd should ignore the markup Desktop please complete the following information OS Windows Pro OS Version NodeJS Version jscpd Version Hi there Can JSCPD be used to compare plain text ie text files ignoring new lines and case Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Want to compare the files from diffs in branchs between master and all other source files like using eslint to compare diffs to increase comparing speed and reduce the report size Is this feature will be supported Describe the solution youd like Support diff commits in config files or cli Describe alternatives youve considered no Additional context no Describe the bug JSCPD tool is not working on node x To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Run node x Start the jscpd Error TypeError Objectvalues is not a function at JSCPDinitializeListeners hometravisbuildKinveyflexsdknodemodulesjscpdbuildjscpdjs at new JSCPD

Moduleload modulejs at tryModuleLoad modulejs at FunctionModuleload modulejs at Modulerequire modulejs at require internalmodulejs Describe the bug The console and HTML reporters do not consistently report the same output all the while the verbose reporter does To Reproduce Run jscpd twice consecutively on the same repo without any changes to the files nor the jscpd configuration Expected behavior JSCPD reports should always be identical when run on the same files with the same configuration Case These two commands were run consecutively without any changes to the files nor the jscpd configuration jscpdbugreport The HTML reports generated were similar in both cases to the console report meaning that files missing from the console report were also missing from the HTML report When I added the verbose reporter I could see that even if the console and HTML reports did not reflect it the files were always scanned Desktop OS Windows OS Version NodeJS Version jscpd version Additional context It should be noted that I encountered that behavior on a very small repository comprising of only a few very small files How I run the command jscpd blame ignore nodemodules My output node Warning NAPI is an experimental feature and could change at any time Clone found markdown READMEmd md Format Files analyzed Total lines Clones found Duplicated lines markdown javascript json yaml Total Execution Time ms I ran the command on this repo OS Ubuntu Git is installed and available in command line Describe the bug I dumped out a large number of JS Files for analysis Not sure

behavior The analysis concludes or a better error is returned to allow for correction of any file problems Desktop please complete the following information OS MacOs OS Version NodeJS Version jszip Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe The default store level has few disadvantages over memory it creates an intermediary jscpd folder it is slower At least on one mediumsize repository I tried it took seconds for level and seconds for memory I think the main issue with memory is that it does not work with huge repositories However the vast majority of users wont have that edge case The ones that do can optin to use level instead Describe the solution youd like Change the default value of storeOptions to level instead Describe the bug Run npm install g jscpd Got the
