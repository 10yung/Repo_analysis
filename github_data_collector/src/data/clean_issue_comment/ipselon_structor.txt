crossenv Edit packagejson as described in structor readme for integrating with createreactapp structor v At this point If anyone has a sure fire way to get structor to run and be usable on Fedora w nodejs Id greatly appeciate the assistance Ultimately I want to be able to simply select RunDebug from the IntelliJ run menu without it being installed globally or otherwise to use it but have it in debug mode so any errors are easily detected logged and therefore fixable with a pull request Ideas After a fresh clone of master Install libpngdevel Everything builds fine using npm run buildserverclientetc Attempts to run after installing globally fail missing file in hidden structor folder files see below Attempts to install locally fail ENOSELF obviously Just to verify that I can run the app outside of the IDE but not installed globally when I attempted to run after a yarn buildserver using the method shown here I get many cannot find files located in HOMEuserprojectfolderstructorbunch of js files it expects to find in this hidden folder Note tried using the structorstarter repo but it emits errors edit was able to get a fork of the starter to run
