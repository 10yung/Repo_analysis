links to LabelsTextViews What is the new behavior Span now has a linkClick event which when bound makes it possible for it to be interacted with via tap Implements reponed as draft Related to this issue For now this PR only checks for auto in width or height This is clearly not enough But the idea is to check if it is necessary to requestLayout on the parent Most of the times it is not necessary In the case of a complex app the improvements is huge It makes apps using animations not using N animation system which is too limited far more snappier This is only a POC Good morning Im trying to find out if a file exists prior to example delete it or rename it and of course Im using the exists function of File class but it always return false so this is causing a big problem for me Here there are my examples try JavaScript const fileSystemModule requiretnscoremodulesfilesystem const documents fileSystemModuleknownFoldersdocuments const path fileSystemModulejoindocumentspath mysqlitedatabasedbdb const exists fileSystemModuleFileexistspath consolelog Does mysqlitedatabasedbdb exists exists try JavaScript const fileSystemModule requiretnscoremodulesfilesystem const documents fileSystemModuleknownFoldersdocuments const path fileSystemModulejoindocumentspath mysqlitedatabasedbdb const path fileSystemModulepathnormalizepath here is the change const exists fileSystemModuleFileexistspath consolelog Does mysqlitedatabasedbdb exists exists Ive already verified that my file mysqlitedatabasedbdb that is actually a sqlite database is there and can be opened without any issue Here is my version info iOS simulator iPhone Android not tested yet tns tnscoremodules tnsios Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe The Image placeholder in BottomNavigation is currently supporting resources res local images or font icons font Describe the solution youd like Extend the image support by providing options to pass base string or image with

runtime error More detailed logs can be easily obtained by following the instructions in this guide Navigation to another page from a BottomNavigation and back again breaks the content of the current tab ListView can no longer be scrolled items cannot be tapped etc To Reproduce Add commands used or steps taken to reproduce the behaviour Create a BottomNavigation with a ListView on one of the tabs Add a pageroute to another page full page not tab content Navigate to the other page Go back The ListView can no longer be scrolled and the items cannot be tapped Switch to another tab and back again The ListView now can be scrolled again If you tapped on an item that action is triggered Expected behavior To be able to interact with the content of the tab Sample project If possible provide a link from the Playground with reproduction of the problem If not consider attaching a sample project or link to a repository with such project Ive created a demo project in my nsdebugging repository Additional context Add any other context about the problem here Ive tested on Android both hardware device Oneplus T pro and emulator Might be related to the fix for Environment CLI Crossplatform

classes but I always get the same error Cannot find name When trying to access the same function in a regular project noncode sharing everything works as expected To Reproduce Create a codesharing project Install tnsplatformdeclarations Write some code that interacts with the native api BuildRun Expected behavior The codesharing project should build just like the regular one Sample project

quite low in a StackLayout The result is that on my Android device the soft keyboard tries to open but closes before fully doing so See this video To Reproduce It can also be reproduced in playground Expected behavior I would expect the UI to move up like it does with all the other textfields due to the windowSoftInputMode I have tried the modes adjustPan and adjustResize Hi Having issue when
