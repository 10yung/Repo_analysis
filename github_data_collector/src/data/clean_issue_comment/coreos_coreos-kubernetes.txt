issue but the latest stable version did seem to have some changes as our network devices were renamed which broke BGP networking Will there be a new hyperkube version image build the last version is Hello Im mounting a host volume into the kubelet rkt container via volume srvkindhostsourcesrv mount volumesrvtargetsrv Below srv I mount some volumes on the host via systemd units eg j core systemctl cat srvbitbucketPGDatamount etcsystemdsystemsrvbitbucketPGDatamount Unit Beforelocalfstarget Mount Whatdevdatalvol WheresrvbitbucketPGData Typexfs Install WantedBylocalfstarget This worked fine up until a reboot since then the mounts below srv are not visible inside the rkt container anymore j core rkt enter c binmountgrep srvbitbucketPGData vs j core mountgrep srvbitbucketPGData devmapperdatalvol on srvbitbucketPGData type xfs rwrelatimeseclabelattr inode noquota Neither restarting the node again nor restarting the kubelet has solved the issue The only workaround Ive found so far was to remount the respective mounts after the kubelet was started which IMHO is a terrible solution as this means the Kubelet already has started the containers that use those mounts I try to

on CoreOS with master and worker nodes I have issues I wanted to assign host names to my k s Nodes instead on IPs as name so I assigned the hostnameoverride to string names like k smaster k sworker etc Everything worked fine but when I deployed the calicoyaml the caliconode containers showed the error of not resolve adress for because it started to use the hostname instead of IP What could be the solution for this I mean can I specify it to use IP instead of hostname or does it only uses the hostname The caliconode containers on worker nodes were in CrashLoopBackOff state so I thought that this is the issue and I changed back the hostnameoverride to IP address and restarted But the caliconode containers on worker nodes are stll in CrashLoopBackOff state The caliconode container on master node is working fine The logs of caliconode containers on worker nodes kubectl logs caliconodebvzf n kubesystem caliconode Waiting for etcd connection No IP provided Using detected IP ERROR IP address is already in use by host w k s Calico requires each compute host to have a unique IP If this is your first time running the Calico node on this host ensure that another host is not already using the same IP address Calico node failed to start kubectl logs caliconodefxxsz n kubesystem caliconode Waiting for etcd connection No IP provided Using detected IP ERROR IP address is already in

githubcomjteeuwengobindata recently deleted their account and someone else took it over We probably want to reevaluate how were using that tool and if we should switch to something else Hi is there a wrapper to install CRIO and use it with kubernetes on Containler Linux None
