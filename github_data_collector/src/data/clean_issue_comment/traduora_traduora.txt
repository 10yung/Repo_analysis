Describe the bug If you import a set of strings from a po file traduora will ignore strings that have msgctxt In this example only the first translation will be imported and all the month names translations will be ignored stringsespo msgid Search msgstr Buscar msgctxt month name msgid January msgstr Enero msgctxt month name msgid February msgstr Febrero msgctxt month name msgid March msgstr Marzo msgctxt month name msgid April msgstr Abril To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Go to import Import a po file that uses msgctxt Only from string is imported Expected behavior I would expect to see all the strings even if msgctxt is not supported by this system the original string should be available for transaltion I try it in my PC but I cant chage the System language I want to know is it already exists THX for your JOB fa is default country is IR There is no need for add faIR separately As we work towards a version it would be great to collect a list of adopters to help us spread the word Feel free to mention your company or project as a comment and Ill add you to the adopters list or you could also submit a PR to the readme Application Resource Bundle abbr ARB is a localization resource format that is simple based on JSON Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I am currently trying to translate a application There are tons of larger term eg email templates or pdf templates which have to be translated At the moment I cant import them into traduora as the terms are to long for the DB field From what I found out is that the value field in the terms table cant grow in size because of the index which is required for the unique Describe the solution youd like Maybe a hash can be generated from the term value which is then used for the unique With this solution we might be able to have larger terms Closes I chose the format used by the Laravel framework as base This should be easy enough to include in different frameworksprojects as required Currently only view over translations is possible ie i can select only a locale and view change all terms in the selected language It would be useful to be able to select a term and show change all its translations at once ie to be able to change all language variants of selected key on a single page Also it would be useful to be able to add new key on such page it will be add to all languages and default values or no values will be shown I see from the formatsmd file that PHP strings is on the roadmap I dont suppose you could give us a general estimate on when that will be worked on eg were no longer prioritizing this vs sometime in Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe When exporting the translation files in traduora they are currently exported as eg deDEstrings It would be great if it would be possible to change the default name so that the exported files can directly replace eg the files inside the xCode project It would also be nice to get all files for each language at once in a zip file Describe the solution youd like In Project settings add the possibility to change the export filename format For a xCode Swift project the expected structure is delprojLocalizablestrings delprojMainstrings frlprojLocalizablestrings frlprojMainstrings So also a remapping from deDE to de as prefix would need to be possible
