of this dependency updatesignore groupId orgspecs artifactId specs core details labels testlibraryupdate semverpatch There are two approaches mentioned in the READMEmd and I am a bit confused at this point There reason is that it looks like that first approach is impure and second approach if I am not mistaken creates a logger every time you use it in for comprehension Would it make sense to treat logger as Resource val logger Resource F SelfAwareStructuredLogger F ResourceliftFSlf jLoggerfromClass F thisgetClass def safelyDoThings F Sync F Unit for loggeruseinfoLogging at start of safelyDoThings something Sync F delayprintlnI could do anything onErrorcase e loggeruseerroreSomething Went Wrong in safelyDoThings loggeruseinfoLogging at end of safelyDoThings yield something I am still new to whole TypeLevelFP stack so please let me know if I am doing something completely wrong The use of Sync here propagates out to any code that wants to use the logger If instead it used F Defer Applicative and all the instances of Fdelayx were changed to Fdeferxpure F then this would relax the requirements and only reference type classes from catscore instead of catseffect This is quite a big change however as the typeclass constraints will propagate out through all the other layers of log cats Updates comgeirssonsbtcirelease from to Release NotesChangelog Ill automatically
