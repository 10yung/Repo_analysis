The text Threadsafe can only resume a coroutine in one thread simultaneously in the readmemd might scare people away Is this meant to mean does not implement send andor sync yet or it is inherently unsafe to use in multiple threads Cant compile in windows without stdmem import stackprotectedrs rust cfgwindows fn pagesize usize unsafe let mut info memzeroed this fails libcGetSystemInfo mut info infodwPageSize as usize This appears to be redundant please check if this is correct Thanks
