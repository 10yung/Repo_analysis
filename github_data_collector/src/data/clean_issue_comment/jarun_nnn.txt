Usage Either pipe command output into nnn or redirect a file to stdin The paths must be separated by Eg find size M nnn or nnn listoffilestxt Up to paths can be read at a time and no more than M will be read from stdin Reads are done in chunks of K A tmp directory is created and symlinks to the given paths are created with paths being as compressed as can be ie no directories are created that only contain another directory This directory is removed on exit Currently the symlinks are not followed for operations like remove and such Ill do that tomorrow I didnt have much quality time to spend on time so it took a bit longer that I wouldve liked but I havent forgotten about it Hopefully the code isnt that horrid This is really WIP and Im going to stop looking for bugs as I keep finding more and more as I get more and more tired Rolled from For next release x program option e replaces NNNUSEEDITOR x program option t replaces NNNIDLETIMEOUT x quit with error code on kbdQkbd x additional key kbdF kbd to toggle hidden x fix crash on entering empty dir then Down Proposed features and tasks up for grabs take list of files as input and show add PCRE code within a macro and add Makefile target to compile with PCRE library support predefined filters like bookmarks Cygwin package update the nnnvim plugin to show a persistent bar a video exploring nnn plugins Anything else which would add value please discuss in this thread List of completed features and tasks
