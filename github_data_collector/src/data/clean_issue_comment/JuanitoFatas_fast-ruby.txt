Would it be possible to gemify fastruby and also add contributors The idea would be to have a gem that just focuses on fast ruby in general also on rubygemsorg not just on github alone Not sure if this is wanted but Ill just add this issue here feel free to proceed how you wish to past this point I believe some examples could be non relative anymore with the latest Ruby version We should rerun all examples and update the results I noticed that many examples in code do not match the template ruby require benchmarkips def fast end def slow end Benchmarkips do x xreportfast code description fast xreportslow code description slow xcompare end removes gem update system cause it is now fixed on travis side As discussed
