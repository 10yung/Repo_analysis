hi all If my keras network look like model Sequential modeladdGRU paramsrecurrentunits activationlinear inputshapeprnfeatures prfeaturesize dropout namenet modeladdDense activationsigmoid models summary Layer type Output Shape Param net GRU None dense Dense None how to create the network structure for tinydnn I dont know how to fill the below variables recurrenttinydnngruinputsize hiddensize seqlen params Thanks Tinydnn is headeronlyCan I just type include tinydnntinydnnhand add the headfile into the project But I encounter this problem that tinydnntinydnnhno such file or directory whatever I use visual stdio on windows or armlinuxgcc on linux for accorss compliationAnd also there seems something wrong in the tinydnnh Please find the error message below Building CXX object examplesCMakeFilesexamplemnisttraindirmnisttraincppo In file included from homefebinStoragetinydnnmastertinydnntinydnnh from homefebinStoragetinydnnmasterexamplesmnisttraincpp homefebinStoragetinydnnmastertinydnnlayersl normalizationlayerh In member function virtual void tinydnnl normalizationlayerbackpropagationconst stdvectorstdvectorstdvectorfloat tinydnnalignedallocatorfloat const stdvectorstdvectorstdvectorfloat tinydnnalignedallocatorfloat stdvectorstdvectorstdvectorfloat tinydnnalignedallocatorfloat stdvectorstdvectorstdvectorfloat tinydnnalignedallocatorfloat homefebinStoragetinydnnmastertinydnnlayersl normalizationlayerh warning unused variable prevdelta Wunusedvariable tensort prevdelta ingrad homefebinStoragetinydnnmastertinydnnlayersl normalizationlayerh warning unused variable currdelta Wunusedvariable tensort currdelta outgrad homefebinStoragetinydnnmastertinydnnlayersl normalizationlayerh warning unused variable numsamples Wunusedvariable const sizet numsamples curroutsize tmpccJwUsAgs Assembler messages tmpccJwUsAgs Internal error Segmentation fault Please report this bug examplesCMakeFilesexamplemnisttraindirbuildmake recipe for target examplesCMakeFilesexamplemnisttraindirmnisttraincppo failed make examplesCMakeFilesexamplemnisttraindirmnisttraincppo Error I dont see this issue posted here When building examplesCMakeFilesexamplecblasmlpdirbackendscblastestmlpcppo on testmlpcpp line error too few arguments to function int randrunsigned int inputpushbackrandr RANDMAX On my glibc randr was declared as extern int randr unsigned int seed THROW Fix inputpushbackrandr seed RANDMAX can we use both test function and getloss functions at a time epoch enumerate If I use like that I Am getting loss as nan values I found one bug in multi class cross entropy that log nanso whenever stdlogy i should change to stdlogy i e instead of e we can add any small value how much I can keep b t and b t I am trying to match the performance with keras I could not able to find the b t and b t constant values Could you publish an example of training for semantic segmentation where the pictures are located as files in a folder Thank you Hello I am trying to train semantic segmentation net The net was build but I get exception in deconv d function file backendtinyh when calling to backwardactivation backwardactivationoutgrad outdata currdelta Message is Microsoft C exception stdbadfunctioncall at memory location x FB The exception is in the STD library area I am using the latest tinydnn code Hi Is there anybody can help me I use the g option static to compile the examples it can compile successfully but when I run the example benchmarkall it shows segment fault thanks in advance
