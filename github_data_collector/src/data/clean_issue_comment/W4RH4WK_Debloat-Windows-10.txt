Windows Defender context menu item Removing Windows Defender GUI tray from autorun Line of removeonedriveps If you have the option to Launch folder windows in a separate process in Folder Options checked then after running removeonedriveps explorerexe loads the Computer explorer window instead of loading the expected start menu taskbar system tray Maybe explorerexe didnt fully exit Tried it on two computers with the same results Now that the March update is out I think its time that the scripts should be updated to debloat I have huge faith in these scripts as theyve helped ease some of the pressure off of my yearold Dell laptop that I use for school but I really think there is some room for improvement Most of the scripts havent been updated in over months with the most recent changes being months ago and Im very sure that whatever updates Microsoft have made since then have added more bloat Ever since came out the reviews and news about it havent been very good and Im certain that theres been lots of bloat added in which can be removed It may be optional afaik but it wont be long until it will show up in the Windows Update screen When running removedefaultappsps on a fresh Windows Pro it fails upon doing a GetAppxPackage MicrosoftAdvertisingXaml RemoveAppxPackage This is because several packages depend on this such as MicrosoftPeople microsoftwindowscommunicationsapps as so forth So it should be moved to the bottom of the list or the logic should be expanded to check for dependencies first and uninstall those before uninstall For my case GetAppxPackage AllUsers must be run AFTER GetAppXProvisionedPackage Online French W Anyone has same problem I ran the scripts and I see that the live tile from the weather app is gone from the start menu Now it just shows the app icon instead How can I fix this Thanks Hi I have tried the script inside Windows and it works perfect However when I add this script during OSD Task Sequenceinside Windows PE sometimes it can remove part of the bloat software sometimes it wont remove them all all One of the hostnames blocked through blocktelemetryps causes Windows Update to claim that Youre up to date even though theres a Cumulative Update available Cant help you with the troublesome entry as I have no idea how to debug the hosts file under Windows Install a fresh copy of Windows April Update Apply blocktelemetryps Open Windows Update and check for updates In my case it successfully finds and installs the latest Malicious Software Removal Tool and Windows Defender definitions However the Cumulative Update wont ever show up Empty the hosts file Flush DNS cache Now the Cumulative Update will get detected and installed output Apps such as Autodesk Sketchbook Bubble Witch Saga Candy Crush Soda Saga Disney Magic Kingdoms Dolby Access March of Empires War of Lords Mixed Reality Portal Mixed Reality Viewer MSN News Paint D Sticky Notes didnt properly remove Maybe they are new default apps that come with the new versionbuild Please add them to the list if possible I can offer TeamViewer access if needed
