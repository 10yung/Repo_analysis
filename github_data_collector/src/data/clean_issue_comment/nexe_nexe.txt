 Please use this template while reporting a bug and provide as much info as possible Not doing so may result in your bug not being addressed in a timely manner Thanks What happened Im trying to create an executable for my script which uses puppeteer I used sh npx nexenext target and once I run the executable while nodemodules are present everything is fine However once the nodemodules arent there I get the following error console node UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning Error Chromium revision is not downloaded Run npm install or yarn install at Launcherlaunch homekiprasprivateprojectsnodemodulespuppeteerlibLauncherjs at async latestCarSnitcher homekiprasprivateprojectslatestCarSnitcherjs node UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning Unhandled promise rejection

promise rejections are deprecated In the future promise rejections that are not handled will terminate the Nodejs process with a nonzero exit code What you expected to happen I expect the executable

repos releases Target Node Version Nexe version sh nexe version Python Version sh python version Python Edit See also What happened Im using nexe to build a node CLI into a binary It works fine except for the fact that my CLI has a local dependency So in my packagejson I have dependencies core filecore The binary builds just fine but when I try to execute it the local dependency doesnt get bundled with it So if I try to run the binary while its not adjacent to a nodemodules directory that has the local dependency inside it then the binary immediately throws a module not found error internalmodulescjsloaderjs throw err Error Cannot find module core at FunctionModuleresolveFilename internalmodulescjsloaderjs Running the binary while Im adjacent to a proper nodemodules allows it to execute perfectly I found this issue where its explained that dependencies are discovered based on file extension This doesnt work for me since my local dependency is an entire directory a node package itself and so doesnt have a single file extension Im also not able to point to the webpack bundle of the local dependency as a local dependency in a packagejson must be either a directory or a tarball What you expected to happen I would expect any local dependencies to also be bundled with the executable so that the binary can be run from anywhere How to reproduce it as minimally and precisely as possible Build a library with a local dependency Use nexe to bundle the library Run the executable while not adjacent to a nodemodules directory that has the local dependency in it

requests What would you like to be added Code obfuscation feautre Why is this needed When I tried to open the exe express web app built using nexe I found all the codes were visible It would be better to have some code encryption feature before building the final exe When using nexe t platform it tries to download everything from the tagged release whereas newer versions of nodejs are not contained within there The nexe version Im using is the latest beta bash Error is not available create it using the build flag Should this be the default behaviour Im guessing that nexe hosts all the compiled binaries there because isnt released yet but currently it seems as Im not able to build everything with nodejs here Is there a way to verify build setup requirements eg library dependencies in C ABI compatibility sense Platform used Arch Linux uptodate Bit Version A new year time for a new version Things that I want to address Code Structure make more imperative simpler to grok update tooling Simplify bundling rely on NCC webpack Emit notes for native nodules already done in next with bundle Typescript support by default what even is JavaScript done with NCC Fix longstanding windowslinux filesystem bugs This will be greatly simplified by using ncc and having significantly less files Allow the use of something like resolvedependencies since the VFS will still be present Meta release things Adopt lerna because they baked in conventional commits changelogs conventional bumps Move to Github Actions Schedules dont really work on Azure Pipelines GH actions is basically Azure Pipelines with a github UI so the machines will work the same Only support LTS branches of Node Bonuses Update Documentation simplify to level of CLI have CLI API parity Remove RC capabilities defer to rcedit

What happened Hi I noted that required files that have classes definitions are not added in the final executable For example libraryjs class MyClass qwe indexjs requirelibraryjs Then compile using

single request its a Nextjs app with a custom express server Now after running the build command I can run my app using NODEENVproduction node serverjs using node and everything works as expected I can get the right data using httpContextgetWHATEV If I then run pkg using node and start the binary file httpContextgetWHATEV always returns undefined I couldnt find a way to debug it is it the node version you are using Is it because its an experimental feature Maybe something during the patch in Maybe related zeitpkgfetch What happened The app does not start properly when compiled with nexe
