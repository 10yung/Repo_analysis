one Probably makes more sense to have them be the contents of the variables rather than the deparsed variables ie file names Based on on noamross input Hi Brodie Your package makes awesome comparisons between objects I have a package called lumberjack that allows you to log changes in objects or data as they flow through a notapipe operator I think that the diffs that your package make would be a very nice way of logging We could store consecutive diffs so people can visualize changes in the cli The lumberjack framework is extensible and anyone can define loggers by providing an R or RC object The idea is that any packages that compare R objects can Enhance the lumberjack package by providing a logger object This way no installation dependencies are needed and everyone stays lightweight I think it would be interesting and useful to have a lumberjack logger object in diffobj If you are open to it I can do a PR I would basically add one file to the R directory and one to the test directory I could do it in R or RC as you wish you already import methods so RC may be your preference I would also add an Enhances line to your DESCRIPTION More information Introductory vignette and how to add loggers My talk at eRum Also The daff package will also feature a lumberjack logger on its next release lumberjack coming soon Cheers Mark For example would be useful to allow a super wide display width to capture wide data frames without display wrapping but then wrap the resulting diff so that it fits in a narrow terminal This eliminates the complexities caused by the display wrap of D structures on the diff Incidentally the HTML mode pretty much works this way already since the wrapping is handled by the browserviewier Relates to Seems like the consistency could be desirable though it isnt clear whether it is more desirable than having the most useful output for each mode Maybe it isnt possible for us to apriori determine what is most useful so consistency might be better
