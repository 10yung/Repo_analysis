even though the app is downloading the content I have manually added classes from the Download button folder under the Example app Below is the relevant code if selfprogressfractionCompleted DLog fselfprogressfractionCompleted selfdownloadProgressstopDownloadButtonprogress selfprogressfractionCompleted I find the default color of the empty line is gray and I want to change it to red and implement the following code selfbtnDownloadstopDownloadButtontintColor UIColorred But it does not work it only makes the filledLine color changed Who knows how to change the color of empty line Could you add Swift Example Code to make me understand how to use it in swift Thank you kPKDownloadButtonStatePending for PKDownloadButton state not rotating When I tried to compile it on Xcode the

not increasing Here is my block progress NSProgress Nonnull downloadProgress selfdownloadButtonstopDownloadButtonprogress downloadProgressfractionCompleted What am I doing wrong Thanks in advance Hi after I upgraded from d d to ff my app started crashing I discovered that it is due to me setting attributedTitle of the startDownloadButton to nil and this code thus initializing an NSAttributedString with a nil string I think the solution is quite easy in PKDownloadButton updateButtontitle check if the passed title is nil If yes initialize attrTitle itself as nil I think the podspec file is not set correctly It targets iOS and only I think it should have the greater than or equal to in the podspec so it can support all versions I currently get an error when trying to add it to my project Unable to satisfy the following requirements DownloadButton required by Podfile My Podfile targets and up
