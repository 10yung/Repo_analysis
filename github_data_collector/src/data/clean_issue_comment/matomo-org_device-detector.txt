include signages When ParserAbstractmaxMinorParts is changed by any Client Parser it is propagated to all Client Parsers This happens because static properties defined ONLY in the parent class shares a common value with the child class To set version truncation specifically for a custom ClientParser we need to redefine ParserAbstractmaxMinorParts in the child class and use late static binding to access the property Example php php use DeviceDetector Parser Client ClientParserAbstract class MyAppParser extends ClientParserAbstract protected static maxMinorParts selfVERSIONTRUNCATIONPATCH
