program class members Your input classes appear to be inconsistent You may need to recompile the code We need to remove an element from the list adapter via onClick for a button that is a widget inside the row Banging my head around different options but none is working Ideally we should access a ListView and get adapter from it to remove item from it and trigger notification to the ListView that data is changed But the problem is that we cant access ListView from within the Object that is inherited from SlottedListable It might be useful to adapt the old Wart s code to the new WartRemover release I ve just lost minutes because the compiler did not catch discarding Ui in a Ui smiley Something like that should be possible scala Tweak SomeView v vsubView someTweak vsubView someOtherTweak without any notion of Ui Currently we have to do scala Tweak SomeView v vsubView someTweak vsubView someOtherTweak get For some reason a listener for CheckBox is named OnCheckedChangeListerer while its method is onCheckedChanged mind the last letter disappointed Perhaps an exception should be added to EventTweakMacros for this particular case Take this code scala var button slot Button button Onclick button hide and compile it with Ywarnvaluediscard useful flag using the compiler It fails with error homemDevelopment TestActivityscala discarded nonUnit value error button Onclick button show error error one error found I have this strange problem which I do not understand probably due to missing knowledge of how slots or macroid in general is working I want to wrap a ViewGroup into another ViewGroup after a layout was set in setContentView This works but when I then want to add a TextView to the new outer ViewGroup it fails in the following way The TextView becomes the first child of the new outer ViewGroup However it should be the second last child of the new outer ViewGroup since I add it to the new outer ViewGroup after I add the old outer ViewGroup to the new outer ViewGroup var newOuter slot FrameLayout var outer slot LinearLayout override def onCreatesavedInstanceState Bundle superonCreatesavedInstanceState setContentViewgetUil LinearLayout matchParent wireouter getUi l FrameLayout matchParent wire newOuter outermap view viewgetParent match case parent ViewGroup parentremoveView view parentaddView newOuterget case newOutergetaddView view newOutergetaddView getUi w TextView text This TextView should be the last child of newOuter FrameLayout This week I started using Macroid and reading through the documentation While using it yesterday I suddenly the M release was not available anymore After browsing the repositories I noticed it did not exist anymore but instead there is a M release which has some breaking changes After browsing through the documentation of the M release branch I have seen the documentation is already uptodate but does not yet contain the new documentation When will be updated with the M documentation Im using v even though the docs say v M is the latest I found it haphazardly by starting from some example code that was using ContextWrapper instead of AppContextActivityContext Even though this is newer sbtupdates always tells me to upgrade to M It can be a bit confusing and probably causes some adopters to stumble Is there going to be another milestone with this change or a v release
