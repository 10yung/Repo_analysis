Transition object appears front of TabBar after dismissing second view controller Hi there First of all I want to say that I love Motion a lot it is a great thing which allows developers to do awesome stuff in their apps I want to use it in our project a lot but I am currently having several issues and I would like to help finding and fixing them Along with Motion I am using NVActivityIndicatorView and I noticed that after several Motion transitions my NVActivityIndicatorView animations work with some delay and the more Motion transitions I perform the worse it gets for NVActivityIndicatorView Here is a video of a simple project I made I tap Animation button to trigger NVActivityIndicatorView animation it works fine Then I do Motion transitions and tap Animation again You can see a slight freezedelay I repeat it more times and it gets worse with every transitions In my real app with more complex views and transitions this thing is noticeable even after transitions videomp zip tabbarissuezip I discovered that HeroTransitions has the same issue And it happens not only with NVActivityIndicatorView but with other libraries too as you can see in that discussion
