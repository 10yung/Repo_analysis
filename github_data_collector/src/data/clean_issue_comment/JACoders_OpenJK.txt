the bug and if possible steps to reproduce the bug I get the error when I start the data and downloaded it from here to play Jedi Outcast I have an error when I enter a door the game closes to be able to start the Jedi outcast and to pass on the error to download here the data I have What did you expect to happen instead Start Playing codempbotliblprecompcpp is compiled with DEFINEHASHING The below functions are unimplemented in this case c int PCAddGlobalDefinechar string int PCRemoveGlobalDefinechar name This is an redesigned server rate limiter for incoming Out Of Bounds Connectionless packets The purpose of these patches is to mitigate spoofed IP OOB DOS attacks This is achieved by two changes Fixing issue with original q a rate limiter that was causing very high CPU usage when under such attack up to the point of rendering server unusable Allowing whitelisted players to fully access OOB server protocol when server is under such attack There are new cvars svautoWhitelist Enable automatically adding connected players to whitelist svmaxOOBRate Max incoming OOB packet rate per second is default raising it even more would require code changes svmaxOOBRateIP Max incoming OOB packet rate per second for a single IP is default but there is a burst of times the cvar value and it appears to be enough Known issues Lack of whitelistdat file access synchronization Rudimentary version of this was implemented in jk mv Concerns have been raised about storing IP in the whitelistdat file being against the GDPR or other privacy laws If this is a problem there is a cvar svautoWhitelist or IP could be stored as its digest I can explain the attacks addressed by this PR and how they are mitigated in depth on a private communication channel These patches have been tested on actual servers by Yberion and they managed to mitigate few real attacks that would have crippled the server without them Also a slightly different version has been part of JK MV for over a year Using Windows OS and running latest build openjk cc c windows playing SP Ive run into a bug on kor map transition to kor The kor doesnt load completely The loading bar keeps moving to then back to and voice acting can be heard in background Im using mods Spankis Jedi Customization Plus Mati Hootis Assorted fixes for Jedi Academy and Darth Vader AngelModder v links bellow Ive attached a save file right before the transition jedi zip Next map loads up fine on original Jedi Academy exe Only works on Windows If comsteamIntegration is on startup maybe it can default to the game will look for a steamapidll and steamappidtxt and attempt to initialize the Steam API With an extra download of these two files one can have the Steam Overlay and hours tracking without launching OpenJK through Steam itself Windows Windows Single player Build version up to Hello I would like to ask what is the status of case mentioned in the topic someone already reported it and it seems it has been closed Base on my experience problem has not been resolved as I am still experiencing lack of event triggers after loading game form checkpoint after dying By that I mean no cutscenes upon engaging into certain action points no possibility to interact with environmental triggers like doors cutting down tree on yavin inert AI If the problem is considered to be resolved or closed why this bug is still present in the newest builds Kindly please direct me to the proper thread if it is still ongoing case as following presumable duplicate lead me to non related topic Windows using Intel graphics game and openjk was working months ago perfectly Is this for single player or multiplayer Both Description of the bug and if possible steps to reproduce the bug Major lag when updating to latest build at main menu and ingame What did you expect to happen instead Expected new build to work as I need it for certain new mods and as build that I used months ago now fails to work instead it lags please help me From jk mv bring console support to windows IF launched from the commandline Reporting a bug Please make sure youve given the following information thanks Operating system and version Ubuntu v linuxx Is this for single player or multiplayer Single player Description of the bug and if possible steps to reproduce the bug Ive noticed a hilarious bug that doesnt affect gameplay but which is very unusual Every once in a while there will be random objects from the scenery from two levels ago These objects dont have any collision detection so I can go right through them But they sometimes block things from view Im attaching some of the more awesome examples mostly from the desert level superimposing objects from the first level outside of the academy which was quite a juxtaposition
