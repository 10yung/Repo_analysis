Hi JeremySkinner Do you think it would be possible for you to publish the module to powershell gallery I can help you with that if needed and also automate it if you want Ive had an experience where something went wrong with the installation of poshhg so Id like to reinstall it The problem is that when running through the install script it only says It seems poshhg is already installed It would be great to have an uninstall script or uninstall instructions that would leave the system in a state where poshhg could be installed again Adding trycatch logic to WriteVcsStatus so that if one of the scriptblocks that has been added to the VcsPromptStatuses array fails the other scriptblocks are not affected are still invoked This complements the poshgit pull request ferenced in the module unload This complements the poshgit pull request Hello Im using ConEmu poshhg Thanks for the tool its is really great The only serious issue Ive found so far is regarding mapped network drivers Ive use the command NewPSDrive Name Z PSProvider FileSystem Root myremote myshare Persist to create a new network driver It happens that the path is a mecurial repository However hgexe takes a long time to resolve this path It isnt a network issue because this share is actually on one of my virtual machines When I disable hg it is very fast to access the folder I can profile the directory change to see how long it takes but its about seconds everytime I hit the enter button My machine is also OK i GB RAM SSD so it should not take that long Thanks for everything A command to check if something to pull exists in the remote repo Useful to trigger some CI stuff for example It return false if the dir is not a repository true if the dir is a repository and the local rpository is not up to date with the remote Submitting a similar set to poshgit could probably go further than this to integrate them but this is enough for step one Currently branch name has background that is different from settings you choose for powershell Added of changes in subrepositories to the prompt Notably in Powershell ISE In ISE PS C Repo ImportModule C Source poshhg poshhgpsm PS C Repo globalPoshHgSettings and note the colors are PS C Repo writevcsstatus fails with errors like the following WriteHost Cannot process Color because is not a valid color Parameter name value Actual value was At C Source poshhg HgPromptps char WriteHost sBeforeText NoNewline BackgroundColor sBeforeBackgroundColor ForegroundColor sBeforeForegroundColor CategoryInfo InvalidArgument WriteHost ArgumentOutOfRangeException FullyQualifiedErrorId SetInvalidBackgroundColorMicrosoftPowerShellCommandsWriteHostCommand
