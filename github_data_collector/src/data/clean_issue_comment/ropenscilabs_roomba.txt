I started working on but havent been able to come up with a good solution yet Not much in this pull request but figured Id submit it anyway This package is very exciting great work Our dataspice team was thrilled to see how nicely it already handles common requests on a dataspicejson file eg r libraryroomba json jsonlitereadjson Works nicely when all columns come from same level of nesting json roombacgivenName familyName json roombacvalue unitText description But not clear how to get a repeated column from a different level of nesting r json roombacvalue unitText description box Probably requires some kind of notation to indicate the different levels eg in this case maybe something like r json roombacvariableMeasuredvalue variableMeasuredunitText variableMeasureddescription spatialCoveragegeobox would be possible This package is very exciting great work Our dataspice team was thrilled to see how nicely it already handles common requests on a dataspicejson file eg r libraryroomba json jsonlitereadjson Works nicely when all columns come from same level of nesting json roombacgivenName familyName json roombacvalue unitText description It would be great if the cols argument could take a named list that could also rename the output columns on the fly r json roombacvalue units unitText description Maybe this requires another argument like keepallrows In the example below I think we should allow the user some way to end up with rows instead of The third row corresponding to baz should be all NAs It would be useful in cases I can imagine for the user to know that they got distinct outputs back and that one of them was fully null librarymagrittr somejson foo a b c bar a b null c baz bing c lst somejson jsonlitefromJSON lst roombaroombacols ca b c keep any a b c NA NA NA So what I think this should look like is a b c NA NA NA NA NA NA Mostly useful when the user knows theyre passing x number inputs to an API and expecting x outputs even if some of those outputs are empty Right now the shiny app is hardwired to work with specific values returned from the twitter data Should eventually be smart about figuring out whats a date item
