I want to use tensorflowapi c to use CapsNet Is there such a possibility Y valY numvalbatch cfgbatchsize reshape what is the use of this line in mainpy Can we use the code for RGB image dataset What is the use of channel parameter in CapsNet function Changed Tensorshape into Tensorgetshape Since tensorflow deprecated it How to determine the vector length and can anybody explaine to me about what it represent Is it possible to use in machine learning for medical imaging using MRI dataset Hi can you share english version of the blog posted at for understanding CapsNets Thank you Hey I was linked to this repository by an article that discussed a video summary of Capsule Nets I think it might be in your Baidu share thats linked from the repository Readme but when I click the link it loads incredibly slowly minutes to full load timed out first time and the input box does nothing when I enter the suggested code ahjs and press Enter Is there a mirror for the Capsule talk andor the other contents of the share Thanks There seems to be a problem in Vk when calculating the loss in the function in capsNetpy at loss function line maxl tfsquaretfmaximum cfgmplus selfvlength maxr tfsquaretfmaximum selfvlength cfgmminus you use selfvlength when calculating maxl and maxr selfvlength tfsqrtreducesumtfsquareselfcaps axis keepdimsTrue epsilon selfcaps is VJ and VJs Dim is batchsize VJ squashSJ so all of value in VJ is if it calculate selfvlength the dim of selfvlength is batchsize and interval of value is so i think it has to change like this maxl tfsquaretfmaximum cfgmplus selfvlength maxr tfsquaretfmaximum selfvlength cfgmminus if it is wrong Can you tell me what s wrong Hi im Using CapsNet to Handle Highdimensional and Smallsample Problems but train cannot converge My data dimension is classes what should i do thanks a lot
