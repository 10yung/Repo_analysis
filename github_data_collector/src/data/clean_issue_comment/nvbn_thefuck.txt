img width altScreen Shot at AM src Hello Im cleaning up my zshrcaliasrc with the help of Ive noticed that eval thefuck alias slows down my shell by a lot The startup time changed from ms to ms once I disabled the evaluation of the alias Wouldnt it be faster to just paste the output of thefuck alias into my aliasrc to avoid the slowdown Or wouldnt it later be compatible etc Thanks sh thefuck

zshrc I measure my startup time with this sh start of zshrc measure boot time see also the last line bootTimeStartdate sN end of zshrc bootTimeDurationdate sN bootTimeStart printf bootTimeDuration ms n I have done some of the work but I have no idea how to actually run thefuck from the cloned repo I tried python thefuckentrypointsinitpy but that didnt work I would like to run it so I can test it locally besides having the tests Prior to my changes the missingspacebeforesubcommands rule looped through the available commands checked to see if the first portion of the command started with a valid executable and then returned that executable immediately if it did Because of this it always converted aptget commands into apt get commands and other rules of the like I changed it under recommendation of scorphus that it return all possible matching missing space commands not just the first one Here is a screen shot of this buggy behavior prior to my changes command execsnoopcats incorrect behavior only returns the first instance ex ecsnoopcats img width altScreen Shot at AM src Here is a screenshot of the correct behavior after my changes command execsnoopcats correct
