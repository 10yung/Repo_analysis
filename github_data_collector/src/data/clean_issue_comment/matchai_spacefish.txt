mind that we are working to achieve feature parity with Spaceship If this proposed feature doesnt already exist in Spaceship please submit a PR there instead Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Fish has the very nice function for prompts to show a shortened path instead of full sub directory names Describe the solution youd like Truncating the path is a nice option Personally I like Fishs builtin way to shorten the directory path in prompts shell echo PWD or just pwd homeUSERlocalshareomflibcompletions sfsectiondir in omflibcompletions promptpwd lsolcompletions Describe alternatives youve considered Instead of using pwd or PWD it would be possible to use promptpwd fishnvm Node version is not shown Current Behavior I use the following Node version manager Currently Spacefish does not show me the Node version used cf screenshot Screenshot at Environment Spacefish version Fish version the output of fish version Fish plugin manager fisher Terminal emulator iTerm Operating system OSX Bug Report Current Behavior When I activate a Python virtual environment the name of the environment appears on the line above the prompt devoid of any styling save for a pair of parentheses AFAIK this is just the default way Python displays a virutalenv Expected Behavior I would expect the virtualenv section to appear inline with the rest of prompt and be formatted correctly Relevant Fish Configuration Can be found in configfishconfigfish fish set SPACEFISHPROMPTORDER time user dir host git package node golang haskell pyenv exectime linesep battery

at AM Thanks Current Behavior This is the inverse of The smallest reproducible case Ive found so far is to cd into a directory which triggers the AWS module press g press tab press delete Notice that the g remains displayed on screen but is not actually present in the buffer Expected Behavior The first input character should not be displayed when deleted Relevant Fish Configuration fish set

version widths is checked Possibly related Bug Report Current Behavior Shows a symbol when the package version is not defined Expected Behavior Does not show the package section if no version is defined Possible Solution Only if you have suggestions on a fix for the bug Remove the symbol for version as was done in spacefishbot Issue copied from Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Many applications will use packagejson to track dependencies and scripts but have no intentions of publishing to a package repository A package version probably does not mean much either in those contexts It is recommended that such projects set private true For such projects seeing a warning symbol in the prompt leads to think something is misconfigured Describe the solution youd like If packagejson does not contain a version but is marked private do not display the package section Describe alternatives youve considered Add a configuration option to opt into this behaviour I think this should be the default behaviour but could be convinced that it needs an opt in Documentation adoption Recommend setting private true for versionless packages Bug Report Current Behavior When having a lot of active git changes spacefish crashes Only displays part of the prompt and only show a new input line after sending ctrlc Expected Behavior Fish not crashing or the git

version fish version Fish plugin manager fisher Terminal emulator cmder git bash pycharm terminal Operating system wsl ubuntu on Windows TLDR The team has begun working on the better faster crossshell rewrite at Spacefish is not going anywhere and is still accepting feature PRs but we wont be actively working on it Inspired by the work denysdovhan did on denysdovhanrobbyrussellnode and this discussion back in November I started work on at the start of April to address the amount of duplicated effort that is made to maintain both spaceship and spacefish Starship is written in Rust and will contain all the logic required for a wrapper to be created for any shell The plan for the immediate future is to add firstclass support for Fish Zsh and Bash The prompts will mostly be the same with some improvements where it was difficult to make them in the past Things like prompt configuration files improved testing selfupdating more safety when things go wrong etc All of that being said we will still be reviewing feature PRs on this repo for the next little while so we havent gone into full maintenance mode That wont be happening until starship has all the features and tooling needed to replace spacefish We would love to get the support of those of you who are fans of spacefish and would like to contribute to our Rust codebase Hope to see you over at Bug Report Current Behavior nvm use has no effect Expected Behavior nvm use should change node version It is working with any theme except spacefish Environment Spacefish version Fish version Fish plugin manager ohmyfish
