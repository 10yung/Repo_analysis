Ive tried searching for this issue havent found any mention of it Im not sure if this was done by design When I clear my history the device recognition setting resets Its not a critical issue but it is very inconvenient I apologize for the lack of structure I am new to Github It looks like there is a similar issue related to Tor private tabs However in this issue Tor does actually connects Im not finding any other issues or anything in the community like this Description After starting Brave then opening a new private tab with Tor it shows that the browser has connected to the network When entering and address or search into the address bar Brave crashes Once you restart Brave it gives the error that it is unable to connect to the Tor network This is because when Brave crashed the Tor connection remained open Steps to Reproduce Open Brave browser and wait for it to finish loading Right click the plus icon to open a new tab and select New Private Tab with Tor After seeing Successfully connected to the Tor Network in the address bar type in search terms or an address After hitting enter Brave crashes Reopen Brave browser by clicking the desktop icon Repeat steps and Here is when Brave sits for a bit trying to connect to Tor Then returns the error dialog Unable to connect to the Tor network Reproduces how often Can reproduce of the time Brave Version aboutbrave info Brave V rev f f bf e e c a b c b edb bfc c Muon OS Release Update Channel Release OS Architecture x OS Platform Microsoft Windows Nodejs Brave Sync v libchromiumcontent Additional Information When Brave crashes the Tor process is not killed on rare occasions it is So the connection stays open That is when I receive the message saying its unable to connect to the Tor network However if the Tor process is killed it will connect to the network but still crashes almost every time Also it seems that this only happens when using the private tab with Tor is the first thing I do after starting Brave If I use another tab to go to a web page then do the steps provided above it works fine Have you searched for similar issues I have and not found anything Description I am using ZoneMinder to monitor my video security system and while Brave works for some functions it fails when the more advanced options are set Montage View in particular that require more than six open connections to the ZoneMinder local server Also once the perserver limit is reached no other pages from the server options logs console can be opened Steps to Reproduce Open a connection to a ZoneMinder Montage page use your ZM server address instead of zmhome with six or more video locations shown Actual result Only the first six video locations show any additional locations and things like the State and FPS data that are intermittent connections do not show No additional pages on the server can be opened Switch to a Montage view with less than six locations and observe that the State and FPS information is now displayed and you can open a limited number of additional pages Expected result Being able to observe at least locations more would be better and have the State and FPS information displayed Being able to open additional pages on the ZM server Console Logs and Settings at a minimum Having this setting not being the default or even easily changed would be acceptable as few people actually need it Having the increased setting only apply to a selected domain or list of servers would also be acceptable and would limit unwanted behavior when accessing other servers Reproduces how often Every
