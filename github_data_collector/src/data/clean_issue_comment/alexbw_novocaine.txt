Is this a suitable library to make a lockin amplifier with for audio signal processing of microphone input For iOS a sampling rate of Hz is hardcoded For newer iOS devices the sampling rate is Hz This causes a crash on setup Sampling rate is for iOS already determined from the Hardware Hi is there any way to set audio sample rate to hz or hz and i want to get all array as short array audioManager setInputBlock float newAudio UInt numSamples UInt numChannels And whats the float range is it returning between I need in short like this audioManager setInputBlock short newAudio UInt numSamples UInt numChannels Hi are there any plans to replace deprecated calls of the form AudioSession for the AVAudioSession alternatives Thanks Sorry if this a stupid question Just wondering if anyone could shred a light on this Ive imported all Novocaine files to my project and renamed the files that will use Novocaine to mm Just this error on RingBufferh refuses to go away during compiling RingBufferh Unknown type name class did you mean Class Parse Issue RingBufferh Expected after top level declarator Is it anything I could be missing like a compiler setting or a flag option somewhere else Im using Xcode and iOS deployment target Thanks in advance Can this be set to play gapless Not a loop but songs from any NSURL just like a regular CD Just wondering if it was possible to somehow turn the array of float values into UTF I am trying some stuff out that would properly send audio data over a network and play it on another device Whenever I try to manipulate the data and receive it on the other end I still end up with floating points To put it silly I kind of need to get it to look like this bytes Edit More specific what I am trying to do is target a machine that wants to play audio through Port Audio I notice the demo has its deployment target set to but I would need to use the library in a minimum environment so Ive checked with the demo and aside from the AudioSessionGetProperty is deprecated errors etc I get an Assigning retained object to unsafe property object will be released after assignment in AudioFileReadermm line and this seems to be the line which causes the demo app to crash I got around it by setting line to strong rather than assign but have not thought about whether this is just a hacky workaround since when running it again with a environment it doesnt let me do that Is there a way to use Novocaine with Bluetooth audio devices like a Bluetooth headset or Bluetooth external speaker Jambox for example There should be no dynamic allocation in a render callback Dynamic allocation is widely considered a nono in realtime threads since it can block
