 Q A Bug no New Feature yes Version Used na FFmpeg Version na OS na Probably a captain obvious question here but has this project considered using FFI Maybe some performance gains to be had Some examples Q A Bug no New Feature Yes Version Used Specific tag or commit sha FFmpeg Version FFmpeg or AVConv and version OS Your OS and version Is it possible to add copy as an available videoaudio codec for X Ive tested this by simply adding it to the front of each array in FFMpeg Format Video X and seems to work fine This is helpful when you have a video of the same codecsize etc and you dont care about converting bitrate you just want to add faststart for example as it doesnt have to reencode the entire video and completes in only a few seconds any reason not to allow this as an option Q A Bug yes New Feature no Version Used v according to composerlock FFmpeg Version OS Linux version running on a Synology DS play Actual Behavior Whenever I try to run FFMpegcreate I get this Exception

volume webvendorphpffmpeg in volume webinitphp on line The exception stems from an autoloader I added myself but that already means that the missing file couldnt be found by Composers autoloader Searching through Symfonys files I cant find a class called ProcessBuilder myself Expected Behavior Obviously for the exception not to be thrown and the extension working just fine Steps to Reproduce After installing PHPFFMpeg in my project via composer adding the FFMpeg package via Synologys DRM Package Manager copying ffprobe to the bin directory and appending my own autoloader after composers one running the code as such gives me the exception requireonceDIR vendorautoloadphp composers autoloader requireonceDIR autoloadphp my own autoloader use FFMpeg FFMpeg ffmpeg FFMpegcreate ffmpegbinaries binffmpeg ffprobebinaries binffprobe Possible Solutions Taking out my own autoloader makes it work just fine I suppose because Composers autoloader only uses the nonstrict include for files while mine uses require I could adapt my autoloader to not throw exceptions as well although Id prefer it doing so Any chance the Symfony dependency for this extension could get fixed instead Q A Bug no New Feature no Version Used FFmpeg Version N gb b OS CentOS Actual Behavior We are using PHPFFMPeg on laravel to process a video file to p and p The PHPFFMPeg is not processing the file or generate a file with bytes Sometimes one of this resolutions is precessed most of the time is the p The Exception return Encoding failed This occours only on production server CentOS Executing the command of FFmpeg on prompt of production server works well Expected Behavior PHPFFMPeg process a video file to p and p Steps to Reproduce We have two jobs of Laravel to process the files in chain In the ProcessVideo PJobphp file In the ProcessVideo PJobphp file Q A Bug fix yes New feature no BC breaks no Deprecations no Fixed tickets fixes Related issuesPRs License MIT Whats in this PR Edited the ffmpegopen method to send Video if and only if at least one video stream is not marked as attatchedpic A sample audio file with cover which is created by adding a cover image to the already existing audiomp using eyed Functional tests to confirm the reported issue and verify the fix Why Fixes FFMmpegopen has media type bug with MP s image metadata Fffmpeg source uses this function to detect if a video stream is actually a valid video stream or just a cover art I did not use the patch in because the codectype can be either png or jpeg If the codectype is jpeg that stream can be either a cover art or just a MotionJPEG video stream Hence it was not the right way to detect this BC BreaksDeprecations No There is a small chance that some code depends on this behavior to detect audio with cover images To Do x Create tests to confirm the issue x Fix till the new tests pass x Run full test suite after making the change Q A Bug fix no New feature yes BC breaks no Deprecations no Fixed tickets fixes issuenum Related issuesPRs issuenum License MIT Whats in this PR This PR adds a new api method to retrieve frames through ffprobe It also adds a support for additional options allowing more custom calls As an addition as last method has been added to StreamCollection and FrameCollection for easier retrieval I also regenerated the api doc which was largely outdated using sami feel free to hide this commit to make the review easier Why Frames information can be needed in some cases see example below Additional options allow some filtering directly within ffprobe which would otherwise require iteration and operations on our output and therefore defeat the purpose ffprobe having such features Example Usage Retrieving the starting byte and ending byte matching a timestamp interval in an audio file needed to generate audio previews without persistence php probe FFProbecreate filepath testsfilesJahzzar Siestamp Now we can do options arrayselectstreams a readintervals frames probeframesfilepath options startByte framesfirstgetpktpos endByte frameslastgetpktpos echo sprintfThe byte interval closest to seconds is d d startByte endByte Outputs The byte interval closest to seconds is Backward compatibility No BC break Interfaces are left unmodified and public api methods only offer a new parameter with a default value not altering the behavior in any way Unit tests have been updated accordingly Hello Im having troubles configuring in CentOS I have installed ffmpeg and ffprobe correctly in usrbin Also Ive checked via terminal and It works Also via terminal if I made a
