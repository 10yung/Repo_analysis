 Laravel Version Laratrust Version Description It seems that Laratrust teams are built around permissions more so than memberships Meaning rather than having separate line items for userteam it conflates roleuserteam and doesnt account for perhaps activity in the context of a specific team at a specific point in time Are there any plans for membershipscoped functionality rather than simply permissionperteam In this case it would require an IDGUID for the actual role entry and separate join for membership rather than teamid directly This may require a bit more coupling of team functionality but I think the ability to retain membershiprelated activity is important Hopefully the question makes sense Before posting this issue please read the troubleshooting section in the docs If you have a question you dont need to provide any data shown below Important If you made changes to your database directly and the changes arent reflected in your app please clear your application cache Laravel Version Laratrust Version I dont know maybe Description You said If you made changes to your database directly and the changes arent reflected in your app please clear your application

assigned to the user preferably using the roleuser pivot table The reason I need this is that a user may have custom data pertaining to that role that another user with the same role may not have Initially I had thought about adding a metadata column on the users table but the cost of evaluating the data on the column and making sure it doesnt deform was too much in the long run Any ideas on how to go about this I did try adding the column into the migration but it didnt appear in any queries of user roles Laravel Version Laratrust Version Description Hi This is less of an issue and more of a question is there any efficient way to list the members of all teams that the current auth user has the role manager in Ie userid is assigned to Team Team and Team as Team Leader with the permission listusers but only assigned as User in Team and not assigned at all to the rest of the teams so he will see all users that have any role within Team but noone from Team etc I can do it with raw SQL but im new to Laravel and unsure how to do it with eloquent and which would be most efficient Thanks Hey hey thanks for your amazing work I like your package saw it at jacurtis youtube channel I am using the teams feature but I run into some problems now I am organizing users of an enterprise within teams This works well except that a user can be now within multiple enterprises I dont really need that I think that I misunderstood the teams feature in the beginning of the project But what I need is the following An enterprise with multiple users Each user is a member a few chosen ones are administrators of the enterprise Every user of an enterprise can create projects They are projectadmins now and should be able to add other users to their project so that they can work together on project related reports A contributor cannot change project related data but reports c r u not d I dont know if laratrust can help me out here Any ideas where to start or what to change I can use the teams feature perfectly for the projects reports permissions but how can I implement the adminmember stuff within an enterprise The middlewares automatic registering option doesnt as expected with Laravel I had to manually add them to register them Routemiddleware rolesuperadmindeveloper groupfunction Illuminate Database QueryException HY SQLSTATE HY Invalid parameter number parameter was not defined SQL select roles roleuseruserid as pivotuserid roleuserroleid as pivotroleid roleuserusertype as pivotusertype from roles inner join roleuser on rolesid roleuserroleid where
