Fixes Environment react reactnative reactnativecommunitycli latest Description When specifying directory for init the printed project directory is based off the project name not the actual directory name Reproducible Demo Create a new project via npx reactnative init foo directory bar After finishing this is the output cd Usersfoo npx reactnative runios cd Usersfoo npx reactnative runandroid Even though the project is created at bar ie Usersbar It should be cd Usersbar npx reactnative runios cd Usersbar npx reactnative runandroid Its a simple change in initts from projectName to directoryName Summary The way Xcode reports device availability has changed This change adds support for this while maintaining backward compatibility with older Xcode versions Also changed how it detects the absence of a device Previously it would do strict equality check with undefined but the problem is that the device was null I think its fine to simply do device as that will handle both cases Summary Suggest matching commands if the user makes a typo closes Thank you for sending the PR We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes Help us understand your motivation by explaining why you decided to make this change This is how it goes Screenshot from Write your test plan here REQUIRED If you changed any code please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work Bonus points for screenshots and videos Increase test coverage whenever possible Summary The characters from npm scoped packages will cause name conflicts with Kotlin because Kotlin complier will generate kotlinmodule files base on module name by default For example we have both segmentanalyticsreactnative and mattblockreactnativeinappbrowser modules installed Currently they will be turned into Android modules with name segmentanalyticsreactnative and mattblockreactnativeinappbrowser And they will both generate METAINFnojdkkotlinmodule file because Kotlin complier failed to parse in module name Eventually it causes build to fail with error More than one file was found with OS independent path METAINFnojdkkotlinmodule Test Plan Write your test plan here REQUIRED If you changed any code please provide us with clear instructions on how you verified your changes work Bonus points for screenshots and videos Increase test coverage whenever possible Tested the code change on our project and it will convert module names into segmentanalyticsreactnative and mattblockreactnativeinappbrowser And Kotlin will generate segmentanalyticsreactnativedebugkotlinmodule and mattblockreactnativeinappbrowserdebugkotlinmodule in METAINF Thus the error is resolved Summary Currently when building using the reactnativecli the derived data path is in the iosbuild folder while in xcode it is in LibraryDeveloperXcode by default This means builds started from xcode and the cli dont share the same cache This results in longer builds and more disk space usage xcode build cache size is no joke when using both xcode and the cli While it is possible to have xcode build in a different directory I think it is better to use the derived data path specified in the project instead of forcing one Before we relied on hardcoding the path to launch the app in the simulator or on device Now we use xcodebuild with showBuildSettings to print the build configuration and get the TARGETBUILDDIR env variable which is the path where the app will be Note this can be a breaking change if a script assumes the build directory location since now the default build directory wont be iosbuild Test Plan You can see that the app is being installed from the xcode shared derived data directory from the cli install logs Before info Installing buildth rdwaveBuildProductsDebugiphonesimulatorth rdwaveapp After info Installing UsersjanicLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDatath rdwaveebjnyfazbruzovcnoejrwfwcgpqvBuildProductsDebugiphonesimulatorth rdwaveapp I also tested that the build cache is shared by clearing all build caches and building from xcode then building with the cli to confirm that a full rebuild is not needed Environment System OS macOS

Security The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only

srcfonts Use reactnative link So after this we have an assets folder in androidappsrcmain As far as i know we have fonts in XML since build tools so do we really need to have assets folder And when i change fonts in srcfonts and use reactnative link i have new fonts in Android but iOS has old fonts and i cant see any update in fonts Am i missing something or this is a bug I found these may be related And maybe this
