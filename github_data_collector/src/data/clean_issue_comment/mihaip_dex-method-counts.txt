i can get method countis there anyway to dump methods name btwsome classess methodcount are different to javaps This updates the Gradle wrapper to the latest version Welcome to Gradle Here are the highlights of this release Incremental Groovy compilation Groovy compile avoidance Test fixtures for Java projects Manage plugin versions via settings script For more details see subsupPlease NO GitHub rebasesquash merges The changes in this pull request are broken up into meaningful atomic commits and my branch should already be uptodate with the latest target branch If it isnt or if youd like me to combine some or all of the commits please let me know and I will make the necessary updates as soon as possible Thank yousupsub Bug description No matter how many default package methods there are the printed result is always for default package methods count Explanation The name in line may be which means corresponding method is from default package For the default package methods code runs into else branch since no child has name Therefore for every default package method a new Node is created in line For nonfirst default package method the newly created Node will always replace the former Node in line and get its count equals in line Overall method count of default package is always at most I added an else if branch which avoids making new Node if we already has a default Node when the coming method is a default package method Theres two fixes related to print output and gitignore But more importantly Ive added the ability to compare method counts between the supplied inputs which prints the difference between the second and first input next to the counts for the second Hi I wonder if it is possible to measure the size of methods and classes LOC bytes etc Thanks Is it possible to automate this process on every debug build by creating custom gradle task Hello is there any way to count total of classes on dex file its on dalviksystemDexFile package but must load inside android if possible to count it outside of android itself Hello is it possible to add export data to JSONXML file feature Google release Android Studio to Stable Channel today as well as its instant run features I believe dexmethodcounts count the methods incorrectly for APK produced with instant run If you try to extract the APK you could see there is a new file instantrunzip which contains all dexes for each package I believe this is the reason why dexmethodcounts wont work Any plan to support this Thanks
