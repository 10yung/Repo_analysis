Expected result What should happen Need to have a useful CLI error messages on gatsby What happened Didnt have a useful CLI error message Environment environment PS Id like to help resolve this issue and file a PR if someone is willing to guide me through the codebase that needs to be looked at Currently Ive only searched for terms such as dispatch as I guess theres a reducer thats firing an effect somewhere but Im finding it hard which to look for I have a productsjson and a categoriesjson file I query in gatsbynode but also in pages and in components with StaticQuery Given the following order of commands gatsby clean gatsby develop the generated build is corrrect CTRL C gatsby develop the result is inconsistent When the build is fast little products graphql returns less nodes either less products or categories When the build is slow more products graphql is returning even less nodes There are even cases where it throws an error refering to my graphql syntax being incorrect The solution is to trigger an update to categoriesjson changing one little char is enough just to trigger a gatsby update After that CTRL C gatsby develop should work properly not sure as I havent done much testing Does this make any sense Environment System OS Windows CPU x AMD Athlontm II X Processor Binaries npm C Program Files nodejs npmCMD Browsers Edge npmPackages gatsby

are any eg Related to na Description I have a large WordPress site that uses the ACF to REST API plugin and gatsbysourcewordpress Some post types have an ACF Url field for additional links These links may be to files hosted on the website itself from within the WordPress media library or to external documents The issue is that gatsbysourcewordpress resolves these url fields differently depending on whether or not the url is for internal or external media If external the url resolves to a string which is the desired expected outcome If internal I instead get back a WordpressWpMedia node with its respective fields In any given scenario I may have any number of external internal urls and the default Gatsby behavior is such that only one of these two node types can be included for a given query eg I either get back the media node and all the external links are resolved to null or I get back String and all the internal links are resolved to null Snippets below LekoArts has made mention of this elsewhere but dropping this here for posterity For context link is the slug for my Url fields warn Multiple node fields resolve to the same GraphQL field wordpresswpinfographicsacflink linkNODE

you have explicitly defined a type for those fields you can safely ignore this warning message Otherwise Gatsby will omit those fields from the GraphQL schema This query returns two posts one with an internal Url and one with an external Url The internal Url is the one being returned In this scenario I need to drill into the link node to get the actual url For clarity the WP website in question
