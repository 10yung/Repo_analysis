HTTPAUTHORIZATION between default keys to hide They may be used for header authorization like Authorization Basic base loginpassword new feature issue BC break no We have a project where session is started only for logged users Its a little bit tricky that Tracy in devel mode always starts session This could possible hide some bug on devel environment that is in better scenario catch with tests in worse scenario on production This is just concept how to let developer choose between session as storage default and works the same way as now or file storage In configuration you can enable it with setting directory for data files yaml tracy fileStorage tempDir If this concept will be approved I can prepare PR for actual Tracy version Version introduced by c e a fd db eda f da f ccad c Bug Description Tracy always starts a session because Steps To Reproduce Dont start a session enable Tracy Expected Behavior Session does not start Possible Solution Remove the start call from DI container and dont be lazy to check if there is a started session Such a code dont belong to DI container anyway See
