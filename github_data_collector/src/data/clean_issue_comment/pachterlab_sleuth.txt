Hi I cant find the zip file for the vignette Page does not exist Would be useful for getting started Thanks I am running kallisto quant in the latest insilicodbkallisto docker container on Ubuntu I downloaded a prebuilt index referenced in the kallisto manual Every pairedend sample is killed These same samples can be successfully pseudoaligned on linux server My local machines have G max RAM mentioned in Bray et al Error is a little cryptic Any ideas root fc DATA kallisto quant i musmusculustranscriptomeidx n o FVBliver b FVBliver fastqgz FVBliver fastqgz quant fragment length distribution will be estimated from the data index kmer length index number of targets index number of kmers Killed I am using sleuth to test for differential expression in viral transcripts from RNA viruses ie no isoforms after assembling my RNAseq reads de novo Im curious whether it is best to map my raw reads to all of my de novo assembled contigs with Kallisto and use these estimated counts with sleuth or if I can simply map my raw reads to the target viral transcript My concern with the latter approach is that only mapping to a single transcript will throw off the shrinkage estimator Am I correct in this assumption Sorry if this is a super naive question Hello The actual Sleuth package and plots within sleuthlive worklook great but for some reason it appears that in the tables when attempting to use sleuthlive every single character from the Ensemble gene ID is being read into every single column one character per column screen shot below Screen Shot at PM If I make gene tables or use plots in Sleuth itself ie just use the various functions in R everything works great and moreover if I download the table from sleuthlive it looks correct ie the ensemble ID is not split over the columnsbut for some reason its reading intoappearing in sleuthlive in this weird way I have tried coercing the datacolumns every which way in Sleuth as well as saving sleuth object in different formats and reading back in to launch sleuthlive but nothing seems to work I am using Mac OS with latest versions of R and R studio I may be barking up the wrong tree here since this could be some kind of weird Shiny issue but I just dont know enoughhave enough experience with Shiny to figure it outany help would be greatly appreciated Thank you Hello I get an error when using plotma with a waldtest object The error message is Ive translated it from german if it is not completely correct Error in FUNX i Object meanobs not found After assuring that I really gave a waldtest object as a parameter to the function I dug into the source code of the function and found that on line of the plotsR sleuthresults is called without pvalaggregateFALSE I assume the default value is TRUE The function then returns a result set without the columns meanobs and b This seems to be the source of the error message After manually doing the steps but with pvalaggregateFALSE it seems to work just fine best Nadine Hi I am using Salmon with numBootstraps Wasabi and Sleuth for differential transcript level analysis And I got this following error I have checked issues and but I am not sure if this

The command is so sleuthfitso condition full and the problem is NA values were found during variance shrinkage estimation due to mean observation values outside of the range used for the LOESS fit The LOESS fit will be repeated using exact computation of the fitted surface to extrapolate the missing valuesThese are the target ids with NA values PPYR PA PPYR PA PPYR PA PPYR PA And I dont konw whats the reason and how to deal with it Could you please help me best wishes The dropbox link to the example Trapnell results referenced in the walkthrough at is a not found It was discovered during testing that the loess function in the standard sleuth shrinkage estimation function sleuthshrinkdf is set to use all available cores on the machine in the typical setup OpenMP framework when installing Rs internal Fortran and C code no environment variables set This is solved by setting the environment variable OMPNUMTHREADS but most users will not know to do this I would advocate for having a mechanism to change this behavior from within sleuth but it may not be kosher to change environment variables within R An alternative would be to just provide a warning to the user though this would come up every time in a standard run Issue is set up as an FYI to put in some solution before the next release
