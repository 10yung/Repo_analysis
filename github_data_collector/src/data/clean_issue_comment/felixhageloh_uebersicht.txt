Can not make widget interactive clickable I want to create button for updating widget data on demand I tried basic logging into console onClick event wasnt triggered even initial active style didnt apply on button Widget is behaving like covered with overlay If I open Uebersicht widget in browser on button works and also trigger system sound inside run function osascript e beep as I expected Somebody knows where is the problem I have Allowed Accessibility My code jsx import run from uebersicht export const render props dispatch return button onClick consolelogtrue runosascript e beep Update button MBP Early macOS Catalina v I dont code professionally Ive never coded in Javascript or its variations so I found the selection of widgets on the main website of uebersicht more confusing than useful Furthermore most of the available widgets mirror the needs of developers so its kinda self complacency to see useful tools for devs only and not made for a broader audience I think coding scares most people XD Anyway for those who try with it the widgets shall have a bunch of exemplar templates to begin with A simple template is in my eyes something useful and not just a poor help World and I think at something like display multiple text boxes reading text from offline text files or online links display multiple pictures from offline paths or online links templates that highlight particular features or Javascript react Javascript for automation as uebersicht is gonna drop coffeescript I successfully modified of the available Widgets for text and pictures but now I try to create a new code able to display pictures which reside in the same common posix path of my Mac hd Its yet coffeescript and Ive not much idea how to elaborate it Help is greatly appreciated

React the widget will fail to load throwing undefined is not an object evaluating processenvNODEENV If I do not install React then the widget will throw an error saying unable to find package react I want to parameterize some things based upon which desktop the widget is being rendered on for a menubar that displays the spaces of each display Is it possible to expose either the widget settings to the widgets or alternatively the screen ID directly Greetings I just tried out Uebersicht starting today and it was going great until all the sudden it was no longer displaying any of the widgets I was working on trying to customize the wttr widget I have since tried removing all of the widgets uninstalling removing the caches and application support data reinstalling I have not been able to get the widgets to display again I am seriously hoping that I just am missing something here I am attaching the console logs for Uebersicht I can also provide a copy of the system report if you wish to review it but dont feel safe publishing that package to a public forum Thanks uebersichtlog Any request I make through the proxy server at will return a status code Ive using uebersicht very well for developing widgets with click events Ive set up my interaction shortcut in preferences but uebersicht rarely interacts with my click events But when I turn on the debug console the widget interacts very well Can you check about this issue Hi Ive been having a lot of fun using the new JSX system to code widgets While looking at htop I realized that the vmem usage of webkit is MASSIVE It idles at like gigs when I dont have a single widget loaded I realized it couldnt have been like this in its default state Maybe something I did may have contributed to what was going on When I was developing a series of widgets it had at first seemed like it wasnt actually live updating them So I had basically just removed and reinstalled the widgets from the folder again and again in order for them to load Oftentimes when doing this the app would stop updating the widgets and I would have to relaunch the app This was stupid for me to do in hindsight as it turned out that this issue was something peculiar to macvim when I switched to my trusty nvim in Terminal the live updates on hitting w worked as had originally been described Ive tried clearing my App Caches for bersicht as well as restarting Ive cleaned out the widgets folder and tried to relaunch the app several times but webkit still is astronomically high in vmem usage I feel like this is undesired behavior img width

Starting Uebersicht with the bad path gives no widgets starting it with the good path lets everything work fine The good path is just a copy of the bad path And they contain morningwidgetindexcoffee Im no JS guru so I couldnt really see where this bug could be located but should be farely easy to replicate by creating a similar folder structure I tried this though and could not reproduce it Until I named one of the folders src So from what I can gather having a widget path that contains a folder named source will break the loading of widgets Edit huh I guess it is this one Is this the intended behaviour Im getting these errors when trying to require googles api library Error ReferenceError Cant find variable global anonymous function InfoBoardindexjsx o InfoBoardindexjsx anonymous function
