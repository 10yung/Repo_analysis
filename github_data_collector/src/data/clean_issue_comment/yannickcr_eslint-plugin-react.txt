In a separate commit I cleaned up examples to be a bit more modern preferring function components so they are easier to read then documented that this rule isnt only for PropTypes but that it accepts static types too Previously this would be an error since the rel wasnt read a targetblank href relnoopener noreferrer Now this works so you can enable this rule together with jsxcurlybracepresence Fixes Fixes Fixes Fixes This PR fixes the problem of does not check jsxindent for JSXText JSXText Node is different from other formats eg The following code JSXTexts nodevalue returns n text n text n js const f div text text div detailssummarychangessummary add handler for JSXText Node check JSXText Indent add the fix for JSXText add test cases testslibrulesjsxindentjs details This adds a script to autogenerate the list of rules and embeds special tags to README Usage npm run generatelistofrules Check whether the autogenerated changes are committed npm run generatelistofrulescheck See also For SSR apps theres no DOM variables in node environment Shall we have an eslint rule to disallow DOM variables in contructor What about nodomincontructor js constructorprops superprops thisstate thisaudio documentcreateElementaudio Error when SSR document is not defined Im intested in contributing this Please let me know if it sounds good closes I think I found the right repo for this The image below shows three errors that need to be changed to camel case img width altScreen Shot at AM src Using this fix all reactnounknownproperty problems option img width altScreen Shot at AM src Fixes all but this one Screen Shot at AM It should be auto changed to xmlnsXlink Ive found an unexpected change that stems from jsx Hello nameJohn Number With ignoreCase false which according to the docs should take case into account when sorting the props the above example now expects name to be sorted before Number I know why it sorts the way it does switched to using StringlocaleCompare which does sh namelocaleCompareNumber Looking at the librulesjsxsortpropsjs code Im not sure what changes would be required to accommodate both this issue and unfortunately So the crux of this issue is is this an unexpected change or should I alter my expectations and update the documentation to reflect this behavior Dependencies eslint eslintpluginreact eslintrcjson reactjsxpropsnospreading error exceptions AsyncSelect Select componentsGroup componentsClearIndicator componentsDropdownIndicator What happens The following patterns are considered warnings regardless they are in the exception list jsx componentsGroup groupProps componentsDropdownIndicator props componentsClearIndicator props The following patterns are not considered warnings jsx AsyncSelect props Select getCustomProps
