Im using the latest n n version from github dev branch I compiled Ubuntu and windows versions in Ubuntu environment and deployed to my ubuntu server The port can communicate successfullytest with nc But when I run supernode in server and edge on my windows pc it didnt output the log after edge started no error or no success Minutes laterit shut it down automatically It did output something like Supernode not responding Its that a bug See This PR allows for the embedding of the supernode in another application in my specific case to write Go bindings for n n In addition to that it also adds more examples for embedding which were created in order to show a more advanced custom configuration The API was changed to allow for the following highlevel start functions to be created in the bindings Supernode starter c include n nn nh int supernodeconfiguren nsnt sssnode int lport int supernodeopenlportsocketn nsnt sssnode int supernodeopenmgmtsocketn nsnt sssnode int mgmtport int supernodestartn nsnt sssnode int keeprunning int supernodestopn nsnt sssnode This was achieved by decomposing snc into snutilsc snc and defining the new public functions in n nh The relevant new examples are exampleedgeembedc and examplesnembedc I have moved the edge embed example with the quickedgeinit function to exampleedgeembedquickedgeinitc Please take all of this with a grain of salt I have never written any C before and followed only a simple C tutorial beforehand I only know GoJSRuby It would be awesome if it would be possible to embed the supernode in an application I am currently writing some very basic I have never written any C before and am just a novice when it comes to Go Go bindings for n n The bindings will also have a command for edges and supernodes and I plan to write a Kubernetes CNI plugin with them While the public API as defined in n nh allows for easy embedding of edge it is currently not possible at least not with my current knowledge of C to embed the supernode To do so I have created a temporary fork of n n in which I have decomposed the supernode in a similar way that the edge is currently edgec edgeutilsc snc snutilsc and if there is interest in changing the API to allow for embedding Id be more than happy to start a pull request I compiled windows with vs unable to connect exit no error In windows it is In linux it is I dont know

IPADDRESSOFOTHERBOX port No route to host So there are moments when the networking works and when it doesnt I started edge like sudo usrsbinedge c XXX d XXX k MYPASS l HOSTPORT a MYIP m MYMAC f v And supernode like usrsbinsupernode l PORT v f And I see that the networking starts working right after reregistering Rx REGISTERSUPERACK message printed I dont really know what to look for in the logs any hints please n n v it good enough in most network enviromentbut in some occasionslow connection or long distance it cause packet loss consider about FEC please thanks refer I hope it will help After playing around with N N for quite a bit I was at first a bit disappointed by the performance Mbits on a gigabit connection Well at first I didnt enable AES after adding A I was able to go to Mbits then I checked the CPU which was at a CPU instance Upgraded the node to CPUs Mbits Were getting there Now I used v to get some more details I did not think that adding logging would reduce speed drastically After removing v the speed went up to Mbits Now I though about some more options so I ran another edge Yet another speed improvement this time I was able to achieve Mbits which is really quite impressive for a userspace VPN It would be awesome if there would be a specific section on perfomance Having such simple changes literally allowing N N to have x the speed is a thing that some emphasis should be put on IMHO Anyways thanks so much for developing this N N is awesome hey supernode getting time out and nods unable to connect with edge Currently the documentation on how to use DHCP is lacking IMHO Ive been trying to implement the following setup Node supernode edge and dnsmasq bash rootnode supernode l v Sep snc WARNING Running as root is discouraged Sep snc supernode is

where it works just fine If I assign a static IP to node and then make a DHCP request it works as well The thing that is not working is the DHCP ip address assignment on node with the r a dhcp option It would be awesome if there would be more docs on how to setup DHCP if someone could help me with this specific setup here Id be glad to write that of course
