Removed RLMSupport to try and eliminate error Added medium button Add Chinese to localizations Hello Ive updated the Onboarding storyboard navigation logic now you can swipe to switch between screens Could you please take a look and let me know your comments Thanks Overview Ive added a switch in the portions section of the preferences page enabling the user to toggle custom gulp sizes This switch if off by default so the user experience remains consistent Enabling custom gulps adds a third option when the add button is pressed from the drink tab This option presents a modal view controller and asks the user to enter the size of the custom gulp The feature conforms to the existing model supporting both units of measure and has been translated to Italian via Google Translate The project is iOS only so I have taken advantage of UIStackView alongside AutoLayout to manage the UI The custom gulp button is positioned above the small and big gulp buttons but will not overlap with the existing percentage label
