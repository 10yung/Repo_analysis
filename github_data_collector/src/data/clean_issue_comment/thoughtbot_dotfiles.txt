Hi there Im running Vim on macOS Catalina When I open Vim I always get this error message Error detected while processing vimrc line E Invalid argument diffoptvertical Press ENTER or type command to continue Removing the seemed to have silenced the error but because Im a Vim neophyte Im not convinced that this is the correct solution asdf has a very useful configuration setting called legacyversionfile When set to yes asdf will in addition to a toolversions files read the version files used by other version managers eg rubyversion This makes the migration to asdf much smoother as many projects only specify these legacy dotfiles for versioning It would be helpful if our dotfiles came with this configuration enabled asdf documentation How to reproduce FROM ubuntu RUN aptget update aptget install y softwarepropertiescommon RUN addaptrepository ppamartinfrostthoughtbotrcm RUN aptget update aptget install y vim git zsh curl rcm RUN git clone gitgithubcomthoughtbotdotfilesgit dotfiles env RCRCHOMEdotfilesrcrc rcup RUN rcup docker build t dotfiles docker run rm it dotfiles zsh If I type g and hit TAB there is no suggestions But I expect them to be present because there is compdef ggit in zshcompletiong Issue This addresses the issue pointed out in Description Introduced in the loadSettings func requires extendedglob As such its been moved from optionszsh to the zshrc file Hi Im trying to change the default Oh My Zsh theme I created my dotfileslocalzshrclocal and added the ZSHTHEMEmythemename but it is not loading Do you know if theres some step Im missing I added the custom theme as suggested by the Oh My Zsh documentation Some Bash builtins like export alias can be run once instead of multiple times by using multiple arguments instead of calling it times in a row for alias I also think the config looks nicer as a result When bringing my dotfiles uptodate including the Make loadsettings more concise commit I noticed my prompt turned into It turned out I had to setopt extendedglob as noted by the commit message I ended up adding this configuration in my zshenvlocal so by the time zshrc runs loadsettings the glob can work correctly Just wondering if it would make sense for setopt extendedglob to be in thoughtbot dotfiles zshenv or zshrc instead of requiring custom config for loadsettings to work PR adds adds custom tmux binding keys to split window horizontally and vertically Tmux Invocation for horizontal split Ctrl b Tmux Invocation for vertical split Ctrl b Thank you for a great repo guys it helps me really a lot to organise all the dotfiles stuff There is a potential implicit issuerisk covers in symlinking hooks Description Lets say you have such scenario git clone projecta git clone projectb cd projecta composer install additionally installs fe postcommit hook This will most probably break projectb by modifying the project hooks and additionally will modify template hooks in the root dotfiles folder In such a scenario composer changes postcommit hook in the projecta which following the links chain leads to the changes in projectbgithookspostcommit as well as dotfilesgittemplatehookspostcommit since postcommit in projecta is just a link to the initial file Its quite common that some tool like composer may change hooks which leads to such implicit scenario if hooks were symlinked Possible solution gittemplatehooks should be copied and not symlinked git pob reaches out to the remote to find branches that have been deleted If they have been deleted from the remote and you are tracking them then those local branches will be deleted This is completely safe on branches that you are tracking that have not been deleted Local branches that you have not pushed up are also completely safe
