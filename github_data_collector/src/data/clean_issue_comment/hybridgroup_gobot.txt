Please support Adafruit VEML Lux Sensor I C Light Sensor It is I C so it should be fairly easy Both C and Python implementations exist What I have done Installed gort with homebrew Ran gort arduino install Ran gort scan serial Ran gort arduino upload firmata devttyusbmodem b uno Installed gobot with go get d u gobotioxgobot Copied Hello World of Things code example to maingo file changed devttyACM to devttyusbmodem Ran go run maingo Got error githubcomgoblebledarwin gosrcgithubcomgoblebledarwindevicego cannot use d type Device as type bleDeviceOption in argument to opt Device does not implement bleDeviceOption missing SetConnectedHandler method Add delay for Run function of StepperDriver and create common sleep function Testing on the actual machine has been completed Issue Ive been trying to use the example provided but used a different pin The code can be found in However using the devttyACM gives me an error saying that the directory is not found it looks like most of the search result is pointing to Arduino I checked dev folder and the one that I can see that close enough is devttyS and devttyAMA I tried both but it gives me the error of Initializing connections Initializing connection Firmata C D Initializing devices Initializing device PIRMotion B C Initializing device LED F EF Robot motionBot initialized Starting Robot motionBot Starting connections Starting connection Firmata C D on port devttyAMA error occurred unable to connect Perhaps you need to flash your Arduino with Firmata Id love to see support for ESP at some point Based on it sounds like it might be straightforward once the upstream support for ESP is handled within firmata but figured Id open this issue to track this request and see if Im missing anything else Thank you for gobot current adapter hard coded loading only the first joystick added a new adapter that would allow for arbitrary joysticks based on id Run function of StepperDriver does not working properly because there is no Sleep function This function calls step function very first cycle and should have a sleep like Move function Current Move function which has a sleep Current loop of Run function without Sleep Signedoffby Nathan Hack nathanhackgmailcom It would be great if gobot framework could contain builtin functionality for apps instrumentation ie measuring resource usage timings histograms and counters for various operations etc Id recommend taking a look at githubcomVictoriaMetricsmetrics as starting point It is easy to use and it integrates well with Prometheus ecosystem Add new i c feature for grovepi I use this code with the grove ultra sonic ranger Mainly based on Feel free to comment accept or refused it btw nice project
