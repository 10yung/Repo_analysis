Hi I need to solve the D advection diffusion equation for a species concentration with a sink term At the left BC there is a constant concentration for all time steps at the right BC the advective flux equals the diffusive flux initially I want to add an optional sink term kphiphimax which should be zero for cells when phiphimax and which should have a value that sets the cells concentration equal to phimax when concentration reaches phimax not allowing the concentration to rise above phimax Sorry for the long description but is this possible with your code Not really important but may be helpful for preparing presentations and documents The derivations are ready to implement
