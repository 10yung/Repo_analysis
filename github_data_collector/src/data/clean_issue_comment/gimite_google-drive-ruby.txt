Id like to delete columns with fewer than elements and Im having a bit of a hard time as there is no deletecolumn method This is my code each do x yArr each do y if ws xy yArr else yArr end if yArrsum wsdeletecolumnx wssave else end end end Feature request Add support for shared drives If this is available now I wasnt able to find documentation for it It looks like Team Drive support was added a couple of years ago Team Drive has since been renamed to Shared Drives The API documentation mentions a supportsAllDrives parameter that must be passed along with various requests which might be the new version of the supportsteamdrives parameter added at the time and still extant in v of the gem Thanks img width altCapture d e cran a src When proceeding with the setup of credentials when I do the first step Open this page I then click on my profile with which I want to login then I get this error message Any clue why This seems new as I used this gem before Im seeing a bug where my Sheet is losing its frozen row after an insert happens via a call to insertrows This allows to append data efficiently to an existing spreadsheet without having to load and submit the whole worksheet every time we want to add a new row I want to get subcollections in a special folder I have folder id and I get folder by sessionfilebyid I can see the output as Root Folder Test class GoogleDriveCollection But when I call rootfoldersubcollections it return an empty array and also I really see a folder called fastlane in the folder test but I call filebytitlefastlane or subcollectionbytitlefastlane they all return nil So how can I get the subfolder By the way my test folder is on the team driver but I think since I can get folder by id why I cant get folder by title In Google Drive there is an option to add description to files and folders it helps in searching Is there any way to add description to a file on the Drive When passing a Pathname object to GoogleDriveSessionfromconfig it fails since it expects a Config object I suggest instead of check if the object is a string to check if the object responds to one of the required methods eg clientid and if not treat it as a string Thanks Hi is
