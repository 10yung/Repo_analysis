First draft of GradCollide on multiple nodes I have not tested this code Also contains some optimizations to the ElasticAverageBinder and miscellaneous typofixes it is how it is shown IPTW BIDMach has several basic causal estimators IPTW stands for Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting and is a widely used method technique for causal inference with binary treatments We start with some data features mathXmath a response mathYmath and a treatment mathZmath In causal inference we are interested in the effects of directly changing mathZmath on mathYmath This is different from the conditional probability of mathYmath given mathZmath which depends on joint probability distribution of the system as is link for BIDMat for bit windows is broken I tried to run testsmfssc on Netflix dataset For all the cases d to d RMSE is which cannot be true I tried running testsfassc script on the same dataset There I get RMSE ranging from to which is acceptable Is the prediction function wrong I tried to use same prediction function but that did not work either Any kind of help will be really appreciated I have systems where the only version of CUDA available is Can we get BidMach to run along with v Hi I am running into some array dimension mismatches in the Netevalbatch function due to a change in the code Currently the master branch has val scores zerosscorelayerslength batchSize for i until scorelayerslength scoresi scorelayersiscore which has given the scores matrix a vector for each layer rather than a scalar for each layer Previously each score layer only had a scalar score available val scores zerosscorelayerslength for i until scorelayerslength scoresi scorelayersiscorev Is there a reason that this has changed It certainly seems to be making eg the GLM layer break when used as an output layer Change happened here Cheers When i run getdatash file to download all the dataset in data folder so after all data get download a error comes like homebizruntime BIDMachscriptscbintparseexe No such file or directory and same for trecexe so i want to know where is this two files And also there is no cbin folder inside scripts folder So Please Explain Generating kbest is the next priority but this is a good start Seems to work on the MNT english to french dataset more concrete results soon This is coupled with
