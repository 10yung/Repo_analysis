 cargo build release warning An explicit bin section is specified in Cargotoml which currently disables Cargo from automatically inferring other binary targets This inference behavior will change in the Rust edition and the following files will be included as a binary target freepassclisrcmainrs This is likely to break cargo build or cargo test as these files may not be ready to be compiled as a binary target today You can futureproof yourself and disable this warning by adding autobins false to your package section You may also move the files to a location where Cargo would not automatically infer them to be a target such as in subfolders For more information on this warning you can consult warning path freepassclisrcmainrs was erroneously implicitly accepted for binary freepass please set binpath in Cargotoml Not a problem when compiling but thought it would help to note this behavior i checked the released tab but you only have serdemigration i wanted to use it but i need to compile it it would be much nicer to just have it built Right now I can print the public key from freepass or add the private key to sshagent Are there any plans to allow printing the private key as well I want to be able to export the keys for use but right now I have to do it in a round about way Is this an option you are considering adding
