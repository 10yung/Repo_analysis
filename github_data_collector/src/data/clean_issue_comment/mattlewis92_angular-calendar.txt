moving event to right and up or down In finally only changing user not time for event Because when users a lot and distancedragEventx also big function roundToNearest which calculate Mathround return and this change normal behavior I could solve problem when added custom function which return I run test in project and unfortunately some of them was failed Please help me in my problem picture Hey

issues If youre a company using this project then you can use GitHub sponsors as a means of purchasing a monthly support contract by becoming a Silver Sponsor for only a month Platinum sponsors even get a free one to one consultation with me where Ill help guide you on how to integrate this calendar within your application Alternatively if youd like to make a one time donation you can paypal me instead If you have any questions then please feel to comment below Hey everyone I currently work on this project for free in my spare time and Im looking into some ways to make the project more sustainable so that I can justify spending more time maintaining it One of the methods Im considering is by creating some premium demos they would work exactly the same as the current demos except to access the source code you or better yet your employer would need to pay a fee somewhere around the mark Some of the things Im considering making premium demos of are Show events on the month view that span multiple days Mobile friendly components Usage with angular material Fetching holidays from an API and showing them as distinct milestone style events Showing how to support nongregorian calendars eg hebrew hijri jalali etc Infinite scrolling the month week day views apple calendar style Adding some more advanced functionality on the day view scheduler RTL Import and export of events to ICS Grouping events together and expanding to show more If you would be willing to pay for this please add a thumbs up on the issue plus if you have any other ideas of demos you would pay to see please comment here Thanks for taking the time to read this and for using my project ps anyone who donates or above on Patreon will get this for free when its finished Hey everyone Im looking at creating an online video course that shows you how to setup and customise this calendar within your application so that by the end of the course you have a feature rich google calendar like component that goes way beyond the basic demos Every video would be accompanied by the code we build in each step that you can checkout play with and use freely in your application The course would cover Overview what the course covers Getting started installing the calendar into your project Fetching events from an API google calendar or a custom node one and displaying them on the calendar Grouping events into different calendars that you can show and hide Showing holidays on the calendar Adding an event when you click on the calendar and saving to an API Adding an event by dragging and selecting a part of the calendar Blocking the user from adding events to certain times Editing event titles and colors and deleting and saving them to an API Changing event times by dragging and resizing them Opening a popout tile with more info when you click on an event Making month and week view headers stick at the top and scrolling just the body Adding a current time marker and scrolling to it on the day and week views Having month view events span multiple days Truncating the amount of events shown on the month week and day views and adding a show more panel Changing between month week and day views when clicking on headers within each component Fading out events in the past Adding options to toggle weekends and a day week view Adding a scroll to the month view to change the current month Automatically setting the language of the calendar based on the users language Adding the week number to the month view Bonus Integrating with material design Bonus Integrating with ngrx Bonus Integrating with firebase Bonus Styling the calendar to add an toggleable dark theme Bonus Setting dates in different timezones Bonus Unit and e e testing examples The cost of this course would probably be around and goes towards the continued development of this project I currently work on this in my free time for an hour If this is something that would interest you and you or better yet your employer would pay for it please give a thumbs up on this issue Plus if you have any additional thoughts on what youd like to see in the course please comment here so I can produce the best content that benefits everyone ps anyone who donates or above on Patreon will get this for free when its finished
