It seems that when multiple apps are in play this displays as different connections in the dashboard which is correct The incorrect bit is that per app reporting is funneled through a singular dashboard connection so each app triggers an update to the realtime stats which leads to really wonky graphs at least but more importantly incorrect graphs Screen Shot at AM hi all we config our web with SSL and it works when using php artisan websocketsserve but dont work when using supervisord error are failed Error in connection establishment netERRCONNECTIONREFUSED Window someone please enlight me where to make change again thanks Referring from After adding WebSocketsRouterwebSocketmywebsocket App MyCustomWebSocketHandlerclass Getting error Custom WebSocket Handlers Class WebSocketsRouter not found Also referred to But causing all other socket somehow like redirect to MyCustomWebSocketHandler pusherminjs WebSocket connection to wschatlocal appanyKeyprotocol clientjs version flashfalse failed Error in connection establishment netERRCONNECTIONREFUSED I keep getting this error with my private channels Access to XMLHttpRequest at from origin has been blocked by CORS policy No AccessControlAllowOrigin header is present on the requested resource CrossOrigin Read Blocking CORB blocked crossorigin response with MIME type applicationjson See for more details public channel working fine this happens on both local with homestead and production on VPS If can help I am using barryvdhlaravelcors beyondcodelaravelwebsockets laravelecho pusherjs Hello When new user joins to chat another users are getting memberadded message in js Echojoining is running When that user opens same chat link in other tab other users again are getting memberadded message After when user closes one of the opened tabs other users are getting memberremoved message in js Echoleaving is running So hes still in chat in another tab but other users see that he has leaved In right logic server will only send memberadded message only if that member has not opened chat in another tab or browser And memberremoved message will be sent only if all tabs are closed With pusher pushercom this works fine PS Dont know will this info help or not If user has opened two tabs after closes one other users get memberremoved message and see that hes offline But if other users are reloading page through Echohereusers are getting also that user right information I created custom websockethandler and its work fine when APPDEBUGtrue in env but when i set APPDEBUGfalse its stop working class CustomSocketHandler extends WebSocketHandler i think that is bad idea if i have to enable APPDEBUGtrue I get a constant error message error Unknown app id testapp provided when I set in env PUSHERAPPIDtestapp How it works Does it check with Pusher for real aplication IDs created with Pusher We are using one websockets worker to send messages to k clients It uses about GB RAM and of one CPU core It seems like it cant handle more active connections with messages sent We use Nginx as reverse proxy for that So is there any way to set up another artisan websocketsserve on different port and somehow set up our nginx to handle it all Messages are sent from events with ShouldBroadcast Maybe there are other ways to handle this highload Hello Im stuck in situation how to pass websockets requests in situation when Ive servers in chain Here is it A domain name domaindev with A record intranet server which has external IP and nginx with SSL installed that proxifying requests from external IP to internal depending on domain name intranet server which contains service with websocket on standart port this server has no direct access to internet So sheme is Domaindev A record points to Server Server with nginx and SSL for domaindev Server with websocket server on standart port I tried lots of variants and always get errors like WebSocket connection to wss failed Error in connection establishment netERRCONNECTIONREFUSED WebSocket connection to wss failed WebSocket is closed before the connection is established As I mentioned problem is that my service is configured for accepting http connections but connections is sending via https wss I read official manual but cant understand how handle same location for http and websockets requests So this config part from example location proxypass is for websockets only But how I can forward normal requests My Configs appjs windowEcho new Echo broadcaster pusher key processenvMIXPUSHERAPPKEY cluster
