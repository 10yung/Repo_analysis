I got this warning while upgrading using brew cu a Warning It seems there is already an App at ApplicationsIntelliJ IDEAapp overwriting I assume that homebrewcaskupgrade issues brew cask install force instead of brew cask reinstall Would it hurt to use reinstall instead Id strongly assume this would get rid of the warning Looking over your code you install all updated Casks to Applications even if they were installed using the appdirpath parameter and resided somewhere else Could you update the command to rectify this If that isn t possible for some reason I d settle for the ability to specify or exclude Casks with the command perhaps via config file
