Can write a large file transfer example When will the official version be released I have an IoT application that receives Cloud to Device message from an Azure IoT Hub With no C D messages the application will throw a series of exceptions Exception thrown SystemOperationCanceledException in SystemPrivateCoreLibdll Exception thrown SystemOperationCanceledException in SystemPrivateCoreLibdll Exception thrown SystemOperationCanceledException in SystemPrivateCoreLibdll Exception thrown SystemOperationCanceledException in SystemPrivateCoreLibdll Exception thrown MicrosoftAzureDevicesClientExceptionsIotHubCommunicationException in MicrosoftAzureDevicesClientdll Exception thrown MicrosoftAzureDevicesClientExceptionsIotHubCommunicationException in SystemPrivateCoreLibdll Exception thrown DotNettyTransportChannelsClosedChannelException in SystemPrivateCoreLibdll Exception thrown DotNettyTransportChannelsClosedChannelException in MicrosoftAzureDevicesClientdll Exception thrown DotNettyTransportChannelsClosedChannelException in SystemPrivateCoreLibdll These errors are not precipitated by a C D message as there arent any These errors are not caught by any error trapping so there is no stack trace or anything else that would give any better information These errors also do not throw an unhandled exception It is difficult to know for sure what is the inner most exception Since DotNetty seems to be the lowest level I have stated here These exceptions happen without regard to the CPU or device that they are running on Azure Device Client v MicrosoftNetCoreUniversalWindowsPlatform Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated Thank you in advance I think that comment is unpleasantly true you will need to create a clone as youre removing items from the collection that youre iterating over This is what Im seeing it seems as this only occurs upon the second call SystemInvalidOperationException Collection was modified enumeration operation may not execute at SystemCollectionsGenericHashSet EnumeratorMoveNext at DotNettyCommonFastThreadLocalRemoveAll Without this it may lead to an infinite loop When run build anycup console application at windows server R DotNettyTransportChannelsDefaultMaxMessagesRecvByteBufAllocatorMaxMess ageHandle AllocateIByteBufferAllocator alloc DotNettyTransportChannelsSocketsAbstractSocketByteChannelSocketByteCh annelUnsafeFinishReadSocketChannelAsyncOperation operation OnConnectionExceptionSystemOutOfMemoryException SystemOutOfMemor yException DotNettyBuffersHeapArenaNewChunkInt pageSize Int maxOrder Int pageShifts Int chunkSize DotNettyBuffersPoolArena AllocateNormalPooledByteBuffer buf Int reqCapacity Int normCapacity DotNettyBuffersPoolArena AllocatePoolThreadCache cache PooledByteB uffer buf Int reqCapacity DotNettyBuffersPooledByteBufferAllocatorNewHeapBufferInt initialCapa city Int maxCapacity DotNettyBuffersAbstractByteBufferAllocatorBufferInt initialCapacity So i try to call this on the server back to back for example senpacketbuf sendpacketbuf when i throw a breakpoint in debug mode on sendpacket it gets sent and I receive it on the client end but without the breakpoint I never receive the second packet at all Client only ever reads opcode to handle when there is no breakpoint any ideas on what the issue can be Im not sure what kind of code ot paste for reference When regional settings for decimal point is set to eg Polish language based Windows test case for provided testcase fails on Looks like problem only with testcase and provided sample data but im not sure this project stopped developing i want to set up a dotnetty sever to recieve the data from mqtt clientbut how can i get the payload
