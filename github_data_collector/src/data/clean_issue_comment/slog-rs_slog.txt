Might be nice to have something like use slogscope newscopekey value infohi that is shorthand for use slogscope withloggerlogger scopeloggernewokey value infohi More a feature request than a bug but it would be nice to have a way to log to a generic stream using the colors implemented in slogtermTermDecorator Right now you have to reimplement the entire thing to get terminal colors to log to a file This is useful when logging to a file which is later tail Fd It seems that the logic in this PR has been reverted somehow because I now get exactly those errors which are described in that PR when I try to use or with o error E mut dyn stdopsFn static cannot be shared between threads safely srcservermailwatcherrs loggernewopartpath p mut dyn stdopsFn static cannot be shared between threads safely help within stdfmtArgumentV the trait stdmarkerSync is not implemented for mut dyn stdopsFn static note required because it appears within the type stdmarkerPhantomDatamut dyn stdopsFn static note required because it appears within the type corefmtVoid note required because it appears within the type corefmtVoid note required because it appears within the type stdfmtArgumentV note required because it appears within the type stdfmtArgumentV note required because of the requirements on the impl of stdmarkerSend for stdfmtArgumentV note required because it appears within the type stdfmtArguments note required because it appears within the type slogSingleKVstdfmtArguments note required because it appears within the type slogSingleKVstdfmtArguments note required because of the requirements on the impl of slogSendSyncRefUnwindSafeKV for slogSingleKVstdfmtArguments note required by slogOwnedKV note this error originates in a macro outside of the current crate in Nightly builds run with Z externalmacrobacktrace for more info And indeed the kv macro now uses slogbuiltinformatargs instead of whatever is implemented in which in turn implements the pre approach of using formatargs All public types should implement Debug unless theres a good reason not to Since the guard removes the logger when it is dropped it can be necessary to store the guard as part of a struct which may have Debug bounds Why not use BorrowT for keys instead of custom types Key can be replaced with generic K Borrowstr OwnedKV and BorrowedKV can be replaced with T BorrowKV x Update the code and tests x Set lowest version tested at Travis CI to x Changelog I figured having those hidden behind feature flags does more bad than good the features are poorly supported and cause runtime panics from the surrounding infrastructure This fractures the ecosystem in a way that when one can attempts using a package it can compile and have all interfaces check out but panic at runtime with something that shouldve definitely been a compile error not only in rust but in any modern typesafe language Both and have issues Id like to report however issues are disabled for those repos and theres no clear documentation on where to report issues besides the usual GitHub issue tracking locations already have issues enabled which is confusing Both repos state that the issues should reported here however this issue tracker is not wellorganized to support this kind of crossrepo issue tracking For example its not possible to have an overview of the issues specific to just a single subrepo Hi I would like to use slog in a browser in such a way that I could output compact mode there using all the console goodies like consolegroup so I could collapse and expand logs Ive been looking at the slogtermTermDecorator but it seems we will rather not be able to reuse it here or we will Will such abilities be available in slog So I recently found out that I cant log SerdeValues to slogterms drains Would you be open to PRs implementing support for it
