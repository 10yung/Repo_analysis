As documented in the wiki compiling on Ubuntu leads to a failure because of too old openSSL version As the wiki points out the problem can be solved by compiling your own version of openSSL Id like to add to the wiki a conclusive answer on doing so You need two steps one is building your own version of OpenSSL and the second is instructing pyenvto use it To install OpenSSL run the following commands mkdir openssl cd openssl wget tar xzvf openssl utargz cd openssl u config prefixHOMEopenssl openssldirHOMEopenssl shared zlib make make make install This installs the latest version on OpenSSL no more patches will be released to your home directory Now to install Python using pyenv After you configure pyenv run the following command PATHHOMEopensslPATH CPPFLAGSIHOMEopensslinclude CFLAGSIHOMEopensslinclude LDFLAGSLHOMEopenssllib WlrpathHOMEopenssllib LDLIBRARYPATHHOMEopenssllibLDLIBRARYPATH LDRUNPATHHOMEopenssllib CONFIGUREOPTSwithopensslHOMEopenssl PYTHONCONFIGUREOPTSenableshared pyenv install You may add O if you want faster run times Description Platform information eg Ubuntu Linux Ubuntu Linux OS architecture eg amd Irrelevant pyenv version Python version C Compiler information eg gcc Irrelevant The Mac build environment instructions in the wiki currently read When running Mojave or higher you will also need to install the additional SDK headers sudo installer pkg LibraryDeveloperCommandLineToolsPackagesmacOSSDKheadersformacOS pkg target With changes made in macOS Catalina they should now read something more like When running Mojave x you will also need to install the additional SDK headers sudo installer pkg LibraryDeveloperCommandLineToolsPackagesmacOSSDKheadersformacOS pkg target Installing additional SDK headers is not necessary when running Catalina x I installed pyenv and virtualenv on my macos and I found the file boxpy in usrlocalvarpyenvshimsboxpy Open the file it shows usrbinenv bash set e n PYENVDEBUG set x

pyenv has some powerful support for plugins and hook scripts Please refer to Authoring plugins for details and try to implement it as a plugin if possible Please consider contributing the patch upstream to rbenv since we have borrowed most of the code from that project We occasionally import the changes from rbenv In general you can expect changes made in rbenv will be imported to pyenv too eventually Generally speaking we prefer not to make changes in the core in order to keep compatibility with rbenv x My PR addresses the following pyenv issue if any Description x Here are some details about my PR If there is a better solution like use macro for reusable code plz guide me Just make it works cause its really annoying when I have to restart the shell with exec zsh and the PATH get populated Tests My PR adds the following unit tests if any Description pyenv install does not understand multiversion pythonversion files as generated by pyenv local like Output pyenv install pythonbuild definition not found The following versions contain in the name See all available versions with pyenv install list If the version you need is missing try upgrading pyenv cd homeorpheuspyenvpluginspythonbuild git pull cd Arch Linux as in Amd pyenv Python gcc GCC Verbose output For those wondering setting multiple python versions makes pythonXY shims to work on tools like tox which is becoming somewhat standard due setuptools dropping its test command Whenever I try to install any module eg pipenv install requests I get the following error Installing requests Traceback
