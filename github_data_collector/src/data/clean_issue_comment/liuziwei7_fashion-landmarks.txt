Dear Ziwei Liu I am trying to run inference of the models available on github on some images Please excuse if its a naive question but can these models be loaded on cpumachine to run inference Dear Ziwei Liu A problem confuses meCan we use the bounding box position as a konwn information in the testing set I notice that you trian three network for upperlower and fullbody clothes As I can not find the train code Do you use the bounding box information to preprocess the training datacrop the bounding box and then padding or resizing to If soshould we train a network to catch the bounding box positioneach class having an object detection network for the bounding box coordinate so that we can test a image and crop the information from the bounding boxBut the object detection network seems difficult to train because we can find that some images both having the upper clothing information and the lower clothing information how can the network resolve what is need to recognitionThanks for your answer Dear Ziwei Liu I have read your paperDeepFashion Powering Robust Clothes Recognition and Retrieval with Rich Annotations and it is very helpful for my research You mentioned four benchmarks in your paper but I only found fashionlandmarks and landmark detection models in your GitHub Could you release the model about Consumer to Shop It will very helpful for my research Thank you very much Where are the lossfunctions of the net I need help in setting up that weighted L loss for landmark localisation Dear Ziwei Awesome and interesting work Do you mind shed some lights on what is purpose of the statement getorigcoordinate pp repmat offset offset piplinenumpoints scale I can not relate this to the paper particularly p I dont have matlab so I wont be able to debug the value but when I run pyCaffe those values of landmarks came out of stage forward are very small same as pseudo labels all lower than Any explanations will be greatly appreciated Thanks
