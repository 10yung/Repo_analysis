 I enabled multiline by linenoiseSetMultiLine My hint list is hint hint helpand what I return in hintcallback function is something like r nhint hint which means concat hint list with into a string prepended by a r n The question is when I enter a h my hint show up in the next linehint hint help as it should bebut when I go on entering a i my cursor starts from next line leaving the previous line a single h which is not my wishI hope the character I entered could be in same line just like the way I enter words in terminal My question is like thisassume my prompt is h hint hint help hi hint hint Hi I noticed that when I use or say N to get the details of Nth command I see the newline character goes missing It appears like for eg pwdhomepoomanju instead of pwd homepoomanju Any suggestion or help to resolve this issue Refer to It works for me for a long time if there is any better solution please just close this PR Minor fix to typos in the readme file This changeset provides support for building and installing shared and static libraries I used a separate makefile for the new targets because they require GNU make which is not true of the existing makefile If these changes are welcome is compatibility with nonGNU makes is important given that the existing makefile is just used for compiling an example programme or shall I do away with the separate makefile Hi Using this patch the source and the example become fully compliant under stdc yielding zero warnings when using Wall Wextra Wpedantic which is a requirement for a project Im working on I may use linenoise for Looking forward to your review Eugenio some minor improvements found with a linter If I run the example I can paste CR or CRLF lines linenoiseexample hello expr echo expr hello expr echo expr but if I try to paste LF lines I get unexpected result linenoiseexample hello expr hello expr hello expr hello expr hello expr hello expr hello expr hello expr hello expr hello expr hello expr hello expr expr echo expr expr I think it would be helpful to abstract away the direct use of stdinstdout constants into variables that default to stdinstdout such that a pty could be swapped in allowing for a socket input source I think it would also be helpful to allow for an event loop environment via a character reader API reference
