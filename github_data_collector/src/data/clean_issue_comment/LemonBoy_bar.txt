Added a few words on documentation based on I have followed all guides to setting up lemon bar including bspwm for dummies it just doesnt work when i type panel in the terminal i get a homekronikpillowconfigpanelpanel line panelcolors file not found which is weird bcz kronikpillowsusanoo panel ls panel panelbar panelcolors this is my profile XDGCONFIGHOMEHOMEconfig export XDGCONFIGHOME PANELFIFOtmppanelfifo PANELHEIGHT PANELFONTfixed PANELWMNAMEbspwmpanel export PANELFIFO PANELHEIGHT PANELFONT PANELWMNAME export PATHPATHconfigpanel what am i doing wrong When a string of text is aligned to the right the second character is deleted for some reason Are application launchers possible in lemonbar in other words integrating a dockystyle section in lemonbar If so could the lemonbar launcher icons be of types svg png etc Having searched on the internet re using svgpng style icons over font symbols eg Fontawesome in lemonbar particularly the only hints I could find were as follows If possible could sample code for these launchers please be spelled out Hopefully the code would contain a line demonstrating where an svgpng file would appear or even a desktop file which contains a reference to a svgpngtype icon Many thanks in advance Im running a clean Arch install with bspwm So Im really enjoying lemonbar but I cant get font awesome working Im using the lemonbarxftgit version When I try to do a little test echo e uf eb in terminal Urxvt with nerdfontscomplete Hacksize it shows the correct glyph wifi icon However when I try to echo it into lemonbar echo e uf eb lemonbar f Font Awesome f Hack p I dont see anything Ive added all possible font paths in usrsharefonts to my xorgconf Is this behaviour expected Here is the data I send to the bar Pay attention to the end r lFFFF B GB RAM F B F B FFFF Hello F F B B FFFF F B FFFF cF B FFFFB F F F F FFFF F F F F F B FFFF r Result But when I want to specify a background on the right part by changing it to rB please ignore slightly different time of day That is the background of the right part now fills all the gaps between the left middle and right sections as if it leaks The documentation in READMEmd and in the manpage does not explain that the contents of the bar is populated via stdin Examples are also missing Simple example to get one going like these would be helpful sh while true do date done lemonbar sh cat etchostname lemonbar p Hello i just wonder if its possible to add consistent underline or overline across entire bar for aesthetic because i do want to fill my center section with it which is mostly blank and filled with active window title it feels weird the underline and overline shrink and grows every time i hover through windows it would be nice if my top bar underline could expand and fill the remaining space rather than leaving it blank screenshot PS Thank you for this awesome bar Currently lemonbar always makes itself always on top however that messes up with fullscreen windows since the bar is always above them NETWMSTATEBELOW looks like what is necessary to force the bar window to the bottom And this is not a WM issue bar is an unmanaged window eg lleft uUffffffff c u center r right would show ffffffff underline across the left half inbetween left and center
