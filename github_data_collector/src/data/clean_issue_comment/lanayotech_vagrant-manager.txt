I have set up a synced folder with NFS and now Im required to supply my password when starting or reloading the machine So far so good On the command line it all works as expected but when using Vagrant Manager a password prompt appears and even though I input the correct password it keeps reappearing and then the operation fails see log file extract below Vagrant Manager Host macOS Vagrant Virtualbox r Guest CentOS master Exporting NFS shared folders master Preparing to edit etcexports Administrator privileges will be required tee etcexports Operation not permitted tee etcexports Operation not permitted tee etcexports Operation not permitted master Mounting NFS shared folders The following SSH command responded with a nonzero exit status Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed mount o vers udp varwww Stdout from the command Stderr from the command mountnfs requested NFS version or transport protocol is not supported The ability to exportimport a list of custom commands for associated vagrant boxes would be helpful in both migrating from one development machine to another as well as for deploying custom commands to a large subset of users Some expansion on this Command line option to importexport so its scriptable as part of an install Ability to choose between appending existing commands or overwrite Today its only seemingly doable by copying plists around Hi i am using Laravel Homestead to provision my boxes We have setup where we use one Vagrantfile for multiple boxes img width altScreenshot at src In the vagrant manager ui only one box is shown img width altScreenshot at src vagrant globalstatus returns id name provider state directory fe rate virtualbox saved UsersdominicGitrate e b c a rma virtualbox poweroff UsersdominicGitrma e connect virtualbox poweroff UsersdominicGitconnect a b ratewordpressv virtualbox saved UsersdominicGitratewordpressv f a a listbuildernew virtualbox running UsersdominicGitpackageserverconfigboxes dee d ratenew virtualbox running UsersdominicGitpackageserverconfigboxes My software versions Vagrant Virtualbox r Vagrant Manager Can you assist with any suggestions on how to correctly register all the boxes There is no functionality at the moment to fork with boxes which use custom names for vagrant file and dot file fe im using it to place two separate box in the same directory and run them with command VAGRANTVAGRANTFILEVagrantfilecentos VAGRANTDOTFILEPATHvagrantcentos vagrant up VAGRANTVAGRANTFILEVagrantfilecentos VAGRANTDOTFILEPATHvagrantcentos vagrant up Because of vagrantfiles have different name then Vagrantfile Vagrant Manager doesnt detect that boxes Also Vagrant Manager dont have functionality to configure name of Vagrantfile Would love to be able to chose a different editor other than TextEdit when editing a Vagrantfile Would it be possible to add VMware AppCatalyst as a Vagrant provider All state information is accessible through their REST API a la prlctl and vboxmanage AppCatalyst is handy because it runs VMware boxes headless without a Fusion Vagrant plugin license To get available VMs vagrantd f c f ee cf ef b To get power state code messagepowered on Everything else should be reasonably close to the vmwarefusion implementation My everyday user account on OS X is not an admin as a matter of general security Some Vagrant machines require me to put in my Admin password such as before altering the Hosts file on Up or Halt but theres no opportunity to use a different user so the password fails because Im not an admin When doing this in Terminal I would probably just su in before running vagrant up Perhaps Vagrant Manager could allow something similar Hi there Reading I can specify a different place to store the virtual machines and the vagrant boxes using environmental variables When Im on a terminal I specify it and have it different for each bookmarkVagrantfile set of servers However with Vagrant Manager I cant specify it per Vagrantfilebookmark Not sure what is involved but it would be great to specify the desired profile to be opened with iTerm I wrote a bash script which automatically adds new conf files for new pages and activates them But it needs the sites name as a parameter I would be nice if I could specify the Custom Command with an request for input data Atm I prompt that in the Terminal but a Input field or any prompt in the app would be great Any thoughts about that Greetz Marc
