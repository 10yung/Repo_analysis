 Type of issue Bug Question eg about handlingusage X Request for new featureimprovement Is it possible to add suport for opacity in hex values when generating qr codes Expected Behavior Bitmap qrCodeImage qrCodeGetGraphic c c true Im generating hex codes that come in digits instead of the usual six If my tests are correct right now it only allows for digits hex codes resulting in different color generated codes NET Framework Registry Settings Immediately after installing the QRCoderDLL we have an intermittent but frequent issue where an important registry setting is changed by an application or process The OnlyUseLatestCLR registry setting under HKEYLOCALMACHINE SOFTWARE Microsoft NETFramework is getting set to every few days and this is causing many of our SSRS reports to fail claiming it cannot locate MicrosoftVisualBasicDLL Resetting the flag back to corrects the issue Weve turned on registry auditing but Id like to see if anyone is familiar with this issue My thoughts are that I may need to recompile either the QRCoderDLL using a NET framework version that matches the server framework version or recompile the consuming application using this version or both Suggestions will be appreciated SQL Server Windows Server R QRCoder v Runtime version v Server NET Frameworks v v v Type of issue Bug Question eg about handlingusage x Request for new featureimprovement Expected Behavior Currently there is only a bool drawQuietZones to indicate the margin However the size of the margin is calculated with pixelsPerModule C var offset drawQuietZones pixelsPerModule It would be great if there is a exact offset can be input and no need to dynamically generate the margin eg C qrCodeGetGraphicpixelsPerModule offset Your Environment Version used Compiled from source or NuGet package NuGet Used ECClevel L Used renderer class Base QRCode Environment NET NET X NETCore NET Core From issue there is a validation of the allowed characters in the swiss qr Code for the name field From my research i think that the sign should be allowed For example in on Page Point Character set Currently the sign is allowed but not the I have not tested it on the qr validation Portal since I dont have an account Could you do a change to allow the sign in the regex Expression in PayloadGeneratorcs Line charsetPattern Type of issue X Bug Question eg about handlingusage Request for new featureimprovement Expected Behavior The following is with respect to the standard Schweizer Implementation Guidelines QRRechnung version The chapter mandates that CR LF separates fields as opposed to delimit them The table in chapter mandates that the field QRCHRmtInfAddInfAstrdBgkInf Bill information is an optional field That is it must be delivered but can be empty Thus if the field Bill information is empty and the Alternative scheme parameters are not delivered then the last characters of the payload must be EPD r n the r n separates the field Trailer from the necessarily delivered field Bill information however Bill information is empty Current Behavior In the abovedescribed scenario the payload ends with EPD ie the trailing r n is missing Type of issue Bug X Question eg about handlingusage Request for new featureimprovement Sorry for bothering but im new to the usage of qr code but to my understanding you can enconde only in alphanumeric mode Does the librabry allow that or only data mix mode Thanks for submitting a pull request Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request A similar PR may already be submitted

it does not use reflection anymore The version with reflection did not work for me in a XamarinAndroid release build in debug it worked My proposed version does more accurate type checking and should
