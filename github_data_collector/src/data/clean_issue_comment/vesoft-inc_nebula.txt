 As title When I reviewed the code I found a defect and fixed it thx Supports multiple character sets By default each character set supports collation in binary mode The default character set is utf and in nebula utf is an alias of utf mb so the default collation is utf bin You can specify the character set and collation when creating a space If it is not specified the default character set and collation are used The following three create space statements are equivalent create space myspace partitionnum replicafactor charset utf collate utf bin create space myspace partitionnum replicafactor charset utf create space myspace partitionnum replicafactor By disabling strict aliasing via fnostrictaliasing it might have some negligible impacts on performance while avoiding relevant bugs which is hard to hunt which is worthy for us same as gremlin vs ngql this is cypher vs ngql Fixed two failures found by UBSan Tweaks to make UBSan more usable If hive table column names are inconsistent with sparkewriter configure names this tool does not check the metaconsistency and just go on But no data has been written For mapping conf if the mapped fields are different from the column of Hive give the user a hint would be helpful
