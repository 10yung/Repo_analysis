Can we have an option for setting precompiled header output file visual studio equivalent Whats your question How is the library extension determined when generating library dependencies Details From the manual When linking against system libraries do not include any prefix or file extension Premake will use the appropriate naming conventions for the current platform I am adding support for a new platform handheld gameconsole to premake and this platform uses a for library names Ive set up the new OS types as a POSIX OS and it mostly works But when I add links fmod then the generated visual studio file will create an additional dependency called libfmodlib and not libfmoda unfortunately NOTE for the dependency projects in my application it does use the a suffix and correctly links against it It is just an issue with rd party prebuilt library I looked in the premake sourcecode but am not sure where this library suffix is determined The suffix stuff defaults to posix which Ive set so Im puzzled What does this PR do If there is a whitespace immediately before andor after it is not considered as a deferred join delimiter How does this PR change Premakes behavior In most cases directory names do not have leading andor trailing whitespace In most cases whitespace is added before and after pipe and or In such cases applying this PR eliminates issue if directory name has a leading andor trailing whietspace deferred join delimiter will not work properly However all existing tests passed without change Anything else we should know This PR does not completely resolve issue So I dont write close comment Did you check all the boxes x Focus on a single fix or feature remove any unrelated formatting or code changes x Add unit tests showing fix or feature works all tests pass x Mention any related issues put closes XXXX in comment to autoclose issue when PR is merged x Follow our coding conventions x Minimize the number of commits You can now support Premake on our OpenCollective Your contributions help us spend more time responding to requests like these Hey Im am using premake also Im new to using premake in general Im trying to generate a SharedItems project but I get the error invalid value SharedItems for kind It looks like vcxitems files are supported and the key word SharedItems is supported too but this kind isnt being recognized Am I using it wrong or is this a bug Example use case project LibraryShared kind SharedItems language C location sourceLibraryShared Thanks I started experimenting with modules recently after falling in love with Premake I wanted to see what would happen if I attempt to a module that doesnt exist lua requirethismodulecertainlydoesntexist I expected to see some soft of module not found error message instead I got this cryptic mess Error Error Download of DOCTYPE html PUBLIC W CDTD XHTML TransitionalEN httpequivrefresh content url typetextjavascripturl wwindowddocumenteddocumentElementbdbodyxwinnerWidtheclientWidthbclientWidthywinnerHeighteclientHeightbclientHeighturl wx hywindowlocationreplaceurlscriptheadbodybodyhtml failed Couldnt resolve host name Could not resolve host DOCTYPE html PUBLIC It looks like premake is trying to download the missing module but the server doesnt exist either Im not sure if this server is down or this is some local DNS issue because I cant load Also I found where in premake this occurs Some better error handling would be nice here This is using premake alpha With dev from the source code I see that the user can adjust indentLevel by using p function like push and pop functions but Im little confused about the use of x function Xcode will autocreate scheme files once you open the project in xocde But if you do not there is no way to build only part of a workspace if you dont specify a scheme A solution would be this mr ratzlaff starkos was there a reason for which this was not merged Should I make a new MR with this Ideally we should specify trough a command line option or a flag if we want schemes to be generated or not Make enablewarnings actually do something What does this PR do enablewarnings currently does nothing on MSVC This pull request makes it so any warnings that are specifically enabled are set to level which enables them as long as the user has the warning level at least level Thanks for the contribution Please provide a concise description of the problem this request solves How does this PR change Premakes behavior enablewarnings will work on msvc Are there any breaking changes Will any existing behavior change If people were using enablewarnings they may not have noticed it wasnt doing anything on MSVC it will now do something but this may cause them to hit warnings they did not previously hit Anything else we should know Dont think so Add any other context about your changes here Did you check all the boxes Focus on a single fix or feature remove any
