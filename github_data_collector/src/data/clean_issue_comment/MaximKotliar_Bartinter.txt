Added SPM and update Example project Trying to quick scroll for top bounce triggers a false color change Added a video for more context A UIImageView added to top scrollView for the sticky effect Implementation is as in the example without Swizzling The first view controller in my UINavigationController has a transparent UINavigationBar by setting the background image to UIImage with a dark image underneath the status bar is set to lightContent correctly The second view controller sets the UINavigationBar background image to nil and sets the background to light grey in the viewWillAppear lifecycle method but the status bar remains lightContent when it should display as the default black Is this desired behaviour for this module Hi For iOS projets its will be great to make your component Carthage compatible Take a look at these articles Ruthlessly Simple Dependency Management with Carthage Carthage Tutorial Getting Started Making Carthagecompatible Frameworks with Swift Swift Cross Platform Framework section Configure targets for Carthage On your READMEmd add Carthage compatible on top and add section for the installation with Carthage It would be cool if you had an example project showing how Bartinter works
