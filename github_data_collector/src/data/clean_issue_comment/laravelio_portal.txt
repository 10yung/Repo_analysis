 Needs to be updated in profile settings and user registration Atm the notice about an old thread is a little crammed in between the ad and last reply Maybe we can improve this Example I would like to suggest we explore adding additional tags for items such as NovaVaporTelescopePassportFlare and maybe some generics such as JavaScript API just to name a few Atm were still rolling with our own solution before this was natively in Laravel Lets see if we can implement the core functionality for this As a user I should gain experience points when creating threads replying to threads having my solution marked as accepted etc so that I get recognition from the community for my input As a user I should have an easy way to get to the accepted reply so that I can quickly find the most likely solution to my issue Would be cool if we could leverage Algolia to search for threads replies and users I think we qualify for an open source plan since the source code is open source Create a unique index and filter out any duplicates Theres already a wip for this at We can make use of the DB implementation to save notifications Couple this to events and start with the reply notifications We should have a better way of optionally informing people who get banned or have their threads or replies removed This way theyll have a reason and not just see their content disappear We can probably add a textarea field to the delete ban modal for this
