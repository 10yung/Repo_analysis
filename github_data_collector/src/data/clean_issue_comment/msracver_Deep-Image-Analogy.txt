I am currently reading the paper and confused on what is actually considered as an attribute to transfer It lists three things color transfer texture transfer and style transfer In the example image of monalisa and avatar looking at the image A I made the following observation it transferred the color eyes and lips Then why didnt it transfer ears and nose What I understand is it should only transfer color in this set of images Eyes lips ears and nose are individual attributes of that person itself and it shouldnt change Yes it may be able to transfer style ie if B is a photo of girl with tiara headband then it should transfer this style to A producing A But this isnt the case here In short are we actually controlling the attributes to transfer Or the model takes decisions on its own Thank you At first I install protoc but I get an error In file included from buildreleasesrccaffeprotocaffepbcc buildreleasesrccaffeprotocaffepbh error error This file was generated by a newer version of protoc which is error This file was generated by a newer version of protoc which is buildreleasesrccaffeprotocaffepbh error error incompatible with your Protocol Buffer headers Please update error incompatible with your Protocol Buffer headers Please update buildreleasesrccaffeprotocaffepbh error error your headers error your headers In file included from buildreleasesrccaffeprotocaffepbcc buildreleasesrccaffeprotocaffepbh fatal error googleprotobufarenah No such file or directory compilation terminated Makefile recipe for target buildreleasesrccaffeprotocaffepbo failed make buildreleasesrccaffeprotocaffepbo Error Then I install protoc instead but the error still exists I think this is because the protocol compiler protoc and the library header usrincludegoogleprotobuf are inconsistent protoc version libprotoc grep GOOGLEPROTOBUFVERSION usrincludegoogleprotobufstubscommonh define GOOGLEPROTOBUFVERSION I am not the user of root and the protoc is installed at my own dir So anyone could help me solve this problem Thanks Hello What are the minimal requirements for the GPU to run the demo deepimageanalogyexe models democontentpng demostylepng demooutput I have

speed it up Thanks in advance Hello I have been playing around with the prebuilt demo provided and have had some success with it However when I start to increase the weights on certain photos my system will hard crash I have had success with ratios up to around and but then it starts to be more likely that my system will crash I had disabled the TDR which allowed me to run ratios up to around since before I was only able to get it to run around or The system I am using has an x Nvidia M Quadro GPUs so I would imagine that memory should not be an issue but after much debugging I am out of ideas Would there be any additional reason that would cause the crash or any additional settings I could play with Many thanks I have installed caffe before So what can I do to run your demo without install caffe again After I compiled caffe and tested it successfully and then I followed the Configure BuildLinux version While I executing sh scriptsconfigdeepimageanalogysh the error prompt is like

caffe and this project so how should I fix this error Thanks a lot Hi When I run demo file on system single command uses GB My Nvidia card is gtx having GB GPU memrory So I can only run maximum commands at a time in multiple terminals otherwise other wise the usage of GPU exceeds from GB so more command cannot executed I want to execute at least to commands at oncethrough web service So is it possible with this Card Thanks and regards
