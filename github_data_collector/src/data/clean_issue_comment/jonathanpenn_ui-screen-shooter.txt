I have not tested this but there should be a way to control the remote Is it possible to run uiscreenshooter on iPhone device not on simulator my output Running automation script configautomationjs

BUILD SUCCEEDED Running automation script configautomationjs for iPhone Simulator in language enUS Waiting for device to boot instruments Argument UIASCRIPT does not point to a valid script Using script defined in template Instruments Trace Complete Duration s Output tmpscreenshootertracestracetrace find tmpscreenshootertracesRun No such file or directory I have a SpriteKit project which uses texture atlasses Xcode Mavericks These are directories named like Shieldatlas and they contain a few image file When the project is built by Xcode it compiles these directories and the result is a Shieldatlasc in the built app which contains a single png file and a plist file describing the location of the individual textures in the new png file The build log in Xcode shows that this tool is used ApplicationsXcodeappContentsDeveloperToolsusrbinTextureAtlas In the output of the screen shooter script it shows CpResource pathtoShieldatlas tmpscreenshooterappappShieldatlas cd pathtomyproject export PATHmy path environment builtincopy exclude DSStore exclude CVS exclude svn exclude git exclude hg resolvesrcsymlinks pathtoShieldatlas tmpscreenshooterappapp So I assume that somewhere atlas resources must be handled special Is this something which needs to fixed in my project or in uiscreenshooter I do not yet know all the features of Xcode and I may miss some simple setting somewhere which may solve that already There is a problem with the landscape mode The resolution in rect is not exactly etc Sometimes its something like Thus the function rectMaxSizeMatchesPhoneWithMaxDimensionForOrientation returns the wrong value Replacing the old rectMaxSizeMatchesPhoneWithMaxDimensionForOrientation with function rectMaxSizeMatchesPhoneWithMaxDimensionForOrientationrect maxDimension orientation return orientation kPortraitString rectsizeheighttoFixed maxDimension orientation kLandscapeString rectsizewidthtoFixed maxDimension fixes this bug Maybe I dont have something configured correctly but I couldnt get uiscreenshooter to build my app with a Today Extension in it I found a way around it here but I dont think this is the best solution Any suggestions iTunes Connect no longer allows any image with an alpha channel Sips doesnt remove alpha channels something like imagemagick would work Could possibly speed up workflow if put together but who knows Sort of feature request sort of bug I copied capturejs configautomationjs configscreenshotssh uiscreenshootersh unixinstrumentssh To root

DSTROOTbuilddir OBJROOTbuilddir SYMROOTbuilddir GCCPREPROCESSORDEFINITIONSGCCPREPROCESSORDEFINITIONS SCREENSHOTS ONLYACTIVEARCHNO Cant figure out what cause this error With your example all works fine I worked with that amazing script and recognized two things The close sim function does not work Simulator application name is iOS Simulator not iPhone Simulator function closesim I know I know It says iPhone Simulator For some reason thats the only way Applescript can identify it osascript e tell application iOS Simulator to quit I had to delete the app from the simulator to get the new code version in UIAutomation so i reset all simulators before the xcode clean build call by calling my resetallsim function function resetallsim instruments s devices grep Simulator grep o AF AF AF AF AF while read r line do echo Reseting Simulator with UDID line xcrun simctl erase line done Attention If a simulator is running it will not be cleaned I recommend to call closesim before resetallsim to ensure all simulators are getting cleared Doesnt work with cordovaphonegap libCordovaa problem Just created a default project cordova create test cd test cordova platform add ios Running your script
