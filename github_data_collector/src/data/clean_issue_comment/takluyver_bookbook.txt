Is there a way to generate table of content and add to each generate chapter Hi I tried using your bookbook but I am getting error as below could not understand what is going wrong I had simplified my file names as required Any idea why this appear Below is my current directory from where I run the command Thanks for this nice tool Any idea how we could build a word index the same way makeidx does How do I specify a title for the reportarticle produced by bookbook what I autoget is simply Notebook I have to say first that bookbook is great but not without some problems If I try to use bookbook on notebooks where I have used the relatively new cell tags mechanism as in python m bookbooklatex TagRemovePreprocessorremoveinputtagshidecode template arttplx TagRemovePreprocessorremovecelltagshidecell everything breaks and Im told usage latexpy h outputfile OUTPUTFILE pdf template TEMPLATE sourcedir latexpy error unrecognized arguments TagRemovePreprocessorremoveinputtagshidecode TagRemovePreprocessorremovecelltagshidecell Why dont you simply pass to nbconvert the options not understood by bookbook I have made the example of the tags preprocessor but there are many other aspects of nbconvert that are configurable via command line options Thank you gb See for context I believe that the html generator template file could be added as option to the CLI tool but before I do that Id like to have your opinion on the general approach here Is there an easier way to reach the same goal One can use newcommand in a Jupyter notebook to define a macro by putting it inside a math environment eg newcommand bigO mathcal O However the conversion to Latex naturally then puts the newcommand inside a math environment which makes it available only within that set of math delimiters Furthermore in notebooks one must define a given macro again in each notebook that uses it But when these notebooks are combined into a book the resulting tex file should only define each macro once It would be great if bookbook collected all the macros from the set of notebooks and placed them together in the preamble of the tex file without math delimiters around them of course As of PR the labels on Latex cross links look like Chapter or Section How do we let people configure these Command line options Notebook metadata Nbconvert config A separate bookbook config file Custom templates Currently I think notebooks have to match the regex d ipynb eg introductionipynb for everything to work correctly They are sorted lexicographically and then the latex export uses its own numbering so would become while HTML uses the numbers from the filenames Do we want to make the sorting smarter so you can use introduction instead of introduction Do we want to make HTML renumber the sequence like Latex does
