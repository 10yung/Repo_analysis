Is it possible to set contenttype on response I tried ResponseContentType applicationjson or ResponseHeaders contenttype applicationjson thanks This may not be possible but it would be nice if variables could be passed in the WebSchema parameter of NewFlancy PowerShell thing SomeText NewFlancy WebSchema Get thing The only reason I did this was because things like PSScriptRoot dont seem to exist in the scope of those cmd blocks this is super annoying everytime I try to use NewFlancy The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process At C Users dotps Documents WindowsPowerShell Modules flancy flancypsm char flancystart CategoryInfo NotSpecified HttpListenerException FullyQualifiedErrorId HttpListenerException I did only a quick search for examples of setting up NancyFx to achieve something like python simplehttpserver Also can flancy execute a ps on disk I probably missed it in the code Thanks Doug Below wouldnt be too difficult to include Im tempted to dig through the above and see if we can just do it on the powershell side but why reinvent Perhaps ContentPath ContentDir I sort of like Path because it feels more PowerShell However if people feel strongly about this change I dont mind either way Submitted by beatcracker in Repro script StartJob Name Flancy ScriptBlock ImportModule Name Flancy ErrorAction Stop NewFlancy WebSchema Method Get Path Script Hello world WaitJob Name Flancy ReceiveJob Output PS FlancyAsJobps Id Name PSJobTypeName State HasMoreData Location Command Flancy BackgroundJob Running True localhost Exception calling ctor with arguments Unable to resolve type NancyViewEnginesViewEngineApplicationStartup CategoryInfo InvalidOperation NewObject MethodInvocationException FullyQualifiedErrorId ConstructorInvokedThrowExceptionMicrosoftPowerShellCommandsNewObjectCommand PSComputerName localhost You cannot call a method on a nullvalued expression At flancy flancypsm char flancystart CategoryInfo InvalidOperation RuntimeException FullyQualifiedErrorId InvokeMethodOnNull PowerShell version Name Windows PowerShell ISE Host Version InstanceId eac dcbd e a c cb c dbcda UI SystemManagementAutomationInternalHostInternalHostUserInterface CurrentCulture ruRU CurrentUICulture enUS PrivateData MicrosoftPowerShellHostISEISEOptions DebuggerEnabled True IsRunspacePushed False Runspace SystemManagementAutomationRunspacesLocalRunspace This doesnt happen with this version of Flancy This is done Leaving the issue open until it is documented With CTP I was able to get a container started with a flancy server serving pages publicly However a couple of things to note when you use netsh in a container to set http urlacl you see the results in the parent not the container However it does work It also works fine if your admin and just use the public switch There are no errors given in the container Hopefully this is fixed with ctp It makes troubleshooting impossible Need to include or think about routing recipe The internal ips need to be reachable from outside of the host Perhaps the vswitch should be a passthrough and then I can just give it a unique IP Either way this has to be included in the recipedocumentation Need to figure the way to get a script to launch at container launch Right now I am entering a pssession and launching manually Would be nice to just tack on an AsJob parameter so that we can outofproc the Nancy host to make it easier to run subsequent NewFlancy calls It would be super awesome to support OData filtering sorting paging There is a Nancy extension to do it but it creates LINQ queries which might not be onetoone to PowerShell but we might be able to use the OData query parsing capabilities as a starting point The endpoint would just be Pathprocess MethodGet Script GetProcess Then we could do cool stuff like InvokeWebRequest eq PowerShell It would automatically do something like GetProcess Where Name eq PowerShell
