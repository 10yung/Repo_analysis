Love this tool I installed it on my macbook pro and it worked the first time Awesome Thought Id contribute a bit to the readme Already tried it on one of my videos and it cut it down from to and it now sounds great Thats a lot of silence i dont have to edit Hey guys I made some heavy modification to the code so it will be a lot faster Im personally gonna be using it for watching long lecture video in hopes of making them a bit less boring check the README for more info Hello i have a lecture video that have a noise floor of dB can someone help me find the corresponding silent threshold value to set it to I see you have no time but carykh please nominate someone to be a project manager This is an awesome stuff need to be improved and updated Install run instrucions added to Readme Also created an executable please download release from DaWe jumpcutter releases useful if you have more than one ffmpeg version installed or ffmpeg is not available over the PATH variable I have no idea if I need to download anything extra or how to run the python because the instructions in the video give absolutely no explanation on what the heck you need to download to Open it up in the terminal Hi It seems the audio and video get compressed in different rate somehow such that the end the final output the video and audio became outofsync try for example url is basically creating an alternative that might outdo this repo You can add a playlist and all of its videos will be combined in videomp playlist True playlisturl your url btw im a newbie
