 Hi Im trying to develop an App like the one from Ikea the idea is to select some items from a menu and tap where u want to place it I used the Example Scene from ObjectManipulation as starting point The first issue is that the only canvas I can use is Screen SpaceOverlay if I try using any different type it just wont work the Screen Space because its attached to the camera and doesnt follow as it should and in Screen Space Camera becomes D at run I dont know why but it just folds up himself So the st problem is that I cant stop the FrameRaycast from PawnManipulator Ive tried using EventSystemcurrentIsPointerOverGameObject with a return but it doesnt read the touch because its reading the gestures and if I try to control it with touchCount and phase then it doesnt pass through and the only thing working is the canvas So how can I stop the Raycast at UI By the way the tour of object manipulation at ARCore developer is obsolete Another question is that I dont find any Gesture control is it in the ManipulationSystemcs Update I mean are those calls to the specific gestures the ones in which the logic edition should be done Thanks a lot VERSIONS USED Unity f ARCore SDK for

morning Im creating an AR app using augmented images I want to be able for the user to add images as targets either by taking a picture or selecting a photo from the gallery This is done and working fine My issue is that I want to provide feedback to the user of the quality of the target value from to and by adding the image at runtime the quality property is set to an empty string But when we add a new image to the augmented images database on the editor the quality property is set by calling running a shell command one of the executable files depending on the OS on the folder GoogleARCoreCLI like this augmentedimagecliwinexe evalimg inputimagepath Resources Targets jpg My question is Is there a way to get the quality value of the image on the android device Or is the source code for the augmentedimagecliwinexe file or one of the others available somewhere so I can replicate the evalimg function If not it is possible to provide opensource the source code for those executables VERSIONS USED Unity f ARCore SDK for Unity Device manufacturer model and OS Samsung A ARCore On Windows use adb shell pm dump comgooglearcore findstr i packages versionName On macOS use

new app with Unity and ARCore but even in older app made with Unity and ARCore that used to run fine now has this weird symptom The camera background shakes around even with the phone standing still The augmented gameobject seems to stay still though The only thing that changes should be the ARCore components that get autoupdated from google play My phone is Xiaomi mi Anyone having this issue too
