The project has a very cushy rating but it doesnt seem like theres anywhere I can go to see the list of features Theres a wiki and FAQ but theres really nothing there other than a cautionary warning about the checkin feature being very broken Could use some help I tried to install using Vagrant but I am getting errors default Processing triggers for libcbin ubuntu default npm install g yarn default tmpvagrantshell line npm command not found The SSH command responded with a nonzero exit status Vagrant assumes that this means the command failed The output for this command should be in the log above Please read the output to determine what went wrong I fixed the problem by modify vagrantfile and make install suecessed but I still get error that bixed in in e b Webpacker cant find applicationjs in vagrantpublicpacksmanifestjson Possible causes You want to set webpackeryml value of compile to true for your environment unless you are using the webpack w or the webpackdevserver webpack has not yet rerun to reflect updates You have misconfigured Webpackers configwebpackeryml file Your webpack configuration is not creating a manifest Your manifest contains post We have a family with an apostrophe in their name they show up correctly on the site but in the printed directory they appear with the HTML entity inside their last name like O Neal Image attached showing what it looks like img width altapostrophe bug src people are in no households by default admins can add a person to a household people can exist in more than one household a household can have more than one address It is possible to specify one or more roles for a group membership eg leader student etc These are just simple strings Currently the only way to set these strings is via importsync and there is no way to view them in the UI yet Roles were added to meet a need of our pilot churchs checkin software and never fully exposed Would like to have email message send htmltext When using checkin feature with no label set it displays a Print Tags button and errors saying LabelWriter can not be found It would be great if no label was set if this button could read just Checkin and not check for connected printer smile
