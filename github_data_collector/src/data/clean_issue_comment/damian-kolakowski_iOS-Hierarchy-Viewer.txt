On our app connecting the browser to view the hierarchy significantly messes up the layout on iOS and I did not notice the problem on iOS We make extensive use of autolayout in the app This was on an iPad Attached are screen shots one before attaching the browser and one after This is using iOS Hierarchy Viewer ver before after addObserver UIApplicationDidFinishLaunchingNotification auto startso dont need iOSHierarchyViewer start at applicationDidBecomeActive A few of the similar commercial tools allow you to rotate the visual representation around to show depth helping you understand how your views overlap I think this could be a handy feature for this project too and would help give the impression that its a viable alternative I havent looked into your codebase extensively but I was thinking of giving this a shot with CSS if you thought it was a good idea Let me know a I added this via CocoaPods to my project and Im able to bring up the iOS Hierarchy Viewer in my browser but there is no data You need to put better instructions on how this works and what we should expect to see There is mention of an instructions section but it is nowhere to be found I assume its the readme but that is inadequate I want to like this project but you need to improve the documentation first Added automatic start of iOSHierarchyViewer via class HVAutostarter Now yu dont need to change your project code Just add libiOSHierarchyViewerfata to project It automagically finds NSManagedObjectContext object which has to be AppDelegate property or uses obtain from MagicalRecord On building my project I got this error Undefined symbols for architecture i OBJCCLASSNSAttributeDescription referenced from objcclassref in HVCoreDataHandlero OBJCCLASSNSEntityDescription referenced from objcclassref in HVCoreDataHandlero OBJCCLASSNSFetchRequest referenced from objcclassref in HVCoreDataHandlero OBJCCLASSNSRelationshipDescription referenced from objcclassref in HVCoreDataHandlero ld symbols not found for architecture i clang error linker command failed with exit code use v to see invocation A stack overflow post pointed out that its because CoreData framework needs to be added This should probably be mentioned in the installation notes Awesome tool Guys thanks for creating this I just have one question regarding foreign keys Lets assume we have two tables State and City There is One to Many relationship between State and City State City State can have zero or more cities City can belong to exactly one State If we look at State table there will be columns stateId stateName cities however cities field will be empty even though state has cities But that is not a problem Problem is this In City table there are columns cityId cityName state Even though city is connected to a state state field is empty Is there a way to see stateId or something similar in that field I get a crash when I first load the viewer in my browser Hierarchy Viewer REQUEST HTTP INIT

flags I actually did ObjC forceload pathtoliba which should do the same thing Removed a library that had JSONKitm Running on iPad Simulator Mac OS X XCode llvm This is a fairly large project with a great deal of static libraries so if this is not an obvious crash I can try chopping thing off the project to see if it works It would be great if releases were tagged that way I could try to debug this without having to build the library myself Am I missing something or is this a bug Basically this works perfectly if I dont touch the orientation of my simulator If I do rotate to landscape then it appears that no views that are subviews of the root view of the UIWindow will be transformed in the web viewer as evidenced by the image below Note the yellow it is highlighting is basically the identity transform of the segmented control I can provide sample code if needed but I assume this is self explanatory
