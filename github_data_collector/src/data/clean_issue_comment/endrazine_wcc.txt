Thanks for your work on wcc Id been looking for an excuse to try it out and had the opportunity to use it recently Hit a couple of issues along the way so thought Id mention them The app I was investigating was C based but I discovered that the wsh C symbol demangling functionality appears to have been disabled at some point My current understanding is Symbols are actually demangled here But the code that does anything with the demangled symbol has been commented out here which was added already commented out in In addition the code that prints out the demangled symbol seems to have always been commented out here here Unsure if this is in any way related to It would be useful to have accessvisibility into the demangled symbols so hopefully this information will give someone maybe me D a starting point to enabling this Funny story So the app I was poking around in was KiCadthe FLOSS electronic design softwarewhich is implemented via the wxWidgets framework Currently theres no way to automate the schematicrelated functionality so I wondered if wcc might help provide a way to do so Only to eventually discover that KiCad currently implements its core functionality as a somewhat nonstandard shared library already D Although given how its implemented using the functionality still seems like a nontrivial task Running wsh on binaries with nonalphanumeric symbols eg the mangled ones produced by rustc results in output like ERROR Wsh internal lua initialization Synthax Error Wsh internal lua buffer expected near which refers to this line in the generated lua function ZN core num LTimplu coreconvertTryFromLTi GTu foru u GT tryfrom h e dfa E a b c d e f g h jk libcallreflectZN core num LTimplu coreconvertTryFromLTi GTu foru u GT tryfrom h e dfa E a b c d e f g h return j k end It might be nice to support demangling though that may complicate parsing angle brackets parentheses and colons would be valid in symbol names in any event it would be nice for these symbols to not prevent wsh from running I did cleaned it up and ended up with these commits only
