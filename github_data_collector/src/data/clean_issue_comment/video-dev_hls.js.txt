 This PR will make computeLivePosition to have a minimum value of mediacurrentTime and will prevent seeking in case liveSyncPosition mediacurrentTime Why is this Pull Request needed hlsjs seeks backwards during live streaming Are there any points in the code the reviewer needs to double check we could just add the liveSyncPosition mediacurrentTime condition without touching computeLivePosition function but I think this is more correct that way Resolves issues Checklist x changes have been done against master branch and PR does not conflict x new unit functional tests

seek to video so far and video has about video segments see screenshot img width altsegmentissue src And It fails url is attached Ive consoled attached event from hlsjs but then nothing can happen

For some special reasons need to synchronize with something can I get PTS in real time If so can you give me some advice on how to modify it Hi guys Need help I tried using this api using the code below My problem was that the ts segments loaded by this api are the old ts segments I have ffmpeg running and updating those ts segments How can I add cache breaker on ts segments Page Code if

Analytics integration On the documentation page it says Builtin Analytics but Im not quite sure how to access these metrics Im assuming I would need to use Google Events tracking If anyone has an example it would be very helpful Im looking mainly to tracking the video name or url and the amount of video that was matching Thank you This PR will Convert mp generator to TypeScript Why is this
