 In kaminari they removed method deprecated numpages in favor of totalpages Issue Is it planned to add support for rails Hi a new version of Kaminari was released recently and looks like something is broken now pagination section is missing kaminarispecrb fails now Hi can someone add support for Rollbar Thanks The latest commit on the master branch is dated September while the latest commit on the rewrite branch is dated December I hate to be that guy but is RocketPants still being maintained Im not using it much anymore but I still have some projects that depend on it and Id love to know what the future of this gem is Much heart either way NOTE Hence Rails expects locale path as RailsPathsPath So we should be using configi nloadpath to load locale files Is it ok to use RokectPants with the project generated by railsapi new I also wonder even if I can use it with railsapi it might not be a good idea needs a lot of tweaks Made a few changes to make RocketPants support Rails Hello I can see that rocketpants returns a json object which is built from modelerrors Is there any way to also include response of modelerrorsfullmessages in the same response Thanks in advance
