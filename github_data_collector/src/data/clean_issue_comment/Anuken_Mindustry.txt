Platform Android Build Issue I was trying out mods for the first time starting about a week ago using Modustry Modpack by ZoMadeStuff which is fun and generally worked great Eventually I ran into an issue where when I would discover a new materialitem that was not launchable in the core it failed to register that I had discovered the material this meant that it didnt show up in the item list but more importantly it meant that the item cant be sorted or emptied Steps to reproduce This first occurred on the Evosaki Islands map after I built a deep digger which produced the the problem with raw ore and other items This nonrecognition problem was repeated with gold powder and the various oil bottles nonlaunchable raw reverie crystals were recognized as was the launchable pure gold and plastic discovered later This was repeated on different maps the craters and goldsand valley after un and reinstalled the mod and with the oil barrels using only What Pizzas Production mod It can be noted that in custom game mode the unrecognized items are part of the full complement of items and can be properly sorted this issue only seems to occur in campaign mode Platform Linux with wayland Build Issue arcbackendsdlSDLError wayland not available at arcbackendsdlSdlApplicationcheckSdlApplicationjava at arcbackendsdlSdlApplicationinitSdlApplicationjava at arcbackendsdlSdlApplicationinitSdlApplicationjava at mindustrydesktopDesktopLaunchermainDesktopLauncherjava See for more info Steps to reproduce Have wayland Run Mindustry not foolproof will not show for existing blocks idk how See video of it just a note for mods without color in their displayNames default is accent as to differentiate between item name and mod name Conduits and conveyors identify the content and show up the color the orange cells on batteries now change from black to orange depending on their buffered power power stored I was originally using powermaxPower but anuke told me to use powerstatus which is a float that contains the current amount of power given compared to the required now lights have two sprites batterypng which is the base where the cells are the standard mindustry dark dark grey and batterylightspng which is a white outline of the cells for the alpha shader this took so long because of git and conflicting files problems edit pics Screenshot in the preview the batteries seem pretty dark i dont know whether or not it is github preview shading weirdly or the sprite packer compressing it but here are the sprites when i inserted them Screenshot It is complete right now please merge The changelogs are being worked but the big features are translated I didnt update all these yet but edited some I have to sleep nowyawn
