 update update update I want to be on top when the game is full screenBut it doesnt work help me Dear author will this software be updated A new version is very much needed Fix localization errors Hi I forked your repo and added the latest changes Added Hextech origin and champions Added Pantheon to DragonGuardian Updated items and class origins with the latest patch changes to the ItemStringsenUSxaml descriptions Code builds adjusted some of the row sizes so that the text would all fit This is maybe a bit of a cornercase but I play on a k screen and since Leagues cursors dont get that big I use the giant Windows mouse cursors and YoloMouse get them huge ingame so I cant lose my cursor However because of those in the TFT overlay it can end up covering half of the tooltips like this Camera picture because my screenshots dont include the mouse signalattachment So I would like to ask would it be possible to have the tooltips show up in the topright instead of the bottomright of the mouse position If its not a high enough priority I might try to take a look at the code later but I hardly know any C so I dont expect to get too far
