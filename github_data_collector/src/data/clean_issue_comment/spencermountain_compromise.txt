 Issue Capture Issue Capture Felt a little too easynot sure I trust it the export load pathway has a major issue since v any sentence with a contraction Im theyre etc will be mistagged once its loaded with load It is not recommended to use export until v is released ETA next week If you are not using export you do not have a problem Apologies to any earlyadopters of export Existing documents will need to be reparsed Im happy to help with any mitigations of this issue Hi there I remember there was once an issue about gerunds not being tagged as nouns Now theyre sometimes falsely tagged as nouns Screenshot As far as I have noticed if gerunds are followed by either a Copula or modal theyre tagged as nouns There might be other patterns too Ill add them later if I find any Quick one since were all ready for the holidays Happy to go into more detail when people are free Capture groups seem to capture everything BEFORE your target if using or Using OR NounVerb works fine Quick console example nlpJohn always ravenously eats his gluematchjohn eatstagtestdebug John MaleName FirstName Person ProperNoun Singular Noun TitleCase Test always Adverb Test ravenously Adverb Test eats PresentTense Verb Test nlpJohn always ravenously eats his gluematchjohn eatstagtestdebug John MaleName FirstName Person ProperNoun Singular Noun TitleCase Test always Adverb Test ravenously Adverb Test eats PresentTense Verb Test nlpJohn always ravenously eats his gluematchjohn Adverb eatstagtestdebug always Adverb Test ravenously Adverb Test nlpJohn always ravenously eats his gluematchjohn NounAdverb eatstagtestdebug always Adverb Test ravenously Adverb Test Last two examples are correct and expected behaviour of the first Names dont seem to be recognized as ProperNoun if they are the first word in the entire sample text However the same names are properly tagged as ProperNoun when in any other position in text even if they open a sentence if its not a first sentence in text Example names nlpViktor ate a sanchwich I looked at Viktor carefully Viktor seemed uncomfortable namesdebug Hi saw this in the readme dependency parsing Proper sentence transformation requires understanding the syntax tree of a sentence which we dont currently do We should Help wanted with this I looked for about minutes for an issue related to this and didnt find one So please excuse me if I missed it and there is a better place to be placing this I was curious if anything has been done in with this front and if not my thoughts were that this topic can be the beginning of a discussion related to this After the final compromiseminjs update v the function nlpplugin doesnt work Eg let plugin tags Noun isA Entity Verb isA Action nlppluginplugin Such simple code and it doesnt seem to work so far Had to roll back to at least to not experience any difficulties Any idea Btw you had an awesome project description a month ago What happened to it nlpI love apples Yes I domatchapplesreplaceWithpeachesallouttext returns I love peachesYes I do It would ideally output I love peaches Yes I do compomise version A semicolon ends a complete sentence and should be treated like a period when tagging Heres my surprising finding replicated on Observable Screen Shot at PM The match above is surprising because mine starts a new syntactically complete sentence It is not syntactically involved with the word his I expected there to be no matches If I change the semicolon to a period the behavior is exactly as I expect Screen Shot at PM Im trying to use a match pattern where the verb is is incorrectly matched as a noun Screenshot from Observable Screen Shot at PM This is related to my other issue
