Hi On Rainglow v BOX Uk theme contrast and noncontrast versions selected elements are poorly highlighted The same goes for light versions of the same theme I suggest some contrast color be used for better visibility Thanks Being a colorblind person myself I like the Vision Colorblind theme except some colors are still hard to read for people who have Protanopia Protanopes are more likely to confuse Black with many shades of red Dark brown with dark green dark orange and dark red Some blues with some reds purples and dark pinks Midgreens with some oranges See source This PR adds the Vision colorblind protanopia theme using the Vision Colorblind theme as a base Here is an example screenshot below img width altprotanopia src I appreciated the message from Dayle in the opening of this PR Rainglow has an extensive build process and so any changes to the themes in this repository will be overwritten upon next build Please let me know what I can do to get this theme published I think it would be a wonderful aid for Protanopes like my self Love love love Rainglow Thank you for putting it together I have a Feature Request to Add code tick syntax highlighting to markdown md files Deets Visual Studio Code for Windows v as of this writing Rainglow v Theme Joker all Have you tested the issue with other themes Yes works with Monokai but for the most part not any of the Rainglow themes Example Without Syntax Hightlighting joker and most themes Rainglownocodetickhighlighting Example With Syntax Hightlighting monokai themes Monokaiwithcodetickhighlighting Thanks JeFF Most themes have bright contrasting status bars I tend to prefer themes with dark status bars or that blend in with the editor background color VSCode Arstotzka or Arstotzka contrast Rainglow v IMO this is a little hard to read Maybe use b Im using the latest version of everything And I like the light themes very much especial the ones that are kinda dark not too bright and not to dark like peacocks in space tron storm light etc But there is a problem with the fonts color The dark versions of those have a font color that fits more is more recognizable So please make the font colors for light themes more suitable for the theme Or tell us where we can do some changes manually like string color operators classes methods numbers etc Otherwise keep up the great work Thank you Whats the fontfamily used on screenshot Editor vscode Theme Tetra Version Secondary buttons are not very readable By updating the buttonforeground property to it greatly improves the readability Sample Codepen with both buttons here Thanks for your awesome work on Rainglow Dayle Just wanted to report that the Tron theme is rendering unreadable buttons white text on top of a white background as shown on the screenshot below The buttonbackground property here buttonbackgroundffffff buttonforegroundffffff should actually be buttonbackground fb buttonforegroundffffff tron buttons For some reason Overflow Light theme is missing the commenting color Any chance you can add that All else looks fantastic screen shot at am This fixes it pretty much name Comment scope comment settings foreground aaaaaa
