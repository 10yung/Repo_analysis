The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

forever if theres an error in the DO calls On mobile when you click the create server button the UI freezes I believe the key generation is CPU intensive and happens in the UI thread We may need to run it on a Web Worker In the last step of the cloud launcher we should present a link that the user can click and add the server in case they ran the launcher on their mobile browser Its hard to add the server otherwise In the last step of the cloud launcher we should present a QR code so the user can add the server from their phone if the launcher is run on desktop Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend When I open uproxyorginvite urls on my Nexus I dont get the menu to pick uProxy as the app Same is happening now with my dev phone In fact this stopped working before and then it started working again and now its not working anymore Im not sure why This may helpmaking the url interception more robust Discussed with Ben Vinicius and Cassidy If the user DOES NOT have the uProxy app installed the majority of cases the link that we will ask them to click through will take them to the Play Store and the server will be automagically added to the app by virtue of the referrer data passed along to the Play Store If the user DOES have the app installed we need a way for the user to add the server to it The link mentioned above will not work because they already have the app Right now the app doesnt have a way to add servers to itself Its on those instances that we would like to have a link that actually does the magic of adding the server to the app Phase Support users who are on mobile devices We want the access code to be coded on a uproxy prefix so that hopefully it will not be opened by the browser and will instead be managed by the uProxy app This covers users receiving the invite code through instant messaging applications SMS or email provided they open the email on their mobile device We will message users that they can only open this link when on their mobile devices Phase Support users who are on desktop For them the uproxy link will clearly not work Instead for those users we we want to display a QR code QR codes will entice the user to grab the phone and point it towards the computer The QR code will translate into the uproxy url mentioned above but since at that point it will be opened on the mobile device with the app that will work Sidenote on Phase Right now given the length of the invite link generating a QR code for it means having a rather large and detailed image Prior to launching a QR code approach we will probably want to have worked on shortening the invite links
