Dependent upon Serf is able to discover nodes using mDNS It is worth mentioning that in documentation at least at How does Gossip work in SWIM or Lifeguard Just for transmission And where is the relevant source code Thank you for your reply I have compiled successfully on windows linux arm machines I found an error when go build serf on arm machine bash githubcomhashicorpgonetipv rootgopkgmodgithubcomhashicorpgonetv ipv sockoptasmreqnunixgo undefined getsockopt rootgopkgmodgithubcomhashicorpgonetv ipv sockoptasmreqnunixgo undefined setsockopt rootgopkgmodgithubcomhashicorpgonetv ipv sockoptunixgo undefined getsockopt rootgopkgmodgithubcomhashicorpgonetv ipv sockoptunixgo undefined setsockopt githubcomhashicorpgonetipv rootgopkgmodgithubcomhashicorpgonetv ipv sockoptrfc unixgo undefined setsockopt rootgopkgmodgithubcomhashicorpgonetv ipv sockoptrfc unixgo undefined setsockopt rootgopkgmodgithubcomhashicorpgonetv ipv sockoptrfc unixgo undefined getsockopt rootgopkgmodgithubcomhashicorpgonetv ipv sockoptrfc unixgo undefined getsockopt rootgopkgmodgithubcomhashicorpgonetv ipv sockoptrfc unixgo undefined setsockopt But I do it successful after switched the package hashicorpmdns version from to in gomod cmdserfversiongo is left unchanged since and serf version returns Serf v even with the latest source code This will be fixed by a small patch but I cant make it because I dont know whether the next version is or or Automation would be a better solution removed on because grammer Hi I just did some speed tests With client and server on the same Serf process everythings well and Serf immediately forwards the message However when a cluster is involved the initial Serf process waits at least msec before forwarding the message Thats way too long for my use case Thus a why is there a delay in the first place b can I turn it off For serf encryptiondecryption using keyring file Lets have we have Node Node Node with primary key k Now Node goes downIn the meantimeNode did keygeninstalluse operations So Node Node are with K Primary keyK Secondary keyNow Node comes up Node is unable to decrypt the messages coming from Node Node and he is creating a new cluster How can we solve it How do we say serf supports one key can encrypt a message but many keys can decrypt a message Serf version
