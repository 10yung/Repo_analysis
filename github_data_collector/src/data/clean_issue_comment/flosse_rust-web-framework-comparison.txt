Hi This PR is a maintainance one x Remove since not relevant anymore x Change webframeworks link informationsource Im the maintainor of this project informationsource Regards The link to the rustwebapp demo is broken the owner seems to have closed their GH account This seems to be a fork of that project though Just noting some new ones down I came across already included Benchmarks can be easily done with the examples that they included in the project source itself For most of the frameworks we could just use except a few weird crates that name it differently such as helloworld or hello git clone giturl cd giturl cargo run example helloworld release And then on another terminal wrk If we could we could bump each repository and let them have a standard name helloworld with a standard port to simplifies things in the future What I learned from benchmarking different frameworks I am surprised that actixweb was the fastest even when lower level frameworks hyper tokiotinyhttp tokiominihttp is included and does not have routing By the way it would be great if this was included in Probably we should add this note for Rocket rustup run nightly cargo run examples helloworld
