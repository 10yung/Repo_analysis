Hello thank you very much for your great tool I have a few questions for you if If may Is it posisble de connect to differents engagement at the same time with PoshC Is it possible to restrict each engagement agents to allowed team collaborator In this way we wouldnt have an unauthorized team collaborator on an engagement Sorry if the question has already bee asked or if theres already an answer about it or if you cant merely figure out what I mean Regards Shift pedro paulo Discord Shift Shift pedro paulo Discord Shift pedro paulo Discord Shift Shift pedro paulo Discord Shift pedro paulo Discord Shift Shift pedro paulo Discord Shift pedro paulo Discord Shift Shift pedro paulo Discord Shift pedro paulo Discord Shift Shift pedro paulo Discord Shift pedro paulo Discord Shift Shift pedro paulo Discord Shift pedro paulo Discord Shift Shift pedro paulo Discord pedro paulo Discord c pedro paulo Discord pedro paulo Discord pedro paulo Discord pedro paulo Discord f pedro paulo Discord pedro paulo Discord Rigth before its supost to be a B Shiftb char Hi everyone Is a feature like port forwarding local remote available Currently when updating if you get an error its because githubcom now enforces tls and this is not setup by default Try reinstalling as this has the update I was testing PoshC against various proxies and one of them had a bug that prevented webclient requests through the proxy After some internet searches I discovered and tested that the issue could be solved by setting a registry key But this required administrator privileges However using IE Com objects is much easier and managed to hack together a script that calls PoshC with IE com objects As long as IE can reach the internet proxy becomes a nonissue I also find it to be a useful evasion technique I would love to contribute a PoC in the coming weeks if that is ok with you Would like to get your thoughts on this Thank you When using shellcode or reflective DLL domain fronting doesnt work in CLR v Create a CScript variant on DotNetToJS There is currently a poshjs that just needs to be hosted Create an advanced options menu that allows you to configure various preset environment detection checks before the code executes This will be implemented as an advanced feature
