billion downloads its v release saw massive adoption The year was also one of collaboration as discussions began on merging Lodash Underscore Much of Lodash v is proofing out the ideas from those discussions Lodash v would not be possible without the collaboration contributions of the Underscore core team In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with several members contributing to both libraries For lodash v we wanted to cut loose push forward take things up a notch Modern only With v we re breaking free from old projects old environments dropping old IE support kB Core Lodash s kitchensink size will continue to grow as new methods functionality are added However we now offer a kB gzipped core build that s compatible with Backbone v for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink More ES We ve continued to embrace ES with methods like isSymbol added support for cloning comparing array buffers maps sets symbols converting iterators to arrays iterable In addition we ve published an esbuild pulled babelpluginlodash into core to make treeshaking a breeze More Modular Pop quiz What category path does the bindAll method belong to Is it A

Low Prototype Pollution Package lodash Patched in Dependency of minimongo Path minimongo lodash More info found vulnerabilities low high in scanned packages vulnerabilities require manual review See the full report for details Common feature with lessthansimple workarounds I want to use Minimongo Exposing remoteURL and connectionID on the client seems to be a security problem So its hard to use it as a security issue Has anyone solved RemoteDB security problems I want you to let me know if you have a good idea Use cargo to accumulate ops to pass to heavyweight collections I believe it should be included My business requirements specifies that my mongo docs should be displayed sorted and paged in a table where their sort order ignores their case Unfortunately sorting while ignoring case is not supported using the current Mongo publication interface So currently my publication must request the complete collection unsorted and I must sort the docs locally then determine which docs I can display for the page I am doing that I copy the whole unsorted minimongo collection into a reactive array using observe then sort then display the correct portion of that instead and it works but its unfortunately that I am required to publish the complete collection in order to determine which subset of docs to display I only display docs per page its also unfortunate that I lose the nice blaze feature that a single doc update only causes the matching displayed doc to be refreshed Currently because I am sorting using a reactive array any displayed doc change causes all my displayed docs to be redisplayed Am I missing something Is there any way I can hook into mongominimongo to specify my more specific publication request and is there any way I can write something that supports blazes singledoc display optimization but when using arrays of docs instead of a collection As my number of docs in my collection increases this is becoming more and more critical Any suggestions would be handy THX
