I have tried to run example but ended up with issues like Uncaught ReferenceError angular is not defined It looks like a lot of packages were deprecated and made generatorangular outdatednot working state Any updates on getting it fixedupdated There is app folder that has the application content If I register serviceworker in app folder I cannot cache bower components and then app does not work offline If I register service worker outside of app folder indexhtml which is in app folder is never able to find path of servieworkerjs which is outside of app folder in the root directory I have tried this in indexhtml if serviceWorker in navigator navigatorserviceWorker register serviceworkerjs scope then function consolelogCongratulationsService Worker Registered catch function err consolelogAagh Some kind of Error err else consolelogSW NOT SUPPORTED still not supported But I only get I have also tried using absolute path ie register serviceworkerjs scope I am getting an error while refreshing the current page And the error is page not found img width altcapture src Anyone please refer my issueThank You GET netERRCONNECTIONREFUSED I only get this error while grunt servedist but grunt serve work fine Any ideas why this might be happening I am not sure if the issue is caused specifically by generatorangular but given the userbase of it I think it is fair to post an issue here The produced source maps are invalid according to and to support team at Sentry Sources property in the source map is incorrect sources tmpconcatscriptsvendorjs After manual fix reports another problem SourceMap thinks that line of scriptsc f js is a thing but its not Your sourcemap is referencing a line that does not exist In order to reproduce just pass an option to create source maps to uglify uglify generated options sourceMap true I would like to know if anyone has already stopped using Bower for using just NPM If yes have you updated Gruntfile for minified etc Thanks use strict

with the proper path to bowercomponents In addition the server middleware was also not configured to use bowercomponents so even if users add the script tags to packages in bowercomponents manually the server would return not found to the browser requests A final problem addressed in this pull request is that the watch task was not monitoring indexhtml so the browser was not refreshing when that was changed The consequence of these problems is when running gulp serve the user is met with a page that has no css and no js libraries After Fixed wiredep directory to proper location outside of the app folder Started watching indexhtml via pathsviewsmain Added bowercomponent as a resource for the server middleware Hi everyone I am new to AngularJS and I love coding with it but I got some issue regarding on angular routes when it is being refresh it gives me an error I am using apache Heres my code var app angularmoduleCVSRRC ngMaterialngRoute appcontrollerCVSRRCCTRL functionscope http some

just fine I then run grunt serve the web server is started normally but the routing doesnt work I click on about and nothing happens but the controller and the view are there I get to the indexhtml and notice that the links are wrong It is just lia nghrefaboutAboutali When I click nothing happens Adding a after the it works just fine Im not the biggest expert in angularjs around in fact testing this generator for study purposes so there is indeed this issue or am I missing something
