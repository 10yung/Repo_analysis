Hello I downloaded your revised annotation of full AFLW from However I couldnt find the AFLWfrontal dataset with images Could you please help me with the problem Thank you Unconstrained Face Alignment via Cascaded Compositional Learning cfss Unconstrained cc Hi In the test mode of singe threading there is no error when i run the inferenceCFSS Because my version is b I replace if m matlabpoolsize with if m isemptygcpnocreate for using multithreading and turn on multithreading by parpool in the fileinferenceCFSSm The error as follows Thank you The result of the arrayfun with the imtransform call in transImagesFwdm lines causes problem when called withimages of much lower dimensions than the new row col data Specifically it fails to specify the spatial locations x y appropriately and thus the program crashes on the extraction of the windows before the vlhog I propose initially a check for the image size and then a version with imwarp since as mentioned here it is faster and more efficient Therefore all the lines where you check matlabpoolsize throw an exception This can be fixed by replacing them with isemptygcpnocreate However Im not sure if that call works on older versions of Matlab If someone confirms this still works then I can make a PR to fix this
