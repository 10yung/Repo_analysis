 Added info for Touraine Tech It will be great if the page also shows a label Calling volunteers this way everybody can know when an event is looking for volunteers A great conference needs a great staff Volunteering at a conference its an inexpensive way to have access to the conferences and having the opportunity to meet a bunch of great developers It would be great if there is any functionality to add events to the google calender specially for people using android devices as google calender can sync on every device ie mobile devices tablets etc considering option of iCalender is already given that can help ios users hence a better track of confrences can be taken place Hello please excuse the issue but it seemed the best way to get in touch Just close this if you dont care and Ill get the hint I work on Open Source software specially for what your doing namely a calendar that the community works together on It lets many people edit the calendar safely and has all kinds of Open Data feeds including for when data changed Honestly the CFP deadlines is not something we have an easy way to hook up but is something that would be an interesting challenge to look into But apart from that I hope youll find this pretty good Anyway the software is at and its used mainly in the UK to run this calendar of Tech Events Hope this is of interest and happy to answer questions Thanks James Can you guys do that
