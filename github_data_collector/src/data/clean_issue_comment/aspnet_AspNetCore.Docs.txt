comments INCLUDE includesMTcommentsmd Documentation is badly incomplete surrounding the saving of the value of the dropdown in that so it can remember When you create the SelectLanguagePartialcshtml and place it in your layout file it changes the language and the cookie is created However once you navigate off the page it does not remember the cookie value in the dropdown and reverts back to default Language and not the chosen culture also most language selectors would display the countries flag and feel that the documentation should be set up to show how to do that as well

Login RickAnderson Microsoft Alias riande Can we make an article about using EF with serverside Blazor in the same way we have one for Razor pages I wrote a comment and a sample on the pattern to follow here The main points are Showcase how to do CRUD Use OwningComponentBase to isolate the usage of the context to the component it is being used in Explain that if you use the context directly the context is shared among components which might cause multiple queries to start at the same time and that is something that Entity Framework doesnt support I know this was discussed already but I cant see clear picture with browser versions support which makes using or starting using Blazor kinda risky How would we know that Blazor server would work for example if some people use like kinda outdated version of FirefixChrome due to them sitting in Windows and not knowing how to update their browser happened several time not with Blazor but overall in some projects some people dont event understand that they should update their browser and sometimes their corporate laptops are just the way they are I mean it would be very helpful info like Blazor Server Firefox previous need polyfills add them when needed Maybe even basic info about blazor server like core blazor is transpilednot transpiled so your browsers should have at least es support or something like this Reference to pull
