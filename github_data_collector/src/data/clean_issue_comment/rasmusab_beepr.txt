 echos a duplicate portion of the soundbite after its finished playing called from console in RStudio echosfunction calls beeprbeep beeprbeep beeprbeep beeprbeep Hi rasmusab I added the easy sound to your package We love to push the easy Button in our office and it would be cool to do this when finishing long running tasks using beepr Cheers Christoph It could be convenient to be able to call beepsound as a noop ie such that it returns immediately if sound or sound none Based on the code from the package Im working on catchr I think Ive written beeponwarning in such a way that it doesnt haltrestart the process its wrapping when it plays the sound Additionally Ive written a function beeponcondition which is a generalized version of both beeponwarning and beeponerror You can wrap an expression and supply a named list as a parameter which lets you decide which sounds each different condition triggers Tell me if this doesnt solve the issue that you mention in beeponerror If it works please attribute me A recent tweet increased attention to the package In the discussion someone suggested that we really need the sad trombone sound as part of the package This change adds sad trombone using a public domain file Not sure if you re accepting new sounds to the beepr package but I thought it would be fun to try The sounds worked on my machine but this is the first real pull request I ve made so there might be other compatibility issues This is based on the twitter thread from yesterday
