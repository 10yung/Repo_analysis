a Security The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

bootstraps jest to use my tsjest based config However trying the Debug codelens on a specific test results in the extension running C Program Files nodejs nodeexe inspectbrk nodemodules jest bin jestjs runInBand someservicespects testNamePattern should ret urn results for free text search Which does not include anything related to my tsjest config thus jest complains about unexpected tokens

when the test fails and this works nice Lately Ive been writing a lot of tests and some of them were green although they werent supposed to be It would be great if the debug button was there when the test was successful As a workaround i just add a fail and wait until the test fails then i can debug it Screenshots The debug button is missing but i can understand why The debug button that i mean Similar to Visual Studio Live Testing feature where each line of code provides red green status Green if line is covered by a passing test and red if a test covering this line currently fails Also when user clicks red mark they can go to failing tests I would like to champion this feature but would love some feedback from maintainers Do you see any problems with this feature that may prevent you from accepting it Also if possible who can I talk to discuss best approach to enhance coverage data ie which test is covering which line Environment node v fill npm v fill npm ls jest or npm ls

context that gets spawned Looking at vscode docs it seems that this should be honoured terminalintegratedautomationShellosx usrlocalCellarfish binfish but it doesnt seem to be However I have npm and node binaries in my path for all shells bash zsh and fish so probably not the root issue I remember I had problems with MacOS and env in atomvscoce a few years back but I think it has been smooth for quite some time now I also do start vscode from command line So it should inherit env no I use nvm and Ive tried running with npm test nvm use npm test nodemodulesbinjest Nothing works No binaries are
