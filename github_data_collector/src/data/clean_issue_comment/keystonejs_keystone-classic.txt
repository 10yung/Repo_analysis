 Description of changes Enhances the Save button on the admin UI to act as a loading indicator while Relationship fields are populated and prevents the user from saving the model until all Relationship fields have completed loading Related issues if any Testing x List browser versions any admin UI changes were tested in Chrome Version x Please confirm youve added or verified test coverage for this change x Please confirm npm run testall ran successfully Tests passed at the same rate as they did prior to changes There are many linting issues in unchanged files and some tests that remain in the Pending state indefinitely I am trying to design a multitenant SaaS application and I am using Keystone js Node JS framework which uses Mongo Database The model that I want to use is Physical Separation of Data This approach separates the data by provisioning different database for different tenantsclients This helps us to scale our application as the number of clients grows and also scale the database as per the clients need The problem is I dont know how to configure or create a settings on Keystone that would implement a multi tenant system Here is an example but it uses a different database and its not mongo nor keystone js Does anyone have an idea how to configure keystone js to be multi tenant using Physical Separation of Data model or is there any other solution There were some answers from this tread but not clear to me Implementing multitenancy in KeystoneJS Thank you From what I find the time zone is unconditionally appended to the Datetime string before parsing with Moment This yields all Datetime parseFormats that lack the trailing Z ineffective Including from the default list Behavior In Model Eventadd date type TypesDatetime parseFormat YYYYMMDD hhmm required true initial true Setting through Admin UI should be valid Currently thats invalid while setting parseFormat YYYYMMDD hhmm Z makes the string valid in Admin UI Environment Software Version Keystone Nodejs Currently it is not possible to save texts fields in the admin UI that exceed the default multer limit of mb Description of changes To set custom multer options it is currently necessary to set handle uploads to true and define an object with the key multer options multer options dest tmpdir limits fieldSize mb handle uploads true These options are currently being applied during the setup of bodyparser serverbindBodyParserjs This pull request would also apply the options in the dynamic router adminserverappcreateDynamicRouterjs where multer is being used to process updates to fields in the admin UI Related issues if any Testing WIP currently eslint fails with problems errors warnings on my MacOS setup List browser versions any admin UI changes were tested in Please confirm youve added or verified test coverage for this change Please confirm npm run testall ran successfully Notes For more information on the End End E E testing framework for Keystone see To successfully have all E E tests pass you need to have the following set up A recent version of Chrome or Firefox Java Runtime Environment If you are developing in Windows you may run into linebreak linting issues One possible workaround is to remove the linebreakstyle rule in nodemoduleseslintconfigkeystoneeslintrcjson Expected behavior When inheriting from a parent list some fields may need to be hidden in some of the children This appears to be the same issue that was opened back in that was later resolved So the behavior were seeing is almost definitely a regression ActualCurrent behavior Other properties like noedit initial default required can all be overridden just by readd the field with the same name in the child list the hidden field no matter what we do does not appear to force the UI to not display the field Steps to reproduce the actualcurrent behavior Pseudo code parentadd type TypesDatetime utc true format YYYYMMDD default new Date required true initial true childadd type TypesDatetime utc true format YYYYMMDD required false initial false hidden true noedit true I did some testing with TypesText type fields just to see if it was specifically related to the DateTime fields but the problem is reproducible independent of field type based on my limited testing Environment Software Version Keystone Nodejs other LTS versions also show same behavior Browser ChromeFirefox latest versions Were trying to keep the issue tracker unpolluted Please ask questions and support requests on Join the KeystoneJS Slack for discussion with the community contributors Expected behavior If youre describing a bug tell us what should happen If youre suggesting a changeimprovement tell us how it should work The TypesCloudinaryImage field type should be effected by the required true option so users cant create new records without uploading a cloudinary image ActualCurrent behavior If youre describing a bug tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior If youre suggesting a changeimprovement explain the difference from current behavior No matter what I do I cant get the keystone to require a CloudinaryImage before creating or updating a record Steps to reproduce the actualcurrent behavior If youre describing a bug tell us what steps to take to reproduce your bug If youre suggesting a changeimprovement explain how to reproduce the current behavior Create a model with a CloudinaryImage field and set the required option to true image type TypesCloudinaryImage required true initial true Environment Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in The model I am trying to create is for a blog and the project has been coded from scratch rather than using the generator however the issue is still present in projects that were created via the generator Software Version Keystone Nodejs Browser Tested in Firefox Chrome Safari I was wondering if its possible in keystonejs to add a viewpost in two different places For example I have appgetblog viewsblog where I show view only in blog but also I would like to show this in main page But if I do appget viewsblog I see only this blog no footer nav and others sections How can I implement this Also I would like to show this blog in page keystoneset req res resstatus rendererrors but how can I add viewsblog to this code Is keystonejs handle this
