Replace the deprecated function dplyrtbldf with tibbleastibble and make corresponding changes to the text Also load tibble package to use astibble function instead of deprecated dplyrtbldf function Maybe it will be reasonable to change this Well call plot from inside the R command with which evaluates an R expression in an environment constructed from data to something like this Well call plot using R command with It evaluates an R expression in an environment constructed from data ideally to add parentheses for all function names in the lesson to improve readability I took me while to understand this sentence Together with whole question from exercise it sound even worse ps the lesson itself is perfect thus Im typing this here I had a great time and honestly couldnt wait every time I dived into the introductory lessons in the Programming in R section However in the Getting and Cleaning Data module Ive been consistently frustrated during the script exercises where essentially I have to guess how to combine two functions Ive basically never used into a very specific permutation When I submit and get it wrong all Im told is to reread the notes Ive already read that give no more clues for how to get it right or read the frankly pretty badly written documentation that doesnt get me any closer to what Im supposed to do This is particularly bad in the unit on cleaning data with tidyr Its a frustrating loop to just trialanderror your way through every imaginable argument until you finally get something right of course with zero knowledge about why you got it right in the end This needs a thorough update Im trying to learn R on the swirl package Least Squares Estimation and am having two problems It mentioned using the manipulate function but when Ive tried to use it it says that it cant find the function In this lesson Ive had to plot regression lines and there are parts where it wants me to view the formulas for the slope of the regression line However I a having difficulty doing this I believe it said earlier that I can access it by clicking on the gear function on the upper left of graph but it is not appearing Thanks For compatibility with getcoursepath function tryCatchswirlswirlcoursesdir error functionc filepathfindpackageswirlCourses Path to installed lesson lessonpath filepathgetcoursepath RProgramming lapplyandsapply Path to dataset datapath filepathlessonpath InitlessonR Load dataset flags readcsvdatapath headerFALSE Path to dataset info infopath filepathlessonpath flagnamestxt Function for user to open info viewinfo function fileeditinfopath returninfopath Dummy function to advance user past question for which correct answer yields an error ok function invisible The following accepts an invalid answer it should only accept but accepts Now try using evaluate along with an anonymous function to return the last element of the vector c Your anonymous function should only take one argument which should be a variable x evaluatefunctionxx c Great job
