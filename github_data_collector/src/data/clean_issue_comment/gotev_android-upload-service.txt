Hi Good library thanks I think it will be good if we can pass LifecycleOwner as a parameter to the RequestObserver In this case for example we can use fragments viewLifecycleOwner instead of contexts LifecycleOwner because context represents LifecycleOwner that observe Activity callbacks Tests are needed and may help library users better understand and try features without real servers Placeholders contains non localizable text at the moment as pointed out by Make them localizable and customizable
