problem is Ex Im always frustrated when Every time I send a PR I need to go to the UI to update reviewers and labels when they are almost always basically the same Describe the solution youd like A clear and concise description of what you want to happen Id expect a flag in the command line or a config setup where its possible to define default reviewers not those who send the PR to github

Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here NOOP If you are interested on gh updates you can subscribe to this issue New v Features Fantastic work by hamxabaig for implementing beautiful table style printing for listing pull requests Pagination for all list endpoints Upgraded to latest GitHub rest endpoints Added throttling Octokit plugin that uses best practices to prevent hitting rate limits Significantly more robust testing suite Before After Hooks available for every cmd Remove all vulnerabilities reported by npm audit Node Versions Dropped support for v Only Supporting v Issues label flag is now labels Clearer delineation between repos when listing Milestones Stabilize milestones listing implementation Pull Requests New list table view turn off by removing prettyprint from ghjson Thanks to drewbrokke for prefixing each branch name with Branch to make it easier to see separations Thanks to drewbrokke for adding line breaks after each repo and after each branch when displaying pulls Add line breaks between repos when listing pull requests Include merge hook in fetch hook Remove undocumented code that will do a local git merge Repo Thanks to keaglin for fixing silent failures of gh re new Hooks Merge plugin hooks to ghjson file only upon first run of plugin Hooks will now always be managed through the ghjson file House Cleaning Convert to async await style from callback hell Removed alias cmd as aliases are implemented more portably powerfully by the shell conversation to add it back here Updated error handling Clearer logging messages Deeper end to end test coverage of critical code paths like authentication Remove gist paste deprecation warning Simplify the hooks flow About myself Hi there I m Ryan My goal is to improve your dev life by increasing your productivity If you run into any issues or would like to contribute feel free to reach out to me and it would be my joy to help gh pr displays a table and gh is displays a list As a user Id like to see same info about issues than in pulls including issue status gh reports my current user incorrectly when called from a folder that is a git repo I think thats what is triggering it bash gh user whoami First we need authorization to use GitHubs API Login with your GitHub account Enter your GitHub user bpatram Enter your GitHub password hidden Enter your twofactor

my case it seems to return the organization the repo is owned by ebth Interestingly enough my ghjson does list the correct user json githubuser bpatram Deleting the ghjson file and relogging has no effect Hi I did expect that gh is L some label would add the label but it does not Would it be possible to have a configuration property containing a regex pattern that GH could use to name a branch when pulling a PR down For example if someone sends me a PR titled TICKET I could give GH a regex pattern that matches some TEXT dash NUMBERS and either grab that from the PR title or from the latest commit as this is also a common practice Most of the cmds are already singular but there are a couple inconsistencies with Notifications Gists Hi Just trying out gh and realized many of the commands dont have much if at all descriptions gh repo help usage gh command payload flags verbose nohooks List of available commands re repo Provides a set of util commands to work with Repositories B browser

organization String page String perpage String p private Boolean P protocol String r repo String t type all forks member owner public private sources U update String u user String Flags that can execute an action gh help lists available commands gh help a lists all available subcommands So Im somewhat unsure how to use it without dipping into the source code Like what does gitignore string do What command line parser are you using Im familiar with
