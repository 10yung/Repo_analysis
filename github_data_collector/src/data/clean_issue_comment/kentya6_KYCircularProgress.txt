Hi thanks for this open source project Like it so far but cannot get some wanted behavior I want to use single circular bar for multiple cases or dynamically change its current progress But as soon as I start animation there is no way to reset it to another value to start new animation For example I tried to start animation from to in seconds After some user progress I want to reset animation without waiting it to finish all minutes for example to progress and animate to in seconds But it just starts from previous animation last position and resets timer to even if very small portion left it divides that portion into seconds Im trying to set its inital value too not only duration I tried so far swift popupProgressCircleprogress Doesnt work if animation in progress popupProgressCirclesetprogress duration Also doesnt work if animation in progress popupProgressCirclesetprogress duration This just breaks everything may be because next part is called immediately and code execution is faster than popupProgressCirclesetprogress duration This works but because of above part doesnt work it is just making slower and slower every attempts remaining part So I want to achieve either resetstop animation in order to safely set new progress value or just set progress value and it is automatically stops all current animations On top of that there is no way to check if any animation is currently ongoing without waiting progress delegate But its just minor issue Using Swift and XCode
