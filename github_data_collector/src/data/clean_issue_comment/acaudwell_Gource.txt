Intro A project with microservice architecture repositories actual Cant visualize all activity for all repositories Only one repo and then have the necessity to combine rendered video to one file by video redactor And I can t do video well with multi repositories timing scaling and consolidation by hand expected List of git folders input Independent visualization for each Every time I want to use gource I google gource docker but there are oldunmaintained images with confusing configurations Can you please create an official uptodate docker image and place the link on the site and github readme If you dont have time I can create the Dockerfile and explain how to configure docker hub to build it automatically from github releasestags For my dotfiles I use a bare git repo in my HOME with a command which dcnf dcnf aliased to usrbingit gitdirHOMEdotfiles worktreeHOME I cant find a way for Gource to visualise these setups however It would be good to have similar options to the git command This may be due to a misunderstand on my part as to what this option is supposed to do My understanding is that during simulation all events of a day are compressed into the amount of seconds given so if I give secondsperday every seconds hours pass in the simulation However using this option does not seem to be changing the simulation speed at all I always get such a segfault when using gource even on a commit test git repo I use gource like this gource homevaracoastestgit o gourceppm and journalctl shows kernel gnomescreensav segfault at ip effa e cb d sp ffff b ac error in libX so effa e b Im using gource build on Ubuntu with swaywayland maybe this is related to the libX segfault Option for setting blobsize to match file size Color greenyellowred for how often file was changed in the last x days Color greenyellowred for how many different developers changed the file in the last x days The custom log format and captions use Unix timestamps which arent userfriendly I propose that the reader check if is in the time and if so interpret the time as an ISO format datetime per W C Notedatetime That is YYYYMMDD optionally followed by Thhmm ss offset Sometimes the same user might have committed to the same source under multiple usernames Maybe the username changed got bored got married etc or maybe they accidentally committed using the wrong account Who knows But its possible It would be nice to be able to provide a username and a list of aliases that can all be grouped under that one username when displaying the video A user may be doing the work of two developers but its still off putting to actually see two developers show up Since version ffmpeg comes back with the errorswarnings Stream not enough frames to estimate rate consider increasing probesize but increasing probesize doesnt help and Invalid data found when processing input when using the command line gource x o ffmpeg y r f image pipe vcodec ppm i vcodec libx preset ultrafast pixfmt yuv p crf threads bf gourcemp as used in this example This also applies to WebM encoding and for the method where you first go via the raw ppm video ffmpeg always fails at the same second mark in my input file so it seems theres something there which it doesnt like gource timescale gource timescale outside of range Try gource help for more information I wish to make the time scale significantly faster than the current maximum of my desired time scale is Ive tried recording at a time scale of and then speeding up the recording but this doesnt look right due to the animations being sped up Why is there a hard limit placed at Are there technical problems with faster time scales
