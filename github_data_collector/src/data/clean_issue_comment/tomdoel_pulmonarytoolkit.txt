Hello I need to change the coordinate system from PTK coordinates to DICOM coordinates based on tutorial but i cant do it Is anyone able to help me Thanks thanks Monica I used PTK to load up a scan recently Its compressed Dicom images of ARDS patient It loads fine on ITKsnap and D slicer But PTK zooms it when imported and seems to crop out the image Is there any setting i should change Thanks I am getting the following error while segmenting lung field or lobel using the toolkit The plugin PTKlobes failed with the following error Subscript indices must either be real positive integers or logicals When using the capture tool to create a screenshot the vertical capture is misaligned if using macOS full screen mode The UI will round the window and level values entered in the text boxes to the nearest integer For most Dicom images this is the preferred behaviour however when dealing with images of floating point values it might be desirable to set a nonintegrer value May require changes to MimPluginLabelEditBox MimPluginLabelSlider MimViewerPanelToolbar MimViewerPanelCallbackModifyWindowLevelLimits and consideration of how the windowlevel values affect other parts of the codebase PTKAddPaths ptkmain PTKMain Error File PTKMainm Line Column Function definitions in a script must appear at the end of the file Move all statements after the PTKMain function definition to before the first local function definition How could I change the coordinate system from PTK coordinates to DICOM coordinates based on your tutorial Could I change it from the GUI Hi When I try to use the function PTKSaveAs to save the data it always shows that Undefined function or variable PTKSaveAs Even when I try to do doc PTKSaveAs it always shows that No results for PTKSaveAs Is there any way to save the data into mhd file or nii file without using GUI when i write fileinfos PTKDicomUtilitiesGetListOfDicomFilessourcepath it says Undefined variable PTKDicomUtilities or class PTKDicomUtilitiesGetListOfDicomFiles i defined file path in sourcepath please help Hi tomdeol Thanks for your great work When I use the Segment the segments in toolkit Two errors when I deal with different dicom sequences The plugin PTKPulmonarySegments failed with the following error Error in function SeparateSmallestBranchByRadius Could not subdivide the tree into exactly the desired number of branches The plugin PTKPulmonarySegments failed with the following error Attempt to access sampleimage As sizesampleimage is out of range Thanks Gu Yu
