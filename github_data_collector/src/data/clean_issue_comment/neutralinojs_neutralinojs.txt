Expected Behavior When pressing cmd cvx corresponding action is happening Actual Behavior Nothing is happening Steps to Reproduce the Problem Run neutralinomac executable Press cmd cvx Specifications NeutralinoJs Version v Platform macOS Catalina Hi is there any way to print the page or div using windowprint function Hello I know there was a brief mention of an addon system similar to Node being a good idea in this issue What would be more reasonable to expect if this were implemented exposing some plugin API that encompasses all possible cases to the JS side or having plugin devs write DLLslibs that would expose functionality to the JS side on a perplugin basis Or even better if it ends up that Chromium becomes the default webview on all versions of Neutralino would Chromium extension APIs be available to us as well or is that limited to fullon direct implementations of Chromium I know that while Neutralino using other webviews on Windows is still being worked out that Windows users like myself have to settle with IE webview polyfills if we use binary releases like v which also means that the more mature implementations of some newer web APIs like Web Audio might not be fully available to use natively Exposing more system IO like audio and probably using sandboxed probably plugins would be groovy I made a simple app with an image embedded in the html file The img src line points to the path of the image file assetsimgsfilenamejpg For some reason the image file wont show up Ive tried changing to browser in the settingsjson but with no success I know everything works because Ive tried my app on a live server without Neutralino Is images not supported yet Specifications NeutralinoJs Version Platform Linux Ubuntu Expected Behavior App to open Actual Behavior Terminal window opens to run start script then app shows Steps to Reproduce the Problem Double click neutralinomac Specifications NeutralinoJs Version latest Platform MacOS Expected Behavior We need a way of debugging the app in window mode Actual Behavior Couldnt find a way to debug the app in window mode I basically need to open the inspectordev tools within window mode which is desperately needed as many features that are available in browser mode are not working in window mode but Im basically blind in regards of whats going wrong as I cant see the console errors Steps to Reproduce the Problem For example try to use HTML geoLocation API or Notifications API in your app Test it in browser mode it works Switch to window mode it doesnt work Specifications NeutralinoJs Version latest with macos build capability Platform OS X i have basic html app that doesnt need any OS APIs Hence this repo is perfect for build as this gives low ram and disk use Only requirement remaining is to have a app icon without this it looks very unprofessional I want run it on raspi bu it not works
