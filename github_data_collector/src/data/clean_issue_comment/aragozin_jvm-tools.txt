Ive analysed your codebase and noticed that orggridkitjvmtooljacksonNumberOutput is not fully tested Ive written some tests for the methods in this class with the help of Diffblue Cover Hopefully these tests will help you detect any regressions caused by future code changes If you would find it useful to have additional tests written for this repository I would be more than happy to look at other classes that you consider important in a subsequent PR it would be nice to add more security tomxpr for example ability to specify user name password for remote connection It would be also useful to add SSL but it could be too much work The was released several days ago but there was no entry for it in the NEWS Also added the mprx command to README Im trying to use your nice library in order to compute the retained size of an object because I have a huge hprof file I used HeapFactorycreateHeap because I see that getRetainedSize is not implemeted for FastHprofHeap It works the only thing is that it gives a different result compared with Yourkit or Eclipse Memory Analyzer those two give the exact same number of bytes each time Example MapInteger String map new HashMap for int i i numberOfItems i mapputi IntegertoStringi The bigger the numberOfItems the bigger the difference in retained size between this api and the standard tools Eg for items this library returns and Yourkit and EMA return for items this library returns and Yourkit and EMA return Any ideas Thank you Hi I had a bit of trouble working out how to connect your tool to my VM and noticed that someone else had already raised that issue So when I made some progress I figured Id try to write up what I found in hopes it might be useful to others Obviously Im totally new to your tool so might have made all kinds of mistakes but if you think this is close enough to be helpful well here it is Also if you think it needs more or less to be useful dont hesitate to say so and Ill attempt to improve this with your guidance Meanwhile thanks for a very interesting looking tool Im excited to start discovering what it can do for me Is this file really in the correct folder I ran into a trouble with Exception in thread main javautilMissingResourceException Cant find bundle for base name orgnetbeanslibprofilerheapBundle locale enUS at javautilResourceBundlethrowMissingResourceExceptionResourceBundlejava at javautilResourceBundlegetBundleImplResourceBundlejava at javautilResourceBundlegetBundleResourceBundlejava at orgnetbeanslibprofilerheapHprofByteBufferreadHeaderHprofByteBufferjava and if I look into into folder orgnetbeanslibprofilerheap I dont see the Bundleproperties file there AFAIK the file should be located in srcmainresourcesorgnetbeanslibprofilerheap instead of srcmainjavaorgnetbeanslibprofilerheap The reference relationship of objects on Java Heap is needed to debug memory leak I know there are some tests exists but javadoc for packages involved minimal general description will be nice to have
