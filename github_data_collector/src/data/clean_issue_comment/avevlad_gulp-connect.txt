only affect whats going on inside an iframe The src of that iframe depends on which component a developer has picked to inspect on the iframe stage As this could possibly be a notsouncommon usecase it would be great to have an option that allows passing a configuration to connectreload which would allow something like javascript connectreload iframe idofmyiframe or even better for refreshing several iframes javascript connectreload iframes idofmyiframe idofmyotheriframe Somewhat similar to the open configuration property provided by gulpwebserver To allow the server to be accessed from any IP address in the network neighborhood the host must be set to However this value then gets passed passed directly to the log resulting in the following message Server started The host in the URL is surprising for less technical users who expect to see localhost Therefore the host value should still be reported as localhost in the log message If this masking is not acceptable Id be open to introducing a displayHost option value for this purpose The gulpconnect task runs on projects in different directories under the same root folder Only the project that started gulp can be refreshed in real time After the project is changed the changes can be seen in the terminal but there is no update in the browser gulp v gulpconnect all in the title Hi This is my html html DOCTYPE html html

reason So do not switch on livereaload if you want to see more than basic html files connectreload isnt working i debugged it till the mapstream But i could really figure out how this works Below is
