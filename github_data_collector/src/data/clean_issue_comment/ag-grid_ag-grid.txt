wrapperInstancegetFrameworkComponentInstance According to types definition instances is the array of ICellRendererComp so method getFrameworkComponentInstance is not defined on array elements In

Customers of agGrid Man Ive beaten my head against this for hours now and I just cannot get it to work How do I use the chrome date picker for cells You have an example here for how to use Jquery

Support Providing a Reproducible Scenario Here is a link to the Plunker Current behavior The bug is for Date filtering and for when rowModelType serverSide When I click dd in Date and going from left to right type in then then say the date automatically switches to If I continue and type in it switches the entire filter to ddmmyy and it does not filter the rows Interestingly if I were to go backwards by typing the year month then day the date does not automatically change although it appears the filters are not working Also changing it to clientSide orinfinite has the Date filter work normally but since Im using a serverSide application I require serverSide as my rowModelType Expected behavior The expected behaviour would be when filtering by date going from dd mm yy that once I enter the year it does not automatically change or reset and that the rows will be filtered Please tell us about your environment Im using Windows Visual Code Studio and Visual Code Studio as the IDEs
