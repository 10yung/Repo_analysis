Hi guys i am not sure if this is g o issue or openvslam But just trying my luck here i am trying to compile ros package in openvslam Steps as per instruction in cd pathtoworkingdir git clone cd g o

or Openvslam issue Thanks I am compiling openvslam as per the installation instructions provided from openvslamopenvslamsrcopenvslamoptimizelocalbundleadjustercc usrlocalincludeg osolverscsparsecsparseextensionh fatal error csh No such file or directory I did a cmake with the following options cmake DBUILDWITHMARCHNATIVEON DUSEPANGOLINVIEWERON DUSESOCKETPUBLISHEROFF DUSESTACKTRACELOGGEROFF DBOWFRAMEWORKDBoW DBUILDTESTSON Stack Trace logging was disabled as I was seeing glog cmake errors while running cmake which I believe is ok I followed the comments at and also installed libsuitesparsedev but no luck csh is installed at usrlocalincludeg oEXTERNALcsparse g o compiles file and am able to execute few binaries from the g obin directory Any help would be appreciated Thanks KK I am using windows I build g o project with cmake and suitesparsemetis version The problem occurs when I try to build solvercholmod It cannot find FALSElib Any idea how to solve it Ive read the paper VITAMINE VIsual Tracking And MappINg with Extremely Dense Feature Points and Im wondering wheater its possible to implement a Bundle Adjustment procedure like the one described there and named by the author Subsbace Guass Newton Method see section Thanks to anybody will want to help me Since last release it has last two years hope the author could publish a new stable release While trying to compile a slam code line I am getting the following error g oTypeSim Sophuscpp error undefined reference to g otypegroupsba Im stuck and cannot proceed with the build Please help in resolving this error Dear RainerKuemmerle and other contributers I can run the following command pre g oviewer xxg o pre and it can show me the picture but when I press the optimize button it will exit and tell me pre Segment fault core dumped pre A few other buttons still work Whats the problem Hi I want to create a g o file of my own dataset and perform some optimization however I have been facing some issues in understanding the format of g o file I have the Key frames from ORBSlam and the poses between the consecutive frames ie Rotation R and Translation T as shown in following figure Untitled drawing In g o file first all the poses for respective keyframes are mentioned with VERTEXSE eg VERTEXSE QUAT where the first three values are xyz coordinates and others are quaternions After that there is EDGESE section in which I am facing problem to understand eg EDGESE QUAT In EDGESE I think the first two values show the link between frames I dont understand the the succeeding values What are these values in case of keyframes from ORBSlam and how to calculate them What is format of g o file Hey I have noticed that you have commented the second derivative term for the Kernel weighted Information matrix at here This term row resultnoalias rho weightedErrror weightedErrrortranspose Why it could be neglected I mean the neglected term is the value evaluated at the current position it may not be a very small term For most Kernel functions it could be rightbut for Fair Kernel for which rho is not Isnt it then wrong Thanks Hello Ive made some changes in the CMakeLists of g o and I though it could be interesting to share it First Ive set output directory to the BUILDDIR instead of g oSOURCEDIR Then Ive updated most of the g o modules headers to be relocatable in a modern cmake way by using placeholders Before headers paths was hardcoded in the generated g oTargetscmake and with this modification path are relatives to the install path Example with stuff module before cmake g oTragetscmake Create imported target g ostuff addlibraryg ostuff SHARED IMPORTED settargetpropertiesg ostuff PROPERTIES INTERFACEINCLUDEDIRECTORIES homemschweitzerdevothersinstallg oreleaseinclude after cmake g oTragetscmake Create imported target g ostuff addlibraryg ostuff SHARED IMPORTED settargetpropertiesg ostuff PROPERTIES INTERFACEINCLUDEDIRECTORIES IMPORTPREFIXinclude the IMPORTPREFIX is automatically generated by CMake and is relative to the install directory I think this is much more convenient to deal with transitive dependencies when using for example ORBSLAM OpenVSLAM etc I didnt check all the cornercase of g o library so let my know if there is anything wrong with this PR
