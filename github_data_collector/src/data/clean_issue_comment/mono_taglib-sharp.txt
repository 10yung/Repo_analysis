Hello there I dont understand how to set a custom tag for a file In your READMEmd file in the example Readwrite custom tags from a specific format you declare a variable tfile which contains the File var tfile TagLibFileCreateC My songflac Then you create another object called custom which you assign a custom tag var custom TagLibOggXiphComment tfileGetTagTagLibTagTypesXiph But after that this object is never assigned to the tfile instead you call rgFileSave But rgFile has never been created It seems that on Windows performers are separated only by semicolon but TagLib separates performers by both and so it reads ACDC as two separate artists AC and DC I dont have a generic workaround only workaround possible is to exempt ACDC specifically It would be nice to see this behavior change to be coherent with Windows or if its Windows thats wrong in reading the metadata provide a way to read the performers string without separating them It might be slightly helpful to include an explicit reference to the nuget package in the readme If you just do a search for nuget taglib this package actually comes about fourth While the top one seems to be variation just taglib that is still on version targets Net Core Am I missing something because I cant seem to find the tag for whether the file is I found a closed issue also about unicode here It says the filename was messed up But in my case it is not Most of files contains unicode characters can be read properly but some cannot For example QQ The upper text should be while the lower is supposed be Using the Microsoft provided MusicProperties class could give me the correct unicode result but that class has a little of issue about the artist Is it possible to read an audio stream webradio I tried this csharp string url TagLibFile tfile TagLibFileCreateurl But get an TagLibUnsupportedFormatException Im trying to modify the keywords in a file but cant because the file is marked as corrupt when loading reason Size of entries exceeds possible data size Other tools including Windows File Explorer are able to modify the keywords and taglibsharp can read them Whats happening Is this a bug or expected behaviour that is is this file really corrupt but other tools dont care IMG HDR The file is attached Just checking I have a scenario where the speech content resides in Azure BLOB storage and some C handler code in an Azure function which will be downloading the stream of bytes and then determine the format of the file Can TagLib help Thanks Sau
