I juist wanted to confirm that this package doesnt support continuous scales Im not missing anything Hello I just wanted to give a short heads up about a minor issue I stumbled upon when playing around with this great package I just realized some unexpected behaviour with when using geomlabel in combination cvdgrid somehow the color of this particular geom stays untouched r librarytidyverse librarycolorblindr Loading required package colorspace p tibblelabel test ggplot geomsegmentaesx xend y yend color label geomlabelaesx y label label color label themevoid cvdgridp supCreated on by the reprex package v sup cheers Kosmas We should prepare a proper release What is still needed Here are some things I can think about Move github repo to wilkelab This allows us to add a pkgdown website and host it under wilkelaborg as in or Check dependencies Do we depend on the development version of cowplot as the readme states The listed dependency is and the version on CRAN is so this should be fine No packages other than base R should be listed under Depends All other dependencies should be listed under Imports Update installation instructions in the readme Review all vignettes Remove the ggplot color scales vignette It is outdated and there are other packages now that focus specifically on color scales eg paletteer Something else Hello Do you think it would be possible to create individual functions for each of the colorblind types I think that it is very useful to display them in a single grid but it would also be nice to have some flexibility in how we present them Happy to help with a PR for this and also with any help you might like in submitting this to CRAN this is a super useful package Hi when I install the colorbindr package I got the error Does not appear to be an R package no DESCRIPTION
