security fix PRs for this repo from the Security Alerts page details I have noticed that when a change that affects or more keys will slow down UI rendering UI rendering speed is fine when logging is disabled I understand that logging should be disabled in production just wondering if there is a way to overcome this issue Disclaimer Coming from Angular world In libraries like NgRx NgXs effects we always return an observable I feel this code snippet js store ontoday pipe debounce subscribeasync date let users await apiget since date storesetusersusers can be js store ontoday pipe debounce mergeMap date return apigetsince date map users users I did not put much thought into the syntax I will try to test this and give you the results For now sharing this idea here I saw a couple of old PR and discussions about rerendering the component only when the properties he subscribed too have changed and not on every store change Whats the status with that whats blocking it I think it would be handy if Undux used ReactforwardRef to make sure that any refs attached to components created using withStore got attached to the wrapped component instead of the wrapper itself Thoughts
