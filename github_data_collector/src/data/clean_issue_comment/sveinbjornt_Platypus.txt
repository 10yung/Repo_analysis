I couldnt see a way to encrypt the python byte code when creating a package Does anyone know if this is possible or can we propose this as a feature request please Snippet Shellbashetc interpreter printf m echo red text printf m Expected red text in red color Actual mred m Also tested with zshperlpython tput in sh also doesnt work I have an app on my Mac that may update two files If I add them as bundled files they are copied into the resource folder and updates dont affect the original files What I do now is add the files then go into the Resources folder on the command line delete the files and replace them with symlinks to the actual files I have to do this any time I maintain the app It would be a lot more convenient if Platypus had a facility to bundle soft links Sending applicationDidFinishLaunching and applicationShouldTerminate to the underlying script allows writing more robust applications It directly communicates the stat of the StatusMenu application Im having some trouble trying to create an app that reliably passes along the URLs sent to it to the script Im a new Platypus user love it so far so its possible Im doing something wrong but if so I cant figure out what Heres my test setup Create a Platypus app called TestURLs or whatever with a Text Window interface with Accept dropped items checked and within those settings I checked Register as URI scheme handler and added http and https as schemes Use this as the script bash binsh for arg in do echo arg arg done In the terminal issue the following command open a TestURLs Expected output arg arg Actual output varies Most often I get the following arg and it loses the second URL Sometimes I get no output at all as if no arguments have been passed Very rarely Ill get the expected output of both URLs Ive verified that if I send the same open command to an ordinary browser both URLs get opened For example this command will open both URLs in Chrome open a Google Chrome Any ideas whats going on here Thanks Im seeing a strange issue with webloc files When I create an app that accepts dropped files whatever I drag is passed as an argument except for some strange reason webloc files Steps to reproduce Create a Platypus app that accepts all dropped files Write a script that outputs argv Drag a webloc file Im attaching an example app All the script does is this printrargv So whatever I drag to it is output in the window Except webloc files Fooappzip All apps I create with Platypus all show up in System Prefs Notifications Center Is there a way to not have every app I create show up in the notification Center Since about a week ago everything associated with the current version of Platypus is being flagged by my antivirus software as wintrojanpistacchietto and blocked from running This includes php apps that I build with platypus as well as new copies of platypus that I download Is this an actual infection or a false positive The antivirus software that Im using is CISCO Amp for Endpoints its based on ClamAVosxcvd Hi Created gedit launcher app with Platypus selected png icon from folder and created the app in the Applications folder so far so good but after app creation and running the launcher the dock icon remains blank How can I change that Thanks Captura de Pantalla a las
