Hi Im on OSX Mojave with SS Its worked fine in the past but recently Ive noticed that changes I make locally are never pushed to github in my case unless I restart SS or pause and resume the relevant section The logs show activity like Git Notes Checking for remote changes Cmd Notes git revparse HEAD Cmd Notes git lsremote heads exitcode origin master Git Notes No remote changes localremote a c c b e fd f febd a f If I make a local change and restart I get a message like this Config Wrote to UsersmaraspeliconfigorgsparkleshareSparkleShareprojectsxml Cmd Notes git status porcelain SyncUp Notes

menu bar it also seems several projects are stuck in waiting to sync for no obvious reason but Im not sure if this is related For the specific repository Notes tested above it actually just said Last change am when my last change was actually at It may not be relevant but Ive put the synchronised folders outside the SparkleShare root folder like so sparkleshare user nameMartin Aspeliname

automatically build SparkleShare for Windows using MinGW MSYSMSYS MXE or whatever This way each new release will automatically have also a Windows version Maybe just use MXE docker image FYI MXE provides not only the compiler but also a lot of dependency libraries out of the box eg Screenshot from You can find session logs by date and version information in configorgsparkleshareSparkleSharelogs on Linux and macOS C Users YOURUSERNAME AppData Roaming orgsparkleshareSparkleShare logs on Windows To help us help you please include the logs from around the time the issue occurred as well as the SparkleShare version and info about your OS displayed at the top of the log files Then tell us roughly in these steps what went wrong What happened On Windows there were problems with encoding of the automatic messages mergescommits on Windows See screenshot It probably used Windows encoding instead of UTF What I expected to happen Readable text This happens when On adding files into project directory Another question two files were added by SparkleShare sparkleshare SparkleSharetxt Are they necessary or can I delete themone of them Can I put them into gitignore if they are necessary You might also want to add GitLab into the list of predefined hosts into the Windows versionit is present of Linux version Thank you very much It worked very well and helps to collaborate with nontechnical people Thanks for reporting your issue or feature request it helps lots Feature request Support webhooks for notifications The major git hosting services all have webhooks to trigger actions when things happen with a repo It would be nice to be able to trigger the notification service with a webhook when pushing a commit You can do the same thing with a git post hook but this doesnt work from a client such as Working Copy under iOS What happened SparkleShare crashes suddenly and stops running What I expected to happen no crash This happens when no specific action but maybe logs can give some information Cmd chmod rootSparkleSharemyhostmyprojectgithooksprepush Cmd myproject git push all progress origin Git hint The githooksprepush hook was

System Linux bpo amd also tested with same issue Gnome Bit latest stable Debian Sparkleshare installled through flatpak Maybe this could happen when another application tries to write a file blocked by SparkleShare In other cases Sparkleshare crashes at system startup but I cannot provide logs atm When the startup issue happens again I will post them here Fetcher

Failed What happened I tried checking out a keybase encrypted git repo It fails with a Could not fetch host key error What I expected to happen Honestly Id be a bit surprised if this worked out of the box Keybase encrypted git uses gitremotehelpers which may require a bit of extra work on SparkleShares part This happens when Sync remote project Own server Address keybaseteam and Remote Path myteammyrepo If keybase repos can be supported it would be best if they had a preconfigured checkout similar to what exists for Bitbucket GitHub and GitLab SparkleShare is a really nice software for sync with git For my usage I hope to use it to distribute python code from my private git repository Gitea to Windows PC client Is there any way to do so I tried to use Deploy Key to make clients readonly but SparkleShare client is creating sparkleshare and SparkleSharetxt files automatically so that there is always Failed to send some changes error on client Thanks a lot Irvin What happened
