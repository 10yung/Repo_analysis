Open the app Current behavior In the webbrowser Odoo can visualize Companies at the same time or just one if you deselect the other The functionality of selecting them both gives you the possibility to have a CRM overview of both companies at the same time Expected behavior In the mobile app you can select only one company at the time this could be improved by also visualizing the both companies but this is not possible VideoScreenshot link optional Double selection in webbrowser single selection in App Screenshot Odoo Hope this can be improved Kind regards Maikel Impacted versions Steps to reproduce chose a demo vendor bill make a partial refund and validate it go back to the vendor bill create a ne partial refund Current behavior this error is raised Duplicated vendor reference detected You probably encoded twice the same vendor billcredit note Azure Interior Reversal of BILL Expected behavior No error raised VideoScreenshot link optional Check in this video Adding a method to allow changing the date of the Tax Cash Basis Entry There are localizations that could not allow to create the CABA Entry in a date other than the maximum between the Journal Items being reconciled And for that case other workarounds have to implemented But not creating the CABA for those Journal Items at present date or having to use other means I confirm I have signed the CLA and read the PR guidelines at wwwodoocomsubmitpr Impacted versions Steps to reproduce go Accounting Customers Invoices Create an invoice and enter multiple lines of text in the LABEL of the invoice details Print report invoicesorinvoices without Payment Current behavior account invoice report can not print label have multiline like gif Expected behavior Like previous versions can print multiple lines VideoScreenshot link optional FIX account Better Wording at buttoncancel method When Unposting several Journal Entries with buttoncancel method there could be some JE that cannot be unposted but information provide gives no clue on which journal entry the UserError arises I confirm I have signed the CLA and read the PR guidelines at wwwodoocomsubmitpr Description of the issuefeature this PR addresses The refund wizard is not compatible with the LATAM document types This PR try to extend the original wizard to be able to properly create credit notes and invoices modify option in the wizard There are multiples fixes so we enumerate the errors bellow each one has their own commit Current behavior before PR We are not able to set Document type in the Refund wizard When selecting modify option in the Refund wizard it raise and error can not create credit note and do not let us to create neither the credit note or the new invoice Credit note is been created in the default journal of the system and not in the same journal of the original invoice Desired behavior after PR is merged We are able to select Document type in the Refund wizard when creating a credit note When selecting modify option now we can create both the credit note and the new invoice each one now has the proper document type Credit note now is created in the same journal of the original invoice I confirm I have signed the CLA and read the PR guidelines at wwwodoocomsubmitpr websiteevent Commit solved a big problem which was that when an undoredo is performed the whole DOM was reconstructed breaking all the JS relying on the old one For example the latest blog posts which are dynamically loaded in JS were not removed before saving since the JS relied on the old DOM and this broke the page because that dynamic content contained nonvalid XML markup The solution was to destroy all JS widgets before applying an undoredo and rebuilding them all afterwards Ideally this operation should be done on the undo recording action but this would have a huge flickering impact since many DOM would be destroyed each time the user types text flickering which is also bad on undoredo but it is more acceptable The problem now is the following if a widget like many is declared like this start function thiselappend Some dynamic content on page loading destroy function thiselfind Dynamic content to remove remove Then it works in all standard cases dynamic content is loaded on page load and is removed when saving the editor But this happens with the undoredo system The users types text we record an undo which is the whole page current DOM containing all the dynamic contents The users hits CTRLZ a We destroy all JS widgets calling destroy the dynamic content is removed from the page b We replace the whole DOM with the one that was saved That one contains the dynamic content DOM c The JS widgets are recreated calling start creating the dynamic content again Result the dynamic content appears duplicated On save depending on how the destroy was implemented only the last generated content may be removed or both but in any case it appears duplicated during edition Hopefully our current stable version do not contain that many dynamic content so a perfect amelioration of all of this can be found in master As a fix this commit introduces an extra step between a and b we remove the dynamic content of the DOMtoreapply before applying it For this to work widgets have to mark their dynamic content with the class otempautoelement when creating it They also must add the

such a dependency was defined but that the related widget was not found the dependency was considered as not met Now it acts as if that particular dependency was not defined at all This is useful for controlling the visibility of a generic option in the case of a specific snippet without having to duplicate and restrict that generic option Eg There is a generic color option on all snippets For my snippet hello I only want that generic color option to be visible if my world option is enabled I then add datadependenciesworld on the generic color option In the case any other snippet than hello is used since the world option does not exist there the color option acts as if it had no dependency
