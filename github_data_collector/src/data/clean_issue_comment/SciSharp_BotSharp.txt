wanted to create a more complex bot and add some machine learning to it so I found BotSharp First of all I want to point out Ive read all the issues before writing this one Following the documentation Ive cloned the repo and used dockercompose to integrate Articulate UI to test some agents and see how it works I open but nothing appears I can see in the Docker command line that the URL is open but nothing shows And a begginers question Do I have to create my own project and link it to BotSharp or is the BotSharp project a bot in itself Sorry for the lack of knowledge I just discovered your wonderful platform Thanks in advanced Did anyone tried to import agent from Wit I tried to use the instructions for other platform just replacing platform in metajson with Wit but it generated error

matter what I did it wont run and generate the about error Any suggestions Also is Articulate UI is still supported If not what is the alternative for UI Hello Im fairly new to Machine Learning in general so this may be an easy fix but Im getting exceptions when trying to train the AI Specifically a null reference exception on line in PlatformBuilderBasecs in the Core project From the documentation it wasnt exactly clear how to setup an agent and then what training data to use to really get started with training the AI I created a zip file with a metajson file and a file called agentjson both of which have the same file contents Id test Name test Platform Dialogflow ClientAccessToken test DeveloperAccessToken test Integrations This was the only way I was able to get it to start working at all but maybe this is where I went wrong Do there need to be files What contents need to be in the files I think this project is great I just need a bit of help getting everything setup to be able to debug locally so I can start adding to the project I am not using Docker Hi there I am new to programming and have started learning C about months ago I have never programmed anything before this time period After making a calculator and some other basic programs I really wanted to learn how bigger applications work and learn how to upgrade and modify them Since I love the AI part of programming this chatbot seemed like the place to begin Yet after snooping around I wanted to test the actual bot and that is where I am stuck now I can compile solutions in every separate folder to a separate exe file yet when I run it it starts VS and shows the code instead of a UI screen where I can chat with the bot Is there a way to compile all into single exe file Or am I thinking wrong and I need to do something else to make it work I also keep getting warnings when trying to run it in VS tried looking up the fault codes yet for now It is not understandable for someone that is just starting out in this field Kind regards from this newbie in programming I am trying to see how mature the Natural Languange Understanding is I have looked into LUIS some but dont like having to pay a fee per call or relying on an external resource and RASA seems very difficult to use from NET Core but is very robust Is there any more documentation on this
