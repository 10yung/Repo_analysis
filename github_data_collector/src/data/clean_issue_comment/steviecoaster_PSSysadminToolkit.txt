Currently GetUserProfileSize iterates one by one through each computer and doesnt return output until the last one is complete when it outputs the result array in its entirety I suggest skipping the array altogether and just letting each PSObject hit the pipeline as it completes Also the logic for listing profiles is performed in a separate command from querying the profile sizes If that were moved into the script block you could drop the foreachobject and allow it to just use InvokeCommand against ComputerName allowing it to use InvokeCommand builtin asynchronous query ability Adding a cimsession parameter will enable users to provide alternate credentials and make the module behave more consistently Also there is a ticket for making the functions work without WinRM This would let you use DCOM in your session options so you could close that ticket as well This will allow a user to work with profiles on remote systems TODO Expand this issue more Just getting it in there so its not forgotten steviecoaster I need to add an alias Im RemoveUserProfile so the two compliment each other As per steviecoaster creating this issue so he doesnt forget This is a terrible issue I will flesh it out tonight GetCimInstance WinRM cannot complete the operation Verify that the specified computer name is valid that the computer is accessible over the network and that a firewall exception for the WinRM service is enabled and allows access from this computer By default the WinRM firewall exception for public profiles limits access to remote computers within the same local subnet At line char GetCimInstance ClassName win userprofile ComputerN CategoryInfo ConnectionError GetCimInstance CimException FullyQualifiedErrorId HRESULT x MicrosoftManagementInfrastructureCimCmdletsGetCimInstanceCommand PSComputerName Dear Stevie The WriteWarning message to remember to close the session is not printed on the console In addition if you specify the prefix the info are printed out as List if is not specified as table Cheers G rp Remove installed windows updates from several computers with the ability to do it remotely It would also be great to remove patch Tuesday updates sorted by release date Cmdlet and parameter should be something similar to RemoveInstalledUpdates ComputerName xyz Id kb I wrote something that crunches blue screen dmp files and spits out what caused it It has a dependancy on the windows sdk but Ive found it to be handy Do you want it in here I wanted to share this with you guys if you have a lot of switch ports to configure this can help generate the configuration for each port Written in powershell and works great for switch refreshes Function will retrieve AD users properties and group memberships It will then export and log the results Could be used when changing permissions on an account or before disabling it function GetADUserProperties param Parametermandatory True ValueFromPipeline true ValidateNotNullOrEmpty string Username Log file location ex Logfilename c reports temp Username TimeStamp GetDate Format yyyyMMddHHmmss txt User GetADUser LDAPFilter sAMAccountNameUsername ifUser ne Null WriteHost Processing uprop GetADUser Username Properties ErrorAction Stop managerDetails GetADUser GetADUser Username properties managermanager properties displayName uprop GetADPrincipalGroupMembership Identity Username GetADGroup Properties select name description prop ordered Name uprop name User ID uprop samaccountname Email Address uprop emailaddress Title uprop title Description uprop Description Department uprop Department Manager managerDetailsName Office Phone uprop officephone Mobile uprop mobile Account Created uprop Created Password Last Changed uprop PasswordLastSet End of prop userinfo prop FT AutoSize OutString userinfo uprop FT AutoSize OutString userinfo OutFile FilePath Logfilename Writehost Completed else WriteHost User not found Username ForegroundColor Red
