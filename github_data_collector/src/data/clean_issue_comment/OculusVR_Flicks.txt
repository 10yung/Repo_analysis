It just makes it look a bit nicer wink NTSC IS NOT EXPLICITLY SUPPORTED IN ALL OF ITS SUBTLE NUANCES BUT The NTSC variations etc are approximately defined as and etc These can be represented exactly in flicks but divisions are not available It is not clear what does this paragraph mean or refers to NTSC frame rates are exactly defined as Hz Hz and multiples of those not approximately but and are decimal approximations of those obviously Many folks online have pointed out that NTSC technically has a variable frame rate and that this is handled correctly in other media playback libraries such as QuickTime The goal of flicks is to provide a simple convenient stdchronoduration to work with when writing code that works with simulation and time in media but not explicitly to handle complex variablerate playback scenarios So well stick with the approximations and leave it at that It would be best to ask those folks for a reference to the standard where it is defined as variable frame rate NOTE that variable frame rate is not the same thing as noninteger in Hz frame rate like eg NTSC Variable frame rate means by definition that distance between consecutive frames may vary To the best of my knowledge NTSC frame rates has always been defined in each standard as constant frame rates exactly Hz Hz and multiples of those so it would be great to stop propagating this misleading idea that there is something variable or approximate about them It is not more variable or approximate than Hz or Hz For example distance between consecutive frames in NTSC FPS stream are exactly seconds according to the standard in ideal model obviously in physical world it is always approximate and with small random deviations just like anything else
