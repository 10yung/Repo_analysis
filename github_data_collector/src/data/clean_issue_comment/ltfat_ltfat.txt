Its a mild inconvenience that gabphasederiv does not play nice with dgtreal Ill provide a variant that works for dgtreal whenever I have the time to write it If gauss is forwarded as a string the resulting Gaussian is adapted to the parameters aM ie the timefrequency ratio will by aML If it is forwarded as cell array but without specifying the timefrequency ratio you will obtain a Gaussian with timefrequency ratio equal to independent of aM I guess this is undesired I can make the necessary one line change to compwindow and push Dear ltfat developers the twisted convolution has a very compact implementation in tconvm that combines col diag and FFT Would it be possible to have a pointer to where this is coming from Thanks and best regards Eric ChassandeMottin I am using GNU Octave on a Mac I tried to run the ifwt example from the documentation but it doesnt work In the Octave command line type help ifwt There is a simple example A simple example showing perfect reconstruction f gspi J c fwtfdb J fhat ifwtcdb Jlengthf The following should give almost zero normffhat Type that into the command line and get this error error Unsupported data type error called from compifwt at line column ifwt at line column I verified this works on a Windows machine using the same Octave version Something is broken on the Mac side of things for some reason Ive also tried getting the info object from fwt and using that but I get the same error I think one of the last commit broke the wavelet modules See the trace below fwt cameramandb Error using nargout Error File wfiltdbm Line Column indexing must appear last in an index expression Error in fwtinit line wfiltNargout nargouttmpFile Error in fwt line w fwtinitw I followed the Windows install instructions to the letter but received after successful compilation an error Gateway function missing for any of the mexfiles I checked with verbose output the compilation process and everything seems fine I dont know what the issue is but it could be linked to Especially I used Windows bit Matlab bit R a fftw tdm bit gcc Please let me know if I can provide any more details My bet I didnt download the R a precomiled builds These work However if I want to compile myself the source code again same error In most cases converting the filters to the time domain seems unnecessary and slows down the reconstruction process in particular if many filters are involved Handling of nonsymmetric positive only freqtoscale seems to be off if some filters pass the Nyquist frequencies Line sometimes leads to upidx being negative which does not make sense The if loop starting at Line sometimes leads to poshi being negative again with adverse effects The definition of binshi in line is not clear to me Maybe it is meant to be binshi nyquest flipudbinslo instead Generally it may be up to discussion how filters wrapping into the negative frequencies should be handled extend the frequency scale or symmetrize it Passing parameters that lead to filters wrapping into the negative currently simply leads to the function returning an empty vector im now digging waveletswfiltdbm please see following attached image and linked gist for detail after some investigating i realized this bc large N produces very small a any thoughts cmpdb cmpdbm
