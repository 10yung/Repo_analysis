 The new version of ggplot has an updated usedefaults method in Geom As you overwrite this method it result in an error The new implementation is a bit more involved so rather than completely overwriting it Id suggest calling the parent method using ggprotoparent and then do any additional modification you need dagitty allows to specify a single control point when drawing edges eg dag bb D outcomepos E exposurepos Z pos D Z pos E D E Z pos The edge control points are currently not imported by ggdag which would be convenient for users who use the dagitty web interface to initially build dogs I think the coordinates API is unclear as several people myself included have stumbled over it or missed it altogether I think this needs a few changes Examples in the new customizing DAGs vignette A separate function that can specify coordinates something like dagcoords that will override dagitty object coords and if its already tidied update the tidydag coords However I need to think about the second item more ggraph now uses strength instead of curvature It may make sense to be consistent with this in ggdag With some DAGs its helpful to plot them horizontally rather than vertically eg saving space in journals and reports Flipping the plots is easy enough with coordflip but there are a couple problems with doing that Heres a reprex r librarytidyverse libraryggdag example dagifyY X X A B tidydagittylayout sugiyama Normal topdown graph ggdagexample Flipping this is as easy as adding coordflip r Flipped x and y axis so that the DAG is horizontal ggdagexample coordflip However this now reads from right to left rather than left to right It would be nice to have A and B on the left and Y on the right since English reads left to right top to bottom The only way to do this now is to add scaleyreverse to flip the y axis which is now horizontal thanks to coordflip Doing this creates a message though since scaleycontinuous is already set as part of scaledag Scale for y is already present Adding another scale for y which will replace the existing scale Its easy enough to live with the message and not worry but scaleyreverse also needs additional arguments to make it equivalent to just using scaledag Without expand expandscalec the nodes appear too close to the edge of the plot Adding the expand argument works fine and the DAG flips without issues except for the message r ggdagexample coordflip scaleyreverseexpand expandscalec Scale for y is already present Adding another scale for y which will replace the existing scale It would be cool if there were a more systematic way of doing this like scaledagflip TRUE or something I dont know the best approach though and I dont know if an addition like that fits with the overall philosophy of the package Plus in some situations not reversing the y axis could be helpful ArabicHebrew DAGs that should read right to left horizontally supCreated on by the reprex package v sup Thanks for the package It took me some time to manage to use option uselabels in ggdag Consider dag dagifyy x labels cy outcome x exposure outcome y exposure x Then dag tidydagitty ggdagtext FALSE uselabels label works whereas dag tidydagitty ggdagtext FALSE uselabels labels does not one difference label versus labels Is something subtle happening Im using R version and both the CRAN and development version of the package
