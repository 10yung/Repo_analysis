Dear developers great tool Your README only includes linux as the target architecture in the Java section Is there any reason for that Id like to be able to use Warp with NET Core to target linuxmuslx Right now only linuxx is supported Support for linuxmuslx would allow me to layer binaries onto the mcrmicrosoftcomdotnetcoreruntimedeps alpine container This would save over MB in container size compared to the Debianbased runtimedeps container bringing the total to around MB for container for binary for a basic Hello World application And that would be really lightweight I plan to use this project for cdrcodeserver but Ill need ARM builds since I intend it to be used for ARM builds and possibly for normal builds as part of an experiment I try compile this project but failed like this rootiz xi fyb guktgu ux tz warp make make build make Entering directory rootwarp cargo build p warprunner release target x unknownlinuxgnu Compiling warprunner v rootwarpwarprunner warning trait objects without an explicit dyn are deprecated warprunnersrcmainrs fn main Result BoxError help use dyn dyn Error note warnbaretraitobjects on by default Finished release optimized targets in s strip targetx unknownlinuxgnureleasewarprunner cargo build p warprunner release target x pcwindowsgnu Compiling approx v error E cant find crate for std note the x pcwindowsgnu target may not be installed error aborting due to previous error For more information about this error try rustc explain E error Could not compile approx To learn more run the command again with verbose make build Error make Leaving directory rootwarp make all Error rootiz xi fyb guktgu ux tz warp C Can you help me Thank you very much How do you update the app local cache Right now I m having to manually delete this This threw me a bit as I copied and pasted trying to clear the cache on macOS and this path was wrong Would be really great to make this cache based on a hash or version somehow Is there any way to compile windows executables for bit systems is it possible like with node to make a single executable of a php application such as laravel and composer I see a great need in bundling composer dependencies Create a user with no login shell and no binbash sudo useradd r subversion I am trying to create a systemd service which will be executed by a user of this category Executing the warped application using this user sudo u subversion warped creates error Error Custom kind Other error StringErrorno tarball found inside binary Is there a way run warped dotnet applications for users with no login shell users no binbash users I have to switch some of our net core binaries to run on a rhel x instance and hit a show stopper where warppacker as well as binaries I made with this awesome tool failed to run due to glibc being on for rhel x it wanted Im still learning probably never will stop my ways through linux and didnt see anything obvious where I could change this or an easy way to work around It seemed my options were to either compile glibc outside and place it in rhel or upgrade rhel to x which is probably the better choice but Im not in control of those decisions in what Im facing Thanks for any insight if this is something I can specifyconfig when running warppacker
