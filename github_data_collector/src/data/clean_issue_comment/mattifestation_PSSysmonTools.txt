Do you plan on supporting schema any time soon To increase discovery of this tool and improve management this tool should be available via Chocolatey While I am willing to do so on my own I thought it would be best to have the package uploaded by the maintainer of the original package One thing to note is that since this is a module the chocolateyinstallps installer script should either install directly to the normal PSModulePath or add the installer path typically C ProgramData chocolatey lib to the PSModulePath registry key for autodiscovery
