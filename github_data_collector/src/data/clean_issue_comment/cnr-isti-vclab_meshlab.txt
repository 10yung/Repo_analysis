MeshLab bitfp v OS Windows Currently the minimum width of Project window starts limited by the layer name size Currently the minimum width of Project window increases when the dropdown of a layer is opened and does not decrease when the dropdown is closed If a layer has a very large name the starting minimum width of Project window is too large If the filename associated with a layer is very large when the dropdown of the layer is open and you alttab away and return the minimum width of the Project window becomes too large Expected behavior Be able to reduce Project window width to any size If Project window width increases when a layers dropdown menu opens decrease window width when layers dropdown menu closes Example file to reproduce issue Dear Meshlab developers I really find Meshlab to be invaluable both as a mesh viewer and as a platform on which to quickly experiment with the many algorithms in the VCG library I know that writing this tool was likely many thousands of hours of work maybe even unpaid and surely not wellacknowledged Thank you so much I hope you can continue with your enthusiasm in improving this free software I will now bring up an issue that will likely contradict the existing tradition but I think that it is important to address now that Meshlab is basically the standard tool for mesh viewing The popup asking users to send developers an email which I see every couple of days is a nuisance I understand the logic behind it and again I admire your work But please consider for a moment that your busy day is often interrupted by the Linux kernel your favorite code editor or the app you use to find a date persistently reminding you to thank its creator The first time you likely will be glad to be informed of something you did not know but after a few more attempts you wont appreciate it as much as your life depends on that functionality I will request Meshlab become a mature software part of the vital infrastructure we use daily and limit itself with a standard note in the About menu that mentions the developers with additional information in the documentation etc True well think less of its creators that way but we developers are already used to be contacted only when our stuff is broken and I dont think we need constant praises to do a good job The meshlab documentation at did not see any love for years The meshlab and meshlab txt docs need to be merged and converted to md format Same for meshlabserver and meshlabserver txt The outdated build instructions should be removed as there is a dedicated document for that at The link pointing to needs to be removed as it is dead The meshlabserver page does not explain at all what meshlabserver is It is just a copy and paste job from the meshlab page If I undertand correctly and that page does not say it meshlabsever is a batch mesh processing tool which takes inputs from the command line and outputs files without starting a GUI It also needs to explain what functions it supports how they are invoked and to document the script it can take as input Dear meshlab developers and Paolo in particular I have found meshlab to be very useful in my daily work Thank you for your creation At the same time I think that the popup window that comes up every several days in my intensive usage reminding me to send email to Paolo to tell him how great the tool is is a nuisance If every tool out there that we love to use daily would pester us that way the world would not be a good place Can this popup be turned off vcglib devel branch and meshlab were used This project was run on ubuntu LTS system However errors occurred when make as follows usrbinld cannot find ljhead collect error ld returned exit status Makefile recipe for target distribmeshlab failed make distribmeshlab Error make Leaving directory develmeshlabsrcmeshlab Makefile recipe for target submeshlabmakefirstordered failed make submeshlabmakefirstordered Error The associated solutions in the Issues did not work Could you please give some suggestions There are some plugins that arent in the qmake file despite being in the meshlabplugins directory A few build or build with minor updates filteraging the pro file says no longer needed but it does build and work just fine filterbnpts Same as above though it looks more specialized edithole Needed minor tweaks to build but seems to be OK successfully closed a hole in the stanford bunny edittexture Needed minor tweaks to build segfaults in TextureEditorSelectFromModels call to ResetLayout when you try to use it samplepluginsiom built fine samplepluginssamplexmlfilter built fine samplepluginssampleio built fine Others are outdated enough that they probably should just be removed unless their functionality is sufficiently useful to merit the effort to update them editpickpoints editslice Others I dont know at all samplepluginssamplepclfilter Requires PCL has an unimplemented filterArity method Hi Im trying to import an obj file and I get an error message saying the texture E EL is not found The path to the texture is E EL BEAT XYZ So I guess currently texture paths with spaces are not supported I have installed last snap version on Ubuntu and I obtain a message error While opening homealsenMyShareblobasc Failed to openhomealsenMyShareblobasc when Import Mesh from File menu What is the problem Thanks Alberto Senni Hello We compiled meshlab successfully but it generates the segmentation error when the running the executable meshlab databunnyply in the meshlabsrcdistrib directory Here is the
