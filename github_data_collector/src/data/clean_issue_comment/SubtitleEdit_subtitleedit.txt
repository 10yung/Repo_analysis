problem add new Bold tag when merge with line before and after Hi If I put the cursor inside the textarea and DONT highligt anything then rightclick and select cursive or bold I get an error message Error Message translating from swedish so it might not be the exact words Index outside the intervall It may not be negative and must be less than the size of m ngden Name of parameter index I know its stupid to select cursive whithout selecting any text but I would expect that the application just to ignore it or give me an You must select text to make it cursivebold whatever Windows Subtitle Edit Can repeat it every time It does NOT happen if I dont put the cursor in the textfield first Cheers This has happened to me on multiple occasions so I thought to make a thread When I extract subtitles specially for scene UK some of them are out of sync If you play the video and use the embedded subtitles it plays fine but once you extract them theyre outta sync Eg When extracted subtitles are outta sync I used CCExtractor to extract and it worked fine but with that files loses all of the color tags Beta I use the batch conversion of multiple SUP files to SRT This works superb But as I know from manual conversion sometimes the engine finds some unknown words and some of them are interpreted wrong In the manual conversion you can see the words in a list By using the batch tool I like to have these words as a log file It could be written to the same folder where the SRT is written to and it should contain the words and timestamps to be able to find the position in the SRT file When having a second window open in Subtitle Edit for example when translating with Google and i want to minimize Subtitle Edit it will only do as Windows did back in the old time when we used Windows yes it was a great time Minimizing is great when something takes time to do so that is the reason i want to minimizing Subtitle Edit It would be nice if it could minimize to the toolbar and even nicer if it could minimize to the systray notification bar In this picture you can see what happening if i minimize the Translate with Google screenscraping It would be nice if there is a feature that could set the Save As default directory be the same as the source file or to a custom directory We better get version out soon After years on my todo list SE can now read teletext from ts files thx VS code for the suggestion to debug Auto br of lines is now much more configurable Read more here Also fixes and new convert options for Batch convert TODO x Test import of subs from ts files x Test line break x Test Batch convert x Test SE on Kubuntu General testing fixing bugs I recently upgraded my main installation from to to make use of all the new features I noticed that something with the subtitle preview text has changed somewhere in between those versions the preview text now uses inclusive timings What this means When the out cue of a subtitle is eg and the video position is exactly by using the shortcuts for frame backwardsforwards the subtitle is still visible while its supposed to be hidden since the SubRip timings are exclusive So out cue subtitle gone at While I dont know if this is the original specification most players VLCMPC do work like this Im sycing to shot cuts and the resulting srt doesnt overshoot subtitles by frame Im using mpv and mpv handles preview text is off When I turn it on the subtitle is not visible when on the out cue ie its using exclusive timings The other players dont work properly on my pc so I couldnt test if its isolated to mpv did use exclusive timings so I think something has changed along the way Despite reasons why some of these arent there some may benefit from them Close File not just Exit in the menu File Assigned keys for Changed speed percent Changed speed percent in the batch converter This is the usual read speed of Subtitle Edit And this is the usual speed if I download a file from the same location Because of that I download the file first and then open it locally Funnily this is much faster
