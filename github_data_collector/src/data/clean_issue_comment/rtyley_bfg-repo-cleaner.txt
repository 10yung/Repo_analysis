When trying to remove a specific version of a Git LFS file by its OID I always get the following error java jar bfg jar bi delids myrepofolder Error Option stripblobswithids failed when given delids MainException class orgeclipsejgiterrorsInvalidObjectIdExceptionInvalid id cc cf f e aaadfd ad df adc e d b f f c f a cf d The file delids just consists of a single line where the OID cc cfblahblahblah is listed which I wanted to remove If I do a git log p S cc cf f e aaadfd ad df adc e d b f f c f a cf d all I get the commits listed where this file was added and later removed replaced by a newer version Im desperately trying to get a few Git LFS OIDs out of the history of my git repo to have it clean again git push u origin master To rejected master master nonfastforward error failed to push some refs to hint Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind hint its remote counterpart Integrate the remote changes eg hint git pull before pushing again hint See the Note about fastforwards in git push help for details The command is java jar dbfg jar converttogitlfs pngdllexepptpptxdocdocxdocmdotdotxdotmxls and many more noblobprotection direction It changes some files but for examples some png files are not changed to lfs and I do not know why Also how can I modify the script or the command so that the endings of the files png will change also if its like PNG or PnG etc I am new to git and the lfs system so I would appreciate every little help Thank you very much I ran java jar bfgjar noblobprotection stripblobswithids allblobstxt testrepo The allblobstxt file contained one blob sha for testingnupkg e de bb d d b b ae ad c e c This file was added but never updated and size was bytes However I see the below output indicating text txt was also deleted Filename Git id testingnupkg e de b B text txt e de b B The end result was that many commits were updated If I run the command with deletefiles java jar bfgjar deletefiles testingnupkg testrepo noblobprotection Then it only deletes the specified file Filename Git id testing nupkg e de b B So looks like stripblobswithids behaves differently and its concerning that BFG simply removes the file without any warning One reason this could be is that Git reuses the same blob as both were bytes and BFG simply is not checking filenames That said not sure how BFG would know what files to keep and what to delete based on blob id Nonetheless the fact that e de b was removed not sure what happens to text txt Great tool btw and thank you for providing it Hey all Im trying to clean some repos of mine and Im running the following command to start in the mirror clone of my repo bfg replacetext txtfilewhatIwantremoved noblobprotection The problem Im running into is that some of the files changed are functional tests and I would like to somehow ignore these json files Is there anyway to do that Thanks Hello Im trying to clean a repo in bitbucket with BFG repo cleaner When i try to push the cleaned repo i get this error message remote You are attempting to update refs that are reserved for Bitbuckets pull request functionality Bitbucket manages these refs automatically and they may not be updated by users I did never create any pull requests but i see that the so called pullrequestref points to a commit with the word pull in the commit message Is that an error in the BFG code or is bitbucket the problem I already found a solution but i dont want to set up a new repo because im not the owner of it and i think this might be a bug in BFG Thanks for all advices Christoph Is it possible to use the bfg repo cleaner to remove a specific commits from history I know it could be done with git alone but for a scenario when the commit is long in the past it is quite hard and some tool helping with that would be great Push failed after cleaning the repo Followed the same steps as mentioned on the page git clone mirror sshgitgittradingcom repogit cd repogit java jar bfgjar stripblobsbiggerthan M protectblobsfrom DEVELOP DEVELOP DEVELOP DEVELOP DEVELOP DEVELOP DEVELOP DEVELOPARC branchTestmaster git reflog expire expirenow all git gc prunenow aggressive git push Please help how to fix this issue I have checked the permission on the project On branch master merge is allowed for maintainer And i am a maintainer of the project which means i can push to the repo Regards Kamal Rajput It would be nice if I could install bfg through a snap package on my system
