Added ability to set config values from environment settings Create config values if they dont already exist Added xmlpoke ability to allow setting other values in the config files Changed config values to be hierarchical to make the config cleaner I would like to have the ability to apply environment specific config transforms to the app config file This can be done using code like this But I am not sure how that would work with PowerShell remoting since its using an assembly that would probably have to be copied down to the server Also I would like to have the ability to have the config transform file sitting on the deployment server with my deployment scripts vs having to have them sitting in the source repository or in the zip file This is because they would probably have sensitive settings in them Thoughts Any script CMD or BAT for install AppRolla using PowerShellexe Maybe use Powershell command for use script ps newobject NetWebClientDownloadString iex For example Might be a good idea Batch jobs seems to be a commen enterprise thing Surely most stuff should be event driven but theres a lot i mean ALOT of old batch jobs out there
