I have installed FengNiao When I try to run the command I am getting the following error my OSX version is B This copy of libswiftCoredylib requires an OS version prior to zsh abort fengniao Hi I dont have access to install this in usrlocalbin is there any other solution to perform with this tool FengNiao img width alt src installsh localhostFengNiao test installsh error product dependency CommandLineKit not found error product dependency CommandLineKit not found cp buildreleaseFengNiao No such file or directory project bundle For example I have a image named Landscape xpng and another Landscapeipad xpng It will delete the last one Currently you have to supply exclude paths via inline arguments fengniao exclude Pods However in situations when your app displays assets based on image names returned by API you will want to exclude a lot of filespaths It will be handy to have an ignore like file similar to gitignore so that each time I run fengniao I wont need to remember which files I need to exclude This file could be called fengniaoignore and be structured similarly to gitignore Let me know what you think about it and I can make a PR for it Thanks for the handy utility When using FengNiao via command line mode I would have a verbose argument in order to see what fileresource is currently scanning
