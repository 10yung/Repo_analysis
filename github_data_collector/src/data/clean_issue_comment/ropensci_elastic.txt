related to related to I can see a use case for a config file with connection details for or more elasticsearch instances and then connect pulls in that info eg r connectfile essetupyml where yaml host someipaddress path search transportschema https user foo pwd bar errors complete or to support many do yaml setupone host someipaddress path search transportschema https user foo pwd bar errors complete setuptwo host someotheripaddress path query transportschema http user hello pwd world errors simple and then call in the details you want like r connectfile listsetuptwo essetupyml or some other thing not sure via ES version information is essentially required to use this pkg I think the solution might be to have a separate config option to either pass the version info in directlymanually eg connectversion give a path that the version can be retrived from has to be similar to what ES gives at the root path but at a different path eg connectpingpath foobar let elastic pkg get the version as it does now from root path Is there a way to write a sparkR dataframe or RDD to ElasticSearch with multiple nodes This elastic package for R is great for normal interactions with ElasticSearch but says nothing about hadoop distributed dataframes or RDDs in SparkR When I try to use it I get the following errors installpackageselastic repos libraryelastic sparkRsessionenableHiveSupport TRUE df readjsonhadoopfilelocation connectesport eshost esuser username espwd password docsbulkdf Error no docsbulk method for class SparkDataFrame If this were PySpark I would use the rddsaveAsNewAPIHadoopFile function as shown here but I cant find any information about it in SparkR from googling ElasticSearch also has good documentation but only for Scala and Java Note that my elastic cluster has multiple nodes and in Zeppelin I am using the spark r interpreter This is a repost of a SO question via using nginxreverse proxy andor caddy w equiv elasticseearchpy does this python In essearch DEBUGurllib utilretryConverted retries value False RetrytotalFalse connectNone readNone redirect INFOurllib connectionpoolStarting new HTTP connection localhost WARNINGelasticsearchGET statusNA request s DEBUGurllib utilretryConverted retries value False RetrytotalFalse connectNone readNone redirect INFOurllib connectionpoolStarting new HTTP connection localhost WARNINGelasticsearchGET statusNA request s DEBUGurllib utilretryConverted retries value False RetrytotalFalse connectNone readNone redirect INFOurllib connectionpoolStarting new HTTP connection localhost WARNINGelasticsearchGET statusNA request s DEBUGurllib utilretryConverted retries value False RetrytotalFalse connectNone readNone redirect INFOurllib connectionpoolStarting new HTTP connection localhost WARNINGelasticsearchGET statusNA request s ConnectionError ConnectionErrorurllib connectionHTTPConnection object at x dd d Failed to establish a new connection Errno Connection refused caused by NewConnectionErrorurllib connectionHTTPConnection object at x dd d Failed to establish a new connection Errno Connection refused cant remember why maybe there was a good reason not to have them
