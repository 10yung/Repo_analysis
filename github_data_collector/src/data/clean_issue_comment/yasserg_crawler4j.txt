It is possible to configure the database names from the CrawlControler constructor It allowed me to create multiple CrawlerControllers on the same working directory without having the URLs mixed between them Substituting because I broke the branch Hey I am currently facing problem with servers which have regular expressions within their robotstxt which require an unreasonable amount of computing time to match for using RobotstxtServerjava Eg Useragent Disallow Disallow Matching for the url asdjdsfsdfjkhejrhwjerhjkfdhksdjfhksjdfhjksdfhjksfdhjksdfasdasddjsjqueryjquerymigrateminjs

connections idle longer than SECONDS Is there a way around this HELLO All i have multiple working crawlers run together eg crawler crawler crawler my question is what if i want to shut down crawler number only i imagine that every crawler in crawler j has a session ID and i can shut it off while requesting its ID HOW CAN I IMPLEMENT THAT More details The image size condition will never take effect change the parentheses position Extracted interfaces from Parser and PageFetcher in order to make it easier to create totally custom classes Support for POST requests by using isPost method in WebURL This commit allows users to add WebURLs and mark them as POST URLs Current parsers do not get PostURLs however users can add their custom post URLs either as seeds or using the visit method It is based on the authentication methods already provided by Crawler j May need improvement in DocIDServer because it is using an encoded version of the URL with all the POST data Encoding decoding of WebURLs to string for DBs could also be improved maybe using a hash Modifications WebURLs have a post flag and can store post parameters as BasicNameValuePair inspired in post form auth WebURLTupleBinding can serializedeserialize the new WebURL PageFetcher can now create POST request PageFetchResult can hold now a complete WebURL DocIDServer uses an encoded version of the URL which contains the post data It allows you to visit the same URL multiple times if the post parameters are different You can add WebURLs directly as seeds Depth will be reset to zero and POST parameters will be taken into consideration Some minor internal deprecation suggestions given the new features Theyll only affect custom complex overriden crawlers Everything is still backwards compatible I dont know gradle so Im not sure why this is giving compile errors on travis but it seems that theres a problem in the config or in the master rather than in my commit Could someone please take a look It is not working on Android I tested on a new project when I put the dependency on gradle and run console return this error FAILURE Build failed with an exception What went wrong Execution failed for task

cant build This methods documentation says that Lower key values results in earlier crawling But if this byte array is converted into Long or Double then this particular line should always result in positive value because itll be the most significant byte If it contains negative values then the most significant bit will be set to Then if the conversion happens in the Java environment the absolute value will be negative and thus signifies a very small number So the logic will not be true according to documentation Please change in documentation that URL priority should always be a positive value for the logic to be true usage of apache commons lang for better performance
