 Is it possible to increase the delay time of a combination I have longer combinations on my web app like a r c g or a r c g k and they take a bit time to think press Hi madrobby okonet agnoster devongovett jlukic ctrlenter dont work this is my code js textareaonkeydown null ctrlenter function e No coming why Just want to be able to set scope back to previous one without setting a variable and without knowing what the previous scope was In my current application I have many components where when a specific component is mounted I want it to use its scope and when that component dismounts back to previous scope my component doesnt need to know the previous scope Support INSERT Key also aka when refocusing window Teh problem In our app we use keyisPressedKEYSALT to detect when alt is pressed to execute some alternatepoweruserhidden actions We noticed that very often alt is being detected as pressed while it was in fact Not pressed Teh steps This can be reproducible quite easily especially when alt is being used for Alfred or Spotlight Focus pageapp Press and hold alt Unfocus pageapp can be by focusing dev tools Release alt Focus pageapp consolelogkeyisPressed keygetPressedKeyCodes In longlived apps you ll notice that keygetPressedKeyCodes tends to get bigger and bigger The only way to reset it is finding and pressing all the keys present in the array Teh fix Reseting downKeys on resetModifiers fixes that I can t really think of a falsepositive or unexpected behaviour since keyisPressed don t work for keys pressed prior to focusing pageapp keyCode of delete or del on mac is not which not dispatch the event Feature Request Unbind Scope Motivaiton I often find myself writing the following code javascript up down esc forEachkey keymasterunbindthisscope key While this works it could potentially lead to memory leaks if a specific key is forgotten Eg if my module would have registered keyspace thisscope cb Proposed Solution A possibility to remove every eventhandler for a given scope would be very helpful Possible APIs javascript keymasterunbindnull thisscope keymasterunbindScopethisscope Discussion If such a feature is desired I would be willing to send a PR along with tests This being said I would love to get your input on this beforehand Do you consider the usecase good enough to add this functionality to keymaster And if yes what would the ideal API for this be
