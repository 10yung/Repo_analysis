Hi today Ive build the zip but first had to change the kernel version from to in updatesh and buildsh because the linuximagekernelimage rpi is not in the repos anymore Could you please update the files It seems that the Raspbian kernel development is dead in the water Changing over to the Raspberry Pi Foundation kernel or supporting both via a parameter perhaps should be considered Please use this issue to discuss the pros cons whatifs and howtos some packages that might be needed during installation eg firmwareralink from nonfree needed for WiFi setup but arent available because the source isnt listed in etcaptsourceslist I propose a new setting which by default would be empty and would enable the installer to create a file ie etcaptsourceslistdraspbianuainstlist this way the installer would have access to packages from that repository as well at least I think it would would be nice angel
