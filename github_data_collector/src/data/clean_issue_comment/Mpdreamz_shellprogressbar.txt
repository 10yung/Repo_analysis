Ive got a console app that Im looking to have a displayed progress two layers deep but also have log output to the console Unfortunately the logger Serilog in my case and ShellProgressBar dont play well with each other and are constantly overwriting each other which leaves the console an incomprehensible mess Is there any way to prevent this or do I need to research how to make a custom Serilog console sink Like maybe somehow force it to stick to certain lines or percentage of the screen or something thanks E In the new Windows Terminal When you start a new timer at the bottom of the terminal like this Each Tick breaks the progress bar up in multiple lines like this Repro steps Open a new Windows terminal Make sure you are at the bottom of the terminal Start a new progressbar Expected I dont want the progressbar to be broken in several lines Actual The progressbar is broken up in several lines for each tick OBS I get the same behavioure in a terminal in VS Code Hello I love shellprogressbar duration column overflows on fullwidth characters such as CJK or Emoji contained message The program has no problem but it looks like weired I think that Emoji will be used frequently in the future Expected expected Actual actual Is it possible to manually collapse a child when the option is set to CollapseWhenFinished false Im using with Net framework Nothing appears except the first line I changed some of code parts but console still not showing like the net core example Is there a way to send messages to the progress bar for it to display permanently I am thinking of something like how gradle works Currently the issue I am dealing with is that NLog is sending messages to the console and the cursor reset makes everything look janky I have disabled console logging but would love a solution that could both display a progress bar and display permanent messages if pbarCompletedHandleWaitOnewait ConsoleErrorWriteLinenameofFixedDurationBar did not signal nameofFixedDurationBarCompletedHandle after wait s should be shown when progressbar is on bottom of the screen Added an option to set an estimated duration for a progress bar In some cases you are able to calculate the estimated duration for an task eg downloads or uploads This option is deactivated by default and can be set in the ProgressBarOptions The estimated duration can be set by using the new overload of the Tick method or by setting the EstimatedDuration property on the progress bar
