Hi ErlangRT isnt working with the latest rust nightly it was breaking because of ramp So I issued a pr to fix ramp which has been merged and released There are still thing breaking in the code but at least its a start Check compatible BEAM version instruction count field or something like that x bsstartmatch bsgetinteger bsgetfloat bsgetbinary bsskipbits bstesttail bssave bsrestore replicate bin environment and support basic command line for erlexec and ctrun x Make ctrun work Make erlexec work Make erl and make it run the emulator Or possibly simplify startup of the whole thing by adding a shared lib for all
