Hello Im try to compile old versions of utox but got fail I see here in this BUILDmd the following package toxcore x and there is inside that libtoxcoretoktokbuildwindowsx staticreleasezip I can see the following files lib libvpxa lib libopusa lib libopusla lib libsodiuma lib libsodiumla lib libtoxcorea But compiler return me an error because libtoxdnsa and libtoxava and compilation is terminated

libtoxdnsa and libtoxava Can you compile it and attach it here please A bridge between Tox and Matrix matrixorg Here is corresponding issue on Matrix side I know it probably one of the most asked questions But I cant find a detailed or even a simple explanation How the software identifies an user without revealing the IP if the core idea of tox is p p and a centralized identification makes tox not p p at all Also some informations about that hash functioning tox ID and how it replaces the IP sharing would be great to be at FAQ After reading the doc DHT protocol ToxDocsText even bep I know a lot about the toxcores run mode but its still very hard to get a comprehensive description in my mind I think a comprehensive description in brief and friendly to an ordinaryadvanced users is necessary Here is what confused me in DHT protocol mentioned friends list it stors clients informationie ip addresses port nodeid timestamp of the friend closest to each frienddoes it store the friends informationsame as above in ToxDocsText mentioned onion modelbut i dont know if has it been implemented by the toxcoreand is ToxDocs reliableie things mentioned in it is just in working and absolutely not done in bep it has the concept node and peer so dose toxcore creat a new idor called peerid or chatid infacta keypairs pub key when an user startup a client program and just for this conversation if it doeshow does it work between nodeid and the new id if it createdbut not just for this conversationdoes toxcores route table inluding the clent list andor friends list said in DHT protocol is base on the newly created idor called peerid or not dose toxcore chat with a friend on a onion model by defaltie not directly to his friend but through a random first jump and jump sevral times to his friend if it doeshow does it work if it doesnthow does it work it seems that the Toxcore todo list doesnt sync where could i get a brief and complete description about how does it work in detail Could the READMEmd include a DidLst that well sync and a A brief and complete description about how does it work in detail Good day I am trying to print out the value of a friend who sent message No matter what I am trying cant get it to work Ive looked into your code in other c files and you were printing uint t friendnumber normaly with printf How Ive tried so far include inttypesh for PRI and etc void friendmessagecbTox tox uint t friendnumber TOXMESSAGETYPE type const uint t message sizet length void userdata printf lu n friendnumber printf lu n unsigned longfriendnumber printf PRIu n uint t friendnumber Hello I use latest toxic and tox on gentoo Toxic is connected through Tor with udp disabled Toxic reports v r After long use it loose any connectivity with all contacts but toxic showing it is online People on qtox seeing me offline forever me too Right after I restart toxic connectivity is immediately restored and I see online people and they see me This happens every day or once per days for long time Now when people started reaching me by phone saying WTF where are you on tox I decided to create this issue Please help PS I created this issue on toxic but I think it is CORErelated Please go easy on me Im a complete novice to Github I compiled toxcore with enabledaemon flag as specified in the guide then copied and edited toxbootstrapdconf The only changes I made in the file were set enableipv to true and specify valid nodes at the bottom I checked everything to be working both through the systemd unit with the status command and with netstat The latter shows that only tcp and udp ports are used netstat luptn egrep tox tcp LISTEN toxbootstrapd tcp LISTEN toxbootstrapd udp toxbootstrapd What am I doing wrong As we all know today more than ever before it is crucial to be able to trust our computing environments One of the main difficulties that package maintainers of Linux distributions face is the difficulty to verify the authenticity and the integrity of the source code The Arch Linux team would appreciate it if you would provide us GPG signatures in order to verify easily and quickly of your source code releases Overview of the required tasks x Tag a release on github x Please create andor use a bit RSA keypair for the file signing The key may be used for email encryption too Keep your key secret use a strong unique passphrase for the key x Upload the public key to a key server x Sign every new commit by default x Sign new tags Verify the Github Release tarball download against your local source x Sign Github Release tarballs Additional Information Thanks Hey irungentoo Ive created these two issues Please Ive created first one months ago take a look at it carefully and merge it or say whats left I was unable to build the tox jso myself and your Jenkins fails to create it either Both of these issues are passing most tests etc I hope you are still delighted to make Tox project totally working and final This project is really a future please help building it and make one more step to its greatness Lets make Tox better
