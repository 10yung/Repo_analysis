Hi did any body get a chance to find a tutorial on how to use this gem on Mac I have been playing around with it but do not seem to get anywhere I am at stage zero after installing the gem I found a few articles where people seem to have figured out how to use it but I am not that advanced on rails yet Would appreciate some help Where to put the class myRecommander recommendifybase Where to add the recommender Myrecommenderner where to add the set creation please Thank you I dont understand how cosine works It looks like it does not implement the correct functions inputmatrix thingother native true similarityfunc cosine recommenderthingotherprocess Traceback most recent call last from irb RuntimeError implemented in subclass Looking at the code it looks like there are unimplemented methods on the class Is this expected Creating an input matrix jaccard with a redis db other than results in the correct items and ccmatrix being created as data is added but empty similarities values when process is called This appears to be because the db is not taken into account by the native recommendify command AFAICT it never gets passed to it Theres too many people running their own forks In the method serializeitem in similaritymatrixrb I found there could be a bug when converting similarity metrics into a string the original code is like this def serializeitemitemid maxprecision items writequeue itemid toa itemssort ab b a items items maxneighbors items itemsmap is s istos maxprecision nil itemscompact end the issue is at statement stos maxprecision For some cases the value of s could be a fairly small floating point number when converting it to string Ruby will use scientific notation as the result of stos For example e After executing stos maxprecision given maxprecision the return string will become which causes the similarity result being enlarged incorrectly I would suggest to change stos maxprecision to sprintmaxprecisionf s with sprintf the above example will output it is an edge case there could be other better solution to it but just want to share my findings on this issue Thank you very much for the great gem MetaSync rootbt msfupdate

helpful for ruby newbies like me Once you build the Recommendify gem where do you go from there Do you have to write a new model like in the example Trying to copy that code into a model file gives the error uninitialized constant Recommendify does not recognize it as a gemmodule Tips Thanks ps running recommendify on windows Fixes Right now if youre trying to work from a Redis database other than you must use the Ruby similarity implementation because the database info does not get passed to the C extension When using multiple recommenders in a script eg for cross validation the redisprefix was the same for input matrices of all recommenders Whats more all recommenders had access to all input matrices of all other recommenders This patch fixes these problems and enables testing different recommenders in a script to see if their difference of performance is statistically significant Tests really pass now
