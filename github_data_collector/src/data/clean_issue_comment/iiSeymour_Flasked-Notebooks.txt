Hey this is great stuff Im really excited by this concept I just tried running your example made no code changes and somehow got this error ZMQSocketChannel object has no attribute execute Is this something you have run into before Could it be my IPython version Thanks Proof of concept for dynamically rendering IPython Notebooks using Flask Yep I used flask at the beginning of nbviewer but we definitively need something async to handle many requests in parallel hence we moved to tornado Unlike nbviewer each code cell in a notebook is executed on request Cool using ipythonipython and ipythonipython nbconvert should get the ability to run the notebook on the fly which will then only be a config option on nbviewer your input on it would be great It wont be enable by default for obvious performance reasons and also because most of the time we wont get the library installed Running apppy starts the flask site which renders the markdown and updated code output cells Yes work great locally for me Notebooks are rendered within the existing flask site using the normal templating approach Im not sure I get what you mean here Can you develop Do you think we can do better in nbviewer itself Pages can be developed by starting the IPython Notebook server in the notebooks directory I do not get that either do you mean that your app is serving files from the local filesystem
