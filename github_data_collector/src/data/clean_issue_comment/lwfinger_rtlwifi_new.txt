I am using a hp laptop with rtl de After upgrading the kernel to the WiFi stopped working It was working fine till the kernel x When I clone the rtlwifi directory it fails to make screenshot attached Screenshot from Im not sure how to properly gather relevant information for the report or if this is the appropriate repository Please let me know if Im posting on the wrong place Once Ive upgraded to kernel from the wireless is unusable NetworkManager still finds the wireless interface find access points and connects to them But the connection goes down and up so quickly and all the time that Im unable to use it at all Not sure what information I should gather for a proper report The issue persists on and Hello first thanks for the great work on those drivers My kernel version Linux arch I try to use this card Realtek Semiconductor Co Ltd RTL EE PCIe Wireless Whenever I try to interact with it I get those cryptic kernel messages and it break my built in NIC Intel Corporation I Gigabit Network Connection rev The only workaround I have is to reboot at this point kernel igb Detected Tx Unit Hang Tx Queue TDH TDT nexttouse nexttoclean bufferinfo nexttoclean timestamp ffff nexttowatch f c a jiffies ffff d descstatus Ive build the driver from this repository as explained in the README and the behavior stays the same Im sure its not an hardware issue because under Windows everything works find with the realtek driver Do you have any idea where should I start looking Tests below conducted in an area with uncongested WiFi channels and no bluetooth devices anywhere Driver is built with extra CFLAGS Ofast frenameregisters mtunenative But you will get the same results with the defaults Driver is running with ips Tested on Linux with RT patchset IPERF TEST PHONE CLIENT LINUX

mean due to retries DMESG OUTPUT DURING TESTS rtl ee Using firmware rtlwifirtl eefwbin rtl ee wlp s renamed from wlan Not very informative huh Lets retry the tests this time with the driver being more verbose Ill also have Hostapd spit out what its doing Driver now with ips debuglevel Well dmesg didnt show anything new Hostapd doesnt care about data it just handles WiFi protocol stuff Anyway something interesting was that despite the AP considering the signal strength as dBm the phone only registers dBm short distance That may be due to high gain antennas on the AP improving reception or just the transmission being weak I dont know The phone also reports the maximum speed of the link as Mbps at close range During transmission ee claims to run at M bitrate max I even enforced it with sudo iwconfig wlp s bit Mbps after the first test But the actual bandwidth ends up being a measly Kbitssec and the iperf server reports a bitrate of Mbitssec Driver was from latest commit in rtlwifinew extended branch Now despite disabling Link Power Save on the driver increasing performance by a little bit this should not be necessary as it shows the implementation of lps is faulty

vendor driver for ee Is there a way to have the driver be more verbose Perhaps collecting more runtime information would lead to the cause of the issue Im interested in debugging this device for rtlwifinew Hello Ive been using this driver RTL DE on Fedora with kernels x and Fedora with kernels very successfully Today I installed Fedora that comes with kernel downloaded latest version of rtlwifinew using git and tried to install as usually but does not work Then upgraded all packages and new kernel is but it still does not work The driver compiles installs and aparently loads at boot time or with modprobe with no errors or problems but when starting KDE Plasma it simply does not detect any network as if there was any wireless device available NOTE Latest kernel on repositories is kernel and kerneldevel BUT kernelheaders is and THERE IS NO OTHER PACKAGE AVAILABLE I dont know if the problem is the the version of the kernelheaders different from kernel version or the KDE network manager or some actualzation to the rtlwifinew driver the previous version I have does not compile and the latest version compiles but does not work By now I restored my old Fedora backup to work while I can get my RTL DE working on Fedora I have backup of Fedora and so I can restore a readytouse installation to try setting up rtlwifinew again Any recommendation to discover if the problem is the kernel kernelheaders version or the wifi driver or the KDE Maybe a set of console commands which ones to check the status of the driver and the wifi hardware Thanks Whenever I install the driver and reboot my machine after logging the screen get glitched and shows nothing but a black screen I tried several times with a fresh install of the kali machine Messages are logged The card is used as an access point generic Ubuntu x RTL AE ac PCIe Wireless Network Adapter When running make I get this error tmpcco FYt s Error unknown loc subdirective view tmpcco FYt s Error unknown pseudoop lvu up

pulseaudio moduleloopbackc Too many underruns increasing latency to ms Is this my laptops wifiBluetooth module hardware issue or driver firmware issue I have an rtl de laptop hp qcy au have compiled driver from extended branch PC can connect to my personal hotspots just fine which are WPA PSK or similar My university AP uses following config SSID STUDENT Encryption WPA PEAP Inner Authentication MSCHAPV No module parameters changed Signal is OK although not as strong as Ralink MT U adapter But Ralink adapter connects instantaneously while in case of rtl de driver only one dot of network manager widget turns green and other doesnt And it times out I am quite new to linux and dont know how to get debug output for networkmanager If someone tell how I can provide debug output also Thanks
