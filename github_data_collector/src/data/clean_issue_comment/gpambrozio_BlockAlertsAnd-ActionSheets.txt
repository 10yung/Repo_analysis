 adjustsLetterSpacingToFitWidth is deprecated first deprecated in iOS in BlockAlertViewm hi im writing an ipad app that work only in landscape mode The BlockActionSheet work correctly only in portait mode how can solve this Fixes Added code to be able to handle multiple textfields in an alertview simply by passing in placeholders for the desired textfields Placeholders should be blank if no placeholder is required An outlet has also been provided to be able to access the value in the textfields from the block for the Done button There were a number of left over methods after these changes which I could not see a use for so I have removed them to avoid clutter unneccesary complexity The current master branch only allows for textField to be held within an AlertView Hello Ive been trying to resolve this issue with the BlockAlertView component which doesnt display any text or render a background when invoked All that is seen are two sets of three dots in the middle of the screen My investigations have revealed that in the show method the background image is being set by using the format alertcolorbuttonpng for the image file name but the resultant image object has a nil value I can confirm that the image resides in the file system and in the Resources sub folder The Podsresourcessh file also has this file with the correct path in the installresource method call Any pointers in the right direction will surely be helpful Thanks Ashley updatehostscreenwithinvisiblealertcropped Im really struggling with something that should be easy How to change the color of the celltableView Tried the following with no luck alerttableViewbackgroundView nil alerttableViewbackgroundColor UIColor blackColor cellbackgroundViewbackgroundColor UIColor blackColor cellbackgroundColor UIColor blackColor celltextLabelbackgroundColor UIColor blackColor See here The problem When running my unit tests the voidinitialize method gets called and signals a HALT The offending selector is UIFont boldSystemFontOfSize which tells us that it cant deduce the device type when running from Terminal Unknown Device Type Using UIUserInterfaceIdiomPad based on screen size The offending code objc voidinitialize if self BlockAlertView class background UIImage imageNamedkAlertViewBackground background background stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth topCapHeightkAlertViewBackgroundCapHeight retain backgroundlandscape UIImage imageNamedkAlertViewBackgroundLandscape backgroundlandscape backgroundlandscape stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth topCapHeightkAlertViewBackgroundCapHeight retain titleFont UIFont boldSystemFontOfSize retain messageFont UIFont systemFontOfSize retain buttonFont UIFont boldSystemFontOfSize retain The solution objc voidinitialize if self BlockAlertView class background UIImage imageNamedkAlertViewBackground background background stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth topCapHeightkAlertViewBackgroundCapHeight retain backgroundlandscape UIImage imageNamedkAlertViewBackgroundLandscape backgroundlandscape backgroundlandscape stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth topCapHeightkAlertViewBackgroundCapHeight retain How would I go about adding fixed width buttons for the BlockAlertView I want them to extend nearly the width of the alert view but currently their width is dependent on the length of the buttons text I tried simply adding a fixed width of in the buttons frame but if the buttons text label is relatively short then the second button will appear offframe I cant figure out how to get that working correctly BTW I tried just adding spaces around the label text this works fine in iOS but the text appears offcenter in iOS Thanks
