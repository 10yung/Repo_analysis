Greetings butteraugli developers and contributors We re reaching out because your project is an important part of the open source ecosystem and we d like to invite you to integrate with our fuzzing service OSSFuzz OSSFuzz is a free fuzzing infrastructure you can use to identify security vulnerabilities and stability bugs in your project OSSFuzz will Continuously run at scale all the fuzzers you write Alert you when it finds issues Automatically close issues after they ve been fixed by a commit Many widely used open source projects like OpenSSL FFmpeg LibreOffice and ImageMagick are fuzzing via OSSFuzz which helps them find and remediate critical issues Even though typical integrations can be done in LoC we have a reward program in place which aims to recognize folks who are not just contributing to open source but are also working hard to make it more secure We want to stress that anyone who meets the eligibility criteria and integrates a project with OSSFuzz is eligible for a reward To help you getting started we can attach our internal fuzzer for your project that you are welcome to use directly or to use it as a starting point If youre not interested in integrating with OSSFuzz it would be helpful for us to understand why lack of interest lack of time or something else so we can better support projects like yours in the future If we ve missed your question in our FAQ feel free to reply or reach out to us at ossfuzzoutreachgooglegroupscom Thanks Tommy OSSFuzz Team I am using g Debian deb u I get the following error while trying to build using MakeFile butterauglimaincc error invalid conversion from JSAMPROW aka char to const uint t aka const unsigned char fpermissive const uint t const BUTTERAUGLIRESTRICT row buffer butterauglimaincc error invalid conversion from JSAMPROW aka char to const uint t aka const unsigned char fpermissive const uint t const BUTTERAUGLIRESTRICT row buffer This change enables multifile input mode similar to what dssim has Sample use I tried to make the change in a way so that the diff is less intrusive If you find that the multifile mode is useful for butteraugli and want it refactored differently let me know and Ill update the PR The issues with the change heatmap input filename somewhat collides with image isMultiFileMode tries to avoid any possible issues ProcessFile possibly adds alpha to rgb so image and image could be rgb but image could be rgba which would change rgb to rgba In any case it was quite inconvenient to constantly run butteraugli with different filenames that I constantly needed to compare that I find this option to be a musthave corrected printf modifier for sizet replaced lu with zu missing ltalgorith gt include added needed by stdminmax added staticcastuint t for nullptr to be able to resolve ctor for bytes Hi I get a butteraugli score when processing this images Butteraugli can be in a range between and when quality is but I think is wrong Whats wrong my terminal img width alt src input image image guetzli output image q oimage Fixes skohlmann cc Output format name version commit index commit hash Example output butteraugli version cc a d aca f b bfb d d c b Please add a command line parameter to print the version of butteraugli Version has these key improvements over Fix deflate stored bug when pulling last block from window Permit immediate deflateParams changes before any deflate input
