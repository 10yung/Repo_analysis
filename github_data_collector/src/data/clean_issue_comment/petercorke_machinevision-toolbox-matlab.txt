Is there any plan for porting this toolbox to Julia language merge rgticks functionality into colourspace also do ticks for xy space deprecate rgticks fairly broken Need to have the label flag otherwise it wont display It seems there are no start up files in common Fixes bug in distortion Homogeneous coordinates were used instead of euclidian to compute pixel distances Includes the computation of distortion when projecting rays Includes a handy undistortion function to directly undistort pixel coordinates Includes undistortion when computing the pose I found some issues while trying to update the D drawing of the Camera Object Apparently this was caused by the deprecated variable hcamera D which seemed to be replaced by hvisualize in the last versions of the toolbox Now I can change the camera pose T and the drawing is updated correctly Thanks for the toolbox its amazing icorner with patch returns unit vector descriptors PointFeaturematch subtracts these is this right Modify closest to do dot product not just subtraction Do the Zisserman trick on descriptors eported by cosmaclivecom Feb What steps will reproduce the problem b ireadbuilding pnggreydouble C icornerb nfeat C icornerb nfeat suppress What is the expected output What do you see instead For the first call of icorner it should return the first strongest corners For the second call it should return the first strongest corners that do not overlap regarding a circle with the radius of pixels the corner should be more dispersed in the output image But both calls return exactly the same first strongest corners What version of the product are you using On what operating system Vision Windows x and Matlab R a Please provide any additional information below Reviewing the icorner source code I found the problem line d sqrt sumfeaturesvy featuresux This line compute the sum of the distances between current corner and the corners already saved on the solution In this case d is a scalar But we need to compute the individual distances between the current corner and each corner part of the solution In this case d it will be an array Regarding to the minimum value from d we can take a decision if we keep the corner or not Fix d sqrtfeaturesvy featuresux Because of this modification we need to do one more thing add a new index to the loop We already have one for parsing the list of corners which in the current implementation is i and we need one more for the output array We need to keep increasing i on each iteration but j the second index only if we keep the current corneris part of the solution Attached to this report is also the icornerm modified file Best Regards Andrei Reported by nibeshmastran Apr What steps will reproduce the problem opening the censusm fileIT is not complete What is the expected output What do you see instead What version of the product are you using On what operating system Please provide any additional information below
