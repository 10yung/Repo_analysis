The net package has some good examples for writing socket servers but it doesnt provide a full example for a robust echo server that reads all data from clients around errors and EOFs ioReaders docs say When Read encounters an error or endoffile condition after successfully reading n bytes it returns the number of bytes read It may return the nonnil error from the same call or return the error and n from a subsequent call An instance of this general case is that a Reader returning a nonzero number of bytes at the end of the input stream may return either err EOF or err nil The next Read should return EOF This is something thats not hard to demonstrate with fairly little amount of code and a robust socket echo server would make a good example In the example of directory I try to run the program but meet a bug in my VS Code cannot use visit type funcstring osFileInfo error error as type filepathWalkFunc in argument to filepathWalk golangorgxsyncerrgroup is a semiofficial package for managing multiple goroutines and propertly propagating their errors with cancellation support via a context We should add an example of errgroup or at least mention it in the WaitGroup example pointing folks to it for more advanced use cases Removes vendor directory and uses chroma syntax highlighting instead githubcomalecthomaschroma Add gomod Generates files with new generatego Syntax highlighting seems to be slightly different I found this greatly simplifies the code dependencies Refer Via personal email One function that might be worth adding to is how to change the location from UTC to California time ny timeLoadLocationAmericaNewYork fmtPrintln Location ny n n Time timeNowInny I havent thought about if I want to include this just noting for now Coming from this reddit comment I think the WaitGroup example could be improved by having the worker function just be a worker function and performing the wgDone an anonymous goroutine in the calling context You could still mention that syncWaitGroups need to be passed by pointer at the bottom of the example if you felt that was important See d Maybe upgrade to v of BlackFriday
