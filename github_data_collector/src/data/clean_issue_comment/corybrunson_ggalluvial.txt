 Description of the issue When a continuous variable is passed to x the stats pass correct locations to the geoms However the geom parameters width and knotpos take only fixed values and cannot take the differences between axes into account This limits their flexibility in such plots as illustrated below It should be possible to specify that stratum widths and spline knot positions be proportional to betweenaxis differences hence take different values on the two sides of each axis Reproducible example preferably using reprexreprex r libraryggalluvial Loading required package ggplot datavaccinations add survey dates to vaccination data surveydates dataframe survey levelsvaccinationssurvey start asDatec end asDatec vaccinationdates mergevaccinations surveydates by survey plot with linear flows ggplotvaccinationdates aesx end y freq stratum response alluvium subject fill response statalluviumgeom flow lodeguidance forward width knotpos statstratumwidth labsx Survey date y Number of respondents r plot with xsplined flows ggplotvaccinationdates aesx end y freq stratum response alluvium subject fill response statalluviumgeom flow lodeguidance forward width knotpos statstratumwidth labsx Survey date y Number of respondents supCreated on by the reprex package v sup Different Sankey diagram parallel sets plot and alluvial plot generators render flows between axes using different curves This blog post by Jeffrey A Shaffer discusses and showcases several options More than the current single option should be made available if possible through the grid package and the default should be informed by Shaffers discussion and perhaps also by this paper by Matthias Schonlau introducing the hammock plots implemented in ggparallel Description of the issue Diagrams for large datasets take a long time to render The bottlenecks might be due to inefficiencies in the code Profile the code identify the bottlenecks and benchmark alternative implementations See this chapter in Advanced R Reproducible example preferably using reprexreprex Need a suitable public dataset For cases in which the strata have no intrinsic order an option should be available to arrange the strata at each axis perhaps even using different orders at different axes when the strata are repeated maybe this should be allowed or not according to an additional parameter in a way that minimizes the number of flow overlaps The majors example in the vignette is a good candidate for such an option A heuristic algorithm should suffice and the concept is general enough that it might already be in use somewhere I wont have time to write one for a while and it might be worth writing in C and calling via Rcpp Interpolate aesthetics along flows between adjacent axes The aesthetics should interpolate along the splines at the same rate as the vertical positions
