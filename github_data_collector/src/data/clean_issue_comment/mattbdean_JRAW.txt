When one creates an OkHttpNetworkAdaptor without specifying their own working OkHttpClient the default OkHttpClient generated may have a null ProxySelector This causes a NullPointerException in my program using JRAW I discovered that ProxySelectorgetDefault returns null for Linux machines so to circumvient the error I created an OkHttpNetworkAdaptor with a custom OkHttpClient which has a custom ProxySelector which simply doesnt use a proxy see the NullProxySelector which was added OkHttp has been updated to implement such a NullProxySelector Please update OkHttp or implement the above change in specifically the line private val http OkHttpClient OkHttpClient you must use the OkHttpClientBuilder class and provide the ProxySelector Such ProxySelector should either be ProxySelectorgetDefault however if null the proposed NullProxySelector Id make a PR but this can simply be resolved by updating OkHttp Cheers omarathon SubmitReferencesubmit currently has resubmit hardcoded to false This prevents submitting links that were previously submitted in the past It would be helpful to make this a configurable option This is identical to the feature added recently in PRAW I have no experience with Kotlin or the frameworks being used in this project But if we are in agreement about the feature I can submit a pull request that attempts to implement it I used the code from the github website of JRAW the login information for credentials is correct as well UserAgent userAgent new UserAgentbot megabigsadmegabigsadMegabigsad v megabigsadd Create our credentials Credentials credentials

start by saying I really enjoy the library youve written here and its saved me a lot of work for my own project a Reddit source connector for Kafka Thanks man So the issuelike the title mentions I believe theres a race condition with token refresh It may or may not be specific to streams but thats the only place Ive noticed it so far In the RedditClientrequest method a check for token refresh is made based on AuthManagerneedsRenewing if and only if that method returns true the token is refreshed However since the needsRenewing method only returns whether or not the token has already expired and not whether its likely to expire soon its possible that in between that check and the actual request to Reddit the token expires I think one easy fix could be to alter the needsRenewing method to return whether a given percentage of the tokens lifetime has elapsed this could be anything from to depending on how expensive it is to fetch a new token and how much time is expected to elapse between calls to that method and requests that then use the possiblyexpired token If you agree Id be happy to open a PR up to add thislet me know In reddit api i can use params after and before after before only one should be specified these indicate the fullname of an item in the listing to use as the anchor point of the slice How to use it in JRAW For example i want to get posts from some subreddit before some post In reddit i can use The is now forbidden and currently the JRAW uses this URL in RedditClient redditClient helperonUserChallengeurl Im trying to make a bot for a particular subreddit and for this purpose I need to be able to grab new posts As it stands it seems like clientsubredditpostsbuild only grabs the posts currently on that frontpage Is there a way to grab all new posts to the subreddit and maybe fire an event when a new post is made
