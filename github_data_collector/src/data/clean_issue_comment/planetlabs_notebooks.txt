Ive just followed the steps in your script to calculate top of atmosphere reflection toarplanetscopeipynb Its really easy to follow Thank you for providing this I think Ive found a typo and figured Id make you aware of it In is the section where you set the characteristics of the output file to unint Then you rescale the reflectance bands from float so that they can be saved as unint However in the call to save the raster file you define the reflectance file and not the rescaled file as output file If I understand this correctly this would try to save the float values as unint resulting in an output file that has pretty much only values I believe the section with rasterioopendatareflectancetif w kwargs as dst dstwriteband bandbluereflectanceastyperasteriouint dstwriteband bandgreenreflectanceastyperasteriouint dstwriteband bandredreflectanceastyperasteriouint dstwriteband bandnirreflectanceastyperasteriouint would have to be changed into with rasterioopendatareflectancetif w kwargs as dst dstwriteband bluerefscaledastyperasteriouint dstwriteband greenrefscaled astyperasteriouint dstwriteband redrefscaled astyperasteriouint dstwriteband nirrefscaled astyperasteriouint In the croptemporal notebook in cell gdalwarp vsicurl is called to download a portion of a geotiff In the current docker image this process fails with the following message ERROR PROJ projcreatefromwkt Cannot find projdb ERROR PROJ projcreatefromwkt Cannot find projdb ERROR PROJ pjobjcreate Cannot find projdb ERROR PROJ createGeodeticReferenceFrame Cannot find projdb ERROR PROJ projaswkt Cannot find projdb ERROR PROJ createGeodeticReferenceFrame Cannot find projdb ERROR PROJ pjobjcreate Cannot find projdb ERROR PROJ projaswkt Cannot find projdb ERROR PROJ projcreatefromwkt Cannot find projdb ERROR PROJ projcreatefromwkt Cannot find projdb ERROR PROJ pjobjcreate Cannot find projdb ERROR PROJ projaswkt Cannot find projdb ERROR PROJ projaswkt Cannot find projdb ERROR PROJ projcreatefromwkt Cannot find projdb ERROR PROJ projcreatefromdatabase Cannot find projdb ERROR Cannot compute bounding box of cutline Cannot find source SRS The current installed version of gdal is In the past the version was pinned to This may be related to the switch to gdal ref and possible solutions Both the cropclassificationclassifycartl psipynb cropclassificationclassifycartipynb throw an error when trying to download the planet data in the th cell running planet data download activating complete elapsed paging False pending activating complete elapsed paging False pending Error BadQuery field general message invalidshapeexception Invalid shape Hole is not within polygon Im running the jupyter notebook directly from the docker container Hi Everyone I had an issue recently trying to follow stepbystep procedure from API Introduction tutorials I cant go further Quick Search section because my APIKEY is apparently not working I got this answer message Please enter your API key or email and password errors Everything was good for previous sections but from here the most important i consider the code reboots me with that message Sorry if my question is too basic but I tried looking for the answer from another blogs trying their solutions and without success Thanks in advance for your reply Mishel This makes the repo Binder compatible See this binder example deployed from this branch Binder Changes move Dockerfile to repo root remove the planetnotebookdocker subdirectory make docker build changes to support Binder based on AAbercrombie s and the binder docker guide update docs Respecd Dockerfile so binder can use it following this tutorial Removed docker file subdirectory so binder could find the Dockerfile in the project root In order to avoid upstream issues like we should push our own base image to dockerhub In datasetsidentifyipynb we use fiona to read the shapefile coordinate reference system The version of fiona that is associated with the version of rasterio we are using has a bug where it is unable to open the EPSG support file gcscsv This issue is documented here In this bug will be fixed Wait for to go live and fix the installed fiona to that version instead of creating a ton of code for parsing landsat qa bands use riol qa
