Normally when building a base VM getting the latest updates is desirable The default encoding of enUS is ASCII which causes certain packages namely postgresql to fail Explicitly declaring that we want to use UTF fixes this Upgraded from sha to sha Use case so one can easily SSH into a server and build a box without requiring X forwarding nor configuration changes Had to use mirror URL bc ubuntu removed the amd iso from the main site The scripts currently create VMs which have a default username and password as well as Vagrants insecure key The key will be replaced when the box is deployed with Vagrant however the password is never changed and SSH is forwarded to the VM by default This patch improves security by making sure a VM built with packer and deployed with Vagrant is fully patched doesnt have a known SSH key pair and does not allow SSH password login All of this can be changed by the user to get the previous behavior by changing the update variable and the newly added sshdisablepasswordauth to true A side effect of doing the security updates before building the box file is an efficiency gain over doing updates at deploy time for every VM The version was also incremented because this changes the default behavior of how the VM is built is there a way to have the bootcommandprefix support efi booting This same issue happens with ubuntu as well I have just tested ubuntu build with HyperV provider and I would like your feedback Would you be interested in adding this provider to boxcutter Few notes There is a trivial bug in hyperviso builder that prevents bootcommand to be processed properly With this fixed packer works as expected Preseed is different because linuxtoolsuname r and linuxcloudtoolsuname r are needed for obtaining guest IP and cant be installed during provisioning Released box for testing vcustomize modifyvm id audio none vcustomize modifyvm id draganddrop hosttoguest Turn audio off and add dragndrop host to guest since bidirectional isnt working at this time
