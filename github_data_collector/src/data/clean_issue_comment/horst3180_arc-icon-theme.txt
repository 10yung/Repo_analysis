some applications eg pcmanfm transmission use gnomes ugly icon instead of the pretty gear used in thunar it was used regardless of elementary and faba icon themes installed usrshareiconsgnome x categoriespreferencesdesktoppng Similar to the ArcTheme we also want to continue supporting the ArcIcon theme Any new or existing bug fix can be posted on the new fork fossfreedom will help me comaintain this project SO I installed it like its described and my taskbar does not look like the ones in the screenshots screenshot from So I installed everything according to noobslab But after selecting the Arc Icon Theme my Docker looks like this screenshot from Is there a fix out there Maybe even a beginner friendly one Edit forgot to mention here My problem is the files icon which shouldnt look like that I believe After running the installation script the icons for the Terminal and Gedit are missing for all themes The battery indicator looks incredibly misleading with this theme for me Example screenshot from Looks like I have but in reality I have sub If I change the icon theme to Paper instead it looks about right screenshot from Is that intended or a bug And if its intended Why I really like the Arc theme and use it on my personal computer however eg a lot of MIME types are missing Ive created a few myself mostly related to java however the rendering script is really slow and makes it hard to test the icons out This pullrequest mostly includes my changes to rendericonssh and should make the rendering script run faster On my machine rendering out the entire icon set from scratch takes about times less time than it would have previously MinutesSeconds Original Current My machine Ubuntu Intel Core i K CPU GHz GB of RAM It also now skips any svgfiles that havent changed since the last render finished Thats what the timestamp files are for they keep track of when the svg was render out last so we have something to compare time with Another neat feature for speeding things up a bit is the ability to filter out which icons should be rendered Just pass the render script a regular expression and only objects with matching IDs will get rendered out Eg the example below only takes about seconds to finish rendering Combine this with something like sudo cp ruv Arc usrshareicons and it allows for deploying an icon change in seconds though not all apps will register the changes necessarily and changing icon theme back and forth might be required rendericonssh cpp Rendering objects with IDs matching regex Match textxcpp Match textxcpp Match textxcpp Match textxcpp Match textxcpp Match textxcpp Match textxcpp Match textxcpp One caveat though is that search only looks for objectIDs in the cached objectID files So if new icons are created with new objectIDs you need to delete the cache file and then a new cache file will be created instead like rm actionscache Another option is just to run the render script with no arguments and it should automatically detect that the corresponding svgfile has changed and render it out as well as create a new cache file The cache files are also great for searching which icons you currently have Example grep generic cache sed r s sort uniq mimetypescacheaudioxgeneric mimetypescachefontxgeneric mimetypescacheimagexgeneric mimetypescachepackagexgeneric mimetypescachetextxgeneric mimetypescachevideoxgeneric I know there hasnt been any commits recently to this repository however I hope you will keep working on the Arc theme and this should hopefully make you more productive or at least help anyone else wanting to continue working on this icon theme PS I removed optipng as I had no idea what it was doing in the original script so you might want to add it back is there any easy way to change all the folders color to F D from the original blue color There is also an extra diff the change of the file COPYING to LICENSE But this can be ignored at will When connecting to a VPN service via cable the network icon shows no indication of this as nmdevicewiredsecurepng is missing
