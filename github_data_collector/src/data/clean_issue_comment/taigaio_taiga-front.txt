Do you want to request a feature or report a bug Bug What is the current behavior I want to update the name of one task in the US page on the tasks list Usually im doing that with the help of the pen icon appearing when you fly over the task In the last stable version of the taigafrontdist it threw an thischildScope is undefined error What is the expected behavior Changing the name of a task by using the pen icon on the userstory tasks list Is it happening in taigaio or in your own instance Own Instnace What browserversion are you using Firefox and Chromium Version Are there any console errors Ctrl F in red TypeError thischildScope is undefined appjs f appjs g appjs jQuery dispatch handle several times Id like to request feature of showing full names in autocompletion user mentions suggestions in addition to user names and allowing search by it Currently if I for example write a comment and want to mention a user I could press start typing user name and get drop down list which allows to choose existing users whose usernames begin with text that I type But it is not so simple and intuitive to find user name Full names are much more common in user interface I see that also you could start typing full name of user and autocompletion popup will appear also But if I for example know that name of user is John and dont know his username there could be many Johns in big project and in autocompletion popup Ill see something like johnallmighty johncoder And how should I understand who is needed John here I think it will be really useful if I could start typing John and get autocompletion suggestions both with usernames and fullnames like johnallmighty John Smith johncoder John Johnson Such suggestion list is much more useful In same way user mentions autocompletion are implemented for example in GitHub see screenshot Screenshot Id like to request feature of autocompletion user mentions using in Markdown mode Currently if I for example write a comment and want to mention a user I could press start typing user name and get drop down list which allows to choose existing users whose usernames begin with text that I type But This only works in HTML mode I prefer Markdown mode and I think that Im not the only one So autocompletion of user names without having to switch to HTML mode and back again will be useful In same way user mentions autocompletion are implemented for example in GitHub user mentions autocompletion are available in Markdown mode though there is no other mode here yes When editing an existing attribute status or adding a new one in admin panel its not possible to change the color of the status Do you want to request a feature or report a bug Feature What is the current behavior This is in the Kanban view Currently a small coloured clock appears in the US card when a deadline is set but it is restricted to the clock and not so eyecatching If the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce The colour of a due date can be set in the attributes settings page setting a due date on a US or task activates a clock icon bearing that colour What is the expected behavior It would be good if User Stories themselves could take on the due date colour on the Kanban card when the deadline approaches It would help to highlight them especially for more timebound projects Im using Taiga for a magazine project where we set deadlines for article completion if the US were coloured by deadline we could more easily decide what to focus on next Regarding styling as of now marking a user story as blocked currently gives it a red background we could use a similar styling but giving the due date colour instead of red This behaviour could be toggled on the project level possibly from the due date settings itself something like show coloured clock or colour whole card Is it happening in taigaio or in your own instance Instance managed by Disroot What browserversion are you using Firefox esr for Taiga Thanks for reporting This is a bug taiga on premise I wanted to move stories within Status but all stories with filtered Status get promoted to the top Scenario Enter backlog Four US status Ready status New status Ready status New Filter eg filter backlog on New status Move US upwards ie above US Remove filtering Expectation of order after reordering US status Ready US status New US status New US status Ready Reality US status New US status New US status Ready US status Ready Browser is latest Google Chrome Bug is known for several weeks at least and present accross devices of different Team members I cannot attach console errors now dont want to have entire backlog reordered again Do you want to request a feature or report a bug Feature What is the current behavior To bulk add tasks you must add cards to a sprint For teams that have a more steadyflow but need details subtasking for quality control this is a real pain What is the expected behavior US would have a Bulk Instert item for subtasks just as the kanban has a bulk insert for US Thanks for reporting
