Im trying to add the repo using SPM but I get the following error img width altScreenshot at src Ive setup unit tests for my project and want to add ViewViewController instantiation to the tests because the project is modular When compiling this error message appears when for any methods that came from Reusable Undefined symbols for architecture x static extension in ReusableReusableStoryboardSceneBased where A CUIViewControllerinstantiate A referenced from implicit closure throws FooProjectHomeViewController in FooProjectTestsInstantiationTeststestInstantiations in InstantiationTestso ld symbols not found for architecture x clang error linker command failed with exit code use v to see invocation Im not sure why this is happening because the other frameworks can be accessed easily This is a sample code that generates the error swift testable import FooProject import Nimble import XCTest class InstantiationTests XCTestCase func testInstantiations expectHomeViewControllerinstantiatenotToraiseException Possible Faqs Is the project enabled for testability Yes Do you have other tests besides this Yes What do you mean by the project being modular The project has multiple Targets and Configurations ex Configurations Release Release Debug Staging Staging Debug Targets FooProject FooProjectV We implemented autoRegistration of tableViewCell types This was done such that it is an optional nonbreaking change The features is disabled by default although that could be changed without breaking anything When calling dequeueReusableCell one can now specify autoRegister true and it will take care of ensuring that the classnib is registered Note that in order to get around generic constraints this required duplicating the dequeueReusableCell function for each of Reusable and NibReusable Hopefully this is useful to someone Are there any intentions to extend Reusable to macOS specifically NSTableViewNSCollectionView The library is obviously focused on iOSUIKit but I thought Id still ask Thanks And setup CircleCI to run them
