Redirect to the blog post cc crutkas First of all thanks for this minimal useful software I couldnt find this simple batch resizing in any of graphic softwares that I work with I have a suggestion Sometimes we need to have multiple target sizes eg different icons for different use cases Thatd be great if the user could simply check all the desired sizes they want and get the resized files with one click It would be nice it I could put it with my other image tools jpg at AM jpg at AM Great work I thought your tool had failed because the tooltip info does not refresh wo F It took me minutes to figure out it was working You should refresh the tooltip info jpg at AM jpg at AM So I need all files resized to under k I typically will use medium and then play with the jpg compression It would be nice to set a default max file size when resizing It would auto scale down the JPG compression factor This should be a quick change Windows Pro Dell Latitude laptop It worked fine to start with after imaging a brand new machine from our master image and installing a couple of extra programs including ImageResizer Everything tested out fine A few days later as I was getting ready to roll it out yesterday I installed another bunch of Windows updates added a couple more programs Avidemux Shotcut now after selecting Resize Pictures in the context menu the Image Resizer window does not appear The wait cursor appears for a second or so then nothing Event viewer shows the attached info I tried uninstalling the latest set of Windows updates no change I tried reimaging the laptop again still nothing Went down to v no change Will try on different laptop next exactly same specs then try some earlier program versions imageresizer errortxt Edit to add tried on different laptop After activation worked OK After imaging worked OK After fully updating Windows doesnt work I think I may have attached the wrong line in the event viewer last time so heres the error from this new laptop

faster workflow
