 x I have read CONTRIBUTINGrst x I have tried with the latest prerelease version and I still can reproduce the issue Tribler versionbranchrevision devel Expected behavior Use the index value from enumerate or directly iterate the object Actual behavior Use of enumerate without using the index value python async def loadcheckpointsself for i filename in enumerateselfgetcheckpointdirglobconf selfloadcheckpointfilename await sleep It seems that anonymous downloads are not working on devel To test this I setup a few tunnel helpers on our testing machine that run the latest commit on the devel branch I use the runtunnelhelperpy script to deploy a few exit nodes just for testing However when running Tribler again latest commit on devel and running it with the testnet flag there is no download progress when starting a download Readding the download also does not address the issue The file downloads correctly however when not running Tribler with testnet So I guess that problem is somewhere in our exit nodes that are now using asyncio Fixes fixes I just updated our tunnel infrastructure and I observe the following error when trying to perform anonymous downloading Jan prxmx

AnyDex gets prioritised over the one that Tribler provides Adds breadcrumbs for navigation and fixes some bugs With the introduction of the new directory structure logging was broken To fix that I refactored the way logging is set up and also changed the logger config file to YAML format for better readability How logging set up works now Each tribler module eg triblercore triblergui now includes a method loadloggerconfig in initpy which specifically loads the logging configuration for that module This allows each module to have its own independent configuration See loggerconf in both triblercore and triblergui modules There is also a sample configuration file in triblercommon module explaining the logger file itself After defining the appropriate loggerconf in the module it can be enabled by simply calling triblermoduleloadloggerconfig from the main execution file See an example in runtriblerpy file YAML dependency pip install pyyaml Fuzzing is the most efficient method of testing complex GUIs However implementing one can be a tricky task especially in the case of desktop applications that are written in more than one language and splitted into several parts hello Tribler Im looking at you To implement fuzzing in Tribler well need a framework for Qt scripting or a bridge to a popular GUI testing platform a way to automatically build an FSM for the GUI a library to fuzz and explore the GUI FSM Good read on the topic devel bcf e ea ce c a b bc c d de Arch python Install dependencies for Arch create venv activate install dependencies for ipv install
