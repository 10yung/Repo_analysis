Im sorry Im new to Github where do I find the code Thanks a million Hello I want to know how to determine the value of the filtCutOff in Scriptm filtCutOff b a butter filtCutOff samplePeriod low accmagFilt filtfiltb a accmagFilt Hi Great code thanks for sharing I have been having bad results with lower frequencies even with Hz and I wonder if its because the signal is no good or if im doing something wrong I noticed your samples have higher acceleration magnitudes and they describe a pattern something very different from mine that look like noise Do you have any insights that could help acccelular When we change stop time of spiral stairs dataset from to the plot generated is entirely wrong Position in zdirection turns negative while it is positive and shows steps when stop time is Steps in the initial time from to sec should not change at all but that is not the case The length of the step in the initial period changes and z of even the initial period becomes negative Can you tell me whats going wrong I have attached the screenshots for both the cases Stoptime Stoptime Greetings is there a way to port this code to be compatible with NGIMU hardware xIMU hardware isnt available anymore on the website Main thing is that the CSV files created by the NGIMU Data LoggerConverter contains the time in the first column the matlab script accepts a packet number This packet number may be a sequence of integers but not all packet numbers are step from each other ie gaps exist How does the packet number relate to time Kind regards Thomas Hi thank you for the code It is extremely use full for learning I was wondering if I can use this code to estimate my UAV flight trajectory using same IMU readings from the Flight controller of UAV I want to visualise my own data IMU data how to change from csv to bin to allow matlab to read it Hello thank you for your fantastic code I am trying to measure the length of each walked step using insole sensorpressure sensor and IMU data fusion is already done inside the IMU so I have the three accelerations and the three angles which I am reading from a text fileI performed three step of length cm cm cm each one I want to ask if anyone can help me to understand where are the errors to be corrected in order to have more accurate results my codetxt recordLefttxt Firstly thank you for your code Im new to matlab When I run Script I get the following error Undefined function or variable xIMUdataClass Error in Script line xIMUdata xIMUdataClassfilePath InertialMagneticSampleRate samplePeriod
