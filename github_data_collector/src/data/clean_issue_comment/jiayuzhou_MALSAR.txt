Hi Jiayu I was testing the proximal operator for the L inf norm which lead me to test the prflbmcpp First it worked well and the procedure to make sparsity is quite similar to the procedure in Sparse PCA But I found some source codes doesnt match the performance here is my testing D tau mu theta mc prflbmD tau Then mu theta The results seems quite right But in the source codeline x imj c imj thetac imj thetac imj thetac imj theta when theta mu should be in stead of Please let me know why is this Regards Hank We need to change the parameter to keyvalue and users can leave some parameters blank to use default values Currently we use FISTA and however in practice SPARSA works better We may want to change to other solvers Or provide a list of solvers and ask users to choose one of them We need to unify the inputoutput format
