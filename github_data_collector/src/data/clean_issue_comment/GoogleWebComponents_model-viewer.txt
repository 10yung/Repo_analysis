I work with D models for augmented reality and we are having a hard time trying to make our D viewer parameters make the object seems closer to what it will be in the AR environment We use blender evee to compare the D models to the real object but in our D viewer it appears to have a really strong light that make our objects seen lighter andor too white especially with white objects sometimes it looks to bright in one side and in the other side of the same object it is really dark doesnt have a smooth transition between shadow and light but in augmented reality it seems darker close to blender but not so realistic So if we darken the model to match the viewer it will be too dark for AR Does someone know the best parameters to use in a viewer so it will look closer to AR blender viewer Instructions For Filing a Bug Description Please provide a detailed description of the bug how to reproduce it and the expected behavior Always include a code snippet screenshot any errors

have a question on starting AR mode Is Tap to place function exists When I use AR on model viewer the model spawned right after it detected stabilized place I want to place it where I want to put on Any one can help me thanks Our repo is now a Gb download which is pretty ridiculous especially for a small project Its almost entirely fidelity golden images which would be better served by Git LFS Of course in order to switch well also have to rewrite our history the idea being to keep it but simply in a new place This is dangerous so Im thinking Ill fork this into my own repo and give it a shot there so we can see how it works modelviewer already have lazy loading of D models in which is awesome Itd be nice to piggyback on that functionality and make the poster lazyload as well Especially since posters dont have srcset support for multiple resolutions it can take a lot of bandwidth if posters are big Description Im getting a strange issue where the model disappears when i switch tabs wait a bit then come back hmm Im seeing this on Whats very bizarre is that the object doesnt just disappear Its as if the exposure ramps up to the point where everything is white It happens fast so here is a closeup of it happening in slomo disappear Live Demo Visit Switch tabs Wait around s Come back Browser Affected I only tested in Chrome x Chrome Edge Firefox Helios IE Safari OS Android iOS

unstablewebxr attribute runs nicely offline as PWA but Im considering Scene Viewer as a first option instead So whenever the intent is issued to comgooglearcore the following dialog shows up Screenshot Google Is there a way to circumvent that and use Scene Viewer in my offline app I know this is not directly related to modelviewer Anyways thanks for your great work guys Description If I
