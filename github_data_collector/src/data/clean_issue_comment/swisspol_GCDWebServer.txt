hello When is HTTPS supported I dont wanna compress the whole folder cause it takes time when i upload the folder it seems like all files are stored in the same path and i wanna delete it but so many files cant be selected at a time so its a question and enhancement I am trying to fetch ip address using GCDWebServerGetPrimaryIPAddress on iOS simulator while connected to Ethernet but it returns nil The same code is working fine when I am connected to wifi network Here is my code NSString ipAddress GCDWebServerGetPrimaryIPAddressNO NSAssertipAddress We must have an IP address at this point to proceed I am using latest release of GCDWebServer v Ive attached screenshot of my ethernet connection img width altScreenshot at AM src Let me know if you need more information My app requires visibility into the progress of a request being read by GCDWebServer As seen in and this isnt an entirely new problem Theres a solution mentioned there as follows Subclass GCDWebServerConnection Override didReadByteslength to be notified when bytes are read and processRequestcompletion to get the request and its content length Unfortunately it appears that internal changes since these issues in have changed the order of these methods being called Currently they processRequestcompletion is called after all of the bytes are received despite the connection owning a GCDWebServerRequest This pull request adds a new method to connections that can be overridden to receive the request called didParseRequest When this is called weve received just enough data to get the headers allowing us to read the content length and calculate the percentage complete Since the response is formulated in the connection instance there was no need for an additional method for tracking write progress Another problem I encountered was that totalBytesRead includes the header datas bytes This is unlike the content length of GCDWebServerRequest which only accounts for the body To solve this I added two new methods to GCDWebServerConnection that calculate the amount of bytes that the connection expects to receive fromsend to the remote peer once the exchange is complete Named expectedFinalTotalReadBytes and expectedFinalTotalWrittenBytes it adds the headers and bodys lengths With these two changes it is possible to monitor the progress of a request being received and sent by GCDWebServer Hi swisspol thanks for creating this useful library This PR is about to create a new subspec to use GCDWebServer on iOS App Extensions Please have a look when you have time Hello swisspol Thanks for this awesome library I am facing one issue I have start playing video then I press home button App is in Background now and I have locked the phone now when I unlocked the phone and opening app again then video is not playing as Connection is not reestablished or reconnected Please help me with this Thanks Hello Ive created a web server that serves a static website A response is sent if a request is made to a page that doesnt exist but the response body is blank This means that the WKWebView will be blank Is there a way to send a simple Not found as a response body when returning s Swift let secondServer GCDWebServer secondServeraddGETHandlerforBasePath directoryPath pages indexFilename indexhtml cacheAge allowRangeRequests true secondServerstartwithPort bonjourName nil After a while in the background switch back to the APP selfwebserverisrunning is always true but in fact the local server has stopped running Note data racing conditions can be detected when running the code with the Thread Sanitizer turned on Thread Sanitizer can only be activated when running on simulators at least for iOS apps This is an alternative to I didnt have luck with the previous restart code but when I stopped and started the server everything seemed to work fine
