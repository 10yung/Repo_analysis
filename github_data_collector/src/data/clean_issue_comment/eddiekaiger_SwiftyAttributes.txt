 Since Xcode includes Swift Package natively it would be nice to be able to include SwiftyAttributes using SPM CoreText note Client requested name SFUIRegular it will get TimesNewRomanPSMT rather than the intended font All system UI font access should be through proper APIs such as CTFontCreateUIFontForLanguage or UIFont systemFontOfSize Hi when i use your example HellowithFontsystemFontofSize WorldwithFontsystemFontofSize i get only text with font size It happens in uitableviewcell with autoheight
