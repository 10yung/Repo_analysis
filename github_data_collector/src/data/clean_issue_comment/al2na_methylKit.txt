Hello Thanks for the great tool I have a quick question regarding the validity check for tileMethylCounts function For this particular experiment I have samples called MORs and called FORS Now when I am performing DMR analysis while I am doing tiling I am getting the following warning object has more than one sample id only one allowed While reading the data I am reading it based on the default resolution ie base and filtering it based on criteria defined in the tutorial Please find attached the code and the output till the filtering I have questions in this case a Should I ignore this warning b If not is there a special way to handle DMRs Please let me know if you have any further questions Thanks Surajit methylationwarningtxt I have a methRead object that is further merged using unite It consists of samples When running clusterSamples I get the following error clusterSamplesUniteobject distcorrelation methodwardD plotTRUE Error in quantiledefaultsds sdthreshold missing values and NaNs not allowed if narm is FALSE See here the error is not very informative getMethylDiff command appends its filename suffix with a space on both sides ie methylDiff suffix txtbgz vs methylDiffsuffixtxtbgz This applies to its index file as well though Im not sure if this also appears when a suffix is automatically generated as opposed to having one supplied as a parameter right now we dont get rowids when asking for them percMethylationmethylBaseDBsavetxt TRUErowids TRUE PEsamplerrbs PEsamplewgbs SEsamplev copy SEsample SEsamplev Sometimes it would be useful to include column and row names in the text output for instance when saving percMethylation to file In order to count methylated and unmethylated cystosines the documentation at Tiling windows analysis states this code tilestileMethylCountsmyobjwinsize stepsize In order to obtain the myobj object this code is stated further up which is the only place where this is defined read the files to a methylRawList object myobj myobjmethReadfilelist sampleidlisttest test ctrl ctrl assemblyhg treatmentc contextCpG Given the default of mincov the myobj will be prefiltered for each cystosine which makes sense for DMC analysis For regions this prefiltering shouldnt be done imo For example for a given region with cytosines all have a coverage of say All would be filtered on this threshold and consequently the whole region However they would sum up to coverage without prefiltering worthwhile being included for DMR analysis I would there fore suggest if this my understanding is correct to pointing this out in the documentation adding mincov or so to create myobj for section Filtering should still be made but on the region rather the cytosine level ie using covbases in the tileMethylCounts call or so Right now I saw that it used x the size of the input file in memory This is fine for million CpG sites but can be quite large for million CHH or million CHG sites We are loading the whole file into memory anyways but maybe we could limit copying during some of our processing functions For now this should just go into documentation that for noncpg sites a lot more ressources are required
