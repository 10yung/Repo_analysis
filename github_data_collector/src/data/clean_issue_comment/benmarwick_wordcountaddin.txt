Please briefly describe your problem and what output you expect If you have a question please dont use this form Instead ask on Please include a minimal reproducible example AKA a reprex If youve never heard of a reprex before start by reading Brief description of the problem Using the code given by website devtoolsinstallgithubbenmarwickwordcountaddin type source dependencies TRUE Everything run smoothly until installing package fastmap The error is returned as Error Failed to install wordcountaddin from GitHub converted from warning installation of package fastmap had nonzero exit status r insert reprex here For the simple Rmd shown below Id expect textstatsto count seven words but instead it finds twenty This seems to come from an issue in the regex used to identify and strip the YAML after initial processing of text the second does not start a line r title Test RMD author Jeff Goldsmith date output htmldocument This document contains a very simple sentence Thanks for the nice addin I was looking for something to compute readability scores and its nice to have the word count as a bonus The readability function works fine if I call it after the word count function textstats But if I call the readability function without calling textstats earlier in the session then I get the following error r wordcountaddinreadability Error in function classes fdef mtable unable to find an inherited method for function readability for signature NULL supCreated on by the reprex package v sup Great package Would it be possible to add an option to return a data frame instead of a knitrkable object If textstats returned a df it would be easier to use in the document itself to grab the word count This way it could be used to automatically insert word counts to documents Cheers
