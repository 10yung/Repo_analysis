of all thank you for this great library Its really awesome and pleasure to use Recently I was searching for similar library using color manipulation term There were plenty of different libraries in the results list but polished wasnt among them So in order to gain more attraction from people that might need this great lib I suggest adding some more tags like color manipulate color manipulation curried color manipulation Currently in some search engines like npms your lib looks like this polished In its most recent version flow errors on the position shorthand with the following error This is correct since position would be overwritten if it was part of the directionalProperty function call currently typed with an indexer in srctypesstylejs With the proposed change we always take the position that was passed to the function This adds the ability to use round in the math helper with tests Im not totally sure what the process is for adding functionality here and what math functions

seeing When loading up the page where this is used during serverside rendering I see this error printed to my terminal Error running template Error Couldnt parse the color string Please provide the color as a string in hex rgb rgba hsl or hsla notation What you expected to see The CSS variable interpreted correctly and lightened Reproduction If the above doesnt clarify I can whip up an example I find myself giving some components only a top and bottom marginpadding Or only a left and right margin padding Maybe a shorthand for marginXpaddingX would be useful It takes two arguments one for left and one for the right marginpadding The same could be done for marginYpaddingY taking an argument for the top and bottom marginpadding With the deprecation of getValueAndUnit I was looking at

refer to the literal width of the element even if the container has been rotated It sure would be nice if it could always refer to the width of the text itself and not the container For example the vertical axis of a chart or other vertical text transform rotate deg I realize it could be tricky to support any arbitrary rotation so maybe just that one common use case could be covered Thank you

between px and px screen widths Reproduction Hi all Ive been a big fan of polished especially coming from the SassPostCSS world Im working on a project with Emotion and am missing a few common PostCSS plugins I used to use one of them being Any thoughts on adding something like that to polished Thanks polished version MixinHelperShorthand you were using and how you were using it javascript triangle pointingDirection top width px height px foregroundColor inherit What you are seeing A black box What you expected to see A colored triangle Reproduction It seems that browsers tested on Firefox and Chrome do not support the border color inherit in the form css bordercolor transparent inherit transparent transparent but do if they are declared by side I would propose to revert back the triangle logic to make it work for inherit and make the bundle slightly bigger This is very useful when creating tooltip arrows who can inherit the color of the border of the tooltip
