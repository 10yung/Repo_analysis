 Popup is presented on a TabBarController which is parent of several child navigation controllers The popups content view controller is a regular UIViewController The UIViewController has prefersStatusBarHidden set to YES Drag style is set to default iOS When clicking the arrow or popup bar to hide and show the VC the status bar animation works as expected expected When slowly dragging the VC downwards the status bar does not update and gets stuck on top of the tab bar contents unexpected Have tried messing around with setNeedsStatusBarAppearanceUpdate but no luck Setting prefersStatusBarHidden to NO eliminates this problem Simulated on iPhone with iOS Works as expected on iPhone X and above Using latest LNPopupController framework Description I am using the latest version of the library installed via carthage I am facing this issue only in ios runnig iphone x and ie iphone and prior devices running ios are fine Screen Shot at AM as you can see popupbar starts from the page inset and goes behind the tabbar and with any action updating the popup pushing a viewController clicking on the tabbar popupbar moves to its correct position Screen Shot at AM Xcode version Description On notched devices on x and when using a UITabBarController the tab is initially drawn without safeAreaInsets and appears shrunk After presenting the popup bar the tab bar is drawn correctly and even after the popup bar is dismissed Rotation will also cause the tab bar to be drawn correctly Unlinking the LNPopupController framework from the project will not cause the bug but obviously the popup bar can no longer be called Initial launch Simulator Screen Shot iPhone Xs at Popup presented Simulator Screen Shot iPhone Xs at No popup after presented Simulator Screen Shot iPhone Xs at Steps to Reproduce Not able to reproduce in a smaller project unfortunately but the project that it does appear in is available here The LNPopupController is built in a submodule so make sure it is cloned along with it The tab bar will be shrunk upon first launch Device OS and Xcode Versions Latest Xcode beta latest commit of LNPopupController I have seen this issue on XXsXr simulators and on physical XXs devices on Ive started work on It is intended as a general rewrite of the entire presentation model The idea is to use UIPresentationController subclasses with custom animation and interaction controllers This will greatly simplify the presentation system and allow many more features such as free card presentation on iOS Planned features that will also make the cut for Animations that run alongside the presentation animations of the popup Supporting card presentations iOS for now but can be any OS version with a custom presentation controller Dimming of contents under the popup Remove legacy iOS support The goal is to support as much of the current feature set as possible Some minor changes to look and feel might happen due to the transition to presentation controllers There are still some unknowns The effort is being implemented in the v branch So far I have removed all legacy code removed all old presentation code and have a proof of concept using the iOS card presentation controller as the basis for popup presentation Todo x Add support for full screen popup presentation Add support for interactive Drag presentation x Add support for iOS interactive card presentation x Explore card presentations for iOS and below x Explore nonfull width presentations Explore embedding the popup bar inside bottom bars such as tab bars Explore the possibility of the bars background view extending under the hosting views safe areas Hi guys I am planning to clean up the code and drop support for I will create a stabilized version with iOS support and that will be the last to support legacy OSes After that I plan to clean the code from legacy and maybe rewrite some of the presentation stuff as time permits Please fill this template before submitting an issue This helps determine the issue cause much quicker If you are filing an enhancement request you only need to fill the description section and can safely remove the other sections Note If you are using a fork with CocoaPods please make sure it is uptodate with the latest version before opening an issue Description Provide a clear and concise description of your problem In case of an enhancement request please provide use cases where the required functionality would be useful Steps to Reproduce In case of a bug report provide the steps necessary to reproduce the issue If you are seeing a regression try to provide the last known version where the issue did not reproduce If possible please provide a small demo project that reproduces the issue or attach a video with the reproduction this would be very appreciated Device OS and Xcode Versions Provide the OS and Xcode versions you are using and the device simulator you tested on Can I configure the outer padding of the Popup for example to have right and left padding And if it applicable to make outer shadow for it I have a horizontal Collection View in my View Controller that is presented by LNPopupController and I cant find a way to register dragging down the controller if the touches are in the Collection Views area If I disable scrolling of Collection View it works great but disabling it is out of question also subclassing UICollectionView and using UIGestureDelegates method gestureRecognizer gestureRecognizer UIGestureRecognizer shouldRecognizeSimultaneouslyWith otherGestureRecognizer UIGestureRecognizer doesnt make any difference Just like apple music for iPad
