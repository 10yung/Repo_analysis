 Summary of the new featureenhancement The current PowerToys icon feels dated With the legacy and connection with Windows this makes sense but I believe modernizing it might be better to make it feel more native to Windows In well see lots of inbox application icons modernized more on Microsoft Designs push to redesign hundreds of OS icons here Another issue with the current icon is the fact that it feels outdated and doesnt scale very well to smaller sizes for eg the systemtray Proposed technical implementation details optional The proposal is to redesign the current PowerToys icon so it feels part of the Windows family of experiences eg Terminal other inbox apps Important When reporting BSODs or security issues DO NOT attach memory dumps logs or traces to Github issues Instead send

descriptionsummary of your PR here What does it fixwhat does it changehow was it tested even manually if necessary Summary of the Pull Request This PR moves the context menu entry to the same section as the Rotate rightleft options and moves the drag and drop menu entry down below the Copy here entry Details of the investigations are available in issue These changes have only been verified for the

Additional comments Details of how the context menu ordering works can be found in Based on the details above since the ShellImagePreview which contains Rotate LeftRight is registered at HKCRSystemFileAssociationpngShellExContextMenuHandlersShellImagePreview the same has to be done with ImageResizer for each of the supported types Thus there are entries for bmp dib gif jfif jpe jpeg jpg jxr png rle tif tiff wdp all the directly supported types mentioned in the ImageResizer code Images like ico also work with the ImageResizerexe but it converts it to jpg instead so it doesnt actually resize a ico back to ico ShellImagePreview adds entries a separator Rot right Rot left and another separator For a basic check without making the context menu handling more resource intensive a simple check for a separator at the start indexindexMenu arg has been added to make sure that if an older version of Windows is being used where ShellImagePreview isnt available or if it has been disabled the code will still run fine The drag and drop handler index was simply increased by one because Copy here was the initial first value in the context menu Describe how you validated the
