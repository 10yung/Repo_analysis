Good day I have setup this solution on my Mac Docker cemac My dockercomposeyml file looks like version services web build dockerphp volumes docrootvarwwwhtmlwww ports db build dockermysql volumes dbdatavarlibmysql environment MYSQLROOTPASSWORD root MYSQLDATABASE default MYSQLUSER default MYSQLPASSWORD default Using the Devel module I got an output of d exectime I have run dockerosxdev inside my project root where it looks like total drwxrwxrwx leotan staff B Jan dbdata drwxrxrx leotan staff B Jan docker rwrr leotan staff B Jan dockercomposeyml drwxrxrx leotan staff K Jun docroot then did a normal dockercompose up d With dockerosxdev running with no errors when I have some changes it outputs something like INFO Syncing dbdataibdata ft INFO Syncing dbdataiblogfile ft INFO Syncing

dockercomposeyml without dockerosxdev Update I tried the method of testing from but when dockerosxdev is not running and I do a touch testfile it gets created in the container I accessed the container also using dockercompose exec web binbash What am I doing wrong Hello if i am running dockerosxdev it sync files from host to virual machine nicely The problem is in other side It automatically deletes every change which is made on the docker side INFO Watching Usersjeniksynopsisprojektysynopsisvyvoj Usersjeniksynopsisprojektysynopsisvyvoj INFO Syncing synopsisvyvojfileslogstaramysqlslowlog

fix this brikis when I try to dockercompose up or dockercompose build i get the following error ERROR SSL error SSL CERTIFICATEVERIFYFAILED certificate verify failed sslc Ive run the following commands with success boot docker up eval boot docker shellinit dockerosxdev I am on Mac OS X el captain boot docker virtualbox I do have some shared folders inside my VM that I use It would be cool to be able to tell dockerosxdev to ignore those shared folders using a parameter or an environment variable The whole story is that I mount readonly backups from production on my OS X machine to be able to have production data without consuming storage I then share this folder with my Docker VM where I build an AUFS mount to allow the VM to write to the readonly backup I am then able to quickly discard any modifications and restart from scratch That is a great way to work with production files I currently directly modified the dockerosxdev code to grep v my shared folders in findvboxsfmountedfolders but this is not a great solution I would like to be able to configure a list of folders that are excluded from findvboxsfmountedfolders preferably not at each run but globally Weve been using this as part of a Docker trial at work and Ive noticed in some instances colleagues managing to run the script prior to having installed its necessary dependencies namely coreutils and fswatch Currently the script logs the resulting errors to stdout and continues to run resulting in issues that need to be resolved by hand Im wondering if it would be possible to check for the presence of these dependencies prior to do anything and halting if any are not installed Unfortunately I cant reproduce this problem but dockerosxdev appears to be prompting for a sudo password continuously under some circumstances We believe this to be the case because there are no other sudo requirements in the affected script Password Password Password Password No matter how many times the password is entered the prompts continue Cancelling the prompt and resaving the unmodified affected script triggers the prompts again The problem has since resolved itself Sorry I cant be more specific I tried running dockerosxdev in a directory that has a space in its name and it failed with INFO Initial sync using tar for UsersseanhuberRails tar Rails Cannot stat No such file or directory tar Error exit delayed from previous errors INFO Initial sync using tar for Appsrttreats tar could not chdir to Apps tar short read error in run exit status The path of the directory I was in is UsersseanhuberRails Apps Are there any plans to update this to work with the new OS X Docker Beta As Im running into the same issue where shared OS X volumesmounts having slow file IO and watch scripts dont work unless they are set to poll all of the files running dockerosxdev in one CLI tab is working it says it is watching but then opening another terminal tab and running dockercompose up yields ERROR Couldnt connect to Docker daemon you might need to rundockermachine start default I dont have the default image because I completely uninstalled docker prior to installing dockerosxdev
