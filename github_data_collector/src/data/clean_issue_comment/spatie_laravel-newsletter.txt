I need to be able to retrieve all interest categories for a project and I thought this functionality could helper other people In the new version of Mailchimp API lastName and firstName changed to LNAME and FNAME Hi you will need to change the documentation since in new Mailchimp API you cant pass firstName and lastName in merging fields Proper naming convention is FNAME and LNAME how to get the audiences information who are subscribers in our project dashbord This package doesnt seem to install on laravel Any help Hi Ive been using this package and like it however I have noticed an issue with the implementation when injecting rather than using the facade Since the nulldriver and newsletter class do not implement any kind of interface it is impossible to use dependency injection since there isnt a single class or interface to inject If you want to be able to use both the null driver and the real class and be able to switch them out then you have to use the facade If you use the Spatie Newsletter Newsletter as a dependency then this breaks when you inject the nulldriver class instead Would it be possible to have them both implement an interface so people not using facades can still make use of your implementation I would be happy to look into a PR for this if you would be willing to accept it Thanks
