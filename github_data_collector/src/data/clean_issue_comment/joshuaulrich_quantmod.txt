 Description Hi It seems that getDividends adjusted dividends for splits twice Expected behavior For example function quantmodgetDividendsAAPL return xts object where on its value is but valid value must be I think the function adjusts already adjusted data the current tiingo getSymbols implementation only returns an OHLCV result It does allow for an adjusted or unadjusted result but it does not expose the divCash or splitFactor columns Id like to expose this data so that I can use it in other processes Specifically i have some other data sources that only expose unadjusted prices These sources need to be adjusted for splits not divs so i need access to the split factor There are a few considerations in how to go about this getSymbolsyahoo already includes an extra Adjusted column in addition to the standard OHLCV columns so it would not be unreasonable to just add these columns to the end of the existing output This would probably be the least invasive and simplest to implement but would also create a go forward support issue that might interfere with a more radical API redesign approach Another option would be to include a Adjusted column to make it similar to the yahoo output and to add parameters to the getSymbols call to control which adjustment to include similar to how adjRatios works This would be a bit more complicated to implement but could work across a number of sources the biggest downside would be that it wouldnt allow use of splitdivsboth in different situations this brings up the larger question of the framework design as a whole and how getSplits getDividends adjRatios should work for sources other than yahoo I certainly dont want to break existing functionality and design patterns but it would seems silly to me to extend the existing round trip call patterns to tiingo when the data is already coming back as part of the getSymbols call For reference the alphavatange api does not expose div and split data directly so its not really a consideration here any thoughts on the best way to go about this Im happy to do the lifting once a directionapproach is accepted Error messages contain API keys in plain text This is a problem for tests that are run on TravisCI or any other CI platform where the logs are public Here are a couple examples r quantmodgetQuotecFOO WYSIWYG src av apikey v Error in getQuoteavSymbols cFOO

fix may be as easy as setting call FALSE in the call to stop Hi guys Amazing project here Just wondering if we can add support for stock API They allow calls minute for free with intraday data going back for years I think this is a better alternative for alpha vantage They also support Websocket to receive the latest trades on the market for free What do you guys think Hello Team Needed the symbols list for FRED source in getSymbols function of quantmod Can any one help on this r getSymbolsSymbols EURUSD reloadSymbols FALSE verbose FALSE warnings TRUE src FRED symbollookup TRUE autoassign FALSE from SysDate to SysDate In the place of Symbols EURUSD what need to be used for different currency rate to the USD Please assist Description Chartseries adds by default a second

setOldClassxts and setOldClasszoo calls in quantmod cause issues if other packages need to define those classes as well For example see and a StackOverflow question I answered a couple years ago I mentioned these to jaryan and he would prefer to remove all the S classes from quantmod
