I added the option bytes to show size as bytes Enables further scripting with the numbers I followed the path used in the README which is a subdirectory of the output path but nothing is getting created and theres no error message The subdirectory doesnt exist but Id expect that it would be created If I have just the name of a path then the file gets produced Is there any way the output can be split out by the bundle Im not currently sure how to use this in a multichunk webpack build Hi I tried running webpackbundlesizeanalyzer against the output generated by my app for the first after some iterations and was surprised by the following error webpack json verbose webpackbundlesizeanalyzer C Users gustavo AppData Roaming npm nodemodules webpackbundlesizeanalyzer build src sizetreejs return statschildrenmapbundleSizeTree TypeError Cannot read property map of undefined at ObjectdependencySizeTree C Users gustavo AppData Roaming npm nodemodules webpackbundlesizeanalyzer build src sizetreejs at printStats C Users gustavo AppData Roaming npm nodemodules webpackbundlesizeanalyzer build src clijs at Socketanonymous C Users gustavo AppData Roaming npm nodemodules webpackbundlesizeanalyzer build src clijs One change I made was to hide most stats from the webpack logs with the stats key my webpackconfigjs js stats assets true children false chunks false errors true errorDetails true modules false timings true colors true Obviously this was the cause of the error above The only thing I found to work is to remove these I havent tried any combination of webpack CLI flags apart from verbose json which didnt work It would be nice to document this problem and how to solve it so others dont get into this trap as well And if you know about a more elegant way around this let me know My webpack config has multiple entry points and bundles It would be nice to see the size for each one Right now the analyser just shows the size of what I think is the first one and doesnt indicate which one Would be great to add something like to the output to see realworld increases Ive been using webpackbundlesizeanalyzer for a while now and its been working great I have however recently noticed that some packages are not showing up anywhere in my analyzer results Im fairly certain this is related to the fact that I recently started using codesplitting with webpack For example I have a reports page that when accessed dynamically loads a bundle which uses the d js npm package to show some charts yet d js is not showing up anywhere in the analyzer results If I add an import of d js to my main bundle it starts showing up in the analyzer results again Any advice on how to resolve this would be greatly appreciated Ive checked the output from webpack p json and I am seeing d js mentioned when its loaded in the codesplit bundle I can provide more specific info snippets from the webpack json output etc if that helps
