Someone please update this source It was obsoleted for years Some armor blocks including slabs and the underside of slopes have problems with the texture which would normally continue between blocks but instead sharply cuts off between blocks Another thing that bothers me is how some armor blocks slabs for example dont have that metal trim at the edges of the block making them look out of place when used with regular blocks Round blocks do have that metal trim but it doesnt go away when you use them to make cylinders a href src titlesource imgurcom a The armor cubes to the right have a nice continuous texture The slabs and ramps to the left cut off sharply between blocks TLDR Please make armor blocks more coherent and aesthetically pleasing In the folder SpaceEngineersSourcesSandboxCommonModAPI and its subfolders there is no IMyTimerBlockcs file The class IMyTimerBlock is accessible via ingame script but here on GitHub is no information given about the interface I know that the interface has at least the Methods Trigger and StartCountdown I This field only seems to update on a grid the first time you use the ship when in multiplayer After that it never updates again until you logout login then use the ship again Only then will you see the current status of stored power and only for that one run After that it wont update again until you repeat the logoutlogin cycle It also seems to update when one connects to a connector This is in multiplayer using a dedicated server Error CS The type or namespace name RecastDetour could not be

a blueprint from the clipboard it will just replace the last one and name it the same You cant edit blueprints w The class is defined here The spelling is defined here P The IMyProjector interface returns a DictionaryMyDefinitionBase int However unless there is some other way to use this it becomes a useless method to access from the InGame Script API as the MyDefinitionBase is prohibited summary A comprehensive list of blocks left to be welded summary DictionaryMyDefinitionBase int RemainingBlocksPerType get Also I found that the method RemainingBlocksPerType is not used except for when it is being implemented by the MyProjectorBaseModAPI Due to the restrictions of the InGame Script API and its common Script is to complex Error I would suggest that there should be a method that could get a grids outline at a specified angle as well as the outline from a certain square and position gridgetOutlineVector D angle returns DOutline would contain points of collidable points as well as test methods gridgetSliceVector D angleVector D pos returns DOutline gridgetSliceVector D angleVector D posStart Vector D posEnd returns DOutline Reason I am currently trying to auto print my ship using for loops and hasBlock to a lcdtext panel however the Script is to complex Error shows up
