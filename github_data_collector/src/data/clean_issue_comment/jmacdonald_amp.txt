Theres this editor vis which uses regex and its quite convenient Can you make the search commands use regex Also there is the x command which searches for a pattern then selects it xtet will select text test tert etc It is very convenient Also it can automatically apply a command to them like xtet ctest which will change all the matches to test very niceu if you ask me Thanks like title Hey there Thanks for such a simple and nice editor Ive been using it for a few days now and I would love to have a simple case sensitivity switch I find it confusing when trying to jump to a symbol and its not appearing Ive read the warning in the docs but if you think its somewhat simple to implement this maybe adding a casesensitive key inside ampconfigyml I would be happy to try and open a PR need to stretch my Rust knowledge though Steps to reproduce Create a new buffer with Shiftb Press d New line is added Go to the last line Press d New line is added Double width unicode grapheme do not seem to be handled correctly not all grapheme have the same width in the terminal manshrugging Peek I am not sure if this is out of scope Otherwise for the great project this is what i see Hi thanks for you lovely editor Im not sure if theres an option to specify file type highlighting when writing new file buffer pressing B key Would like to use this editor when I show some code snippets Im about to write but without going to the IDE Would be nice if I press B Somehow I specify that for example Im about to write java file Syntax highlighting takes place immediately Thanks Hi I use amp several sublime text sublimesyntax files for formats not supported out of the box that I collected One is for vuejs vue files that always worked except for a file With this particular file amp crashes I cannot see the error message because it disappears too fast The same file and same syntax works with sublime I tried before submitting this issue Dont know if the problem is caused by the syntax having some problems in the definition but maybe amp should not crash or at least should give a meaningful message I attach the syntax file and a file that when edited gives the problem you have to scroll until reaching the styles if you want to check it up If not please close the issue fileszip Thanks in advance and thanks again for you great work on amp Pedro eg vim filename c normal zt I optimistically add this pullrequest to show why I created I have been sitting on and using this code for my own work daily since August and think it is stable The reason I created this PR now is that I noticed and wanted to save jmacdonald some work if possible I optimistically updated Cargotoml with the new version of scribe but will not be able to do the same with Cargolock until it is actually pushed to cratesio I fully understand if this feature is already being implemented in a different way and wont take offense if the PR is rejected I am also happy to make adjustmentsadditions to make it comply
