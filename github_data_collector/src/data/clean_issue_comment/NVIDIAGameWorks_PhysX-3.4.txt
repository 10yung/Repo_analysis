From time to time ive got assertion failure in this line PhysX use require to name some variable eg NpRigidDynamicrequires This is a keyword for C a concepts and will make C a project fail to compile Any advise to fix it If a patch provided thats would be great No matter Ue or PhysX Visual Debugger I cant debug the heightfield hole When they render static rigid body they just ignore the brief Special material index values for height field samples see PxHeightFieldSamplematerialIndex PxHeightFieldSamplematerialIndex struct PxHeightFieldMaterial enum Enum eHOLE A material indicating that the triangle should be treated as a hole in the mesh material in PxHeightFieldSampleh Hey Im using DS Max and the PhysX Plugin for DS max v I added Triangle collision to objects and everything works fine The only thing I have problems with is the Camera Collision Detection Its a third person game and if u are right next to a wall u can look trough it I read a documentation which said that I need to adjust the skin width in the gamebryo Process Script Physx Extractor Plugin but that doesnt helped The exportet file is a nif Toolbar PhysX PhysX Extractor Im using D Studio Max DCC plugin for PhysX and ds Max My using steps Create Dynamic Rig select the left knee joint which is between the left thigh and the left calf set Constraint Limits as Hard Limits Start simulation I can see the thigh and the calf moves exceeding the Swing Y Limits I also exported PhysXScene to see the parameters nvpxPrepExportPhysXScene true RepX nvpxPrepExportPhysXProj true nvpxExportPhysXProject test exported The exported file shows the knee joints Stiffness and Damping of SwingLimit are always and like this SwingLimit Restitution Restitution BounceThreshold BounceThreshold Stiffness Stiffness Damping Damping ContactDistance ContactDistance YAngle YAngle ZAngle e ZAngle SwingLimit After trying all parameters combination I found that there is no way to set a limited joints contraint limits as hard limits or say there is no way to change Stiffness and Damping of SwingLimit Hi Im trying multi client and I find that PxControllerManagercreateController adds actor into the scene without calling setOwnerClient Is there any way to call setOwnerClient before controller adds actor into the scene Is APEX source code provided in this and PhysX repositories full Im not seeing many parts such as particles force fields turbulence Could it be possible to see full APEX source code Even though its deprecated it has nice features that could be brought along I got a crash inside NpScenefetchResults on Android The
