Dear brandynbok and ericqian First of all thank you for the code which is very well written and documented I have a question about the likelihood in the interation of EM step When I set the initial value of the parameter to a random numberthe value of likelihood decrease with the interation of EM ooking forward to hearing more from you on this matter Thank you for your answer Regards Weiwei Cao Dear brandynbok and ericqian Thank you for the code It is very well written and documented I have a question regarding last the two plots in the exampledfmm The second plot that plots the common factor uses the standardized smoothed value of all the variables on the yaxis but for the common component uses only the INDPRO variable What is the reason for that Also in the last plot The project of common component onto PAYEMS and GDPC Shouldnt the common component be a lot smoother than the original data Looking forward to hearing more from you on this matter Thank you for your answer Regards Ahmed Junaid Khalid Dear brandynbok and ericqian First of all thank you for the code which is very well written and documented I have a question of updating of the matrix C in the function EMstep after finished the iteration of EM step the matrix C just change a little and the coefficient of quartly variable do not change I want to know thats why and how to deal with this problem Thank you and best regards Weiwei Cao
