Some questions about the ZeroTier Knowledgebase page Layer Bridging of Ethernet and ZeroTier Networks on Linux The wiki ask me to install bridgeutils but CentOS remove the package Describe the bug A clear and concise description of what the bug is At least on Linux systems when temporary privacy extensions IPv addresses are enabled ZeroTier continues to send path discovery messages from the deprecated primary lifetime expired IP addresses ZeroTier should only source messages from nonexpired IPv addresses Sourcing from these expired IPv entries means ZeroTier is sending x the discovery frames as it needs to These also go to the ZeroTier root directory servers on the Public Internet so are a needless waste of metered Internet bandwidth And during rolls to a new IPv prefix as we just underwent means ZeroTier sources from IP addresses that arent even accessible in any way To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Run zerotier on a Linux system with IPv privacy addresses enabled Wait a couple days so you get some deprecated addresses in your address table Run tcpdump filtering on port and observe ZeroTier sourcing path discovery from the expired addresses Expected behavior ZeroTier should not source path discovery from expired IPv addresses Desktop please complete the following information OS Linux OSDistribution Version CentOS and ZeroTier Version As far as I understand it the changes made in a a to attempt to solve made it so that any NDP emulated address would count as valid source for an inbound packet regardless of the sender node Also the output of isV NDPEmulated is only taken into account when marking inbound packets as ZTRULEPACKETCHARACTERISTICSSENDERIPAUTHENTICATED outbound packets from the plane subnet other than would not get this this flag and thus dropped by the sender before they can get validated by the reciever as authentitcated nodeNetworkcpp Im not sure the changes I made on that file are valid so please provide feedback on this if possible Describe the bug If a ZeroTier clients parentupstream interface acquires an IP in same subnet as a ZTdefined managed route ZT appears to remove the conflicting route Fine but not necessary but ZT client does not readd the route if the parent subsequently acquires an IP in a different subnet if parent roams back out of the managed route network Use Case Laptop that roams intoout of workhome the managed route subnet work When I get home after being at the office I have to cycle the ZT connection to get the managed route back To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Connect remotely to a ZT network with managed route Observe successful connectivity to remote subnet via managed route Roam ZT clientparent into the managed route subnet parent interface is assignedacquires IP inside ZTdefined managed route subnet Observe continued successful connectivity to remote now local subnet ZT managed route is removed from parents routing table Roam ZT clientparent out of the managed route parent interface is assignedacquires IP not in the ZTdefined managed route subnet ERROR Observe loss of connectivity to nowremote again subnet ZT managed route is still missing from parents routing table Disconnectreconnect ZT network Observe reestablishment of connectivity to remote subnet ZT managed route is readded to parents routing table Get back to work Expected behavior Connectivity to remote via managed route subnet remains successfulautomatically reestablishes if parent interface roams intoout of the managed route subnet no real need to remove the conflicting route in the first place if parent interface finds itself in the same subnet as ZTdefined managed route except perhaps to avoid routing overhead trivial for my usecase Environment OS macOS Catalina ZeroTier Version Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe There are currently ZeroTierrelated images on Docker Hub with none of them belonging to the ZeroTier dockerhub user This can cause a lot of headaches for people that see Docker listed on the downloads page as they might pick a random image to use without checking if a version mismatch whether the Dockerfile was modified from the origin source before building etc It also means theres not a good way to add an Unraid app template to the ZeroTierNAS repo as youd be relying on a third partys docker image Having to doubletriple check all these things to install a securityfocused app is not ideal Describe the solution youd like As mentioned theres already a Dockerfile in the repo so it would be nice if the container image creationversioninghosting were added to the existing CI pipeline That way there would be an image available with versionbuild parity to other releases and it could be trusted Describe alternatives youve considered The other alternatives already exist ie buildinghosting a copy ourselves which work but are nonideal IMO due to my previous concerns Additional context This process could be added to the Jenkinsfile not sure how youre handling CI behind the scenes though but adding a trigger in docker hub to build on a new release would be easiest Would just need to specify the Build Context since the Dockerfile isnt in the root directory Here are the triggersregexes I use to set the image version and latest tags based on the v naming scheme Apologies if you already know all of this img src height x Hi all been using zerotier for a while on multiple raspberry pis windows and android My last Rapsberry Pi B i suddenly ran into some issues and im not sure where in the process it went wrong I cannot connect to the network and i also get segment fail And now it seems like the zerotier is going in loop and i cannot stop it Look at the ID each time i run ps aux it changed to a higher ID And it just keeps rising piraspberrypi ps aux grep zerotier pi pts S grep colorauto zerotier piraspberrypi ps aux grep zerotier pi pts S grep colorauto zerotier piraspberrypi ps aux grep zerotier pi pts S grep colorauto zerotier piraspberrypi How do i stop this Ive tried all commands To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Create a Network Install zerotierone See error Screenshots Desktop please complete the following information OS windows OSDistribution Version Insider ZeroTier Version eg Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I have a global IPv prefix on my physical LAN router and I would like to advertise it to my zerotier network so that every host gets ipv connectivity Because the prefix is subject to change as it is distributed by my ISP I cannot put it into Zerotier Central assignment pool So I set up a radvd daemon on the router and ask it to advertise the prefix to the zerotier interface A few tcpdump shows that my host receives RA messages but the global ipv address that should have been generated by SLAAC does not show up Describe the solution youd like Make ipv address assignable by native RASLAAC method Describe alternatives youve considered Adding the ipv address and route by handzerotier central I just downloaded ZeroTier One for android and I have configured my network properly However it says OFFLINE at the bottom and when I log into ZeroTier One it doesnt show it trying to connect I have manually added my client to my network and it just says its never connected I have tried the following Disconnected it on my phone and reconnected it times Uninstalled the app Checked and unchecked Route Via ZeroTier Checked and unchechecked Disable IPv currently unchecked Quadriple checked the network id and it is accurate Quadriple checked the client id in zero tier that it is correct Yet it stays OFFLINE Please help I am always using a VPN mullvad to browse the internet for various reasons but I know want to additionally use ZeroTier to access my smb shares on my server in another physical location I general it works well but I always get TUNNELING or OFFLINE when using mullvad Since my understanding of VPNs and the technology used in ZeroTier is limited I dont know what kind of settings to look for to make this work sidebyside
