Currently if I have a struct Foo and impl Foo rustytags generates two tags for Foo one for the type definition another one for the impl Most of the time unless Im looking for a function I only want type definitions so a flag for omitting impls would be helpful Previously no tags was created for cratepublic declared functions like following pubcrate fn foox u body
