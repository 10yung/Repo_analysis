I was trying to utilize a different kernel to the linear kernel and as a result was trying to create the MEX file for the libsvmpredictc function When I ran the code for creating the mex file from the libsvmcompilem file I encountered the following error In file included from libsvmpredictc svmh error expected identifier or before token svmh error expected identifier or before token libsvmpredictc

your framework I have longer training times than in your examples because I changed the features to CNHOG features To make the training faster I would like to limit the maximum number of trained exemplars which is possible by setting streamparamsstreammaxex for example to But if I do this the framework takes only the first images and initializes exemplars on this basis now my question Is it possible to tell the framework to select the images per random out of the trainings images In my case this is important because my example images have filenames with a specific structure so that images with similar names are more likely to each other Thanks a lot and kind regards Florian Hello I would like to use the part based deformable HOG features for my project As my project is in c I want the corresponding CC codes you have in the folder named as feature I would highly appreciate if you can give me these corresponding C codes The codes available in this particular folder are mex files and they cant be used from my xcode project in Mac Hi I have been trying to replace HOG with HMAX features in the ESVM framework When I do the training with HMAX features I get the following error ERROR number of negative support vectors is Something went wrong Can you explain what might be the cause for this error Thanks Fixed BUG that caused looping over all dataset every time we applied SVM to an image during mining of negatives Running time improved from quadratic to linear Optimized method for ipdating mining queue updatemqonepass No need to loop through all the queue two times to find elements to delete because in onepass mode we loop images iteratively onebyone Hi quantombone Is parameter defaultparamscalibrationpropagateontoraw the switch of cooccurrence Sugite Hi quantombone in the ESVM paper you said that you annotated all the bus class of Pascal VOC with segmentation masks and geometry structures Are those annotations available somewhere I could really use them for some experiments in my Masters Thesis Thank you very much Federico Hi I was trying to replace HoG features with dense SIFT features However I found esvmdetectm will change feature dimension especially for HoG Simply replacing modelx with SIFT feature will not work Is there any suggestion helping me develop the codes replace HoG with other features Thanks in line of esvmdetect pyrN cellfun is calculated for the number of HOGS that fit inside each level of the pyramid however the prod of a negative size will be positive which leads to zeros at the end of the matrix X Later offsets bb is referenced which may be out of range since sizeoffsets sizeX instead of pyrN cellfunxprod sizex sizex S thog it should be pyrN cellfunxprodmax sizex sizex S thog Amir
