This follows up on the changes in cmake Of what seemed to be relevant to the commandline in the release notes I skipped CMAKECUDARESOLVEDEVICESYMBOLS and CMAKEECLIPSERESOURCEENCODING as I am not confident about how they are intended how to be used what the possible useful values would be x This compdef is not already available in zsh x This compdef is not already available in their original project x I am the original author x This is a finished work x It has a header containing authors status and origin of the script x I accept that it will be licensed under the terms of the Zsh license It may be a nice idea to provide a completions for kind zsh compinit insecure files run compaudit for list Ignore insecure files and continue y or abort compinit n y Execute the compaudit command to get the following file path here are insecure files usrlocalsharezshsitefunctionsbrewservices usrlocalsharezshsitefunctionscarthage How can I solve it thank Ive found one other interesting command thats lacking any completion mc the Midnight Commander The completion is of good quality it covers all the options and also completes directories for the panes x This compdef is not already available in zsh x This compdef is not already available in their original project x I am the original author or I have authorization to submit this work x This is a finished work x It has a header containing authors status and origin of the script x It has a license header or I accept that it will be licensed under the terms of the Zsh license Thank you so much for your PR Please provide a general summary of your changes in the title above If submitting a new compdef please check it is compliant with our contributing guidelines and tick the boxes x This compdef is not already available in zsh x This compdef is not already available in their original project x I am the original author or I have authorization to submit this work x This is a finished work x It has a header containing authors status and origin of the script x It has a license header or I accept that it will be licensed under the terms of the Zsh license Is there a way to globally exclude a path from all completions When cding into the keybase path hierarchy I get multiple permission denied errors because completion I think is trying to scan potential folders as I type The keybase path is where Keybases KBFS is mounted which allows you access to any users public files plus private team files etc Thank you for writing this it makes my command line so much better yarn add localpath cannot completion absolute path in filesystem The node autocompletion restricts to js files which works well for the general use case but when processing a profile log with profprocess it becomes difficult to complete the log files generated by prof Im not sure if the completion system can handle it but it would be nice if it would switch to completing log files when the profprocess flag is passed edit is not included
