version and all users are stored in MySQL as the default storage I guess we will have to migrate that to SQLite that is the new default storage for config and DF users But there are no documentation at all about upgrading from x x nor any release notes in the Wiki for x Are there more breaking changes or things to consider when upgrading Is the upgrade process automatic Database migrations moving from MySQL to SQLite and so on Documentation about this is really required Thanks I have several stored procedures in a firebird database Trying to access any of them does not succeed Feedback from the system is always an empty resource for both func or proc resource If I try to access any of them with its name eg or I always receive error code context null message Function SPDELETEINVOICE does
