appear GIF of Issue in full project Expected behavior I can select rows on the table on the first try Versions Libraries BootstrapVue Bootstrap Vue Environment Device Windows latest Chrome and Firefox others on phones etc Demo link Additional context My demo is a stripped down part from a project which uses CoreUI which may be related In the project selecting never works where in the demo it starts to after exiting a select mode In the code sandbox it worked as expected originally but when I started adding more to figure out the issue it broke When I added these libraries it stopped working not even imported in mainjs just added to the dependencies coreuicoreuipro beta coreuivue beta Removing them did not fix the issue so maybe something else is at fault I attempted to work around this buy having two tables one you can select one is viewonly that use vif and else that also result in unselectable rows I finally added keys to both and that seems to work but is ugly Describe the PR This PR
