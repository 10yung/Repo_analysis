We are using nomnoml to generate display only ERdiagrams and would like to add some minimal interactivity where the users could click the boxes and see some related help info or possibly navigate to other web pages Theres nothing specifically built into nomnoml for such interactivity right But Im hoping its still possible but Im not sure eg Im a little new to SVG but I understand its a DOM underneath and adding onclick handlers is in theory possible right eg as described here But Im imagining to do the above I would use nomnoml to generate my SVG and then separately oldschooljquerystyle find the rect elements and bind my click handlers to them But that would traditionally mean eg finding those elements by known ids on them right But I see a closed issue here that rejected the idea of having the nomnoml syntax let you assign ids or css class names In general am I thinking right or is there a differentbetter way If this is thinking right then is there a way I can find specific nomnoml generated SVG elements without having such ids on them Influencing visual effects Look at the picture Not an issue just wanted to give you a heads up that I wrote a chrome extension that finds markdown codeblocks on every page syntaxed with nomnoml and renders a clickable rendered diagram right before the codeblock Been using it for a month now and its been great to include flow diagrams in the readme of my projects and to have the rendered automatically right in github Thanks for making such a great library It was really easy to build on top of It would be great to have a syntax for assigning a shorter alias to nodes Sometimes Ill have very large diagrams with long node names it makes it difficult to update each instance of the node in the structure example nomnoml pum Progressive Utility Matrix pum Hyperwave Shell actor pum nitrogen shock containment field Still can use the original Node name Progressive Utility Matrix Tau Particle Any syntax can work I dont know what would be easiest in regards to the internal parser I would be interested in taking a stab at this feature and making a PR If you could let me know how doable this is and any tipsplaces in code to get started that would be great img width altpic src Like this situation there should are three arrows but two of them are covered Im evaluating nomnoml for our app but after playing a little bit I found out edge labels can be cut off For example Order A B C D Order line Z Y X Order Order OrderLines Order line Is there a workaround Hi all First I want to thank Daniel for the really balanced tool Keep it up One day it might really become a supported feature of GitHubs Markdown itself Well what I found missing however is the simple directive background which should fill diagram back layer with specified colour It is really annoying that I need to specify for different vscode extensions what they should backing diagrams with skanaar Can you consider this Thank you The ability to create and link more than two classifier on a single line may be usefull two avoid repetitions example Alice Bob Bob Carol Carol Dave could became Alice Bob Carol Dave I want to make arrows across package for example package A Cat BDog package B Dog Is there any way to do this Great project BTW
