I have a use case a list of blocks each of which has another list and both the block list items and sublist items should be draggable and droppable I tried your lib Only block level moves Any plan to add nested dnd Thanks Example I can observe the problem in Safari on iOS It works fine in every other browser I tried Even Safari on desktop works But with Safari on iOS what I see there is that the table displays and reordering the table by dragging the handles works but scrolling the table to the right does not work I havent looked into the reactmovable code at all but Im guessing that somehow reactmovable is blocking whatever clickdrag event that Safari uses for scrolling Which is a sensible thing for reactmovable to do to implement reordering via dragging But in this case since my table uses datamovablehandle to specify only one column of the table as the handle reactmovable shouldnt be interfering at all with clickdrag events in other columns I previously had a similar table made with reactsortablehoc that didnt have this problem so it must be possible for it to work Hi tajo Here the commit with changes from issue I called the new callback afterDrag as you suggested so that it matches to the existing beforeDrag It is called right before onChange and contains the new index of the dragged element Both beforeDrag and afterDrag callbacks are now the ClientRect object Since we cant access the ghostRef when beforeDrag is called Im returning the ClientRect of the original DOM element Also added onMove callback I havent implemented its triggered when list elements are moved with keyboard shortcuts as it contains the mouse coordinates and they are not quite relevant when moving the items with keyboard Regarding the tests I havent found any of them for beforeDrag in the existing codebase so I havent written tests for new callbacks Let me know if you find them necessary Thanks Andrey Hello First of all thanks for great library simple and clean Readme states that IE is supported but Ive encountered small issue with it Here findIndex method is used which seems to be not fully supported by IE At least Ive got img width altScreen Shot at PM src and had to add this library to webpack config I appreciate your focus on minimalism and sticking to just the essentials Its a great library Im wondering if any of the following additions would make the cut to be added onDragEnd event that fires regardless of whether a change occurs or not Im using beforeDrag to track when dragging is actually occurring and customizing the UI But I need custom logic to determine when it stops Send the clientX and clientY positions as part of the beforeDrag event onMove event that includes clientX and clientY I think would allow for greater customization without adding any bulk to the library Personally Id like to use to change the cursor to a grabber only once the item has been dragged px Why Because its clickable until its been dragged a few pixels similar to Trello drag and drop Im having trouble to get scrolling within nested containers to work properly and I hope that you can point me in the right direction Description My layout is created using a CSS grid without having any exact widthheight values responsive One of the fields is completely filled by a reactstrap Card component C C contains the actual list L which managesincludes the movable list entries A simplified example can be found here With explicit size for display of the main container Question Given these circumstances I seem to be unable to get scrolling to work As far as I know I need to set overflow on C due to limitations regarding overflow scrolling within flexgrid layouts when not setting widthheights explicitly But if I do that reactmovable doesnt seem to be able to pick up the scrolling necessities see previous example I also tried to include C within LrenderList which solves the scrolling issue but when I try to drag an item the whole list is displayed as movable object The last thing I tried was setting overflow on L directly but then overflow is not working at all Any help regarding the correct practice would be much appreciated as I really enjoy this simple to use but effective package Thanks So I have items with a drag handle datamovablehandle When touching and dragging on the rest of the item I expect the page to scroll It doesnt
