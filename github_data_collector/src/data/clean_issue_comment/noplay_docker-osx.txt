Hi bfirsh with docker out should we replace the whole project by a link to boo tdocker I get weird file corruption when mounting varwww into this container It seems to be specific to nginx in combination with dockerosx not sure if the same happens with other virtualisation countainers that mount stuff from the host machine into the VM I could not reproduce this on a pure linuxdocker host I had this on MacOSX and a fresh dockerosx install dockerosx shell mkdir Sitesnginxtest docker run rm i t v UsersstefanfoulisSitesnginxtestusrlocalnginxhtml p nginxlatest curl html headtitle Not Foundtitlehead body bgcolorwhite centerh Not Foundh center hrcenternginx center body html All fine so far echo Hi there Sitesnginxtestindexhtml curl Hi there So far so good Lets add something to the file echo More stuff Sitesnginxtestindexhtml curl Hi there The new line is missing Even stopping the container and starting a new one will not have the change show up C docker run rm i t v UsersstefanfoulisSitesnginxtestusrlocalnginxhtml p nginxlatest curl Hi there And what is super weird I can connect to the container with bash run nginx in the backround and observe the files changing in the filesystem But nginx does not pick them up docker run rm i t v UsersstefanfoulisSitesnginxtestusrlocalnginxhtml p nginxlatest binbash roote e fae a usrlocalnginxhtml nginx roote e fae a usrlocalnginxhtml cat indexhtml Hi there More stuff but at the same time from the host curl Hi there Deleting the file gets picked up though rm Sitesnginxtestindexhtml curl html headtitle Not Foundtitlehead body bgcolorwhite centerh Not Foundh center hrcenternginx center body html And now it gets interesting Overwriting a file with a shorter content will show the content of the old file but truncated at the length of the new file echo And now for something completely different Sitesnginxtestindexhtml curl And now for something completely different echo Now a shorter text Sitesnginxtestindexhtml curl And now for somethi echo A way longer text that contains completely different content Did I mention it is longer Sitesnginxtestindexhtml curl And now for something completely different It looks like its tied to the first request done with a new file If you delete the file and make at least one request for that file and get a and then readd it the new file contents will be picked up It seems to be a combination of dockerosx and nginx I experienced this with the orchardupnginx docker image as well We did a quick test with an apache image which did not show this behaviour My wild speculation I suspect nginx is doing some deep magic in the way it detects file changes and caches it somehow but apparently not just in memory otherwise it would not survive container destruction and restart Something with the docker abstraction of the volumes and maybe just in combination of using a volume that was shared to the vm from the host os and how nginx reads the files Im linking this issue from docker and the official nginx docker image as well as Im not sure where the issue originates Some additional environment information docker version Client version Client API version Go version client go Git commit client bd d Server version Server API version Go version server go Git commit server bd d Hi there This is with a fresh install of vagrant and virtual box and using the default dockerosx settings and environment variables Any assistance as to where Im going wrong would be greatly appreciated dockerosx shell Starting local Docker

Retrying default Warning Connection timeout Retrying default Warning Connection timeout Retrying Timed out while waiting for the machine to boot This means that Vagrant was unable to communicate with the guest machine within the configured configvmboottimeout value time period If you look above you should be able to see the errors that Vagrant had when attempting to connect to the machine These errors are usually good hints as to what may be wrong If youre using a custom box make sure that networking is properly working and youre able to connect to the machine It is a common problem that networking isnt setup properly in these boxes Verify that authentication configurations are also setup properly as well If the box appears to be booting properly you may want to increase the timeout configvmboottimeout value Fixed issue I have a situation where calling docker run v pwdapp image pserve developmentini is really slow due to the fact that vagrant has to sync a rather large directory at pwd Ive found that changing this line configvmsyncedfolder echo echo create true mountoptions dmode fmode To configvmsyncedfolder Usersjayd e Usersjayd e nfs true Eliminates the problem Just wanted to get some insight into the options that I removed and why they are there in the first place is there a way to cleanly uninstall I used homebrew to install gnutar in the past because of a problem with OS Xs builtin tar This causes dockerosx installation to fail The output of dockerosx shell is Installing Docker client Total Received Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total
