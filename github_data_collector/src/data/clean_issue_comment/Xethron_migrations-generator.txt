the code to be able to set the columncolumnname as columnCOLUMNNAME and columncolumntype too I have two connections having the same table names say connection mysql has a table called products connection inventory has a table called products when I generate migrations for both connections both of them lies on the same folder databasemigrations with the same class name which causes this error Cannot declare class CreateProductsTable because the name is already in use Kindly guide me a quick fix In my application it already have some existing migration and some of the table was not I wish that if we can run php artisan migrategenerate ignorecreatedmigration then it generate only the migrations that not yet create Please tell me if this suggestion is feasible Laravel Compatibility

need to create migration scripts But when I generate the migration script via the command php artisan migrategenerate I get the following error Doctrine DBAL DBALException Unknown database type hstore
