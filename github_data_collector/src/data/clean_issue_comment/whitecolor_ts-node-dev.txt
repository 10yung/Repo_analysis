Hello I try to use compiler option sh tsnodedev compiler ttypescript srcindexts though it has no effect Everything works with sh tsnode compiler ttypescript srcindexts I looked into source code and everything seems to be in place so I cannot even submit PR Any idea why it may happen I can create example repository if that helps When I run nodemodulestsnodedevbintsnodedev respawn srcserverjs ignorewatch srcnext on version pre the ignorewatch argument has no effect I put in a consolelogopts in the bintsnodedev file and it prints js srcserverjs ignorewatch srcnext alldeps false deps true dedupe false poll false respawn true notify true fast false F false disableWarnings false disablewarnings false nocache false cache false typecheck false transpileonly false transpileOnly false T false files false pretty false preferts false execcheck false debug false logerror false prefertsexts false treekill false clear false cls false exitchild false rs true priorNodeArgs which seems not right maybe a bug in minimalist or the config As you can see here The script calls notify whenever the process is restarted and notifications can be disabled completely using the notifyfalse flag on the CLI This is good But It would be cool to have the option of notifications only on errors As it is right now I have to choose between being flooded with restart notifications and occasionally seeing an error notification or disabling notifications and not knowing when my TS doesnt compile or something npm audit security report Run npm update treekill depth to resolve vulnerability High Command Injection Package treekill Dependency of tsnodedev dev Path tsnodedev treekill More info treekill package should be upgraded to version or later according to npm Overview Versions of treekill prior to are vulnerable to Command Injection The package fails to sanitize values passed to the kill function If this value is usercontrolled it may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the server The issue only affects Windows systems Remediation Upgrade to version or later I run my my TypeScript app as follows bash tsnodedev transpileOnly ignorewatch nodemodules srcclientts srcclientts is just as follows typescript import as process from process import as repl from repl replstart prompt terminal The REPL terminal becomes completely unusable If I press Enter I get rlon line If I type a char its not written just one of each or chars are written I have to press CtrlC times to exit the process etc etc unusable This does not happen if I run my app without tsnodedev Do I miss something I see that somehow tsnodedev opens a REPL by itself but its unclear for me how to use it Anyway is there any way to disable such a REPL BTW running with tsnode as follows the issue does not happen I can use my REPL terminal perfectly bash tsnode srcclientts Bumps handlebars from to details summaryChangelogsummary Sourced from handlebarss changelog v November th Bugfixes fix add

testassertions and spies deprecate old assertionmethods e e ba dad a Security The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing

filechangeslogging I would like to disable the similar places js function start consolelog Using tsnode version tsNodeVersion typescript version tsVersion I suggest to add option verbose bool for this for completely disabling consolelog from tsnodedev Hello This project is wonderful One of the newer features tsnode has added is a symbol on the process that can be used to detect if we are running in typescript or JS This is very helpful when developing frameworks like wwwactionherojscom to know which types of files to load in even when running as a distributed javascript package The tsnode converstation Could this be ported that to tsnodedev It disables logging of new line listener Reproduction steps run tsnodedev press Enter button
