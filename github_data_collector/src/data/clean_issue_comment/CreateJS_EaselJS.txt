 Issue Details createJs version if a Tween is added to some timeline on some target tween cjsTweengettarget timelineaddTweentweenwait if target is an instance of createjsDisplayObject then in below mentioned resolveState functionMovieClipjs addManagedChildMovieClipjs adds that target as a child to owner of the timeline Consider thisremoveChildtarget is called and target is removed from parent but child is still there because on next tick target again gets added as child in resolveState function and it looks like removeChild didnt work presolveState function var tl thistimeline

track of the clip if it is renamed or removed from the timeline which causes it to reset TODO should also reset when MovieClip loops though that will be a bit tricky to detect if childmode

thisremoveChildtarget targetoff true this could be done either outside createjs or can be made part of removeChild and addChild functions Is this ok or is there any other solution or any other approach to solve this problem Bumps lodash from to details summaryRelease notessummary Sourced from lodashs releases lodash v was big year Lodash became the most depended on npm package passed billion downloads its v release saw massive adoption The year was also one of collaboration as discussions began on merging Lodash Underscore Much of Lodash v is proofing out the ideas from those discussions Lodash v would not be possible without the collaboration contributions of the Underscore core team In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with several members contributing to both libraries For lodash v we wanted to cut loose push forward take things up a notch Modern only With v we re breaking free from old projects old environments dropping old IE support kB Core Lodash s kitchensink size will continue to grow as new methods functionality are added However we now offer a kB gzipped core build that s compatible with Backbone v for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink More ES We ve continued to embrace ES with methods like isSymbol added support for cloning comparing array buffers maps sets symbols converting iterators to arrays iterable In addition we ve published an esbuild pulled babelpluginlodash into core to make treeshaking a breeze More Modular Pop quiz What category path does the bindAll method belong to Is it A requirelodashfunctionbindAll B requirelodashutilitybindAll C requirelodashutilbindAll Don t know Well with v it doesn t matter because now module paths are as simple as js var bindAll requirelodashbindAll We ve also reduced module complexity making it easier to create smaller bundles This has helped Lodash adoption with libraries like Async Redux st Class FP With v we introduced

Security Alerts page details I have developed a slot game with reels When played in android chrome it doesnt work good when i click anywhere on the screen for no reason the FPS drops if there is any animation playing at the background they freeze when i click the interactive object or if i click on the screen This happens only in mobile We have split the canvas and we have less animations in each canvas running everytime while in android firefox it works perfect but in android chrome it freezes for a single click I tried to disable stagemousedownup events becos they are being triggered when i simply click anywhere in the stage It brings down the FPS to almost from when we click continuously almost in all PC browsers In mobiles android firefox doesnt have this issue where as in chrome its affecting the animations Its like of freezing for a second when we click I tried with RAF and RAFSYNCHED but still no improvement Im sure its because of stagemousedownup events

soStagebonusupdateevent The issue is the domelement is drawn in the correct xy location only when the browser inner window aspect ratio exactly matches the aspect ratio of the stage As the browser window is stretched wider and wider the DomElement is drawn further offset to the left Same for stretching the window tall It appears to me that the base x and y values being used are the top and left edges of the window rather than the top and left edges of the stage See my sample video below For example if I set the y value of the Domelement to the element is always drawn pixels from the top of the browser window even when the window is dragged taller and taller It fails to translate down as the top of the stage moves down in y I put up a live demo to try out Drag the aspect ratio of the window to something other than and you will see the issue Is there a release schedule available It seems the latest release on NPM was pushed years ago same with release in GH even though theres been

slightly over the last version It seems that MovieClips are wrapped in MovieClips and when you run these from Animate it all seems to work but if you instantiate the outer clip with code going to the

a much better place to ask any questions you may have x Did you search the issues to see if someone else has already reported your issue If yes please add more details if you have any If youre using an older version have you tried the latest If youre requesting a new feature provide as many details as you can Why do you want this feature Do you have ideas for how this feature should be implemented Pseudocode is always welcome Issue Details Version used Ex EaselJS Describe whats happening Include any relevant console errors a Gist is preferred for longer errors Im not sure if this is specifially with imageSmoothingEnabled or if its an issue with snapToPixelEnabled but as you can see in this video using the browser to scale up and down works great however when I input a scaleX or scaleY it fails Previously I had used bitmaps for every tile but I recently switched over to a SpriteSheet Sprites It worked perfectly with bitmaps but it does not work at all with sprites you can see it gets blurry OS Browser version Please be specific Ex Windows Home Chrome Microsoft Edge Official build dev bit Windows OS Version Build Issue persits in Google Chrome Google Chrome Official Build bit cohort Stable Do you know of any workarounds Nope not other than literally scalingresizing the canvas itself by either zooming or setting its width and height using CSS Provide any extra details that will help us fix your issue Including a link to a CodePenio or JSFiddlenet example that shows the issue in isolation will greatly increase the chance of getting a quick response Unfortunately I cant really provide an example code just the MP
