I found by guessing that something like exclude vendorscss nodemodulesscss works nicely for allowing multiple exclude globs but AFAICS this is not documented Hi I wrote this small script to generate a config where the existing offending files are excluded for each linter instead of disabling the whole linter for the project Maybe the config reporter should do something like it ruby output x scsslint todoconfig linters outputscan d d do match filepath line column offencetype lintername description match todoconfigfetchlinters lintername exclude unless todoconfigfetchlintersfetchlinternamefetchexcludeincludefilepath todoconfigfetchlintersfetchlinternamefetchexclude filepath end end puts todoconfigtoyaml Similar to and digit hex codes are a W C standard meaning RGBA and RRGGBBAA respectively The linter should allow these perhaps with an optional toggle flag Further reading W C MDN Hi I looked through all the feature request open and closed and did not see the issue being asked The Feature Request is so Scss will look through all the files to see if the class name or HTML selector has been called before in at least one different SCSS file and if so it will throw a warningerror in the terminal to inform the user the name has been used so they might need to merge themcheck it so they can check it and do the appropriate response of either editingremoving or refactoring the SCSS or simply adding a disable and reenable It would help track down SCSS bugs and help make sure to make reusable SCSS that will help keep code clean and modular scsslintyml Using version yml PseudoElement enabled true Error Message PseudoElement Begin pseudo classes with a single colon Code scss placeholder color blue MDN says The placeholder property is written with two colons I have replicated a bug I saw in my own project in the test suite In my project I added a reenabling control comment after to pass the linter but that shouldnt be necessary My uneducated guess is that this is actually a parsing error rather than a bug in the control comment logic but Im not familiar enough with the scsslint internals to go further at this time Im using CSS Modules with SCSS via Im using the CSS Modules export feature to send my SCSS variables to Javascript css export headerHeight headerheight When I do this I get a scsslint error Unknown property headerHeight Id like the ability with scsslint to use arbitrary property names within an export block possibly behind a rule toggle Hi While I love SpaceAroundOperator for equations I wouldnt want them applied to my font shorthand rules but they seem to be SpaceAroundOperator rem should be written with a single space on each side of the operator rem In the documentation it does not seem that this should be occuring Note that this linter only applies to actual evaluated operators So values like nthchild n px px and myfont will not be linted as they are valid CSS my scsslintyml is set to SpaceAroundOperator enabled true style onespace or atleastonespace or nospace Question I used to have a setting that enforced to have a separate file for variables So I had to import these variables in order to have no errors after linting But unfortunately I lost this setting Does anyone know this rule This is a snippet of mainscss file When using my old setting this would throw an error Just because I am using a variable in line that I have just defined in the same mainscss file in line bgcolor rgb body backgroundcolor bgcolor With a rule that includes an intersection selector like hasimage sharebuttonstop sharebuttongoogle The NestingDepth linter complains Nesting should be no greater than but was In my opinion this is incorrect there are three levels of nesting in this rule not four The linter is counting one node as two
