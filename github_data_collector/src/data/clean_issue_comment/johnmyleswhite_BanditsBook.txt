 Hello John First thank you for writing one of the most enjoyable books in the domain One thing that puzzled me was since most of the code was in python why did we not have the charts and visualizations in python as well Since I did not know R I spend quite some time into recreating these with matplotlib while I was working thought the book example here I know there hasnt been any commits to this repo fo a while but I was wondering if you would be interested in adding these to your repo If so what would be a good way to structure them my plots are in Jupyter notebooks but I can split them into files I could raise a pull request in case youre interested but feel free to close this issue if this isnt something youd like to pursue We are currently working on a R package contextual that aims to facilitate the implementation and simulation of both contextfree and contextual MultiArmed Bandit policies in R As Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization offers a comprehensive entrylevel introduction to contextfree bandits policy evaluation we decided to replicate the books simulations In doing so we found that the books source code in this repository deterministically chooses the first arm in other words the arm with the lowest index when rewards between arms are tied def indmaxx m maxx return xindexm As can be seen in our replication vignette this introduces a bias that adds up over time changing simulations results and plots To illustrate left our replication of Figure without breaking ties randomly right when correctly breaking ties randomly compare A patch along the following lines would resolve this issue by breaking ties randomly def indmaxx maxvalue maxx maxkeys k for k v in enumeratex if v maxvalue return randomchoicemaxkeys I presume that the now closed but unresolved also alluded to this particular issue If the proposed changes are okay I plan to work on the rest of the Julia code base to bring it up to speed with I tried to implement thompson sampling please add this if possible now only R is shown beside this repository name if we click to show all your repos if possible change the description to show that other language code exists in this repo maybe like code in julia R python Ruby for my book on MultiArmed Bandit Algorithms The right arm cant be arm number since arm numbers run from to Also after suffling the values for the means the maximum value is not any longer at the end of the list but in the second place seed is to blame for this Rewrite some example code and use more idiomatic python style PS How to run the tests for these examples
