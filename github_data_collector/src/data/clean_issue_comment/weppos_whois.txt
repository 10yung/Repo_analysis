whoislookupaeliuscom if recordnil or recordpartsempty raise Error unable to load whois end p record Result Traceback most recent call last from testrb in main from Usersnjhrbenvversions librubygems

nick Our network admins want us to use whoisianaorg for our whois service and that this IP address they opened in the firewall It would be good to have a feature to set the default address for the whois service for all queries Currently this can kind of be done for IPv with a mask of WhoisServerdefineipv ipv range thewhoisserveraddress Does not work Setting a range did not set the address of the whois service whois h whoisradbnet i origin AS Im trying to get the ips of facebooks crawlers but need to pass the i origin option Hi We have an internal whois server that queries a couple different sources of information Output takes some time and looks like this DNS results xxxxxxxxxxxx companycom Infoblox results XX XXNet XX XXNet XX XXNet Foobar matches Baz matches Boo matches Feh
