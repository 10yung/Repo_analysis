rust error missing documentation for macro srcmacrosrs macrorules sudoiostaticfn note lint level defined here srclibrs denywarnings note denymissingdocs implied by denywarnings error missing documentation for macro srcmacrosrs macrorules sudoiofn error aborting due to previous errors error Could not compile sudoplugin Using denywarnings is really bad idea since software would stop compiling after compiler update Please use D warnings in CI instead Closes Pushing the work so far but Ill add tests when I have a moment For maintainability Id love to be able to specify group names in addition to GIDs for gidsexempted My rustfoo is superficial at best but Im thinking this should be doable by extending issudoingfromexemptedgid what do you think Right now sudopair does not show who approvedis watching the session would be nice to have that in there We should make it easier to install this plugin When I get time Id like to do fuzz testing sudoplugin despite its generic name currently only supports creating IO plugins and not policy plugins Would you consider policy plugins to be inscope for the crate PS Many thanks for releasing sudopair and making sudoplugin available as a reusable crate
