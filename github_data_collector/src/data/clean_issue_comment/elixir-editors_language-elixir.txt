The atombrackets package is configured to expand into in commentdocumentationheredocelixir contexts To avoid this and close this changes literal heredoc contexts S to have a more specific tag commentdocumentationheredocliteralelixir Tested by apm linking the modified languageelixir locally and confirmed that no longer expanded in literal heredocs Also modified existing tests to expect the new name where appropriate Currently using monokaishade theme and the styles on typespec keywords are nearly white which is quite loud visually distracts from the function definition itself and unfortunately discourages me from writing typespecs Id love to be able to target and adjust the styles on typespec keywords eg type typename type typep typename type opaque typename type spec functionnametype type returntype callback functionnametype type returntype macrocallback macronametype type Macrot Im thinking similarly to the syntaxdocumentation class added to doc moduledocs tacking on an extra class like syntaxtypespec or something Any thoughts attr value ok attr value is not colored attr value is not colored ttr value nothing is clored languageelixir version If i try to indent a multiline map the plugin will indent the map incorrectly For example the autoindented map will look like this foo bar baz buzz Where it should be foo bar baz buzz of note if you try to make a map with newlines ie javascript style it autoindents fine foo bar baz buzz however this is not usually how elixir code is formatted The same is true for keyword lists as well as structs When I type inside documentation block I get it replaced by I understand it should be interpreted as a markdown code I get moduledoc Blah blah blah Examples instead of moduledoc Blah blah blah Examples Am I doing something wrong For example the following code is the result of auto indent with the plugin eex formfor changeset action fn f if changesetaction do div classalert alertdanger pOops something went wrong Please check the errors belowp div end div classformgroup label f name class controllabel textinput f name class formcontrol errortag f name div div classformgroup submit Submit class btn btnprimary div end but it should be formatted like so eex formfor changeset action fn f if changesetaction do div classalert alertdanger pOops something went wrong Please check the errors belowp div end div classformgroup label f name class controllabel textinput f name class formcontrol errortag f name div div classformgroup submit Submit class btn btnprimary div end with a corresponding end should be indented atom ver beta bd c languageelixir ver It seems autoindent does not properly unindent branches of case Instead of elixir defmodule Demo do def demovalue do case value do one doone two dotwo three dothree end end end you get elixir defmodule Demo do def demovalue do case value do one doone two dotwo three dothree end end end
