Question fastlane pilot distribute Question Description I currently distribute a previously uploaded build via fastlane which works pretty well since the command above figures the latest built out itself But I have the actual build number and want to provide it myself Is that possible I didnt find any documentationrelated to this New Issue Checklist x Updated fastlane to the latest version x I read the Contribution Guidelines x I read docsfastlanetools x I searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description Since fastlane nuke and recreating my profiles and certificates with fastlane match I cant select any of the installed signing certificates in XCode when exporting after archiving the app The certificate shows up in the General and Build Settings tab of XCode however Fastlane shows the same error as Xcode does No signing certificate iOS Distribution found No iOS Distribution signing certificate matching team ID xxx with a private key was found in target xxx Match was run on my machine successfully and the new certificate shows up in my keychain as valid I suspect this is due to the renaming of the certificates The old ones were called iPhone Distribution xxx xxx the new ones are Apple Distribution xxx xxx If I ask XCode to recreate a certificate it will be named iPhone Distribution as well Command executed The command you executed on the command line that resulted in an error Complete output when running fastlane including the stack trace and command used You can use captureoutput as the last command line argument for many commands to get that collected for you Otherwise please do it manually Caution The output of captureoutput could contain sensitive data such as application ids certificate ids or email addresses Please make sure you

is this change required What problem does it solve If it fixes an open issue please link to the issue here Sometimes we want to ignore the patch version number ie Bitrise does not keep track of it Currently if we check for Xcode version while having the version installed the action will fail Description Describe your changes in detail Please describe in detail how you tested your changes These changes add more flexibility Instead of matching the whole string we can simply split it to an array based on the separator and only care about the version numbers actually specified For instance Checking for the Xcode version while having will match with and with but discard the last patch version number On the other hand when specifying while having will mismatch with and nil Thanks for

to upload a new build and submit it for external testing at the same time Question Description Im going down a rabbit hole at the moment with spaceship trying to build a workflow that works for my team It feels like it would be a common workflow so I wanted to ask before I reinvented multiple wheels here Im trying to do the following Build App Submit to Appstore create new submission But not submit for review Submit for external testflight testing and assign to a group What Ive tried so far I can build the app and submit to app store Using spaceship I can find that build and submit for external testing Using spaceship I can later submit this app for review and release accordingly Pilot and Deliver both want to upload IPAs which seems wasteful for this use case since its the same IPA
