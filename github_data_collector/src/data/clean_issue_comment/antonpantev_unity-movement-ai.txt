Hey When I set the flocking D to fly with no gravity StayGrounded is false the flocking objects clump together confused especially at the center of unity space Its like a gravity well Let me know how to fix it It seems like they lose direction velocity when theyre on top of each other Thanks Hello I have a voxel terrain generator minecraft like and your script works well on telling the AI to move to a certain point but the problem is that it doesnt climbjump the meter height blocks I saw that there is a jump function but I guess its not implemented Thinking how I should tell the character to jump or walk over height blocks while ignoring more than height blocks It is a really well made script for such procedural terrains because making a dynamic navmesh is a huge pain in the a It would be great to post some TODOs here I would love to help with this project and that would make it way easier Thanks Great library Ive adapted it to a d project with movement along the x and z axes and its working beautifullybut theres a major oversight when it comes to rigidbodies that have been destroyed after being added to the NearSensors hashset I tried implementing a solution within the NearSensor script to first check if the rigidbody exists and is enabled before adding to the hashsetbut that didnt address the case in which rigidbodies are destroyed after being added such as when an enemy is killed Cohesion Separation VelocityMatch and CollisionAvoidance were still trying to access the destroyed rigidbody throwing null exceptions every frame I would suggest in NearSensordependent scripts at the beginning of the foreach loop iterating over members of the rigidbody hashset to make it first check if the rigidbody at this index is null before accessing it When I added this check there were no more errors PS Id be happy to submit a pull request if youd like to see the various tweaks I made to add this library to my project When or more flocking units come together it starts rapidly printing out this error message in the console D Hey Anton Id really love to use your library in a Space game Im currently developing I therefor need to control spaceships in D space How is your progress on D steering Can I use the dev branch of this library already Or could you give me a quick advice on whats missing then Ill implement myself Kindest regards Chris MissingComponentException There is no Rigidbody attached to the ScreenBoundary game object but a script is trying to access it You probably need to add a Rigidbody to the game object ScreenBoundary Or your script needs to check if the component is attached before using it UnityEngineRigidbodygetposition at CbuildslaveunitybuildartifactsgeneratedcommonmodulesPhysicsDynamicsBindingsgencs CohesiongetSteering ICollection targets at AssetsunitymovementaiScriptsMovementCohesioncs FlockingUnitUpdate at AssetsunitymovementaiScriptsFlockingUnitcs No such issue exists for other Example scenes I am using unity
