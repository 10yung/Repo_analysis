The option has some historical background for example it could break ncurses applications like alsamixer however the default to true seems strange nowadays because it makes impossible to draw bold text in a normal color Some other terminals eg vte kitty also started default to false here Were not removing the option but just flipping a bit and knowing that users tend to copy paste our config in a past will likely continue to have it defaulted to true in their configuration files The only problem is the users who dont have this option in a config file now or new users however the change in color is noticeable and it also stated very clear in our configuration file so it shouldnt be a problem to flip things back Implements I think keeping this around isnt a good idea so lets just push it If you double click on an opening bracket hello itll select till the closing bracket however the opposite isnt true TODO Bracket selection across lines Fixes Hello Im experiencing poor initialization performance of alacritty on AMD Linux laptop Im using a ThinkPad X with Ryzen Pro U w Vega Integrated Graphics The distribution Im running is Archlinux with the latest kernel arch Im using AMDGPU driver and i wm on Xorg My alacritty configuration file contains just basic font and color scheme settings The current problem is that alacritty has a significant boot up time around ms for alacritty e false on my UHD monitor Meanwhile when I switch from a workspace to another one which contains a window of alacritty instance I can feel a significant latency say around ms On other applications or terminal emulators eg Kitty which is also GPUaccelerated I did not notice a latency either A simple annotation for the profiling results using valgrind toolcallgrind alacritty e false gives a output I

using WSL with Alacritty to system clipboard On linux I use y buffer to do this How can I do same on WSL System OS macOS Alacritty Version Alfred Version Alacritty config alacrittyyml Logs Alacritty log Alacritty log Theres a mac program called Alfred that has a feature for auto expanding text snippets that has worked in all previous alacritty versions Ive used but now breaks in I have a number of snippets setup in the logs Im using the snippet cl to expand to consolelog In cl expands to consolelog In cl expands to v Alfred is closed source so I dont know exactly what it is doing but when it auto expands I believe its Copying the snippet to the clipboard Sending a series of simulated key presses to do a CMDv paste Repositioning the cursor via simulated key presses Clearing the clipboardrestoring what was previously there So it looks like it is trying to send the CMDv key event but on something is happening and it only registers the v and leaves that in the output I dont know if this is an alacritty or Alfred issue but auto expansion works in Terminalapp and iTerm on macOS After building from source starting from this commit c ec Alacritty crashes on start using older
