if desired Security updates receive only security updates if desired details Current Linux implementation is probing multiple files in order to fetch one specific value for example in order to get the design voltage parameter four files will be opened consequently voltagemaxdesign voltagemindesign voltagepresent and the voltagenow Even while all files are located at the sysfs filesystem and read operations from it are very quick for a worse case scenario there will be three unnecessary open syscalls assuming the Managerrefresh method calls as battop does Battery instance should remember which file was opened successfully during the previous information update and should open it directly on a next refresh call Yet it is important to remember that some Linux drivers can remove or add these files on a fly so in case of failure consequent probing should be started again In a result it should reduce syscalls amount vastly This battop issue had introduced the case when the Battery struct instance can represent the missing device While it is possible now to handle that case see this kind of error seems to be a recoverable type of error for library users mostly to the battop at the moment because it can be handled for example by removing the device from the batteries list batteryError can be reworked as an enum with the recoverable and nonrecoverable members smth like this rust enum Error Battery device is missing now GoneioError Some error happened during the information fetch OtherioError As someone whose computer is connected via USB to an external power supply I would love to be able to monitor its status from within battop However it doesnt appear in the sysfs and as such is invisible to this library Being able to support more types of batteries and power supplies should be a worthy goal for this type of library but I dont know how much effort it would take to implement This is a tracking issue for Solaris support This is a tracking issue for NetBSD support This is a tracking issue for OpenBSD support batteryffi crate is using cratetypecdylib for builds which is incompatible with musl targets
