No changes to my code or system but as of last week funddataNVDA quarterly Returns Downloading No Data Found for NVDA NULL Any idea on what is happening Objetive I hope to help I hope to help people look at this repository in a better and well documented way When prices are downloaded they are indexed by Date In btmerge conversion is done to POSIXct with the local timezone Downloaded data converted to POSIXct with no TZ conversion has a time of midnight GMT For any timezone earlier than that the conversion results in each date being moved back one day In my case I am in the AmericaChicago TZ which is UTC hours The class statement at the bottom of btmerge converted to Ive used this code for years but only noticed the problem this weekend when it appeared that I had a market price for Sunday I realize this is an old problem with date conversions in R Just curious if it was intentional to leave it unaddressed or if the idea was to always run with the sysenvTZ set to GMT My original fix was to do the latter but I thought I saw that it screwed up my results havent gone back to verify that My next fix was to add hours to Uniquedates prior to the class statement not pretty I know but effective for now Thanks This link is referred in the plottabler file and it is broken I am having issues I cannot seem to find the solution to in regards to the DCF analysis here I am running the DCF analysis for a number of firms and for many the code works as expected The problem is that when I run the analysis for some firms I have gaps in the DCF data For example when I run the following code for ticker LOW I do not get any gaps Load Systematic Investor Toolbox SIT con gzconurl rb sourcecon closecon Load historical fundamental and pricing data loadpackagesquantmod

ResourceslibrarySIT Warning in installpackages installation of package sit had nonzero exit status Hello SIT I know this dates back several years but I would have a question on the FTCA algorithm implementation Compared to the pseudocode of Mr Varadi I can read that if the correlation between HC and LC threshold while Mr Varadi pseudocode is Add to Cluster all other assets that have yet been assigned to a Cluster and have an Average Correlation to HC and LC Threshold the FTCA code implemented here seems to assign all remaining assets to the HCLC cluster Would you remember why is that Cheers Roman Hi I try to get prices from the combined tickers like the following However I could not load dataproxyrawRdata and find the code in this area How can I solve this problem Thank you in
