One common pattern seen in both iOS and Android is Shared Element Transitions Meaning that you can have an element transform from one state or place into another A good example of this is when you open an app in iOS where you see the app icon transform into the app That particular example is already possible with framer motion but what is not possible is having that element change its position in your app hierarchy A good example is the video in the Android example I linked to above Theres a reactmorph that does a similar thing I think this feature would make for a great addition to framermotion In terms of API Im not familiar enough with hooks still to give a good example on that front but I could certainly see it working pretty well with the already existing exit prop and some kind of additional ID on the motion element that would detect when a motion element with the same ID has moved to another place in the app and transition the changes between those states Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe When using regular target objects or variants with the animate attribute and setting initialfalse it is easy to set initial style However when using Animation Controls there doesnt seem to be a way to set initial state Describe the solution youd like The ability to set an initial target object or variant using Animation Controls Describe alternatives youve considered Initial styles can be set with other mechanisms but then they must be overridden properly by the animation variants It would be nice if you could just specify an initial variant FAQs Does Framer Motion support Preact It might work with Preact but we dont explicitly support it so if it does currently work youd be using it at your own risk Im using Framer Motion with Reach Router to do page transitions To do custom handling whenever an element is exiting or entering to prep the element for animation like position absolute I use the callbacks for onAnimationStart and onAnimationComplete However onAnimationStart seem to be triggered by other nonFramer Motion animations as well See CodeSandbox where callback for onAnimationStart is confused by child CSS animation More specifically this is my usecase One of my screens has a fairy long animation that takes over s to finish long after the actual animation done thru this lib and when that CSS only driven animation ends onAnimationComplete seem to be called twice This is the order of calls Page enters and onAnimationStart is called Page is done and onAnimationComplete is called ms has now passed Other child component of Page now has a pure CSS animation that finishes and onAnimationStart is now called twice around s have now passed If I remove that animation everything works like expected and only and happens If I make the animation longer the events still match up like above The documentation makes it clear that these callbacks are only supposed to be called for properties in animate and onAnimationComplete is also named differently but that is not true for onAnimationStart Even so capturing events in the custom component and doing estopPropagation did not help Is there something Im missing here Is this a documentation problem Essentially I need to apply styling to an element while it is animating but not persist beyond that how could I then do that without using these events Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe It would be nice to be able to cancel tap events in onTapStart such that onTap and onTapCancel dont fire See for example Describe the solution youd like eventpreventDefault is called in onTapStart or something is returned from onTapStart that cancels the event Describe alternatives youve considered Managing the state with refs The useTransform bug framermotion A lot of MotionValues is retained generating a memory leak in server side render SSR on request several time a single page this is the test case tsx import useViewportScroll useTransform from framermotion const IndexPage NextPage const scrollYProgress useViewportScroll const heroBackgroundSize useTransformscrollYProgress value auto value return divhellodiv export default IndexPage going deep in this problem I found that if you dont use useTransform the problem is gone and then I try to destroy the motion value and that works too if processbrowser heroBackgroundSizedestroy clearly useTransform is not destroying the listeners when the page is destroyed Also I test the same but creating all inside a component consumed by the index page and the problem persist Describe the bug I have a problem with variants effect while using iPhone plus The others device work fine but in iphone plus the effect need to touch again the screen or scroll then the sidebar or nav will show Please help me tks so much IMPORTANT Provide a CodeSandbox reproduction of the bug With this example in iphone its not working with the background Please help me to fix it please Is there a way to chain animations together React Spring has something called useChain and other examples would be GSAPs timeline would be great to know how to start an animation when another has finished without using delays or anything like that Describe the bug Image a hierarchy of two motion components where the parent has both whileHover variant and onHoverStart callback defined If onHoverStart while being called results in the change of its own value due to the containing component being rerendered hover variant will function correctly on the parent but wont be propagated to the child The codesandbox provided below should make this more clear Same behaviour applies to onHoverEnd IMPORTANT Provide a CodeSandbox reproduction of the bug Try replacing onHoverStart and onHoverStop callbacks with their commented out and memoized versions this eliminates the bug Steps to reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Hover over the first line of text Background color becomes gray as defined on the parent text color becomes red as defined on the child Hover over the second line of text Only the background color changes Hover again over the first line of text Once again only the background color changes Move the mouse pointer up and then hover again over the first line Both colors will change Expected behavior Both background and text color change on hover If a user tries to touch scroll on a horizontallydraggable element we currently have to block scrolling due to issues with event handlers It might be possible to control this with the touchaction CSS prop Id like to ask whats the purpose of single number min max of Inertia on drag transition which changes both x and y The current behaviour seems to apply it to both values but Im not sure it should be this way
