The gem doesnt install with Rails Will we be getting support soon Hi Id like to get the humanity score reported by Google In you doc says You need to verify this token with verifyrecaptcha in your controller in order to get the score but I cant get the score only a boolean Is there any way to get the actual number There is another gem newgooglerecaptcha that can report the score to the controller Regards and thanks in advance we use this gem in scenarios One of them does not use turbolinks and it works flawless The other pages have turbolinks enabled With recaptcha v and fallback v we experienced different errors The first one that came up was grecaptcha not defined as library loading seems to not be in sync when using turbolinks There were some solutions for older rails versions but using nothing has worked to fix the error We therefore removed the immediate execution of executeRecaptchaForRequest and instead passed this as a callback into the apijs url in order to have it executed when the library has been loaded This fixed the error but then the definition of the async method led to a syntax error unexpected token function Since we already used a patch we also deleted this definition since we dont use it right now This worked for us but is not really the good way and can crash when recaptcha gets updated Are there any solution I missed working with rails ajax true didnt work for us I saw implementation of recaptchaerror which is called in verifyrecaptcha when error occur In my case the request is kind of XHR and respond json and no mode involved How do I get default error messages for errors Just use RecaptchaHelperstoerrormessageverificationfailed is a option but it will be wrong if the error is a timeout Maybe giving a stub of model to verifyrecaptcha and get errors from it is a solution Thanks in advance Im utilizing the reCAPTCHA v API and am seeing the error Cant find variable grecaptcha come through logs on a recurring basis It is recurring with a specific newsletter action because it errors out when attempting to call executeRecaptchaForNewsletter Heres is my implementation if verifyrecaptchaaction newsletter minimumscore SignEmailUpForMailingListJobperformlaterparams email end However the urls where the error is occurring do not even include the recaptchav code as they are all internal urls Im assuming this error is timing related but would appreciate any insight you might have Hi were facing an issue with recaptcha v in Microsoft Internet Explorer default configuration no plugins clean installation with Windows version Recaptcha token is not fetched because of JS errorsdouble rendered ending script tag please see the screenshots attached We use common helper attributes not playing with JS generationcallbacksscripts etc recaptchav action login hl I nlocale sitekey oursitekey In all other browsers Chrome Opera Firefox we dont have any issues at all Unfortunately a lot of our clients still use MSIE and we cannot switch them I didnt find any information that reCaptcha v should not work in MSIE so could it be a gems JS script issue Anyway thanks for the awesome gem Screenshot Screenshot Screenshot I am running the Recaptcha with the v and the verifyrecaptcha is returning false even when the response is a success sh T DEBUG httplog Response success true challengets T Z hostname localhost score The response makes sense according to the API documentation But inside the verifyrecaptcha it runs the self verifyviaapicall that tries to verify if the action is valid but the response of the siteverify request does not include the action on the response body ruby verifyrecaptchaaction userregistrationform minimumscore false It seems that when using invisiblerecaptchatags the native HTML input attribute required is bypassed For a loginsignup form it would be great to be able to first validate that the fields are not empty on the client side using required true before challenging with recaptcha Am I missing a helper parameter Using the W C validator I am getting errors from the Recaptcha tags that are created in the final HTML Validator can be found here My htmlerb simply contains recaptchatags The error I am getting is The scrolling attribute on the iframe element is obsolete Use CSS instead How can the Recaptcha rubygem be updated to remove the scrollingno attribute in the tag Hi The datadisablewith attribute doesnt work with the invisiblerecaptchatags My code invisiblerecaptchatags text Sign up class btn btnprimary datadisablewith Please wait I also tried invisiblerecaptchatags ui input value Sign up class btn btnprimary datadisablewith Please wait HTML generated with ui input input typesubmit datasitekeyblablabla datacallbackinvisibleRecaptchaSubmit classgrecaptcha btn btnprimary valueSign up datadisablewithPlease wait EDIT Its weird but if I add a buttontag like this buttontag hello class btn btnprimary data disablewith world When I click on this button the datadisablewith of the invisiblerecaptchatags works Maybe the problem is in the invisibleRecaptchaSubmitfunction in clienthelperrb var eles documentgetElementsByClassNamegrecaptcha if eleslength var form closestFormeles if form formsubmit I think the Js is stoped after the submit so the jQuery function for datadisablewith is not executed Im not good with JS so Im not sure if its right and how I could fix that
