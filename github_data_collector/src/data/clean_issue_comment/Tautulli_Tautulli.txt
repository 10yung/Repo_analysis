Want to use summary params for notification agent Get telergam limitation symbols for caption message because summary is oversize Create short summary block This method cut text and can cut word for N symbols Maybe there are another method of deal with it but Im not high skill with python Problem surfaced on Fedora where the default usrbinpython link to point to the Python interpreter This fix that by evaluating the version using python itself Supersedes and blows the dust off Implemented suggestion of MrTimscampi to use the Python shebang This addresses this issue Which then will allow to upgrade the codebase to python Help is appreciated to move everything activityhandlerpy TimelineHandlerobject processself This function interrogates the metadata of the library item before scheduling a callback to notify with the scheduler used to implement the delay set in the Notification Delay configuration parameter However in some circumstances the metadata is not fully populated before the process interrogates it This results in WARNING Status code and Pmsconnect Unable to parse XML for getmetadatadetails errors in the Tautulli log and the library items are never processed by Tautulli DEBUG Thread Tautulli TimelineHandler Library item added to recently added queue WARNING Thread Failed to access uri endpoint librarymetadata Status code WARNING Thread Tautulli Pmsconnect Unable to parse XML for getmetadatadetails NoneType object has no attribute getElementsByTagName WARNING Thread Failed to access uri endpoint librarymetadata Status code WARNING Thread Tautulli Pmsconnect Unable to parse XML for getmetadatadetails NoneType object has no attribute getElementsByTagName For the Notification Delay to be useful in delaying the metadata interrogation the selfgetmetadata call has to be made when the scheduled callback is executed not before So the majority of the processing currently done in the processself function needs to be moved In my branch Ive moved the code from the TimelineHandler process function to a new function which is called via scheduled callback after the notification delay period Modified Usersgetwatchtimestats and Librariesgetwatchtimestats to take an arbitrary list of timequeries rather than using the hardcoded list Callers of these methods have been updated to use the previously hardcoded list as defaults for backwards compatibility The motivation for this change is to allow custom scripts greater flexibility in querying watch time stats eg querying watch time for the current calendar week month or year This update primarily adds support for multiple Plex Servers As part of this servers are automatically discovered from the plextv account and populated into the database Changes Monitoring New Support for monitoring multiple Plex Servers New Support for monitoring rclone mount Change Changed Get for Plex Updates to minute interval UI New Dashboard Server Status card New Added server name to lists Libraries History User History History New Import for Tautulli databases New Filter by server Graphs New Added server selection New View by media type or server Newsletters New Added Server selection Notifications New Added rclone updown notification Users New Added Guest access levels No Access Guest Can see only their own history on the servers they are friended to This is the same functionality as in previous releases PowerGuest Can see all users history and all library sections but only on the servers they are friended to SuperGuest Can see all users history and all library sections on all servers But no access to settings Admin Full access to all controls The rclone mount monitoring is enabled in SettingsPlex Media Servers then activated on each individual server in the server configuration I also removed the unicode designation on the logger messages in preparation for PY I can put those back if you prefer I apologize for not using small commits First time doing something like this I removed the minwidth property on small screen to remove horizontal scrollbars Takes the name of the show and generates a slug for use in a URL suffix In this way the TV show can be directly linked in the email to the page on web service like Sonarr Replaces which with command v to check for the python executable Came across this since which is not available on a Centos LXC container Even with Python installed running Plexpy resulted in Error Python not found because of the missing which package Command is POSIX compatible more info see I tested my changes on the most popular platforms by adapting my Ansible role It pulled my branch instead of the plexpy master and the tests complete nicely which test that the webinterface is functioning
