 Feature Use logger or other libraries instead of the print function For example Processing will be print out to console no matter what Motivation Having a better user experience when using tqdm to monitor progress Questions Help Hi Im a bit stuck in the architecture used in the example file enzymesdiffpoolpy and have a question about it I hope you can help me In specific Im a bit confused with the forward pass in the GNN class In your implementation you are running GraphSAGEs but instead of returning the last x you return a concatenation of the separate runs of GraphSAGEs to have the final feature representation of those nodes This looks to me as some sort of residual or jumping connections but I am not finding it in the original paper Why did you do this then Sorry if I am misunderstanding something in the original paper or in your implementation PS You probably can also remove the line batchsize numnodes inchannels xsize as this is done in the bn function Once again thank you so much for this amazing tool and your support I have added file panconvpy into nnconv and file panconvtestpy into example Reference Zheng Ma Ming Li Yu Guang Wang PAN Path Integral Based Convolution for Deep Graph Neural Networks ICML Workshop on Learning and Reasoning with GraphStructured Representations Installation A clear and concise description of the installation error If you have installation log file please provide it here as well The torchscatter installation fails and Im not sure why Ive made sure GCCNVCC are accessible Ill post the full log at the bottom EDIT it seems the official pytorch extension example doesnt compile either Not sure what to do about that Environment OS CentOS Linux release Python version Python PyTorch version CUDAcuDNN version CUDA Version GCC version GCC How did you try to install PyTorch Geometric and its extensions pip source pip Any other relevant information Checklist x I followed the installation guide x I cannot find my error message in the FAQ x I set up CUDA correctly and can compile CUDA code via nvcc x I have cloned the repository and tried a manual installation from source x I do have multiple CUDA versions on my machine x I checked if the official extension example runs on my machine The offical extension example runs on my machine Additional context myrdkitenv tgoggl pip install verbose nocachedir torchscatter Created

class When I read the forward function I dont understand using lambdamax of in code as follows def forwardself x edgeindex edgeweightNone batchNone lambdamaxNone lambdamax if lambdamax is None else lambdamax edgeindex norm selfnormedgeindex xsize edgeweight selfnormalization lambdamax dtypexdtype batchbatch As far as I know when calculating lambdamax torchgeometrictransformsLaplacianLambdaMax function is used However in code lambdamax just sets if lambdamax is none Also as far as I know setting lambdamax is Kipfs GCN not ChebConv using Chebyshev polynomial Why should we use lamdamax as Second I am trying to batch training for multiple graphs In the documentation of CheConv I read that lambdamax should be a torchTensor of size numgraphs in a minibatch scenario This means that the list is lambdamax lamdamaxn where n is the number of graphs Is that correct Installation A clear and concise description of the installation error If you have installation log file please provide it

requirespython version Given no hashes to check links for project pip discarding no candidates Feature I think that now with the power and appreciation this repo has gathered it has almost become a onestopshop for GDL Thus I think that a good visualization tool that will blend networkX tools As you already support conversions between the two could be a good and relevant feature As more and more new papers already use torchgeometric as their development framework it will also generate a unified visualization Standart across papers I hope The pipelines such module can offer are simple graph representations node classification visualizations multiple graphs view eg a batch given the graphs classification labels etc If you think relevant Ill be happy to take part in such task Feature Original Paper Original Paper TensorFlow Repo Motivation A very interesting paper proposing an alternative graph generative model to GraphRNN using normalizing flows I think it is beneficial to pytorch geometric as other papers such as have begun to add other flavors of normalizing flows for graph generation Thanks Bug I am using geneipath graph conv model with some different data set I am trying to log the model graph and traintest accuracy But I am getting an error on addgraph function from PyTorch Error is RuntimeError in place ScatterMax not supported in the JIT Screenshot Expected behavior A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen Addgraph should log the training graph at the specified logdir that can be visualised later in tensorboard Environment OS Ubuntu Python version PyTorch version CUDAcuDNN version GCC version Any other relevant information Hi Im trying to reproduce the results of splineNet on the cora dataset As the author of the paper and as this is the official repo of the paper can I please ask if the implementation provided here should get Im running the same script but without these lines datatrainmask torchzerosdatanumnodes dtypetorchbool datatrainmask datanumnodes datavalmask None datatestmask torchzerosdatanumnodes dtypetorchbool datatestmask datanumnodes As Im using the original split values But get on the test set Shouldve I done something else the link seems to follow exactly the implementation mentioned in the paper Thanks
