ubuntu install git and npm clone repo of nodeos inside repo first step bininstalldependencies second step npm install gives error which pasted above Context How has this bug affected you What were you trying to accomplish npm install Your Environment Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in Operating System used ubuntu Platform used linux Node Version used locally v NPM Version used locally NodeOS Version used lastest cloned Special Environment Variables used if you have set variables of your own and they collide with the ones weve set than specify them here Link to your project if its a fork please provide a link how can i make nodeos support arm Its written in Rust It might be the future Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe A clear and concise description of what the problem is Ex Im always frustrated when more documentation and tutorial about how can be used Describe the solution youd like A clear and concise description of what you want to happen video tutorials Describe alternatives youve considered A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered I start with QEMU emulator and I got a multiuser shell Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Right now we cant contribute to the making of this programs and having every program in a different package is useless Describe the solution youd like Have a repository in the NodeOS organizations like binutils with all the programs in the bin packages with a unified package named nodeosbinutils Describe alternatives youve considered Having a repository for every bin package but this would be very tedious Is it possible to create an electron app for NodeOS to act as an application or GUI requirefsreadFileSyncbinnodetoStringutf in the interpreter crashes the entire system Theres a bunch of extremely fast
