Just an idea for now waiting for feedback and maybe even a contributor who wants to do this We might build upon as this project needs a new maintainer anyways Screenshot at When zooming in or easing to certain locations on the map the results are not shown or at the wrong location and you can see the error Geometry exceeds allowed extent reduce your vector tile buffer size on the JS console see and They closed the original issue and limited comments maybe because they think its an issue with the tiles and not Mapbox GL itself Needs further investigation San Francisco typically works pretty well to test this As a developer I want to use the latest stable version of TiDB so that my users get the best performance and there are no security issues Sadly go get u t doesnt do the trick go get upgrading githubcompingcaptidbv incompatible githubcompingcaptidbv incompatible invalid version incompatible suffix not allowed module contains a gomod file so semantic import versioning is required Not sure what the issue is here They have a lot of dependencies and it never was easy to figure out which versions work together although that might have improved recently Once dependencies are upgraded we might have to change some things in our bootstrap code Acceptance Criteria TiDB is upgraded to v x latest stable Everything works like before See panic htmltemplate pattern matches no files Yeah in general this and stuff that access the assets folders have really bad error messages eg I was trying to make the originals folder point to an s bucket that I mounted using fuse but the mount was done in such a way that it prevented nonroot users ie the photoprism user to access the directory In that case photoprism crashes with mkdir fail blabla file exists which should be more like Error accessing the assetsphotosoriginal folder permission denied I am using the latest docker container and tried to import some pictures but I always end up with the same error messages INFO T Z

As shown below in the APIs StartIndex route an option can be passed to skip indexing photos that havent changed and thus reduce indexing time In the CLIs index command there seems to be no such option I am syncing photos from multiple devices to a single directory so Id like to be able to create a cronjob to periodically index photos but currently it takes too many resources to do it hourly If I was able to skip unchanged files it should be feasible Lovely project I currently organized my photo collections with folders like the following year subject jpg example Berlin HolidayIMG JPG It would be nice if I cloud define an regular expression to extract such information like subject from the path and automatically create albums categories or labels with that subjects while indexing the images Maybe someone can point me to right location in the source code to implement that feature Thanks Timo As a user Id like to use PhotoPrism without cloud dependencies such that no private data is leaked Right now PhotoPrism depends on cloud services openstreetmaporg for displaying the map and for reverse geocoding Like that userdata such as photo coordinates and IP addresses is leaked Possible steps to resolve this issue are find out and document which cloud services are used what data is transferred how it is processed and stored on servers x gecoding map tiles x make the use of cloud services configurable provide selfhostable alternatives to the cloud services Apple Live Photos is a sneaky little feature that has gotten under my familys skin and they now do not want to live without it They expect to be able to see Live Photo animations and toggle them in some way Including support for Live Photos would remove a possible friction point in getting Apple customers to embrace photoprism
