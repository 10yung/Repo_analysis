Hey Larbs Love using this script for my machines but being new to linux I tried changing my shell to bash through the proper terminal commant for my user however it seems this breaks larbs shortcuts and such as on a reboot larbs begins to have a gray screen set and many functions and shortcuts stop working When I revert the shell from bash to the original zsh everything comes back again What is the proper procedure for changing the shell to bash in LARBS beside just the usual terminal command Thanks I opened this issue on voidrice due to st crashing But this is really a LARBS issue Without emojione andor symbola there is currently no way to prevent st from crashing and thereby forcing a new LARBS user to find a solution The LARBS system as a whole at least the i version also makes heavy use of emojis So without proper emoji font coverage breakage can be expected LARBS users can try the workaround at the linked issue but this really needs to be fixed in LARBS Newbie question admittedly but in A Friendly Guide to LARBS it says that some of the customization binds for dwm are in reposdwmconfigh but there is no repos folder Was it moved somewhere else Arch user here Certain packages dunst xsetnotifysend were not installed correctly by LARBS As a result X server failed to launch and user could not login properly This is due to unknown trust arch signature see this issue More precisely to resolve the problem I used pacmankey refreshkeys and ran LARBSsh again I was fortunate since I caught that error while installing vim Without it I would not have been able to solve it I strongly suggested LARBS to send a warning while certain packages are not installing correctly It seems that when typing in f I do get the right selection prompt and on typing in a number plus enter there is no error But no browser is opened Hi Luke thank you first for your fantastic work It makes my life with all settings so much easier On my newly installed larbs it seems that the dmenu is not working With Modd ModX and ModShifte the menu closes if I press any key Ive previously installed i without larbs and the dmenu was working Im wondering if it could be due to the fact that I have a Chinese keyboard layout Hi Luke Do you plan on adding BSPWM as an option in LARBS Look forward to trying out the fib tiling of BSPWM Thanks for all your upkeep of this system DWM is consistently seen using of a core on my ThinkPad Edge with an i CPU i have two volume controller on my dwmblokcs picselected I tried a few times to install LARBS first dwm but i for a few times too and everytime I had this error Its not something unfixable but I guess you might want to know it Maybe sth is missing or its just me who missed some crucial part to make your vim config working like a charm from the begining Error detected while processing confignviminitvim line E Unknown function plugbegin line E Not an editor command Plug tpopevimsurround line E Not an editor command Plug scrooloosenerdtree line E Not an editor command Plug junegunngoyovim line E Not an editor command Plug PotatoesMasteri vimsyntax line E Not an editor command Plug jreybertvimagit line E Not an editor command Plug lukesmithxyzvimling line E Not an editor command Plug vimwikivimwiki line E Not an editor command Plug blingvimairline line E Not an editor command Plug tpopevimcommentary line E Not an editor command Plug kovetskiysxhkdvim line E Unknown function plugend Press ENTER or type command to continue Im still kind of a newbie with vim so if you need just tell me what else should I report here Some logs or sth From what I know in scriptnames there should be plugvim listed but it isnt
