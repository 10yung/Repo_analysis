imsomnia and postman I need to save the body after the request what is the correct response I e foo for and bar for HTTPie does this and some me find it very convenient Thank you for this awesome project BTW For my use case I need a viewer header to be encoded from userId that I have in environment variables I can encode manually and add the encoded ID to the environment too but thats doubling up Id really like to generate the encoded variable with a JS or bash script when the request is sent Is that possible I find for some HTTP requests I use I almost always use a unique value for a variable eg logId sessionId etc I usually just change the variable in the file but I think it would be even nicer if I could get prompted in a popupmodaldialog window for any undefined variables they can default to the last used value but the first time it is used it could just be blank and allow me to enter it in Some people may accidentally run a DELETE request in a file which can be detrimental I suggest adding a confirmation popup for at a minimum DELETE requests Probably something that can be turned offon in settings maybe per method type or something that is done via an annotation on the request itself eg http confirmsendTask deletion cannot be undone Are you sure you want to delete this task DELETE taskstaskId HTTP Swagger supports adding examples along with spec We can add support to use swagger file as an input to vscoderestclient This will save developers from maintaining separate files for documenting REST APIs swaggeryaml and restclienthttp Hi Im using vscoderestclient to try some complex api I find this tool easy to use while allowing to connect multiple calls As a few other people out there I would like to use it for api validation executing complex api orchestrations and batch running for CI There are some of the Issues asking for features related to this PR Send all requests in a file Automatic runs How to write tests on top of the requests Feature Request Support Response Scripting Execute the same request N time could you please add some beforeafter script Run all requests one after another does not work With this pull request Im trying to remove dependency from Visual Studio Code internals from the modules that can be reused to create a command line tool Before explaining the changes bear in mind that this is the first time I write code in Typescript so forgive me if I did some silly mistakes To remove vscode dependencies I have mainly used three strategies for classes with few dependencies I have splitted in two classes a base class without the features depending on vscode and a derived class adding those features for example RestClientSettings was divided in the base RestClientSettings keeeping the name to minimise renaming changes and RestClientSettingsVS A very important class modified this way is RequestController almost all the code went to RestClient class and this class have only the Selection and Range handling To aid this separation also for Selector class some code went to SelectorVS the class TextDocument was used in some places to isolate the dependency a new interface named DocumentWrapper yes I know not a great name was created and implemented in DocumentWrapperVS using TextDocument To create the right instance of a class some factory was needed To avoid changing too much I took advantage of RestClientSettings class already widely used On this class I have put some methods to hide dependencies on window and some helpers to get information from current document I couldnt find a way to remove vscode dependencies from SystemVariableProvider so by default the code uses a DummyVariableProvider and the real class is set at startup Also the EventEmitter class used in somewhere was a bit of problem I dont think we need those events on a command line interface but not being able to remove the dependency Ive implemented an interface to hide the dependency To check that all this work enables us to create a command line program I created a barebone program See restclientcli Ok let me know what you think about all this Thanks Dino VSCode Version OS Version Windows REST Client
