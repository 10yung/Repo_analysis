 Try to solve the NPE in onCreateView method of Fragments Ive viewpager with fragments one of the fragment has recyclerView private val recyclerView RecyclerView by bindViewRidlist It works find once it first appears but one I move to other fragment and return to the fragment that has list the list does not appear and I get recyclerview No adapter attached skipping layout I switch to regular viewfindViewById the issue has been resolve it looks bindView does not bind to fragments view or something Point Kotterknife behaves in a way that if DialogFragmentgetDialog null it will use getDialogfindViewById or if a getDialog null it will attempt getViewfindViewById The FragmentManager calls getLayoutInflater before onCreateView and in a DialogFragment onCreateDialog is called as part of getLayoutInflater therefore there is no point at which a View will exist when a Dialog doesnt So I recommend perhaps removing the fallback as to not confuse developers looking at the source Point The view created in onCreateView is not set to the dialog until onActivityCreated Therefore if a behaviour of initialising the view state in onViewCreated is taken then a crash is guaranteed There doesnt seem to be a great way of knowing if DialogsetContentView or FragmentonActivityCreated was called so perhaps this detail should be added to documentation Ill make a PR later but wanted to see if this was agreeable or Im misunderstanding why I was running into issues Hi Jake Yesterday you updated kotterknife For some reason we got Unresolved reference bindView We tried exclude groups for kotlin and support libswe still using but problem was still persisted Maybe binary compatibility or what Can you please try avoid of using snapshot without stable build from comjakewhartonkotterknife SNAPSHOT to something like comjakewhartonkotterknife etc We did alternative solution for now Uploaded to artifactory old library with different group name to work with ours builds Thanks Hi I added sonatype dependency like this repositories maven url and compile comjakewhartonkotterknife SNAPSHOT to the app gradle But I still got Error Failed to resolve comjakewhartonkotterknife SNAPSHOT Can someone help me with it in an app Im slowly moving over to kotlin in Buildgradle I add in kapt comjakewhartonbutterknifecompiler compile comjakewhartonbutterknife compile comjakewhartonkotterknife SNAPSHOT When I Build it fails with ErrorError converting bytecode to dex Cause comandroiddexDexException Multiple dex files define

everything is OK Added an interface KotterKnife Added binding extension functions for this interface Any custom class that wants to use KotterKnife just has to implement the KotterKnife interface This avoids polluting extension functions on Any This solves It would be nice to be able to do something like this kotlin class Sample KotterKnifeTarget override val rootView something val textView bindViewTextViewRidfoo finds the view from rootView The view binding extension methods would be on KotterKnifeTarget This way we could use KotterKnife with Renderers or anywhere else
