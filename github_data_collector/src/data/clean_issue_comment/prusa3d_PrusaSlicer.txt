 Version Alpha Windows Ender Behavior Estimated time to Pause Print is not displayed calculated When color change is made and the file is sliced the time to each color change is listed It would be nice if this happened with Pause Print as well No estimated time to Pause Print Is this a new feature requestYes Version alpha Operating system type version macOS Catalina D printer brand version firmware version if known Prusa MK s latest version of firmware Behavior After slicing a model when trying to add a pause at a certain layer using rightclick in the layer view causes the layer view to scroll Attached screen recording upon rightclicking Screen Recording at PMzip Project File MF where problem occurs This happens with any project v alpha win Heres some torture test for path planner It is improved in but opt seems not working well There are crossing paths that can be optimized Every hexagon should have wipe but according to retractions and paths there are missing wipes hivezip hive mfzip hive mfzip hive hive v alpha win Deretraction or unretraction dere unre v alpha win Fan is not used and this is shown as a preview of fan speed on model In such case the lowest color dark blue is most appropriate no fan speed Option Dont support bridge not work for and above versions Version PrusaSlicer linux AppImage Operating system type version Xubuntu LTS D printer brand version firmware version if known i MK S MMU S not used to produce the problem so firmware version is not very relevant Behavior Importing the stl or mf occurrs without problem Slicing fails with an PrusaSlicer error see image and the slice rendering is corrupted in an interesting way Alas notprintable curvedHolderSliceError The same curvedHolderstl files was sliced and printed succesfully a year ago with Slic r then current version Now the old stl as well as a new one generated with OpenSCAD and the equivalent mf give the same result in PrusaSlicer To me it looks like a regression Restarting PrusaSlicer didnt help Is this a new feature request No Project File MF where problem occurs curvedHolder zip If all went well there is a PNG screenshot attached as well as a ZIP with a SCAD and MF file Version win Operating system type version Windows Behavior Create an empty file called dummy mf Launch PrusaSlicer File Import Import STL select dummy mf Open An error message appears Loading of a model file failed OK Try to delete dummy mf Windows refuses claiming that the file is open in PrusaSlicer With an amf file instead of a mf file the file can be deleted as expected Version Operating system type version All OS D printer brand version firmware version if known MK S FW v with MMU S FW v Behavior Add the possibility to paint models directly in PrusaSlicer the way Mosaic Canvas does I really want to use PrusaSlicer for creating multicolor models rather than rely on Meshmixer Right now I need to use an alternative slicer Version alpha Operating system type version OpenSuSE D printer brand version firmware version if known Mk SMMU S Is this a new feature request Yes Feature desired Please expose more variables in the custom toolchange gcode area This will allow for easier integration of custom toolchange scripts that still respect filament settings I realize that not everything can be exposed but Im looking for a few specific ones that cannot be parsed out of the gcode settings section or easily calculated Specifically toolchange number not available at all if no wipe tower Very handy for referencecommentgcode Wipe volume that must be purged for this toolchange while accounting for wipe space in objects and infill These would probably be tricky but nice to have if possible Ramming sequence for current filament cooling move sequence for current filament previous and next filament properties Much appreciated
