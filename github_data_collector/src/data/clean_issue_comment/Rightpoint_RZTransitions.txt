please Found a problem when using custom transitions with navigation controller solved by following steps here Hi First great work with this library Im using it in a Swift project but Im having problems with the layout of the destination view controller that is not respected Ive added this line in my AppDelegate RZTransitionsManagershareddefaultPushPopAnimationController RZZoomPushAnimationController And this in my ToViewController selfnavigationControllerdelegate RZTransitionsManagershared The transition is working very good but in my DestinationViewController the layout isnt respected because some labels are put behind the navigation bar which has the translucent property set to false How can I solve this On application launch I set the default animation controllers for RZTransitionsManager let manager RZTransitionsManagershared managerdefaultPresentDismissAnimationController RZZoomPushAnimationController managerdefaultPushPopAnimationController RZZoomPushAnimationController Custom transition is working well when I push or pop the view controller inside of navigation stack But transition is not interactive Pan gesture from screen edge closes view controller immediately and it s not possible to stop the transition The question is should I implement RZTransitionInteractionController inside each view controller to make transition interactive Or maybe there s an easier way If presentingViewController is kind of class UITabBarController RZTransitions will ignore setting transtions Hi If you will do left or right swapping fast then it transition does not happens smoothly Fixes for Added toViewControllerviewframe transitionContext finalFrameForViewControllertoViewController to the end of the voidanimateTransitionidUIViewControllerContextTransitioningtransitionContext methods in each of the transitions as per this SO Updated the project settings in the Demo to build with multiple orientations as well as iPad enabled for testing I have created a project that demonstrates the issue When using RZTransitions if the orientation is changed in a presented view controller when the view controller is presented with an RZTransition the parent view controller is not resized appropriately When the same view controller is presented without RZTransitions the orientation is preserved Thanks The header doc for RZTransitionsManager setInteractionController fromViewControllertoViewControllerforAction claims itll return a unique key to reference the pairing but due to a shadowed variable bug it always returns nil the way its currently written there is no unique key to return It adds as many objects to the map as there are bits set in the action
