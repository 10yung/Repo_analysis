hey thanks for you guys donationIts great As raspberry pi B is already been come out So I wonder if there is something for B Thanks very muchBTW I use the ubuntu server OS pip install tensorflow It runs through the entire process and goes right up to almost and then crashes with multiple red lines and the last line says Memory Error tried different versions reimaged SD card and same error message Raspberry PI WH GB SD CardPython Please provide the following information about your Raspberry Pi setup Raspberry Pi model WH Operating System used Linux Version of Python used SD card memory

System used Raspberian Version of Python used SD card memory size Size of USBother device used as swap if building from source TensorFlow git commit hash if building from source Relevant Console OutputLogs Describe the Issue when running the configure line it say that is required a newer version on bazel for tensorflow so I upgrade the bazel to the latest version and when running compilesh it has a lot of errors was wondering if this errors are from trying to run the same commands again so do i need to delete everything i have done or at least the bazel files on the tf folder or use a different bazel version if so which version is the most recommended it says it needs to be or higher thank you Steps to Reproduce HardwareSoftware Info Please provide the following information about your Raspberry Pi setup Raspberry Pi model model B Operating System used latest raspbian stretch Version of Python used SD card memory size gb Size of USBother device used as swap if building from source gb TensorFlow git commit hash if building from source Relevant Console OutputLogs Describe the Issue I have installed tensorflow on a Raspberry PI using your instructions and it worked correctly After installing a number of libraries that I needed for loading a Keras model trained on my PC numpy scipy etc I have observed the following error while importing tensorflow Runtime Error module compiled against API version xc but this version of numpy is xa Segmentation fault I have updated all the necessary libraries and importing any of them doesnt result in an error in a Python script Also the error is not keras related because the statement import tensorflow raises an error no matter what follows after it Should I uninstall tensorflow and start all over again Steps to

you However r does not have some of the useful functions and feature needed for d convolutional networks eg Conv DTranspose Has there been any attempts to build r for raspberry pi I have tried a bunch of stuff but not been successful For example latest bazel with tensorflow master no dice when i run grep Rl lib xargs sed i slib libg it returns sed no input files raspbian stretch Raspberry Pi model raspberry pi b Operating System used raspbian stretch Version of Python used SD card memory size Gb Size of USBother device used as swap if building from source Gb if i skip the step and directly run configure it says You have bazel nongit installed Please upgrade your bazel installation to version or higher to build TensorFlow Configuration finished
