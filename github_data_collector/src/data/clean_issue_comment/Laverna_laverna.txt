Dear fellow Users Dear fellow Watchers Dear fellow Contributors Dear World Im sorry for being so rude and cold with my comments in the last months when you were looking for help I try my best to keep everyone informed but I cant continue if we get new issues every x days Therefore this message is a hope that everyone will really read something before submitting a new issuePR or commenting on an existing one Dont know what Im talking about Continue In August daed and I contacted the developer and creator of Laverna wwebfor in the hope to get his point of view about the future and state of this project What we got as a response is a clear point of view about the future and state of Laverna Here is an extract of the response we got Actually I dont use Laverna anymore and if you check my little contribution to it youd understand Im not useful at all in this project Actually I do think the FOSS community should center its power on others transversal and complete projects like Nextcloud for instance instead of projects which dont solve any issue related to synchronization multidevices and local storage Real problems for stcentury users which we have to convince to join us This is my opinion but Laverna is not one of them and doesnt replace in any ways mainstream privacyreluctant services Nevertheless I wish you will figure out a way to participate in what you want to and hope for On my way Im out of this one Therefore please consider this project as unmaintained deprecated or similar wordsstates I invite you to migrate use or contribute to the Encryptic project which is the fork of this project Please find here daeds The maintainer of the Encryptic project statement after our communication with wwebfor So wwebfor got back to me Hes done with the project He acknowledged that Laverna doesnt solve issues with synchronization and multiple devices He suggested that effort would be better spent focusing on other projects that do already He also didnt give me access to the repo so I cant do anything directly with it I think his concerns are valid but I like Laverna and I think its worth trying to make something out of Im going to continue with my plan to fork it and develop it independent of the Laverna organization Ive spent the last few weeks trying to familiarize myself with the dev branch and working on minor bugs where I can Its honestly not in very good shape right now It looks like the project was in the middle of transitioning into more of a clientserver model with the addition of the signal server and MongoDB Thats not a bad model necessarily for hosting but it becomes burdensome for standalone endusers who are syncing through dropbox or not at all The signal server appears to have been put together with a multiuser environment in mind and there is the start of some useful features like sharing between users but that is incomplete and I believe actually currently inhibits synchronizing across multiple devices In spite of the above https is not enabled by default The electronbased desktop app version doesnt work gulp is pretty broken in node due to ancient dependencies Supposedly this is getting fixed someday though the current plan appears to be to force a newer version of the natives package which is unsupported I couldnt find an ETA Id like to talk more about these problems and get recommendationshelp on fixing them Im going to replicate this issue on my fork at daed I strongly encourage anyone who feels a vested interest in the project to come discuss and I would like to warn anyone else that this project as it exists at the Laverna organization probably will not be updated any further I wish you all the best cc daed Makss Hello I lost my Hard drive Data which means my configuration of Browser I was in Sync with my
