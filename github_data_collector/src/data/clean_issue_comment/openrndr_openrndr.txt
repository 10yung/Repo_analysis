The big questions would be on how to use them Perhaps through shadeStyles For some video files the audio plays with an audible stutterjitter I suspect this is caused by sound frames that are smaller than what OpenAL can conveniently chain Based on GCN Execution Patterns in Full Screen Passes and Cat like coding edwinRNDR Im unsure if GPUs nowadays perform optimizations for this special case and if so whether there is a need to provide this option to the Filter Describe the bug The batch mode methods like drawercircles and drawerrectangles lock in on the style that was set before the method call The individual classes should have a way to set them before rendering To Reproduce drawercircles until map drawerfill ColorRgbaRandomnextDouble RandomnextDouble RandomnextDouble CircleRandomnextDoublewidth RandomnextDoubleheight Expected behavior All circles should have a random colour Context macOS OpenRNDR Hello Im interested in improving OpenRNDRs SVG support with a personal endgoal being to be able to render SVGs exported from OpenStreetMap layers As far as I can see the current SVGLoader class supports only the tiny base profile and so far not fully How can I best help in increasing SVG support in line with any current goals or work on this Failing any specific requirements Id like start improving just tiny profile support Thanks HSLuv is a humanfriendly alternative to HSL HSLuv extends CIELUV with a new saturation component that allows you to span all the available chroma as a neat percentage From Slack about HSLuv vs ColorLUVa ColorLUVa is CIELuv HSLuv seems to be based on the cylindrical transformation of Luv LCHuv From a quick glance it is tries to rectify the LCHuv color space HSLuv Java implementation
