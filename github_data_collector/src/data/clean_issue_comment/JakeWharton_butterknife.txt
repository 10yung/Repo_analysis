 Hello JakeWharton I have been paying attention to you since years witnessing your growth and achievements Im proud of you Ive been doing Andro for more than three years now With the increase of my work and age Im a little confused Please give me some valuable opinions on the planning of future program career and future technology stack Thank you After succesfully migrating to Androidx i added below things in my buildgradle file implementation comjakewhartonbutterknife annotationProcessor comjakewhartonbutterknifecompiler but when i run the App this error coming Note BindView field with unresolved type Toolbar must elsewhere be generated as a View or interface Please help Im using comjakewhartonbutterknifegradleplugin rc in two projectBoth project use support anotation no androidxanotation But one project generated R file is right but another R is base on androidxanotation which actually cant find in my decency How could this happen I have an issue where I am using Butterknife in a library The issue is not with using in a library but rather within the Android test classes that are using Butterknife In the library everything works fine but in my testActivities the R java is not generating the constants needed to recognize for binding Package name comtestlibssoandroidTest buildgradle file apply plugin comandroidlibrary apply plugin kotlinandroid apply plugin

Ridtestlogin to be constant which I could do by declaring BindViewR idtestlogin except the constant variable is not generated in R java When I migrate the butterknife calls to R the variable becomes red and is not recognised When I search within the R java I will not find that variable at all mainly because it has not been generated So How do I get butterknife to recognize R in a library test class I have an old project that needs an upgrade recently I upgraded AndroidX first then butterknife from to and I also installed documentation using bindview r idxx However I found that the XXXActivityViewBinding was not generated correctly after building the project I checked all the configuration items and they all seemed to be correct So I try to create a new demo to verify whether it is a configuration problem After the demo verification the Project is normal Then I try ReBuild Project and Invalidate CachesRestart several timesHowever the ViewBinding file has not been generated which causes my project cannot run normally as long as it runs it will be a mistake because the views are all NULL Finally I tried to manually clean the cache of Android Studio and the cache of Gradle but this problem still cannot be solved I hope someone can help me thank you this is demo build project image this is my project build project image This is my configuration dependency Task

can use in Android X I am very happy to be involved in this project If there is a need to change I am willing to do my utmost I solved this problem Missing resource ID for OnClick annotation these days Next I will analyze the reasons and solutionsPlease take a look thanks Reason When using kotlin for the same resource if you do not use other annotations eg Bindview before the event annotation eg Onclick after generating viewbindingjava the UtilsfindRequiredView uses a raw integer not R reference When the merged resource is packaged the static value of the R file has changed So it leads Missing resource ID Analysis The annotation processing of kotlin generates a stub java file and processes the annotation according to the java fileBut at this time Java file already using raw integer My solution is to solve in the process method if it is the first time use a raw integer go through the Rjava find the corresponding static value in Rjava and use R reference replace it If the second time is a raw integer it will not be processed because the same resource will use the same IdbutterknifecompilerIdjava thanks
