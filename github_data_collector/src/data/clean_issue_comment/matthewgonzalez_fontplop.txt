When you start the installer you will find there is a bit of blurry and overlapping text as shown in the following screenshot img width altscreen shot at pm src When converting from TTF app doesnt build OTF file yet it links to it in CSS while not linking to TTF Hey thanks for this nice app Its very useful Would it be possible to make an option to generate a single css file instead of one for each font as fontprep used to do This would be amazing Thanks Can you build same application for windows Awesome tool Though I would like to do the conversion the other way around From WOFF or WOFF to TTF Thanks for this tool it works very nice and fast I do have a small feature request though FontPrep had the ability to subset the selected fonts to only convert a certain character range The advantage of this that the converted webfonts would be of a significantly smaller file size as unneeded charactersranges can be left out I cant find this option in FontPlop but I would be very interested in this feature and most certainly a lot of other people as well Can this be added to FontPlop
