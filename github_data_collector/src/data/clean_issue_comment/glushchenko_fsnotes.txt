 NOTE ignoring this template will lead to your issue being dealt with more slowly Describe your feature request We have a Todo section in the upper left of the app that can display all the notes with todo toggled However it doesnt ignore those notes with all the toggled todo checked I could have notes with toggled todo all checked still displayed in the Todo section Showing only the unchecked tasks in the Todo section should make it more useful Additional context This is a behavior found in both MacOS and iOS versions of Fsnotes MacOS fsnotes iOS fsnotes build NOTE ignoring this template will lead to your issue being dealt with more slowly Describe your feature request Fsnotes in iOS allows me to change the editor font family However I dont able to find the option to change font size Currently there is no section jumping through a table of content and I would like to change the font to be smaller to help navigating a longer note Font sizing is discussed in and I suppose this setting should have already added I wonder am I missing something Additional context iOS fsnotes build If I understand current FSNotes behaviour correctly if the user wants a new note to be sorted immediately they have to click the relevant sort by submenu item They then have to click it again to have the notes list sorted in the previously selected order ie ascending or descending Would it be possible for FSNotes to autosort notes on a timed basis set in preferences in other words the app would autosort the note list after x number of seconds Another half solution would be to have a menu item to force the sorting the notes list so the user doesn t have to go to the menu twice to sort NOTE ignoring this template will lead to your issue being dealt with more slowly Describe your feature

feature request Currently when turning on the automatic backup the backup is performed once a day at HOURMINUTES even though the text implies a different behavior I think it would be useful if instead of giving a time on a day a frequency could be provided as well something like backup all notes every full hour Describe the bug Hi there I ve just started using the iOS app it s looking good so far The only issue I ve found is that the first character of a new bulleted line doesn t start with a capitalised letter This is a small thing but I use bulleted outlines heavily so it would make a big difference for me Thanks for considering this and thank you for all of your work on the app To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Type followed by some content this sets up a bulleted line Type enter this will create a new bulleted line Type a Expected behavior The first character typed should be capitalised ie A Actual behavior The first character typed is not capitalised ie a Workaround NA
