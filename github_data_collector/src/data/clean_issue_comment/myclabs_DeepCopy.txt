Reproduce with php phpcsfixer rulesnativefunctioninvocation fix allowriskyyes phpcsfixer from Details We have a situation where we have objects that are somehow linked to other structures an object references a file on disk in our case When the deep copy of a data tree is performed the objects are cloned inside but we also need a hand on the old and new objects together to be able to copy the associated structure at the same time cp files on disk here I dont see a way to do that currently we thought about the type filtertype replace but we dont want to manually clone the object as would be with this filter we are perfectly good with the normal cloning we just need to know when one was cloned to perform the additional operations we need What would be the best way to do it Events Callbacks Type filters that can be chained This is not so much of a big change but it ensures there is only one point of injection which is preferable IMO That said the value is debatable and there is also the question of it is worth to backport those changes to x with deprecation messages Closes cc Slamdunk Add a mode where dynamic properties can be skipped I expect this could significantly improve performances and be good enough for some users Im not really sure whats the interest of having an addFilter and co when everything could be added in the constructor Last time I looked I couldnt find any way to really squeeze much more perf This is mainly due to the fact that DeepCopy deep copy an object As such you cannot assume the properties of that object as values can be dynamically added The result is DeepCopy must rely on a brand new instance of ReflectionObject each time even if you get two objects of the same class A way to change that would maybe to add a mode to clone class instances instead ie to rely on ReflectionClass and cache it somehow But to be honest this is just an idea like that Im actually not sure if its really worth it maybe it would be better to start by having a benchmark and see if the perf gain is worth it
