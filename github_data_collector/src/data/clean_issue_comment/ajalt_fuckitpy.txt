First of all thank you for this great code it is very useful I wanted to point out a small bug however Heres a MWE python import fuckit fuckit def tmp print print print print printa print tmp The expected behavior is that the last should have been printed Everyone knows that a promise to fuckit when the code is done is worth more than fucking it nowsup ida f sup The original JavaScript version does things that way Surely Python should be better than JavaScript so I can write async def stuff await fuckitrealstuff return realstuffdoit And yes I realize thats a future not a promise but fuckithoverboard you know what I mean subsup idf a sup but if you should fall subsup idf a sup An acquaintance of mine says That sentence is exactly why I no longer date fellow programmers but I dont understand what she meanssub
