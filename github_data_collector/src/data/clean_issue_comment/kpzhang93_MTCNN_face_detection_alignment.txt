Hi Has anyone worked on increasing the number of facial landmarks from the current points to points as like in other facial detection algorithms such as Dlib We are trying to use the Face Detection algorithm for us to help in Face Spoof detection for which landmarks doesnt suffice Hi thank you for this work and the source code Regarding the MIT license of this repo if you have used FDDBWIDERFace dataset for training your models which are provided only for the research purposes not commercial usage how can the weights you provide be on the MIT license MIT license allows anyone to use this commercially which is a derivative work of the images which are not allowed to be used commercially Looking forward to your reply Thanks Found lagging if frame size goes beyond KB Face detection accuracy affects if resolution comes down What could be the optimal frame resolution and size for the face detect method Hi there I am not a student right now and do not want to buy a Matlab license Is there a way to use Octave instead Also is there a major difference between the C and Python versions for detecting profileside faces Thanks Nobu When I run demom in MTCNNv there occurs an error Undefined function or variable rectgenpathangle How can I fix it boundboxregression x in generateBoundingBox function of the file generateBoundingBoxm there is boundingbox fixstrideboundingbox scale fixstrideboundingbox cellsize scale score reg Then my question is why plus Thank you in advance It is too slow to do the face detection and alignment when dataset is large if process images one by one So I wander if it is possible to change your script a little bit to make it work when the input is a batch
