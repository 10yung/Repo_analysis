Previous behaviour Anisotropic filtering was continuing to run even with Nearest filtering On opengl it doesnt run on nearest filtering The gui for both renderers also greys out aniso when nearest is selected Anisotropic filtering being able to run on palette texture This caused to break the rendering on palette textures for games that use it PR behavior The PR corrects both of these behaviors Aniso wont run on palette textures as well as nearest filtering Test cases for observing the issues were used Star Ocean Fifa Street Visual issue representation below is when anisotropic filtering runs on palette textures Comparison master Bilinear PS Aniso x gsdx Comparison PR Bilinear PS Aniso x gsdx Localization for Traditional Chinese zhTW WIP Add an option in hw hacks to control the half bottom detection Automatic Force Disabled Force Enabled Automatic automatically determinate if a game needs the half screen fix Force Disabled fully disables the half bottom fix It will help Xenosaga games Force Enabled fully enables the half bottom fix Will help Lord of the Rings Two Towers Superman Shadows of Apokolips Midnight Club Note this will be a temporary solution for release so we can eliminate the possibility of regressions and allow us to fix a few more games as well with the option Related I know that it is possible to change hotkeys in file PCSX keysini but if I remove hotkey it uses default value It is possible to add something like NONE or empty value to disable hotkey I didnt find any messages about this only questions about rebinding Tried on latest git snapshot Recently I was looking to use the Slow motion option in Pcsx and could not remember how to enable it Well with some googling I found the Forum thread about the Shift button options It would be nice to see theses options listed in the program ie a tooltip stating what key or key combo is associated with it Thanks for the Hard Work Sometime ago I worked on which was a fix to handle games which split the frame buffer in order to do texture shuffle Why they do this I am unsure It may have been an optimization of some kind However at the time I relied on some heuristics which have turned out to be flawed See Admittedly it is a shortcut and now the chickens have come home to roost Instead of this heuristic what I want to do is handle the issue in the cache AlessandroVetere has made great progress in handling midtexture hits in the cache for the Jak games with his texinsidert work I believe that this work can also benefit us here too TS relies on reading back a previous rt in a different format and mapping the pixels accordingly Currently the issue with halfscreen is we need to be able to hit mid rt in order to get the other half The hit will not always be dead center See related issues PCSX version v dev g ef Description of the issue Debugger doesnt seem to display VU microcode properly Very few instructions show up correctly How to reproduce the issue View any known address containing VU microcode in the debugger view Last known version to work NA If anyone has any resources on disassembling these opcodes correctly please let me know Im not sure how many people use PCSX for this purpose but Ive yet to find any proper toolsscripts out there This game has symbols marking the different labels of VU microcode and Id like to explore them more Thanks PCSX version All versions and I believe all developmental builds Description The clouds simply dont render unless youre in software mode In hardware mode theyre nonexistent While this isnt a major issue its still quite an issue that Id love to see solved PCSX options Default settings Any changes dont fix this issue How to reproduce the issue It is reproduced by simply playing the game No special setting Last known version to work Has never worked from what I know on any build If there exists one this will be changed PC specifications Windows IntelR CoreTM i HK CPU GHz Turbo up to I believe GB RAM GTX MaxQ Added some missing strings
