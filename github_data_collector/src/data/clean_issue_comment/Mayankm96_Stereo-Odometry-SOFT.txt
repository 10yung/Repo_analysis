Hi you have get the camera orientation and location in world coordinate Which are actrually relative orientation and location between frame t and frame t So you have used pos pos Rpostr Rpos R Rpos to get orientation and location in global relative to the original pos But it dosnt show me a correct trajectory Can I use the R and tr as relative pos which can be added to posegraph D Like hier relativePose trrotm quatR addRelativePoseposegraph D relativePos informationmatrix And then do some further loopclosure Are you familiar with the posegraph D Can i directly use the R and t to construct relative camera pose I also need to get poses in form of x y z qw qx qy qz to build an occupancy map What should I do to the R and tr I really get confused for a long time Could you please explain it to me Thank you very much
