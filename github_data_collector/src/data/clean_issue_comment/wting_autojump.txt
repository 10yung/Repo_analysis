I upgraded autojump to the version and when using cd or j I receive this error Traceback most recent call last File usrbinautojump line in module from autojumpargparse import ArgumentParser ModuleNotFoundError No module named autojumpargparse I downgraded it to the version and it works Im using Arch linux When CD into a new directory The autojump will copy the path into the clipboard which is super annoying How to fix this I just reinstalled arch and I see that autojump doesnt seem to be available in arch repos What happened Hi When a custom install location is given to installpy it modifies autojumpsh erroneously it appends a new if block at the end of the file when it should instead include another elif so that it does not potentially source the main shell file twice in case a distribution symlinks it into a standard location On a default Homebrew installation using usrlocal prefix this is the resulting autojumpsh symlinked at usrlocaletcprofiledautojumpsh after installation sh the login SHELL isnt always the one used NOTE problems might occur if binsh is symlinked to binbash if n BASH then shellbash elif n ZSHNAME then shellzsh elif n fishdatadir then shellfish elif n version then shelltcsh else shellecho SHELL awk F print NF fi prevent circular loop for sh shells if shell sh then return check local install elif s autojumpshareautojumpautojumpshell then source autojumpshareautojumpautojumpshell check global install elif s usrlocalshareautojumpautojumpshell then source usrlocalshareautojumpautojumpshell fi check custom install if s usrlocalCellarautojump shareautojumpautojumpshell then source usrlocalCellarautojump shareautojumpautojumpshell fi The Homebrew installation does create symlinks at usrlocalshareautojumpautojumpshell so because the check custom install block is not an elif it sources twice and essentially doubles autojumps load time in shell startup When I installed Catalina I figured Id migrate from bash to zsh as per the default setting Zsh sourced my entire bashrc with no problems EXCEPT the autojumpsh which caused numerous errors I dont know exactly what caused all the errors but I did notice the following autojumpsh overwrites fpath which caused all sorts of issues I was able to fix this by changing the source etcprofiledautojumpsh which is supposed to work on all shells to source shareautojumpautojumpzsh The installer said something about adding to my zshrc in zsh so I think it correctly identified my shell However it did not correctly source The source etcprofiledautojumpsh DOES work in bash for me I experienced this exact problem installing with brew install autojump which installs in usrlocal and by cloning the repository then calling installpy which installs in autojump In both cases regardless of which folder I was finding the autojumpzsh I had this issue Maybe this is the expected behavior but I dont think the documentation makes clear add the correct version to your rc file Add openSUSE distribution information for installing autojump I would expect to be able to do j somedirectorypath and have autocompletion and actually go to that directory Neither happens on a fresh install on Ubuntu Also would expect tab autocompletion to give the options in autojumps database typing j gtab would show if the first result is homeexamplegreat that i want or homeexamplegoof that i dont want so i know if i should type more letters Are my expectations off or something wrong with my install j s IMO autojump should always prioritize deeper subdirs to jump to OR jump to more complete matchescounter matches counter vs counter to counterwebsite Hi wting thank you very much for autojump Amazingly useful This PR makes the autojumpsh file more POSIXcompliant which is useful in some OSs that link binsh to secondary shells for performance improvements while still using bashzsh as the default shell References paddejumpvim This change makes jo command check command explorerexe existance and use it if available Instead it uses default behaviour This is needed to make this command normally work in WSL Windows Subsystem for Linux Closes
