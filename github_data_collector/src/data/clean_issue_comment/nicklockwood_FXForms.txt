Allow resolving FXForms as a dependency through Carthage For the normal textfield i was able to change the font and color by using textLabeltextColor textFieldThemecolor textLabelfont labelThemefont textFieldfont textFieldThemefont textFieldtextColor textFieldThemecolor But when I tried to change the font for gender field it says that the gender field doesnt have a key call textField In this case is there any way that i can still change the font and color for the selected gender that is displayed Hi When using European numerical pad decimal point is a comma and not the dot we all know and use So when entering a number to a cell of numericfloat type the setValue function inside FXFormsm convert it to double and basically remove the dot and practically convert it to int To handle it the double value need to be replaced with NSNumber formatter This is the problematic line of code value NSString value length value doubleValue nil These are the lines that can be used to replace the above NSNumberFormatter nf NSNumberFormatter new value NSString value length nf numberFromStringvalue doubleValue nil The result is a numeric number with a dot instead of comma Thanks Getting below error at build time Undefined symbols for architecture i OBJCCLASSTtCC Social AppDelegate FXFormVariables referenced from objcclassref in FXFormso ld symbols not found for architecture i clang error linker command failed with exit code use v to see invocation Fixes a problem where selecting placeholder on an indexed type is not feasible when the field has a default value Hi Ive got different background colors on different settings screens and do not know how to set them the same I am working on Navamsa application My settings screen uses FXForms In storyboard I created a viewController SettingsViewController class SettingsViewController FXFormViewController override func viewWillAppearanimated Bool formControllerform SettingsMainForm class SettingsMainForm NSObject FXForm var settingsLocationForm SettingsLocationForm func settingsAboutFormField AnyObject return FXFormFieldTitle Help FXFormFieldType FXFormFieldTypeBitfield class SettingsLocationForm NSObject FXForm The background color of viewController SettingsViewController in storyboard is set to DeviceRGB In simulator bg color of main settings form is but bg color of about form is And I stuck Basically I want one section of the form to consist of only a single UIView I created a subclass of FXFormBaseCell and added a UIView as subview and gave it as FXFormFieldTemplate But the form is still showing a field with a textfield Is there a way I can set the field to be my custom UIView I want to add weekdays on options picker but I want to display them with first letters after they are picked on main form Can I use transformers one for the picker and one for the main form or maybe any other way I have an array of objects that is structured so that each object has a uid and a name as well as some other information Ideally I would like to provide the array as a datasource but have FXForms only display the name as an option Then when one or more are selected I would ideally like to have a new array of objects rather than just names is this type of behavior possible using FXForms my apologies for being vague I really love the build in functionality just trying to figure out if I can use it This changes was to fix crash in the Swift Application when array item is NSNull Steps to reproduce the crash tap multiple times the Add Item prepare empty field a plurality Any tap an empty field crash in setValue
