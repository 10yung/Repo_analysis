ScreenToGif issue Screen To Gif Encoder Gifski not sure what version build time Platform Windows x Problem Gifski generates frames for even static recordings results in duplicated frames and redundant file size Demo generated from same project Recording by gifskiquality frames file size MB gifskiquality Gif link if github said its too large Gifskiquality zoom in Note the flickering pixels gifskiquality x Recording by quality frames file size MB quality quality zoom in Unchanged pixels stay the same thus its basically frame with a long timeout quality x Cropping could be useful to reduce gif size I know that I can achieve this using ffmpeg first but its more convenient if gifski can support this similar to the resize options About this issue I am not a rust expert but I did that to solve my issue So I am sharing it with you maybe youll be interested in it You can give a char after the frame path to multiply the frame delay its still optionnal ie gifski o foogif fps noorder framebarpng framebar png framebar png Hello awesome work Is there or are you plan to have a way to define the duration of each frame And avoid giving ten times the same frame to get this one longer Thank you ffmpeg support fps will be nice to have this feature I would love to use this in my editor written in C to export GIFs but dont want to have Rust as a dependency Are there any plans to provide a C API Or do you know if anyone else has done this allow sh gifski images outputmoviesgif Why I use gifski to generate simulation I have plots to be converted into minutes gif fps Passing images as argument kb buffer is not currently viable on Mac osx
