Hi I am new to object tracking and aiming to develop a multiobject tracker I came to know about VOT dataset but I am unable to download the dataset and I dont understand the use of this toolkit I request you to help me with how to download a dataset How to evaluate a tracker model I successfully integrated tracker written in MATLAB trackerlabel NCC trackercommand generatematlabcommandncc vottoolkitmastertrackerexamplesmatlab trackerinterpreter matlab after that I tested integrating tracker written in python and failedIts always stays in testing TraX protocol support for tracker nccand it no result trackerlabel NCC trackercommand generatepythoncommandpythonncc H dataset vottoolkitpython vottoolkitmaster tracker examples python trackerinterpreter python Later I saw some solutions in website and changed the code trackerlabel NCC trackercommand generatepythoncommandpythonncc H dataset vottoolkitpython vottoolkitmaster tracker examples python H dataset vottoolkitpython vottoolkitmaster native trax support python trackerinterpreter python trackerlinkpath H dataset vottoolkitpython vottoolkitmaster native trax build After that the results also remain the same And I find some solutions use the libtraxso while I cant get it on windows I dont know how to solve the problemsanyone encounter this problemMust I use it in on Ubuntu I use VOT with ECO tracker in MATLAB a

components step while running workspacecreate or runtest I get the error undefined reference to impWSACleanup from vottoolkit native trax src messagec After some searching I borrowed from the solution to this issue and changed vottoolkit utilities compilemexm around line from if isoctave argumentsend DOCTAVE else argumentsend lut end to if isoctave argumentsend DOCTAVE argumentsend lws else argumentsend lut end and it worked for me Could this be included in the toolkit System Windows Octave v configured for x w ming VOT toolkit Trax Ive tried to run the plot program with the official toolkit under Octave and got the following image ours However this is very different from what we see in those publications eg VOT report as follows May I have any feasible solution wrt this issue

normally again However there is no wrong information in log file When I compare this to log information in shortterm tracking challenge Nonetype will not show in log file of shortterm tracking when tracker lost target Is there any problem with RGBT data generation Hello I am having such a problem When I run the RGBT runexperiments file the previous sequences can be executed normally However there will be an error in the subsequent sequence so I will take these sequences to the runtest file and find that they can be executed normally So I suspect that the problem may be in the test For frames that fail to track the judgment the vottoolkit may have some mechanism that I dont understand that causes the error I hope you can help me find some solutions error runexperiments Initializing
