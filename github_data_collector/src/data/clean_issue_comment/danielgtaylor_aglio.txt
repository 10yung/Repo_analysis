This is a question I dont see option to add label Is it possible to have a try it now button in an aglio html doc that will run a test against a live server as one finds in swagger default templates I find that functionality to be very helpful to potential customers install agio with node always failed due to aglio depends on drafter while drafter depends on protagonist protagonist compiles failed with node while protagonist compiles well with node please update drafter version to to solve this problem thanks ahead Critical Sandbox Bypass Leading to Arbitrary Code Execution Package

FSReqCallbackreadFileAfterClose as oncomplete internalfsreadfilecontextjs node v works fine I dont know if this is a request a question or a bug Im trying to do two things Instead of using the builtin highlight on ReqResp bodies I want to iterate over the lines and literally wrap them in p or span elements Needed to output to a content system that cant handle preformatted codetext so I need to style with inline csslong story If I can get the keyvalues thats even better so I can format them differently but Ill take what I can get I cant quite figure out the format of the object delivered in requestbody I tried each thing in requestbody followed by p requestbodything and requestbody thing and clearly Im not accessing the object properly This is either probably something very simple or very impossible Im not above rewriting or patching something if needed This is even more basic I have a folder with just exampleapib indexjade mixinsjade copied from the theme branch But no matter what I try it often seems to try to ignore my updated mixinsjade presumably pulling from the node install dir The command line I use is aglio i exampleapib themetemplate indexjade o foojade And Ive tried various methods of include like mixinsjade mixinsjade and tried an absolute path but that requires setting a Jade basedir option that I dont know how to do if youre not using the JS API directly Thank you in advance on both issuesquestions this will REALLY help me solve a big project Trying to read large blueprints from stdin fails giving a syntax error which suggests the content was truncated Reading the same file in via i filename method works fine so there is no issue with the file itself The length of the content I got was always bytes suggesting some issue around buffering After experimenting it turns out that what actually happens is the processstdinon readable event handler gets called multiple times for large files for each block of data from the buffer So the fix is to build up the blueprint content over a series of readable events and wait until the end event is triggered before trying to process it Aglio will not install and outputs the following errors any

have noticed that this project has quite a lot of traction but it seems there is not a lot of activity The last commit in Master is from May So my question is does anyone have more insight if this is under active development and if not Is there an alternative out there
