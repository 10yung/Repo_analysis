Ive some trouble to reproduce the trained models from the information in the blog post and the readme Usage section The training data is not provided in folders wrt to classification Probably I missed some info to get it work as well Id like to use the model in a github repo as example about how to wrap a trained model into a microservice In case you have the fully reproducable modelh file the final th version of the model flying around somewhere it would be great if you could add it to the repo Great blog post btw
