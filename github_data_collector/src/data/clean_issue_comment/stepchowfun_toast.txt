MVP for Windows host support Works with Docker Toolbox via VirtualBox on Windows Home Untested with modern Docker for Windows requires Windows Pro andor Insider Preview All tests are passing both in Windows host cargo test and inside Linux guest cargo run test but otherwise this PR is a draft not suitable for production It works for my workflow but didnt touch anything related to mounting but tests are passing so idk and remote caching XR pJVW x Status Sanity check required Fixes Description It would be great to be able to invalidate the local cache starting from a specific task and all tasks that depend on it ie I have several build toast files and would like to be able to invalidate from cloning the repository on but dont really want to invalidate things like installing deps setup etc cloning tasks naturally dont invalidate themselves because the command is the exact same even if commits have been happening on the remote repo Alternatives considered A YAML key like yaml localcachevalidif cmdsthatreturn forcacheisvalid orreturn ifinvalidcache Also the current using readlocalcache false which invalidates everything but is less than desirable Additional context None Description A clear description of what you want to happen One of the benefits of containerization of dev envs is being able to run them in a platform agnostic way so itd be cool if toast could run on Windows Alternatives considered A clear description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered Additional context Add any other context about the feature request here Id love to help make this happen
