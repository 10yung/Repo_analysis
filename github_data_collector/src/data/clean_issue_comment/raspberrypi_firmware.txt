Describe the bug Mailbox property tag x ineffective at setting RGB pixel order after firmware upgrade To reproduce Run on a RPi B with latest firmware Repository now contains a complete minimal assembly example Expected behaviour Previously this used to correctly display homer on a connected HDMI monitor Actual behaviour Homer is cyan rather than yellow since framebuffer is using BGR instead of RGB System RPi B Additional context See also I havent bisected the firmware revision where the problem started occurring but a couple of years ago the same kernel img worked correctly with the firmware of the time Randomly on one upgrade it broke Please note the code that generates the mailbox request can be found in lfbc The response to the x mailbox property tag is not checked in the example code but when I add a check for it I see that mbox is after making the mailbox call so for some reason the request is denied although it was previously supported on older firmware Which model

no workaround Hi I have random freezes on raspbian buster and newest rpi firmware i have Linux raspberrypi v SMP Mon Jan GMT armv l GNULinux It happend random sometimes with high cpu load sometimes without any high load It seems to start after upgrading to raspbian buster my rpi b start freezes After freeze i can see my console on screen but cannot log into with ssh i dont use x server Cannot do anything even with keyboard connected to rpi works only enter tap and then nothing happend Copy and paste the results of the raspinfo command in to this section Alternatively copy and paste a pastebin

uname a Linux raspberrypi v SMP Mon Jan GMT armv l GNULinux I report this bug here on recommendation of popcornmix Describe the bug When playing a video with the latest LibreElec testbuilds suddenly a crash appears and kodi restarts This does not happen always and at random moments However it happens often enough to reproduce To reproduce Create a brand new fresh install of libreelec kodi and then update with the latest libreelec testbuild I used Jan on a rpi Play a movie and the crash occurs after some time Sometimes a second try must be done Expected behaviour No crash should happen Actual behaviour It crashes The crahlog file contains Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV Segmentation fault x f d in memcpy from usrliblibarmmemv lso System the raspinfo command does not exist on my

moment Additional context I have a complete image available from this setup So you can restore the image on a micro sd card min gb and boot with it and then goto video and play the video there Please provide me an email address to whom I can send a link of this image If you prefer the movie only I can also provide it It is a movie I recorded myself I prefer not to post these links here publically but if really needed I will do Sorry if Im asking the question in wrong place but not really sure what would be the best place to do it Please advise if theres a better one Recently I was debugging broken mpv which appeared to be caused by linking with both libEGL and libbrcmEGL My question is what is the purpose of the latter Is it somehow different than libEGL provided by platform Is libbrcmEGL gonna replace libEGL completely Why cause so much trouble to projects if they want to support both Mesas libEGL and rpis libbrcmEGL in one binary It basically forces projects to introduce modular design and do quite a lot of gimmicks with linking to have common EGLGLES code without being tied to single library Latest Rasbian on Pi ethled setting to does not function as documented Amber LED stays on When the rpi bootloader was previously configured with libfirmwareraspberrypibootloaderbetapieeprom bin to only boot from the network as BOOTORDER x NETBOOTMAXRETRIES It cannot be recovered using the recovery procedure BTW this should be available as a img file as the normal raspbian image which would allow us to use the same procedure eg using balena etcher I need stable core clock frequency because SPI bus is used I use my PRi in headless mode so GPU performance doesnt matter to me And I prefer to keep GPU power consumption as low as possible I want to use max nonovercocked CPU frequency At least with performance governor RPi boots faster And idle temperature difference between MHz and MHz is only on B There is my current config it works on RPi B gpufreq forceturbo I dislike explicit frequency setting Im unsure if it is compatible with RPi and future models What about new option Something like gputurbo would be fine Hardware BCM Revision a Serial d
