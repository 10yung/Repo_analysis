Recently I stared receiving awk errors awk cmd line FILENAME FNR warning Invalid multibyte data detected There may be a mismatch between your data and your locale It seems this has to do with the locale setting on my machine not being set to C and some interplay between awk and lower level libraries Further discussion can be read here I fixed this by setting the environment variable to LCALLC within the zsh script as a workaround LCALLC awk I dont think its appropriate to ask people to change their locale settings machine wide or even in their shell to remove these warning Im wondering if this is a good idea to have added to the script permanently via PR I guess this may have something to do with the way awk or dependent library was compiled on my current machine Arch Linux However it can still happen to anyone in a similar situation Thoughts Hello I get the following error when running z in MinGW git bash on Windows bash devfd No such file or directory I added a set x in z to see

randomly get the following message on my terminal mv cannot move homeprotistz to homeprotistz No such file or directory This doesnt necessarily occur after cding most recently it occurred after ls There is a file at z with user writeread permissions and recently modified presumably by z Im not sure if relevant but I can also see numerous other files with a similar name ls al z rwrr protist

z rwrr protist protist Aug z Im running the latest version z with zsh on Arch Linux EDIT I got a different error after another ls mv cannot stat homeprotistz No such file or directory It looks like the shell cant find the source file z which is true it doesnt exist In contrast the original error reported above ie mv cannot move foo to bar No such file or directory appears when the target directory cannot be found and perhaps other situations Fixes Currently theres no license for z which might restrict its use in some business settings has lots of information on different ones I recommend MIT since its very open I just noticed those two options where missing from the header when I run z pathname The results are these common Userskangkangohmyzshplugins

would make the experience transparent See archlinux wiki for more information Thanks for this great software
