 After render the JSON Can I edit on the webpage such as modify some keys value and I can save the modify to the original JSON data title says it all I noticed it says Umaintained in the sub header so I was wondering if there was a different version of this project Show the index number of arrays elements This pull request adds backers and sponsors from your Open Collective It adds two badges at the top to show the latest number of backers and sponsors It also adds placeholders so that the avatarlogo of new backerssponsors can automatically be shown without having to update your READMEmd more info See how it looks on this repo We have also added a postinstall script to let people know after npmyarn install that you are welcoming donations optional More info You can also add a Donate button to your website and automatically show your backers and sponsors there with our widgets Have a look here PS As with any pull request feel free to comment or suggest changes The only thing required are the placeholders on the README because we believe its important to acknowledge the people in your community that are contributing financially or with code Thank you for your great contribution to the open source community You are awesome And welcome to the open collective community Come chat with us in the opensource channel on great place to ask questions and share best practices with other open source sustainers JSON Viewer chrome extension shows the JSON path on hover is there a way to get the same in this Howdy Im including this in an application that has cleancss as part of its build process When building a production build the build process get cleancss to throw on warning which is designed to prevent any issues with CSS unknowingly getting through to the production build I guess It has started failing on jqueryjsonview because the css file has a sourceMappingUrl definition at the bottom of it but there is no sourcemap actually provided I dont know if its easy in your build process to just remove this comment line but if you could point me in the right direction I might be able to take a look with a PR if I get a chance Should not create inner logic if collapsedtrue is given should initiate inner logic only when tree is collapsed only on click Currently if you get the content of the DOM element processed by JSONView it includes the dash for toggling nodes Would be really useful to get back the clean object though say JSONViewjson
