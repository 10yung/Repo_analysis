hi what is the status of this repository I see the build is failing and several PRs are unmerged wo any comments If theres anything specific I could help with to breathe some life into this please let me know A Github app requires a custom media type for requests However newcustommedia MediaType was removed in this commit Do you plan to get it back This restores the depagination logic from an old branch Im not sure this is actually the best approach as I worked on this I realized that a much simpler way would be a variant of the execute method that simply includes an optional next page Request object in its output In order to have a nicer development experience I moved most of the Executor logic into the trait definition itself leaving only a few methods to be implemented in the exec macro itself I realize this refactoring isnt strictly related to these changes but personally I think its an improvement I was recently trying to update some code which uses your githubgqlrs crate contained within this repo but it looks like due to some dependencies being yanked it can no longer be used error failed to select a version for the requirement untrusted candidate versions found which didnt match location searched cratesio index required by package rustls v which is depended on by hyperrustls v which is depended on by githubgqlrs v it looks like you have updated the dependencies though here but no new release has been published Would you be willing to publish a new release in the dependency issues were fixed for githubrs but not githubgqlrs which requires a release by someone with privs at some point several problems are corrected in the example code including a reference to githubgqlmutationMutation the serdejson dependency is added to Cargotoml change the dependency on githubgqlrs to the github repo rather than the crate which no longer works This PR adds a sethostname method to the Github client that should enable it to be used for GitHub Enterprise as well as public GitHub The library defaults to public GitHub so usage remains exactly the same for existing users api example Basically just made the base url for the graphql queries configurable so that the user can target GHE installations None
