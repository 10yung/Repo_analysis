Is it possible to have node labels repel each other to avoid label overlap Ive seen this feature for d js Im wondering if you know of or could impliment this for networkD The ability to group nodes and ungroup them It would be nice to have an ability start Sankey from top to the bottom Diagonal networks would be an amazing addition to drake dependency graph visualizations However there are two obstacles The List data structure which I would have to compute using the existing Nodes and Links data frames The requirement that we have only a single root node Is there a way to easily transition from sankeyNetwork to diagonalNetwork using the same graphs and same data structures Sankey networks have been super useful in drake However I am noticing rendering problems when the network is super large r librarynetworkD librarytidyverse n nodes dataframe id seq L n edges dataframe from rep L n to seqlenn value L sankeyNetwork Links edges Nodes nodes Source from Target to Value value supCreated on by the reprex package v sup Is there a way to improve how the edges render on the left The desired result is similar to the graph below r librarynetworkD librarytidyverse n nodes dataframe id seq L n edges dataframe from rep L n to seqlenn value L sankeyNetwork Links edges Nodes nodes Source from Target to Value value supCreated on by the reprex package v sup This is a new issue for an old problem how text displays in tooltips For links the two lines are separated by a newline character n For nodes the two lines are separated by a br tag While this works in Safari it does not appear to work in Chrome or Edge The br tag is just ignored and the two lines run together I believe the answer is simple In the line below just replace br with n like the way links are handled to fix the problem Ive edited my local copy of sankeyNetworkjs and this now works on Safari Chrome and Edge As an aside I believe using br should work in Chrome and Edge Ive posted a question on StackOverflow to ask this question Do you want me to make this change via pull request Is there a native munging function for getting a column sourcetarget dataframe into a link list and node list format The column dataframe has the following format Source Target A C A D B E B F The link list would be from to and the node list would be id node A B C D E F I can get the data into this format but I want to know if there are standard methods for doing so Could you please tag the release in Git I see is tagged Its tough to figure out where the commits are for the current CRAN release of without this Thanks Hi Based on my limited understanding of JavaScript the clickAction for the nodes currently allows you to show in text the characteristics such as node name node size or node group when you click on a particular node depends on how user write the JavaScript expression for clickAction ie the MyClickScript in example of forceNetwork in the R documentation Would it be possible to add a similar clickAction feature for the links In particular one that allows the user to show variables in the Links input such as link lengthwidth sourcetarger or refer to a the corresponding value in a userspecified column in the Links input Or alternatively a hoverAction on the links where it would show a text box similar to the one in sandkeyNetwork defined by a userspecified JavaScript expression based on variables in the Links input when user hovers on the links Thanks Aaron The following graph should have a green node but it appears blue Tested with both the CRAN release and c a c ff c d d e ae cc e r nodes dataframe id letters label cblue green black status cimported up to date outdated stringsAsFactors FALSE edges dataframe src c target c value color d scaleOrdinal domain imported up to date outdated range CD B networkD sankeyNetwork Links edges Nodes nodes NodeID label Source src Target target NodeGroup status Value value colourScale color fontSize color
