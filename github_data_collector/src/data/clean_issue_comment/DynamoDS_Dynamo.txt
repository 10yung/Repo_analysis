 Purpose JIRA GH Issue This fix prevents a crash when converting nodes to code in which at least one upstream node is a CBN that has static property invocations such as p PointByCoordinates x PointXp The reason for the crash was that the property was not found in the procedure table for the class Since property getters internally compile to getpropertynameobject a method has been added that additionally checks for a static getter that accepts one argument namely the class object which in this example would be searching explicitly for getXp instead of just X Declarations Check these if you believe they are true x The codebase is in a better state after this PR Is documented according to the standards x The level of testing this PR includes is appropriate User facing strings if any are extracted into resx files All tests pass using the selfservice CI Snapshot of UI changes if any Changes to the API follow Semantic Versioning and are documented in the API Changes document

Note Before submitting the PR please review How to Contribute to Dynamo Dynamo Team will meet x a month to review PRs found on Github Issues will be handled separately PRs will be reviewed from oldest to newest If a reviewed PR requires changes by the owner the owner of the PR has days to respond If the PR has seen no activity by the next session it will be either closed by the team or depending on its utility will be taken over by someone on the team PRs should use either Dynamos default PR template or one of these other template options in order to be considered for review PRs that do not have one of the Dynamo PR templates completely filled out with all declarations satisfied will not be reviewed by the Dynamo team PRs made to the DynamoRevit repo will need to be cherrypicked into all the DynamoRevit Release branches that Dynamo supports Contributors will be responsible for cherrypicking their reviewed commits to the other branches after a LGTM label is added to the PR Purpose Adding

in the following information to help us reproduce the issue What did you do Tried to translate a mesh What did you expect to see A mesh that has been translated What did you see instead The following error Warning GeometryTranslate expects argument types Geometry double double double but was called with AutodeskDesignScriptGeometryMesh int int int Which is ironic because it clearly states that Mesh is a subclass of Geometry and yet a method that applies to the parent class cannot apply to the child class It violates all rules of object oriented programming What packages or external references if any were used None Stack Trace This was not a crash Just a limitation of Dynamo MeshBug OS Microsoft Windows NT CLR Dynamo If this issue is with Dynamo for Revit please post your issue
