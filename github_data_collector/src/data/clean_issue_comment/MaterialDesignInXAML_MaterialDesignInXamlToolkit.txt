Now you can use CustomBackground and CustomForeground for the ColorZone if you choose Custom as its mode because sometimes you need your own colors like for a GroupBox or something fixes Update Flat and Outlined button border brush and ripple feedback based on materialio documentation Changes Preview Changes Preview TextBox materialDesignTextFieldAssistHasFilledTextFieldTrue materialDesignTextFieldAssistDecorationVisibilityHidden BorderThickness Underline is still shown Not shown if HasFilledTextFieldFalse If I have some free time this week Ill fix it myself Overview Hello We are now implementing the library into a relatively bigcomplicated system with about screens Keeping developing the system we have found the problem The buttons ripple effect can only get fired AFTRE the corresponding function is all finished So there is some gap especially when the processing is heavy seconds seriously Our understanding of the main purpose or concept of the Material Designs micro interactionripple effect is letting users know that their action is successfully started so they can avoid confusion Therefore accordingly we do not think the current move is appropriate leading our users interviewed to the answers When we click the buttons we dont know whats happening And we believe that this issue should be fixed on the library layer Image rippleissue gif Code XAML file EmpButton derives from Button ccEmpButton StyleStaticResource EmpButtonStylePlain CommandBinding RefreshCommand Content ViewModel file RefreshCommandSubscribe heavy method like getting data from servers RefreshUketsukePatientListfalse What we tried and failed Firstly we tried to asyncronize the method However UI processing methodslike ones opening a dialog didn t let us do so Plus we already have got synchronous codes that we cannot touch Then we gave up Secondly we tried to overcome it by creating and using a wrapper letting us execute methods aftre ripple effect has been completed But it had shown several side effects Not opening dialogs and not showing messages etc So we decided not to use the way as well So please help us It is our pleasure if you could change the timing of the effect to start BEFORE the function runs Please ask questions if you do not see what I meant above Because of my English and so forth Thank you so much I have added character counter to text field It is visible when both MaxLength is nonzero and new TextFieldAssistShowCharacterCounter is true Only TextBox is supported because calculating RichTextBoxs length is nontrivial and I dont think PasswordBox needs one I implement this via cloning thus duplicating styles there is no Text property on TextBoxBase Icon update detected by Azure pipeline Auto generated pull request Hi i want make my Textbox Hint Horizontal Alignment to center but i cant do it because of this lines in SmartHintcs file I try to copy all SmartHint templates and change this property but this code will change style properties after all XAML setters and i finally use an event trigger and storyboard to do this My temporary solution is How do I change the border color in wpf checbox For example I want to express it with white border when it is black from CheckBoxFromGrid to checkbox Please tell me how to change Thank you Version Preview ClearButton Issue Code to reproduce xaml TextBox VerticalContentAlignmentCenter materialDesignTextFieldAssistTextFieldCornerRadius materialDesignTextFieldAssistHasOutlinedTextFieldTrue materialDesignTextFieldAssistHasClearButtonTrue materialDesignTextFieldAssistDecorationVisibilityCollapsed materialDesignHintAssistHintOpacity materialDesignHintAssistIsFloatingFalse materialDesignHintAssistHintSearch Hello the following issue is reproducible in the demo application so I have not prepared a demo repo Description If there is an editable combobox near the bottom of the screen the calculation of the popup position seems to be incorrect The normal windows combobox behavior is to have the popup placed above the combobox so that the bottom of the popup aligns with the top of the field With MaterialDesign it seems that the bottom of the popup aligns with the bottom of the screen which leads to a look that is probably not intended Steps to reproduce Open the demo application Go to the Fields section Move the window so that the At least characters HelperText of the Password control aligns with a normal height windows taskbar see screenshot Open the Fruit combobox You should be seeing something roughly like screenshot The popup is positioned incorrectly and the transparent part of the popup that should contain the editable textbox of the Fruit combobox now contains the OS combobox If the popup is supposed to cover the combobox then the transparent part needs to be at the bottom of the popup In any case the list of items should all be displayed above the combobox Thanks for your time in advance David Screenshot grafik Screenshot grafik
