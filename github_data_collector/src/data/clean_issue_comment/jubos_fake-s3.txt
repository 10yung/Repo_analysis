When deleting fake directories that tools like Hadoop create this tool ends up deleting the entire directory even if not empty See this For example if I have testrun foobar and the hadoopaws code tries to delete the fake directory testrun it ends up deleting foobar The real S SDK leaves the foobar file alone and only tries to delete the fake directory which should be expected behavior for this tool Is this project using continuous integration services eg TravisCI or Jenkings Or has it used at any point of its lifetime I faced this issue when I tried to create bucket from ansible This is provisionyml ansible playbook hosts remoteserver gatherfacts false become yes environment envparams varsfiles varsmainyml tasks s bucket name s backup s url It created bucket but resulted Bucket request payment failed to apply in the expected time error I saw multiple requests like this in fakes console localhost Dec EST GET HTTP localhost Dec EST PUT s backup HTTP s backup localhost Dec EST

backuprequestPayment Ansible sent more than times this request and time was out So it would be better if fakes supports this request Here is the doc about this request Love this library great work Minor issue but when submitting a part in a multipart upload the error is not very descriptive when using as PartNumber It took me a while to figure out that I was indexing with instead of PartNumber To Reproduce Create a multipart upload Submit a part with PartNumber Result This will succeed It should give an error saying you cant upload a part with a PartNumber of Sample response from S Heres the response I get from S xml xml version encodingUTF Error CodeInvalidArgumentCode MessagePart number must be an integer between and inclusiveMessage ArgumentNamepartNumberArgumentName ArgumentValue

for demo purposes and got XAmzContentSha is not allowed on requests Latest master has support for setting CORS headers but it is unreleased This actually helps but I needed to make my own image to be able to use it So until this gets released or fixed you can use my image to pass CORS headers not really production grade because it takes fakes from master Getting below exception in one of the project whereas it works perfectly fine in other Dont have ANY idea what seems wrong here Does AWS SDK version matter The project where it works is having awsjavasdks and where it doesnt is having

Using this application I am able to successfully upload files to S but Im now getting to the point where Id like to test with some REALLY big files For cost and time reasons Id like to use FakeS I am starting FakeS on the ubuntu box using these arguments fakes r homedevfakes root p H fakes local I am able to upload successfully to S a MB and a MB file Each of these uploads uses the S multipart API and succeeds When I switch to FakeS the MB file uploads successfully but FakeS appears to fail with the MB file For info the parts are uploaded in MB blocks Heres the output from S when it appears to go wrong Any help appreciated create MBobjecttxt Also works with a MB and a MB file Fails with MB file Regards Paul I am running a Vagrant VM with Ubuntu and I have set up fakes in there Its running
