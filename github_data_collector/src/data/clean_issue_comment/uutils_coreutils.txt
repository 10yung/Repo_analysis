average GNU up days user load average This patch provides the same output This is a multiweek effort to fix all cargo clippy lint complaints Ive made significant effort to segregate the changes by clippy category per commit The last commits containing allow are added allow attributes for code that clippy doesnt like but has no easy refactor or would increase MinSRV I tried to be very mechanical and straightforward about all refactors But Im happy to work on any of this if you disagree with any of the refactoring choices or the allow commits note this PR is on top of the fixmodernize PR in order to be able to easily build and test on multiple machines This PR is on top of the windowslegacy fixaddition PR adds cargo make support for platform dependent build and testing using cargo make and cargo make test respectively modernizes deprecated range operator try and trimleftright corrects all test failures for all tested CI types both Travis CI and AppVeyor tests w and W for stat more loosely given variable support on target machines via builtin stat avoids testing stat outputs a d and f which are race conditions and may vary per machine andor run fixes testing on windows linux via WSL Im happy to make changes This is really a preliminary PR to fix all brokendeprecation issues and serving as a base for a separate massive clippycleanup PR So we coud use coreutils construct minimal linux system Allows older windows versions to build using featurewindowslegacy use CreateFileW instead of CreateFile disable hostname build current implementation isnt compatible with older Windows version substituted deprecated range form with removed try removed unused argument in println There appears to be a lot of variation in how complete the partially done commands are For example od seems fairly complete but date doesnt even support simple usages like date Ymd and sort seems to have a good selection of options but is missing some relatively important ones like sort keys It would be really useful if there were some documentation clarifying how complete the partially done commands are to help people understand whats available I am looking for Windows equivalents of Unix commands and would for example use this project for many of them but would probably not install date as it stands or only make it available via the uutils command
