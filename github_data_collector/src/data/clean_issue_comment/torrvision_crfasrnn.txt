I combin CRNasRNN to FCN but this error that i can not deal with it the title is information of error Dear Authors This is a very great work Thanks very much How to change the parameters of Cropping D in order to detect image with size about Thanks very much Dear All Initially an error xrange is not defined came when I tried to run the demopy then I changed the xrange to range and the py script started to runhowever anothe error came I upgradeprotocpp Successfully upgraded file specified using deprecated V LayerParameter Traceback most recent call last File crfasrnndemopy line in module

Netbatch num lenblobsitervaluesnext AttributeError dict object has no attribute itervalues It seems that it is an compatible issue thank you in advance In CRFasRNN the thetaalpha and the thetagamma are for spatial terms and the thetabeta is for the term in feature space In the thetaalpha is but the thetagamma is Why did these two parameters set for so much difference In addition the thetaalpha is means that the image has a big spatial blur right What does this mean Does any know the reason Thanks sadeepj bittnt Is it possible to process multiple images simultaneously via Multithreading Can you please suggest the required changes to be made for this Thanks Akash Hi Everyone I am trying to replicate the training of this model on Pascal VOC augmented dataset which has training images and validation images I have following queries regarding training For me a whole pass through the dataset of images takes approximately hours where i use a batch size of Am I missing something or is it similarly slow for everyone How many complete passesepochs through complete datasets are required to train model to desired accuracy roughly Miu How is the trend Will initial validation Miu accuracy decrease starting from fcn and then decrease Any trend in this whosoever has trained successfully will really be of help Regards Ankit Hello I am trying to train cfrasrnn with my own data using I had to slightly modify some pieces of the code to make it run on my Mac OSX but it now runs the training I have one first problem when trying to parse the log file in order to vizualise loss using lossfromlogpy Traceback most recent call last File lossfromlogpy line in module main File lossfromlogpy line in main trainlossappendfloatmatchedgroup AttributeError NoneType object has no attribute group Indeed in the log file theres no lossft output Why The second is that when I try to use the caffemodel output eg iteration or to test if it recognizes object it now fails to do so I tried with various objects What am I doing wrong please Many thanks if any one can help Hi I tried to run the crfasrnndemopy on aws g xlarge gpu instance but it took about seconds how to can make it more fast
