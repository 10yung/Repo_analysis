Not sure how useful this is but I wanted to update glutin and webrender to see if it would fix Unfortunately this didnt fix the issue but I thought Id put this up for you in case it saves you work in future Known issues Ellipse clipping broken as webrender no longer supports this Only list crud and button examples updated to work with new glutin Hello I encountered error when building limn with rustc Compiling orderediter v error E the trait bound B bitvecBitBlock is not satisfied homeusercargoregistrysrcgithubcom ecc db ec orderediter srclibrs impla B bitvecBitBlock OrderedSetIterator for bitsetItera B the trait bitvecBitBlock is not implemented for B help consider adding a where B bitvecBitBlock bound note required because of the requirements on the impl of stditerIterator for bitsetItera B error aborting due to previous error error Could not compile orderediter warning build failed waiting for other jobs to finish error build failed I tried to add the where block as rust recommends but the error stays exactly the same Commenting out this line with impl works the library gets built and even examples can be built This error seems to be in stablebst library which uses orderediter internally but these two crates seem to be no longer maintained stablebst library is used only in limncoresrcinputkeyboardrs it uses TreeMap and ranges from this crate Maybe the best thing to do is just wait for ranges to be stabilized in rust and just remove this library altogether and use std BTreeMap as written in this comment Running Windows v Attempting to build or run any of the examples with cargo returns this error error failed to select a version for khronosapi required by glgenerator all possible versions conflict with previously selected versions of khronosapi version in use by khronosapi v possible versions to select Are there any plans on data binding Unicode input is essential for nonEnglish users When I try to run clock example I gets error thread main panicked at called Resultunwrap on an Err value OsErrorwglCreateContextAttribsARB failed OS Error FormatMessageW returned error os error src libcore resultrs note Run with RUSTBACKTRACE for a backtrace error process didnt exit successfully target release examples clockexe exit code None of the currently available widgets demonstrate an ability to draw over other portions of the window It would be nice to see how this might be accomplished in limn Some example widgets that need this functionality include dropdown box context menu menu bar tooltip tab bar etc I think there is still a room for little refactoring Here are few propositions How about change of WidgetBuildersetdrawstyle to setstyle I would suggest change naming of WidgetModifier also the method frommodifier The name is confusing and I there is no documentation currently Only have apply method so how about Apply trait Or WidgetApply Also WidgetBuilderfrommodifierListdefault you basically create a default list Maybe WidgetBuildcreatefromListdefault or implement From trait for the current widget modifier It would be possible to write let wb WidgetBuilderfromListdefault There is lot of somewidgetlayoutaddcontstraints repeating in the examples Since contraints is a macro itself how about putting a target widget builder inside macro listwidgetlayoutaddconstraints shrink matchwidth scrollwidget change to something like not sure if possible constrain target listwidget shrink matchwidth scrollwidget In this case we are hiding mutating a state so maybe not so good idea How about listwidgetaddconstraints or listwidgetconstrainaligntop container or listwidgetaddrulealigntop container We could also consider changing constrain to rule since its shorter and easier to type I dont have time to investigate this currently but here error the bottom of the rectangle doesnt get rendered for whatever reason Probably a webrender mistake The layout is correct as far as I can see errorwithborders Only occurs when the window is maximized This doesnt happen in a regular x window Its only a minor annoyance though Known issues On Windows the whole window flickers while resizing On X and probably other platforms when growing the window the new window area stays black for a while before being drawn Rendering lags when the layout is updated rendering and layout are not well synchronized The core eventrendering loop needs an overhaul to fix these properly Im planning to take these on after trying to fix the other major issues on OSX so that these issues can hopefully be fixed and tested across all the major platforms
