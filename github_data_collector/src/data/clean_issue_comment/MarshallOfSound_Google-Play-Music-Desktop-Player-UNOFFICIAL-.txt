instructions in the FAQ OS Windows GPMDP Version RC Issue Descriptions On most screens the main scrollbar disappears after a short while It reappears sometimes when interacting with other UI elements resizing the window etc but always disappears again after a moment Hovering the right of the window which would normally show a hidden scroll bar does not work When the scrollbar is present Im able to use it and it wont disappear as long as Im using or hovering it Im always able to use the scrollwheel on my mouse to scroll In the following screenshots Ive marked with a dot about where my mouse was In this first screenshot Ive interacted with the track list which caused the scrollbar to show I then hovered my mouse on it and took the screenshot GPMDP In this second screenshot I moved my mouse off the scrollbar for a few moments and after it disappeared I hovered where it should be GPMDP Steps to Reproduce Open GPMDP Notice that the scrollbar is visible on the main Google Play Music landing page Wait a short amount of time Notice that the scrollbar has disappeared I know Im able to switch between the full player and mini player however having a customizable mini player completely separate to the main player would be awesome to have It would be especially nice if instead of having it be a square how it currently is it would be a wide rectangle like shown below This also makes for an appealing music display for streaming which is what I currently use the standard application for Having a completely separate mini player would also allow you to tab into it to change songs and play lists without the overlay shown on stream having a progress bar or ratings appear over it Providing users with the option to drag around and split up artist and album resize change fonts based on currently installed fonts and adding more info like time progress name of next song what number the song is in the queueplaylist or a visualizer Below is a picture of the full player with what would usually show when trying to change a song on a region being captured OS Win x GPMDP Version Megapost Issue Descriptions The X on the Dark theme are Black on the Black button causing them to look
