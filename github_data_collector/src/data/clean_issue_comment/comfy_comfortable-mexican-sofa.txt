 Summary Redactor was built on top of jQuery x Rails pulls jQuery jQuery has removed the jQuerysize function which is used by Redactor This PR reimplements jQuerysize as part of the assets The branch gemspec didnt limit the maximum version of bootstrapform as a consequence installingupdating could pull newer version of bootstrapform that depends on BS which would break the layout of custom controllers that are reusing the CMS backend Note For general questions and feature requests please leave a message on Gitter Expected behavior I have a certain styling I want to apply to all p elements for a layout For example I want to add lineheight px to the content by doing this div classui centered grid div classui row div classten wide column div classcard stylelineheight px cmswysiwyg content div div div div However this is not affecting all the p components because the styling is being added to the div component So I was wondering if there was a way to import a styling css file for that layout to apply to all p elements System configuration Rails version Rails CMS version Ruby version Ruby Summary When glebm converted these files from CoffeeScript to JavaScript he used ES These files break on older browsers like IE I transpiled them to ES using babel I think sticking to ES is a better solution than adding babel gem dependency complexity I havent yet updated Plupload to its latest version but the contained polyfill is a little more up to date use original name mentioned errorcausing PR was merged into rc use original file names for prettytextdiff and diffmatchpatch comment source urls for later updates Update CodeMirror and used plugins to latest version Summary When CMS is included in a rails parent app the aftersave callback on the file model causes an endless callback loop that runs until a stack level too deep error is returned And the file is not successfully uploadedsaved I reviewed the change logs for active storage and didnt see anything that seemed relevant I suspect there is a change in the behavior in there somewhere and I just failed to find it Moving the callback to a beforesave resolves the issue tests continue to pass on with the change the repeating stack is hometongboycomfortablemexicansofaappmodelscomfycmsfilerb in processattachment activesupport rc libactivesupportcallbacksrb in block in makelambda activesupport rc libactivesupportcallbacksrb in block in haltingandconditional activesupport rc libactivesupportcallbacksrb in block in invokeafter activesupport rc libactivesupportcallbacksrb in each activesupport rc libactivesupportcallbacksrb in invokeafter activesupport rc libactivesupportcallbacksrb in runcallbacks activesupport rc libactivesupportcallbacksrb in runsavecallbacks activerecord rc libactiverecordcallbacksrb in createorupdate activerecord rc libactiverecordtimestamprb in createorupdate activerecord rc libactiverecordpersistencerb in save activerecord rc libactiverecordvalidationsrb in save activerecord rc libactiverecordtransactionsrb in block in save activerecord rc libactiverecordtransactionsrb in block in withtransactionreturningstatus activerecord rc libactiverecordconnectionadaptersabstractdatabasestatementsrb in transaction activerecord rc libactiverecordtransactionsrb in transaction activerecord rc libactiverecordtransactionsrb in withtransactionreturningstatus activerecord rc libactiverecordtransactionsrb in save activerecord rc libactiverecordsuppressorrb in save activerecord rc libactiverecordpersistencerb in block in update activerecord rc libactiverecordtransactionsrb in block in withtransactionreturningstatus activerecord rc libactiverecordconnectionadaptersabstractdatabasestatementsrb in transaction activerecord rc libactiverecordtransactionsrb in transaction activerecord rc libactiverecordtransactionsrb in withtransactionreturningstatus activerecord rc libactiverecordpersistencerb in update activestorage rc libactivestorageattachedonerb in attach Please let me know if I can add any further tests or anything else Thanks for the great gem When opening the file manager overlay via the burgerbutton next to its name in the menu drag and dropreordering via the same icons before each file does not work When using the file manager outside the overlay it works fine Most probably a missing javascripthandler initialization Comfy on Rails It is useful to be able to put the CMS in a separate database and for this being able to configure the superclass of the Comfy models is necessary regardless of which mechanism of multidatabase support one chooses
