Dear author Recently I tried to use openface to do head pose estimation I met an problem which confuse me That is some pictures result value in which the persons head is more partial than others is smaller than other pictures in which the head is straight Thats weird Can you help me Thanks Describe the bug Make has errors To Reproduce followed all nonoptional steps under WikiMacinstallation Expected behavior binaries in the bin directory Screenshots see full terminal output below Desktop please complete the following information OS MacOS Mojave Version eg Compiler if compilation or linker error Additional context Terminal output in response to make CNC build dap make Scanning dependencies of target LandmarkDetector Building CXX object

code your ccnfeye model in model modeleye patchexperts ccnfpatches synthlid only have scale in and when my face small whether it will lead to the poor detection effect and whether the model scale in and can be provided Thank you very much I place two images in dir indir and execute the following commands and get different results Both gaze and AU feature are different What is the reason Many thanks bash FeatureExtraction fdir indir FaceLandmarkImg fdir indir Hi TadasBaltrusaitis Landmark failed when yawning showed below Snipaste Can I just adjust some parameters to solve this problem without retraing the pdm model thanks a lot Hello thank you for your wonderful software I am using OpenFaceOffline windows to process a video with faces One face is always in the left half and one face is always in the right half of the frame The csv it produced contains data for faceid and Is there anyway to tell which face in the video is and which is Hi Tadas Im working on the pain score Which one would be more accurate to study AUr or AUc Hello My aim is to use Kinect v RGB data to perform feature extraction from a live feed However I couldnt figure out how to give only the RGB camera of Kinect v as a device from command line since it isnt seen as a video device devvideoX on Ubuntu Im using libfreenect as the driver Thank you in advance Hello I found that FeatureExtractionexe has a negative value when performing visualization but AU should be between and and a negative value appears in the saved csv file Hi Im a newbie and have modified the FaceLandmarkVid main function slightly to view the detectedlandmarks values Im looking at taking forward some Unity integration work I have found But when I run my modified FaceLandmarkVid it provides huge values inside detectedlandmarks The code segment is below bool detectionsuccess FALSE double gdoubleArray detectionsuccess LandmarkDetectorDetectLandmarksInVideorgbimage facemodel detparameters
