 instead of What Corresponds to Swift Hi I started by using MultiPeer Connectivity directly and I have faced multiple issues concerning file exchange For instance I can send files only up to m distance between two nodes Beyond this distance file exchange is not possible Also I try sending files of different sizes ranging from KB to MB Something file exchange hangs with MB files and sometimes it works flawlessly Maybe Im doing something wrong but I could not find any paper or document giving information about the limitations etc of MPC I know it is based on Bluetooth and Wifi and thus should have the same performances as these technologies but if someone has any information about that Ill be happy to have them Thanks a lot Hi Is there any example demonstrating file exchange using PeerKit Stackoverflow is almost empty concerning PeerKit unfortunately Thanks Hey jpsim your lib is awesome but your README lacks information I created this iOS README template to help you out This would make sure that the documentation in README works as expected How does the connection between the devices work exactly Just curious I have set up PeerKit as per the example from the Cards Against app and have managed to get two devices to connect to each other However this connection is only successful of the time The other times onDisconnect is called right away Is there any reason why this is happening or am I doing something wrong Also what is the procedure to attempt a reconnection after the connection is unsuccessful Should I call transceive again after creating a new Transceiver
