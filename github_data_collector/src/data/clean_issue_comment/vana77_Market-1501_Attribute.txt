 Thanks a lot i want to label some data with attributes but i cant find propriate label tools to finish it Dear sir How can I add attribute detection to the reID code using the python language instead of running in matlab Thanks for the work I came across the original paper and it seems that only attributes are used in the APR paper but the dataset has attributes in total I tried to look through the paper and see if theres any specific reasons for it and did not managed to find any May I kindly check what are the attributes that are not used and if I am supposed to throw out those attributes when doing experiments Thank you As shown in following picture the label indicates that the person doesnt have a bag But it seems that the person has a bag The age seems like adult instead of teenager The upperbody clothing seems like pink instead of white I found two images were inappropriately labeled The color differences are calculated by CIEDE RGB value standards are according to Wikipedia I randomly picked a x area and got the mean RGB value followed by converting to L A B space RGBPink RGBPurple RGBYellow in boundingboxtrain or in marketattributetrain It was labeled as downpink My results dePink dePurple in boundingboxtest or in marketattributetest It was labeled as upyellow My results deYellow dePurple Values were different according to the picked area but the differences were significantly large
