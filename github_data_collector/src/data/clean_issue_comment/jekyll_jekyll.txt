In order to avoid having to install and recompile all gems on each push we could cache the dependencies using actioncache cc jekyllbuild I updated to the latest githubpages I ran bundle exec jekyll doctor to check my configuration I read the contributing document at My Environment Software Versions Operating System OSX C jekyll githubpages Latest Expected Behaviour I had a post with a Unicode Tamil filename md I expected the generated permalink to include all the letters and combining marks while converting spaces to hyphens Specifically I expected the generated filename to be html Current Behavior Instead it generated something like html breaking up words in unexpected places I looked at the code and in jekyll libjekyllutilsrb I found replacecharactersequencewithhyphen which replaces alnum with The problem is that there many Unicode lettermark codepoints that dont match alnum in my specific case U BCD It turns out that the Alphabetic Unicode property only applies to some of what wed want to consider LettersMarks Instead the recommendation I got on SO was to use Unicode categories My suggested fix would be to change the Regex to match pM pL pNd My Environment Software Versions Operating System LinuxDebian jekyll Latest githubpages No Expected Behaviour No BOM warning is produced when files are read Current Behavior When using encoding ISO in configyml the following errors occur when building a jekyll site once for every time a file is read vendorbundleruby gemsjekyll libjekyllconvertiblerb warning BOM with nonUTF encoding ISO is nonsense vendorbundleruby gemsjekyll libjekylltagsincluderb warning BOM with nonUTF encoding ISO is nonsense Inserting puts filereadoptscontext on line of includerb shows encodingbomISO Hardcoding the second argument to Fileread to be encodingISO fixes the warning Im not sure where the bom bit is coming from or whether Fileread ought to be happy with it being there but that appears to be the source of the problem Sorry I wish I could use utf encoding too smile This is a bug fix No unittests Summary Since LiquidTemplates are now cached ensure that every render starts with a clean context Context Resolves This is a feature or enhancement Summary Proofofconcept Warn a user if theres an existing instance being served already Context Resolves cc hoenix In case you want to take this for a testrun ruby gem jekyll git ref refspull head Motivation Following your instruction on Debian doesnt work Here the detailed explanation Suggestion Update your instructions in order to allow Debian users to install Jekyll In detail remove the installation of Ruby from the repository and instead curl sSL bash s stable restart the shell rvm install Added a step to the macOS documentation that explains how to edit your bashprofile file Thought it might help some newer users out Thanks for creating a Pull Request Before you submit please make sure youve done the following I read the contributing document at Make our lives easier Choose one of the following by uncommenting it This is a bug fix This is a feature or enhancement This is a documentation change Before you submit this pull request make sure to have a look at the following checklist If you dont know how to do some of these thats fine Submit your pull request and we will help you out on the way Ive added tests if its a bug feature or enhancement Ive adjusted the documentation if its a feature or enhancement The test suite passes locally run scriptcibuild to verify this Summary Provide a description of what your pull request changes A short change to the macOS documentation page that explains how to edit your shell config file Previously it said Add the brew ruby path to your shell config now in addition it suggests using sudo nano bashprofile to edit the file This was admittedly a stumbling block for me so I thought adding it might help other users out I found someone else who mentioned this being a stumbling block to using Jekyll as well Hopefully this is helpful Context Is this related to any GitHub issues You can use keywords to automatically close the related issue For example all of the following will close issue when your PR is merged Closes Fixes Resolves Use any one of the above as applicable Jekyll markdown export from Github Its supposed to show a table of chords for the ukulele which are defined using only numbers formatted as italic bold and strikethrough besides the standard format in the markdown should render as thus in the HTML output created by Jekyll as td del del del deltd But the output is this td del del td rendering as td del del td Summary Situation User is trying to do a production build passing in environment JEKYLLENVproduction bundle exec jekyll build BUT the user also has a development server running say in VSCode from a week ago Observed Behavior Jekyll will do the build but it will prefer the development servers environment instead of the environment variable being passed in Motivation This happened to me on a side project and it was very frustrating I didnt have any optics around why the system wasnt behaving as I would expect it to it just felt like broken software I imagine that beginners are the folks most likely to get burned by this as they pull up some development server as per the docs and then try to do a production build in a different tab DoItForTheBeginners Referencelevel explanation Preferred Behavior If a user attempts to run a jekyll build and we observe that in their system they also have a running development server then it should give a warning of some sort that declares that they are clobbering the environment and that they should go turn off the development server perhaps with a tip like You can see if you have a local development server running with a command like netstat vanp tcp grep An implementation could work if we create a lockfile of some sort when the development server is running Drawbacks Time money Hi Thanks for considering to file a bug with Jekyll Please take the time to answer the basic questions Please try to be as detailed as possible If you are unsure this is a bug in Jekyll or this is a bug caused by a plugin that isnt directly related to Jekyll or if this is just a generic usage question please consider asking your question at where nonbug questions go Thanks Make sure that youve done all of these If youre sure that the bug youre reporting is only apparent in a previous version of Jekyll please say so explicitly in your description I updated to the latest Jekyll or if on GitHub Pages to the latest githubpages I ran jekyll doctor to check my configuration I read the contributing document at My Environment Replace the values in the Versions column with the ones in your build If youre not using githubpages just replace it with No Software Versions Operating System win jekyll githubpages Latest Expected Behaviour Jekyll cant render a formula properly which contains such as a b It should be like this under normal conditoins But Its like this in Jekyll What is it you expected to happen This should be a description of how the functionality you tried to use is supposed to work Current Behavior Describe the details of the bug Be sure to include any steps you took for the problem to exist such as the directories you created and the full command you ran Include any plugins you have installed this is very important You can include any logs you think relevant here If youre using GitHub pages and youre not sure where your logs are please email supportgithubcom and they will happily help you I create a new environment by jekyll new envir and then I just change the default markdown file welcometojekyllmarkdownin the post to layout post title Welcome to Jekyll date categories jekyll update script src typetextjavascriptscript script typetextxmathjaxconfig MathJaxHubConfig tex jax skipTags script noscript style textarea pre displayMath inlineMath script yaxb ab mathbfTij mathbfTji a b And it looks like this in chrome But It works in other markdown editors like Markdown Preview Enhanced in VScode which also use Mathjax So It should not be caused by Mathjax I aslo tried on the githubpages and its the same problem
