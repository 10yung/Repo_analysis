Continuing from IRC Im currently using the following highlighting configuration in prezto zstyle preztomodulesyntaxhighlighting highlighters main brackets pattern line zstyle preztomodulesyntaxhighlighting styles line bold The latter line makes the whole input line stand out by making it bold Is such a thing possible with fastsyntaxhighlighting When selecting text in the Zsh vimode or pasting text reverse styling is used If possible I would like a configuration option to not use reverse styling and instead be able to set the fg and bg Here is a screenshot of how it looks currently img width altScreen Shot at pm src I would like to be able to configure it with colors something like this img width altScreen Shot at pm src When highlighting this text with the default theme zsh zsh i c cat etcshells grep x linebuffered i binzsh I get this img width altScreen Shot at pm src It seems the second last character should be yellow but it is not If I put a space between the single and double quotes it highlights correctly img width altScreen Shot at pm src FSH ab Emulator macOS Terminal also iTerm inside and outside Tmux Zsh Using Ohmyzsh I would like to make comments italic to match the theme I have in Vim eg comment blueitalic Currently it seems like it is not supported as I get cannot parse style comment unknown color or style element italic Would love if this could be added When I have multiple colors on the same command I just want to know which is which This would save me a lot of time If you could also support named colors and hsla as I see myself transitioning to using those whenever I can Here an example of what I mean I mean that in the second case the parentheses should not light up green but be treated as regular code Another example would be this where I would expect red color for the first curly brace since it is not a command This might be a known issue but I only found one mention in the issues which might even be unrelated I didnt dig in deep if it was only about the command afterwards being treated as command This also talks about performance issues which might be the reason the cases are not working as expected Commit ab ef b b cdf c f ec a current master In a simple git alias case ex cicommit the chroma works as expected but in one that includes an argument its looking for it doesnt seem to do so ex cmcommit s m In this particular example the quoted string following cm isnt highlighted as a message being passed to commit s m paraphrasing the issue posted by Eras in zshuserszshsyntaxhighlighting Steps to reproduce enter hello hello to prompt press W W both hellos are removed press Y and witness one hello coming back Expected behavior hello hello would come back works if zshsyntaxhighlighting is not enabled The issue was fixed in zshuserszshsyntaxhighlighting see I have been using fastsyntaxhighlighting for a month now and today I saw some problems Image Image In this example we got problems then keyword half colored with another color also happens sometimes with the do keyword Inconsistency of l color Inconsistency of ls color The second closing bracket yellow instead of green Image While trying to replicate the previous example this character got highlighted when my cursor stays on the place at the right looks very weird Can this be caused by something else Hi I have a rather curious bug That only occurs if I load fastsyntaxhighlighting with omz I cloned fastsyntaxhighlighting to HOMEohmyzshcustompluginsfastsyntaxhighlightingfastsyntaxhighlightingpluginzsh Steps to reproduce expected behavior quit every man zsh df source HOMEohmyzshcustompluginsfastsyntaxhighlightingfastsyntaxhighlightingpluginzsh man vim echo foo foo man vi Press arrow up Result man vi Press arrow up Result echo foo Steps to reproduce unexpected behaviorbug quit every man zsh df pluginsfastsyntaxhighlighting ZSHHOMEohmyzsh ZSHCUSTOMHOMEohmyzshcustom source ZSHohmyzshsh man vim echo foo foo man vi Press arrow up Result man vi Press arrow up Result man vim
