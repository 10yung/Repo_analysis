i want to know where can get the standard answer about those task In the BP formulation the xL should be xL and other formulations have the same problem The corresponding formulation in the matconvnet manual is right I want to train the vggvd model from scratch which parameter initialization method should I choose gaussian or xavier or xavierimproved For example in exercise why you compute dzdx as follows dzdx singleresx pos sumpos singleresx neg sumneg In other words how to obtain the initial project tensor p in practice hi in part there is a calculation of dzdxempirical can somone help and explain the calculation why is there a sum and why is there a division by eta and not a division by etxex as i expected to be thanks Check the derivative numerically ex randnsizex single eta xp x eta ex yp vlnnconvxp w dzdxempirical sumdzdy yp y eta dzdxcomputed sumdzdx ex fprintf der empirical f computed f error f n dzdxempirical dzdxcomputed abs dzdxempiricaldzdxcomputed Propose to add some titles to the images to be more clear what is what Propose to add some pauses to that it would be possible to view the results step by step less overwhelming Each time exercise is run the results are different Figure headings are st time bell pepper score nd time bell pepper score rd time balloon score varying answers after that There is no change by setting vlsimplenn options to disableDropout true the results still vary This is on a Ubuntu Matlab R a with gcc There are no compiler warnings when setup is run with default options When exercise is run on a Mac Powerbook with Matlab R a it is stable Results are the same every time Hello I am trying to segment medical image using softmaxloss which refer to vlnnloss I can segment my image using this example But when I use softmaxloss layer removing the last layer forward and backward pass as follows remove this net addCustomLossLayernet l LossForward l LossBackward add this netlayersend struct name loss type softmaxloss But my objective function generate error I couldnt figure out what else I should do to make this work with softmaxlossvlnnloss instead of regression I will appreciate any kind of help output Sincerely Hosna Specifically to the questions in the practicals Thanks I downloaded the files and everything but Ive had trouble getting VLFeat to work In particular its suggest to do Set the current directory to the practical base directory From Bash Run extrasdownloadsh This will download the imagenetvggverydeep mat model as well as a binary copy of the VLFeat library and a copy of MatConvNet Run extragenfontssh This will download the Google Fonts and extract them as PNG files Run extragenstringsh This will create datasentencelatopng From MATLAB run addpath extra packFonts This will create datacharsdbmat Test the practical from MATLAB run all the exercises in order but it doesnt quite work because extra is not defined or anywhere to be found Whats going on in particular I am trying to do Visualize the output y figure clf vlimarrayscy colormap gray of the tutorial but matlab throws errors Thanks
