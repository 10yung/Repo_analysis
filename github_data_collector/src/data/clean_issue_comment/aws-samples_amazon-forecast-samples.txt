Hello I wasnt sure where to ask this since its more of a question than an issue Would text based data work with AWS Forecast For example we have orders that have names and the size of the order can likely be predicted based on the name of the order If were trying to forecast the size of the orders would Forecast be able to use the name field outofthebox as part of the forecasting algorithm I hope that makes sense and if im asking in the wrong place please let me know where a more appropriate forum is Thanks in advance bp Issue if available Description of changes By submitting this pull request I confirm that you can use modify copy and redistribute this contribution under the terms of your choice Hello I am getting this issue when I run line in notebook predictorarn predictorArn NameError Traceback most recent call last ipythoninput e f e c d in module predictorarn predictorArn NameError name predictorArn is not defined I am running the notebook in jupyterlab in AWS Sagemaker Please let me know if I am missing something I didnt see the above var any where in your code I skipped over this line and was able to complete the lab I dont see that its being used anywhere Might not be needed Thanks for the help Dan Is there any reason to keep the legacy SDK content in the repo now Using a dataset with item metadata illustrate how to predict cold start items in a notebook Create a notebook that illustrates how to include metadata for related time series information to perform a what if analysis Create a notebook that showcases the impact of building with HPO enabled Create a notebook showcasing the impact of including Holidays with DeepAR Create a notebook that deploys a predictor and generates a forecast using AutoML and compare its impact to previously generated models Identify a timeseries oriented dataset with the following types of information Target Time Series Related Time Series Item Metadata These will be used in other notebooks to illustrate their impact and usage with various algorithms
