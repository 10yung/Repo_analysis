Related to To trim down the amount of serialized data and make the dump more readable add support for using datadebugInfo when it is available This will greatly speed up serializer when serializing objects with debugInfo greatly speed up GUI as there is far less data to be downloaded and processed greatly improve readability as objects do not have redundant dumped data We currently have some routing use SubDomain Routing features and we found out clockwork is not working for this setup Hopefully clockwork can support it Thanks This pull request fixes Data returned by serializer was corrupted for deeply nested structures Instead of cutting down the data raw data was returned instead Im using type but this can be changed I get this error when installing clockwork on lumen All I did was installing via composer and adding this line appregisterClockwork Support Lumen ClockworkServiceProviderclass And the error Unresolvable dependency resolving Parameter required app in class Illuminate Redis RedisManager I thought issue was related but when I try its fix I get another error Call to undefined method RedisenableEvents So I dont really know what I should do Laravel Framework Lumen Laravel Components As you might know monologmonolog has been released a while ago and as a developer we want our projects to be uptodate with those latest packages updates Sadly itsgoingdclockwork loses compatibility when upgrade to monologmonolog because there is a missing void type hint on ClockworkHandler Now applying this return type would mean a major version bump of itsgoingdclockwork since we would break compatibility with PHP x Is this something we can do No longer support older PHP versions Since PHP x has reached its endoflife I would consider this an okay upgrade for this library What are your thoughts on this Just finished installing clockwork in my projects and looks like it doesnt work for me I keep getting memory errors at line of FileStorage data jsonencoderequesttoArray JSONPARTIALOUTPUTONERROR Running PHP Laravel Vagrant machine MB memory I get no connection column in clockwork v laravel Since we now apply the stack trace filters in serializer we dont have the correct stack trace when we collect the basic fileline info Hotfixed so we do trace serialization first but now we dont have the fileline info at all when the stack traces are disabled in config The trace option when logging messages also doesnt do anything right now like this I install clockwork to my project but the WEB UI doesnt work It can be open in chrome but cant loading all js and css file Am I missing something php laravelframework itsgoingdclockwork composer require itsgoingdclockwork successfully
