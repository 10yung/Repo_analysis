typeahead example Problem description defaultHighlightIndex is useful for allowing users to quickly select the first suggestion in a typeahead just by pressing enter However we found that it has an unfortunate sideeffect of preventing form submission on enter when there are no items in the suggestions list ie when the user is trying to enter something thats not part of the suggestions list Heres a slightly modified version of the typeahead example that changes the outer div to a form with a submit handler to help demonstrate the issue First try removing defaultHighlightedIndex and typing in or anything else that causes the suggestions list to become empty and then pressing enter Youll see the notsubmitted text at the top of the page turn into submitted which is triggered by the custom onSubmit handler on the form Then try adding defaultHighlightedIndex back in and doing the same Youll see that notsubmitted remains unchanged meaning the onSubmit was never called Suggested solution I opened a PR a while ago that has a solution to this but there are some outstanding issues with the tests and I ended up finding a conflicting test case and am unsure how to move forward Would love to hear some thoughts on how this should be resolved Thanks Thanks for your interest in the project Bugs filed and PRs submitted are appreciated Please make sure that you are familiar with and follow the

free to add additional comments Fixes For instance Merge getA yStatusMessage as we have two different implementations Merge id generation for slots as we have implementations downshift reachUi Other code improvements as well They provide confidence but I think they can be written a bit better Maybe will also be fixed as a side effect Have prop that will make useCombobox behave as an autocomplete with inline selection This means that when the user types a string in the input once a value is highlighted in the list the rest of the item string is added in the input That rest part should be visually highlighted and selected Pattern number Example number downshift version node version npm or yarn version Relevant code or config See the links below What you did Im working on a dropdown select component that has an input field inside the dropdown for filtering My current solution is something like a custom button that opens a portal with useCombobox that has the menu always open Kind hacky and not fully accessible Also suffers from What happened I spent some time to figure out how I can use useSelect or useCombobox to achieve implement the feature but wasnt able to get it working Other options I tried Normally use useSelect and place custom filtering input inside But it seems not possible to make it work because the menu gets closed the moment you click on the input Latest attempts here Use useCombobox but move the input inside the menu In that case filtering doesnt work and a y is broken Reproduction repository See the links above Problem description Not really a problem I guess rather a feature request Because existing hooks do not provide that flexibility Suggested solution Anyone else tried to do something similar Is it a common patter at all Id appreciate any suggestions
