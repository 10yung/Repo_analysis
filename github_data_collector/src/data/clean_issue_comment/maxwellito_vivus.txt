Im having some trouble with the animate fill hack When using the hack with scenario and dataduration the finished class is also delayed and I cant control this delay JS new Vivus back type scenario function obj objelclassListaddfinished HTMLSVG path dataduration datastart path See example here Vivus version Vivus Instant Browser Chrome Steps to reproduce it Use an SVG with sharp angle produced from Illustrator in Vivus Reproduced Issue Note the top left corner of the leftmost part of the U and youll see the break in the corner I might be just missing something but I couldnt find anywhere how to make a more compliant SVG or a setting to pass into Vivus Thank you for making something so awesome for everyone to use Screen Shot at PM After animating with vivus some lines appear to be thicker than others When i disable the plugin or watch it in firefox Everything looks normal For a problem please fill the following Vivus version current Browser Chrome MacOSX Steps to reproduce it Open attachement and put it into an object and animate it Screenshot Bildschirmfoto um Fileszip Hi now we have many monitors with many refresh rates going up to hz and beyond Ive made some icons and the animations on them runs faster on hz monitor than on hz Will it be possible to limit FPS by skipping frames if there are more than desired value eg It could be done like this Desired fps could be provided in vivus object options Please define your problem or issue as clear as possible For a problem please fill the following Vivus version all Browser all Steps to reproduce it A standard fill wont get animated but Convert the fill to a pathbased pattern easy see below and see the jsFiddle and it will be nicely animated by Vivus note although changing the fill method is relatively easily done enough by hand vivus has the capability to be used by regular people not SVG experts for whom this task is really too much This capability could be added to vivus to automatically do the conversion for them see JSFiddle and below for what is involved JSFiddle link or similar platform No personal website will be allowed only sandboxed platform where the code is isolated and can be hacked note I apologize for not doing the parsing code to make this automatic in vivus Im not a programmer but a total hack and Id probably screw everything up I just kind of fell into this solution and thought it worth sharing To do it all you need is to change the fill to work like so pattern idpathFill patternUnitsuserSpaceOnUse width height path stroke fill color dM l strokewidth pattern path fillurlpathFill just add this code and put a variable in there for fill color Pattern notes I used a pattern height of but if set to something big like the animation will be one long fill instead of looking like closing blinds I used a pattern width of but it doesnt matter so long as the path stroke origin is half of the width and the strokewidth must be the same as the pattern width or more Perhaps a wider width will be easier on the browser like width dM strokewidth I dont know Just a thought Combinations of pattern sizes and path stroke definitions create some pretty cool patterns plaid for example if you wanted that or diamonds or dots Not sure how useful this is but there it is note When a Vivus element is in a scroll container using overflow auto it will not appear because isInViewport uses document as the only possible scroll container This could be solved by allowing the settings object to specify a scrollContext for the SVG or maybe allowing an option to disable isInViewport check Hello Maxwellito First thanks for your lib it works well and thats nice I was playing around with some SVG when i found a path element in some random SVG used only to fill areas the stroke attribute was set to none This is breaking the animation when the oneByOne option is used because you have to wait for the invisible path to finish before going on I made a very simple modification to remove paths that have stroke set to none Do you think it would be interesting to add this I can make a PR if you want javascript Vivusprototypemapping function var i paths path pAttrs pathObj totalLength lengthMeter timePoint timePoint totalLength lengthMeter paths thiselquerySelectorAllpath START Added part var cleanPaths for i i pathslength i path paths i ifpathgetAttributestroke none continue cleanPathspushpath paths cleanPaths END Added part for i i pathslength i path paths i pathObj el path length MathceilpathgetTotalLength
