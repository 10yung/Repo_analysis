This will allow us to provide a single module instead of have code splitting separation To really use this build it requires you to directly use the output build from the lib directory If developers who uses TypeScript plans to use this package by importing it they cannot use it since the types for indexdts and indexts do not match eg the init function is missing from the definitions Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe It seems that to use this project with a webpack build the built and minified script libindigoplayerjs needs to be loaded with scriptloader or just added as a script tag Describe the solution youd like It would be nice to be able to import indigoplayer as an ES module to gain typings avoiding using the global and integrate into our normal chunk lazyloading workflow eg import IndigoPlayer from indigoplayer IndigoPlayerinit Currently this generates a lot of TypeScript errors for me TS tsc nodemodulesindigoplayersrctypests error TS create which lacks returntype annotation implicitly has an any return type tsc nodemodulesindigoplayersrctypests error TS on which lacks returntype annotation implicitly has an any return type tsc nodemodulesindigoplayersrctypests error TS once which lacks returntype annotation implicitly has an any return type Happy to help work on this or provide more info if its unclear Thanks for building amazing playerThis is not issue Just a question Is there any way to leverage HLSjs API through indigo player I want to do some xhrsetup for my video If it is possible then question arises first how can I do that and second is what happens on ios devices because hlsjs is not needed on ios devices for your player I added buttons to the ui that allow you to quickly move forward or backward in the video like the video player on ios I updated the doc with the information I also added the French language Just one thing I couldnt update the icon typography so I put icons by default Description Provide a npm module that exposes a Player component for React Idea import Player from indigoplayerreact currently not available this is merely an idea Code sample javascript import React useRef useEffect from react import PropTypes from proptypes import IndigoPlayer from indigoplayer const CHUNKSPATH IndigoPlayerVERSION lib export default function Player config chunksPath const container useRefnull useEffect IndigoPlayersetChunksPathchunksPath chunksPath useEffect const player IndigoPlayerinitcontainercurrent config return playerdestroy config return div refcontainer PlayerpropTypes config PropTypesshapeisRequired chunksPath PropTypesstring PlayerdefaultProps config undefined chunksPath CHUNKSPATH x Proper cleanup when playerdestroy is called Find a proper way to expose the player API which is returned by IndigoPlayerinit Im not convinced about the IndigoPlayersetChunksPath implementation for libraries Chunks never really worked outofthebox when including an npm lib The following file contains all currently available translations Id like to have some help supporting different languages feel free to submit a PR with a translation in your language of choice First off great job on getting this out Love it A few quick notes Keyboardonly navigation didnt seem possible on the demo You might consider a new method for hidingshowing controls eg add tabindex to the outer element and then consider handling focus You probably should add proper ARIA attributes to ensure screen reader support Buttons should have typebutton to avoid accidental submit behavior
