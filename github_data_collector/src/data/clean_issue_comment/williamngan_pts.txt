Ie Render in a child canvas but bind events to parent div This would allow for easily overlaying the canvas with interactive dom elements Hi I noticed that an object of the Circle class is implemented as a Group of two points the center x y and a pair of the radius r r This works fine but Group methods like rotate D shear D moveTo etc dont do anymore what their name suggests except scaling from the center The same holds for the Curve and Line classes I think This could lead to confusion when trying to for example shear a circle The best solution that I can think of is to move those transformation methods to the Polygon class since thats the context in which they do work as intended Perhaps some methods that also work easily on circles like moveTo and scale could then be added to the Circle class Hello Im using Pts version with npm Im trying to use the Types PtsCanvasRenderingContext D as I want to clip an image under a Curvebspline However even after reading the documentation I dont quite understand how to use Types Ive noticed though that the Typesjs file under my nodemodules is empty except the license comments Would you have more information about this Thanks In the first example of the animation guide it is stated that every beat the squares color changes and every beats the circles color changes and the rotation completes once But this is not what actually happens in the shown example since every beat the squares color stays the same only the number inside the square changes and every beats the color of both the square and circle change and the rotation completes The comments in the code do describe the correct behaviour So the text has to change a little bit to match the example code or vice versa I have an error when adding tempo to the space like it is described in the guide Add tempo instance as a player to track animation spaceadd tempo ERROR Argument of type Tempo is not assignable to parameter of type IPlayer AnimateCallbackFn Type Tempo is not assignable to type AnimateCallbackFn Type Tempo provides no match for the signature time number frameTime number currentSpace any void Fixed by adding implement IPlayer to Tempo Class and changing the animate property to public dont know if its the right way to go but it works I was trying out multiple forms in HTML space I had form for drawing circles and form for drawing text This resulted in the text being placed in the circles or the circles around the text depending on the order of operations since both forms start counting with the same kind of domID from So the first text and first circle have the same ID and hence get placed in the same HTML element and thus also at the same location This is a bug and not a feature right Maybe something like a formID can be added such that forms dont interfere with each other For example formfont formtext doesnt apply the font options to the text and something like formctxstyle fontfamily Arial has to be used I suppose this can be solved pretty easily by setting the context style accordingly every time formfont gets called I also noticed that fontvariant is not an option when setting a font is this intentional since there are otherwise too many arguments or forgotten by accident Maybe in this case passing an options object instead of multiple arguments would be a good idea since there are so many optional arguments and it can also be hard to remember the order in which they have to be supplied What do you think williamngan Im happy to help with a pull request if you want Currently once a style is applied to one element it will get applied to all elements as stored in a single ctxstyle object Theres a reset function but its not consistent with the default We should also allow user to set their own default options add link sound and other features callout mobile homepage should have links before the fold Also update READMEmd Very cool library Im having a blast playing with it and am really admiring the attention to detail and API UX I had one question about the Utilssplit function When called like this js Utilssplit true with loopback set to true I would expect the last element of the returned array to be NOT Is this an accurate expectation on my end Or am I misunderstanding something
