Currently invalidated cells are indicated by an X but the invalid cell output stays unchanged This is confusing to the user ideally invalid cell output should be more obviously deemphasized eg greyedout semitransparent Barring that the invalid output should probably be cleared JupyterLab is the nextgeneration frontend for Jupyter and has a more modern extension framework This should be possible to achieve better frontend integration for Nodebook See also Issue Amazing work thanks for sharing Ive been thinking about something similar but nodebook is an interesting alternative and it demonstrates how to invalidate cells in jupyter Heres one detail that could be perhaps improved Consider the following cells a a a printa Now proceed as following Evaluate all cells The last one prints Delete the second cell Evaluate the last cell It still prints If instead of deleting the cell one commentsout its contents the behavior is as expected the last two cells are invalidated and upon evaluation is printed Would it be possible to do the same upon deletion I guess that it might be tricky because of Jupyters undo functionality The license states that it should be packaged in all distributions of the package but it is not packaged in the pypi releases I only realized this because I am in the process of packaging nodebook for conda forge
