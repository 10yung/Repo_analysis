In old versions of iOS EPSignature is working properly but in iOS the view controller appears like a popup and you cant draw anything because the finger movement closes the view I integrated EPSignature into Xcode project using Carthage and I received an error below Skipped building EPSignature due to the error Dependency EPSignature has no shared framework schemes for any of the platforms iOS signature can be exported as svg format Update project to adopt the recommended build settings in Xcode Update Travis configuration to use Xcode Update project to support Swift Unable to view signature in Xcode and ios or above Please upgrade to frame work to swift compatible I want to show my custom images in the place of delete done buttons in navigationItem How can I achieve this Newest version do not compile with swift and Xcode after couple of renames works fine Added EPSignatureTests to the EPSignature scheme test action to fix the Travis failure Credit to Victor for the issue fix
