 In the implementation of chanselect it first checks every channel to see if it can recvsend After that it randomly select one and do the recvsend What about if a channel can recvsend while checking but cannnot when really do it It seems the chanselect will block it would be great if there was a size param so this library can be dropin replaced with a compatible api for passing messages between processes I written a test which compares the number of transfered messages per millisec to the number of threads Im using a similar test for the lockfree iqueue The file is located at Id appreciate it if you would integrate it Currently chan provides chansend to send data by void argument But someone may want to send intlongdoublechar etc How do you think And I worry about someone may mistake to use chan and argument pointer For example c char buf while chanisclosedc if condition strcpybuf doA else strcpybuf doB chansendc p If the chan is possible to do buffering the buf will be overwritten It need to allocation new memory for each sending My suggestion is adding new function like below c chansendstringc buf chanrecvstringc chansendintc chanrecvintc chansenddoublec chanrecvdoublec This functions allocate new memory for the types chanrecvint chanrecvdouble is possible to free the memory automatically chanrecvstring will be required to free memory by developers chanselect currently only supports nonblocking selects It should also support blocking selects maybe by passing in a flag
