This helps Hello I am trying to implement retrying logic when connectionio failure occurs The request method takes OptionVecu which means I cant pass body as it has moved again unless I clone it Can passing body by reference be supported Thx I have added support for following two features Specifying custom https port new method to build ssl context by passing ca file cert and private key Hi Ive been trying to update solicit to support rustopenssl and Im almost there The last issue is to implement trysplit for SslStreamTcpStream but the underlying method tryclone for SslStream was deprecated in rustopenssl Has anybody else tried to update this One option is to go with ArcMutex but Id like to know is there any simpler solution here Ping jwilm etal I am new to Rust and I dont understand how to run a simple https server The simple server example is currently http only right otherwise it is not possible to implement SessionState asynchronous server must not block in rxrecvframe so handlenextframe is not suitable for asynchronous server The workaround this limitation is to implement ReceiveFrame which produces one previously read frame but making handleframe public is more straightforward convert RawFramea into RawFramestatic Whole TransportStream is not needed It is problem because for example connsendnextdata cannot be easily called with Vecu argument which implements Write but not TransportStream Try to keep the server example in sync with the latest implementation started this effort but only for the client example
