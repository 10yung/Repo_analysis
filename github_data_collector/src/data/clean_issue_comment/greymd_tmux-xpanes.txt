Reported in The session file is automatically deleted when tmux session is detached I imagine it must be helpful for users if the session file is kept in that case Because in a common case the user does not recognize the possibility that the session is better to be kept alive when opening the new windows How to reproduce Create session from outside of tmux session sh xpanes ssh localhost Detach the session ctrlb and d by default Session is alive but session file is deleted ps alx grep tmux polls Ss tmux S homeubuntucachexpanessocket newsession s xpanes n tmp d usrbinxpanes ssh c ssh o StrictHostKeyCheckingno localhost ls homeubuntucachexpanessocket ls cannot access homeubuntucachexpanessocket No such file or directory Technical reason This is caused by this trap bash x xpanes c ssh localhost localhost readonly XPSHELLusrbinenv bash tmux S homeubuntucachexpanessocket attachsession t xpanes detached from session xpanes exit rm f homeubuntucachexpanesxpns rm f homeubuntucachexpanessocket The temporal session file cachexpanessocketPID is supposed to be used to recover the session So the file may be kept in case of network disconnection or any other troubles On the other hand the file is going to be deleted if the tmux session is explicitly exited because any recovery wont be required However tmux also makes its own process exit when detaching ctrlb d As far as investigated there is no way for xpanes to confirm whether the session is explicitly exited or detached This is the reason why xpanes deletes the session file Hi greymd Firstly thank you for this amazing piece of kit Ive made a tool built on xpanes that really helped my research htop cluster Ive found myself building another tool using xpanes This time I needed to run an alias command on each of the servers in the cluster which I ssh into on xpanes Similar to the tool mentioned earlier just with an alias instead of htop I eventually figured out how this needs to be done from following the instructions here The following is a snippet from my Python script python Make ha partition hosts mscluster mscluster procedurely ha for i in range ha msclusterstri run xpanes C t c ssh abank t bash ci atmrun ha systemrun The t bash ci atmrun allows me to execute my alias atmrun in each of the panes corresponding to each node in the cluster I know there shouldnt be instructions for ssh options in these docs but it seems to me like it would be beneficial to have this as one of the examples in the docs At the very least this issue will remind me of how to do this in the future yum All the best Thanks for this software It is so cool Actually very useful I did not now about its existence it works so great I combine it with synchronized panes and it is wonderful Sorry I know issues are not always for random comments like this one If we dont close this issue can people share the use cases for what you guys use it ZZC ad Here is my rough idea New feature called alias feature Any feedbacks is welcome For now xpanes has following problems Users cannot set panes title provided by t individualy Redefine xpanes with builtin alias is lazy Many escaping ie alias prodserversxpanes c ssh i key user server i key user server Alias feature would solve above problems Creating file It would be TSV YAML or JSON HOMEconfigtmuxxpanesaliasesprodserversyaml yaml cmd ssh server title server cmd ssh server title server cmd ssh server title server cmd ssh server title server Execute with alias A Alias name xpanes A prodservers Result ssh server ssh server server server ssh server ssh server server server Hey greymd in my workflow as it pertains to tmuxxpanes I use what I call schemes For example I have an iTerm profile called XPPackages that executes this script after login HOMEconfigtmuxxpanesschemesbash pkgmgnt bash function pkgmgnt title Package management xpanes t d l t c title gems gem outdated title macports port outdated title yarn global yarn global upgradeinteractive title composer global composer global outdated Would it be possible to build in such a feature
