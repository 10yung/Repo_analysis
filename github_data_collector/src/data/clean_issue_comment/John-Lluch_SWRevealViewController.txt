I get this issue installing one signal I have all my code set up for SWRevealViewController it worked perfectly fine on Xcode and even on Xcode beta but for some reason its not working on the recent update release from the App Store and I end up getting this error Thread EXCBADACCESS code address x at the app delegate screen after I toggle with my SWRevealView Controller any ideas how I could get this fixed Ive used this control for many years now Using Xcode beta on iOS simulator I assert and crash in SWRevealViews statusBarView method at line if object respondsToSelectorNSSelectorFromStringkey statusBar object valueForKeykey Assertion failure in UIApplication createStatusBarWithRequestedStyleorientationhidden BuildRootLibraryCachescomapplexbsSourcesUIKitCoreSimUIKit UIApplicationm Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInternalInconsistencyException reason App called statusBar or statusBarWindow on UIApplication this code must be changed as theres no longer a status bar or status bar window Use the statusBarManager object on the window scene instead Anyone have a fork with a fix Hello Ive been using swRevealVC for quite a bit in my iPhone app and it works great I am now trying to port it to iPad and would like to show both viewcontroller front and left in full size sidebyside basically like the email app see attached picture IMG When ever I show both VC simultaneously with SWRevealVC it moves the front controller out of the way and thus hides a section of that front VC content as the front VC has to move away to reveal the rear VC Is there a way to get both VCs views in full screen displayed at the same time or will I need to look at using a splitView I understand that the drawer effect requires the front view to move away but I was wondering if by using some of the settings rearViewRevealWidth or rearViewRevealOverDraw there would be a way to achieve the desired effect Thanks for the help Please update cocoa pod version to Thanks At some point along the way Apple added a pauseInteractiveTransition method to the UIViewControllerContextTransitioning protocol Doesnt seem to hurt anything that its missing but just to fix the warning Upgrade to Xcode and Syntax warnings were corrected Hi When I open the side menu everything in the front view controller class become nil
