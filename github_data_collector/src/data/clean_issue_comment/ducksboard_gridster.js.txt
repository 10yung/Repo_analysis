time to open an issue If you want a responsive gridster you can try this function girdsterResize use the resizewidgetdimensions method the variable baseDiemensionWidth is measured by yourself according to the container of gridster gridsterObjresizewidgetdimensions widgetbasedimensions baseDiemensionWidth I found this answer from the Issues but I also found it not work when I change to another router i am using Angular to do a SPA After I debug my programmer i found the solution to resolve this question At the source code of jquerygridsterjs the method addstyletag has an if statement if documentgetElementByIdcssID Gridsterjs create the style and insert into the headif you change to another router the statement always be false By remove the element which has ID called cssID before the statement I realize a responsive gridster cssIDremove I am using Gridster v Recently I am facing one problem that while dragging the widgets the dragged widget gets overlapped on the widget that exists on that coordinates Below I have attached the GIF for better understanding Gridster Overlapping GIF Adding the code for creating Gridster gridster GDashboard ulgridster namespace

datagridster Hi I recently encountered such a problem When I move widget to right or left sometimes it will overlap some other widget specially when the other widget is at the far right or left If there are many widgets in the dashboard the probability of this happening will increase greatly Thanks for any suggestions or solutions Im using Gridster v for my web site and i need to add lot of widgets with addwidget command While adding multiple gridster instances on the same page page loads forever or hang during page load Tested it on both Chrome Firefox browser and issue exits Tried the solution provided here But it doest work Any ideas how to fix this problem Heres my code var gridster fori i i gridster i gridster ulgridigridster widgetbasedimensions widgetmargins shiftwidgetsup

appear when responsive layouts are dragged Im trying to use a fontawesome class as handleclass this classes have the format fas fa somename and it seems that breaks the resizing I believe it has something to do with the fact that a class with the same name of the one you specify as handleclass both is added to the span and in this case what is doing is generating is a span with this class attribute fas faexpandarrowsalt fas faexpandarrowsaltboth Hi I have created a resizable layout using gridster and it saves on change so for example my current configuration is widget base margin and one item Page section only with sizex sizey row col Now lets assume one user called Mr Whites modified his layout so that Page section becomes sizex sizey row col that will be saved in db and every time Mr Whites opens this page his layout will be that size After long time using this solution Ive realized that it may be useful for Mr Whites to resize with smaller steps so I changed the widget base from to because I wanted to be flexible if one day I decide to change it again Ive created a function that will calculate the factor function getFactorresponse var response response originalWidgetBaseDimension currentWidgetBaseDimension iftypeof reponsewidgetBaseDimension undefined currentWidgetBaseDimension reponsewidgetBaseDimension else currentWidgetBaseDimension thiswidgetBaseDimension return originalWidgetBaseDimension currentWidgetBaseDimension In this case the factor will be because is Then I get the settings saved in DB for Mr Whites and I multiple sizex and sizey by the factor So now sizex sizey row col will become sizex sizey row col I expected it to look exactly the same as previous layout but it doesnt I also tried to measure the width of the element while changing the widget base so seeing if I was able to see any kind of pattern but no luck when widget base is width sizex height sizey px px px px px px px px The dirty way would be to ask Mr Whites to resize his layout with the new version I would like to avoid that Is there any other way to calculate this Thank you very much after reordering objects I want to save position But I dont know how I can do that please any one can help me pre ERROR TypeError Cannot read property width of undefined at dhresizable scriptsbundlejs at dhinit scriptsbundlejs at new d scriptsbundlejs pre when
