modulejs at Moduleload modulejs at tryModuleLoad modulejs at FunctionModuleload modulejs Hey folks first I want to say how much I love this project Great concept and this is almost usable as my everyday shell But Im having some issues that I cant get past Ctrlw closes my shell This is something that I cant get past Ctrlw in bash should kill the word before the cursor Ctrld doesnt act as Del key Another bashism if there is text present then ctrld should act as if Del were pressed and delete the character in front of the cursor Various things break in Emacs Mouse scrolling ctrlarrow keys dont work And Page UpPage Down will actually print PageUp or PageDown when pressed log net PageDownPageDownPageDown It also seems like Emacs cant tell how many rows my shell has Text at the bottom of a document is unreachable I got an error prompt when I executed the tmux command img width altscreen shot at src The root cause is ohmyzsh tmux plugin alias tmux to a shell function picture The canExecute method return false in this case screen shot at I created a fix for source Maybe it is not the best approach but it is a simple one An issue is happening on macOS Mojave The app turns all white and becomes unusable after trying to create a new tab both from the menubar and with keyboard shortcuts Same thing happens when changing a directory cd foo to and from another directory This is more of a question than an issue I see the output of SHELL environment variable is bash echo SHELL usrlocalbinbash and yet I dont think bashrc is read Also cannot execute the following commands source bashrc Cannot read property length of undefined bashrc Upterm command not found Apologies if this has been already answered or is not even the goal of this project There are no preferences in my UI that I can find Especially Id like to remove w as closing the window because theres never ever been a time that Ive needed to do that and d or exit hasnt been good enough There was an issue reported a while back It seems to be rejected but some of them have been implemented like altd so I not sure when it was updated Either way ctrlu still doesnt work and ctrld should exit the terminal if there are no characters to delete I would like to work on potentially fixing this but I have no idea where the keybindings are for the readline bindings I can find other bindings but couldnt find for example altd at all Steps to reproduce Paste the following code into the terminal bash echo Hello echo World Observed behavior The lines are concatenated together What gets run is echo Hello echo World Expected behavior The lines are run in sequence with the first line run first and then the second line run after the first has completed wx squashed version v In terminal interaction mode the red part
