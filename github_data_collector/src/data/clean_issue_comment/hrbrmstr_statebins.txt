Hi there Great package I wondered if there was an easy way to resize different bins Im after resizing the bins by population size like this It seems like resizing might not be too hard but wondered whether dodging so that there is no overlap might be a bit trickier Best Alan Right now the state abbreviations will not print if a value is NA librarystatebins librarydplyr dataUSArrests USArrestsstate rownamesUSArrests USArrestsAssault NA statebinsUSArrests valuecolAssault name Assault roundTRUE themestatebinslegendpositionright Which returns this error In sbinvertgbdata fill darklabel lightlabel NAs introduced by coercion It would be nice to still have the abbreviation printed possibly with a userspecified color Following up from Twitter how to get rid of the white background at the edges that resists all my attempts at removing them libraryshinydashboard libraryggplot ui dashboardPage dashboardHeader dashboardSidebar dashboardBodyfluidPagefluidRow plotOutputstatebins fluidRow plotOutputstatebins server functioninput output outputstatebins renderPlot usdata dataframecbindstateabb statearea stringsAsFactors FALSE usdatastatearea asnumericusdatastatearea statebinsstatebinsstatedata usdata statecol stateabb valuecol statearea outputstatebins renderPlot statebinsstatebinsstatedata usdata statecol stateabb valuecol statearea themeaxistextx elementblank axistexty elementblank axisticks elementblank panelgridminor elementblank panelgridmajor elementblank plotbackground elementrectfill ecf f shinyAppui server Background Im working on a shiny app that visualises US House and Senate voting patterns with two types of scores so four combinations Currently I use the highcharter package however I want to switch to statebins it looks really neat Highcharter also takes forever to load every time a setting is changed Im hoping statebins would be faster although not yet tested Request Would it be possible to show more than one variable value in a single bin wo using faceting I really like the new facet functionality but I also dont want to display x US maps to the user on a single page I couldnt really find a working example which might be telling so I am attaching some hastily done photoshopd possibilities bars number twocolurs Not sure about the feasibility of any of these but looking forward to your response Cheers Gokhan I hesitate to ask this given how quickly you responded over the weekend to my request via twitter but here goesis it much work to allow statebins to accept a facetwrap or facetgrid argument Not being in the USA but being very interested in the way this expresses data would it be possible read easy to make this more general so I could have a data frame with a column variable equivalent to whree you have the US states initials eg maybe Australian suburbs geographic regions etc and produce the similar coloured grid result i am thinking of eg population average wages number living alone etc Thanks Dan Raymond How hard would it be to create statebins as an sp object with reasonable lat and long values Im thinking about modifying geommap so it can take sp objects as input and switching between actual state borders and binned border would be interesting That would also make it easy to generalise statebins to other shapes
