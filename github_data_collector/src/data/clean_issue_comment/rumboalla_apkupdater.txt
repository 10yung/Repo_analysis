The recent releases are here Possible issue is on device the app just shows as Camera however manually downloading the latest version from that link did do an update to the existing app I was on v and it upgraded me to v which was released yesterday Timing issue Please add apk download dir and ability to download only this updates to this dir not install Also it will be great if you will keep apkmirrors apk names convention like apkmirror do like comgoogleandroidappsrecorder minAPI arm v anodpiapkmirrorcomapk for all repos you use Please add link to the app home page inside app also it is great to add automatic update of app itself from github Would be a nice addition This may have been touched upon regarding app releases Both APKMirror and Aptoide post user uploaded versions ex Adguard nightlys which I dont want to install but they still show up in the Updates Tab even though I have checked exclude experimental builds in settings Id rather not Ignore apps in the apps list tab because I may miss an update that I really need Hopefully a skip option can be added either through a button or popup submenu Add possibility to add a GitHub or GitLab link for an app and the app automatically search for new versions for it Newpipe or Bromite for example Useful for apps we develop debugging so that it wont offer us to update to a new version When apps are updating there are no notifications we dont know where the download and installation is It is possible to add notification in notification bar to see progress of download Since the update notification is not persistent can be swiped awaydismissed why does it keep popping up with notify sound even though I have acknowledged tapped the notification which opens the app It almost seems like its caught in a loop because the notification does dismiss after tapping it but once the app opens with the update in progress wheel showing and finishing the notification appears again notifying of updates again w sound annoying after awhile I also should mention that this only happens during the set update timeframe if out of that frame I can open the app it will look for updates and if found no notification popup Just seems a little bizarre how the whole update notification process works Very minor but liked the old style appicon more without the magnifier more One idea
