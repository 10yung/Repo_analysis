We released x builds for our users and then a lot of crashes began to happen there are many scenarios and we couldnt figure out whats going on and if we could do anything to fix so we rolled back to Rhodes and had to remove app compatibility with Android temporarily Also there is data loss when rolling back because sqlite is x in rhodes while it was x back then Some of the errors include crashing the app when performing http operations crashing after a while without doing anything crashing upon app startup and sometimes closing the app suddenly because Application is throwing too many failures

AppApplication RhoRhoApplication end sCallbacks flag Filing these here because rhomobiledocs project doesnt seem to be updated Documentation for isRunOnSimulator and isDeviceSecured is incorrect isRunOnSimulator also applies to iOS and returns true if run on Apple simulator I have not tested with RhoSimulator Probably really moot since simulator on iOS only runs with speciallybuilt X image and would never apply with distributed application isDeviceSecured description should be reworded a bit since simulator check is included on iOS All of the methods are actually available on iOS but of course those that are not applicable return false It might be good to mention this in the documentation as it will save developers the trouble of writing conditional code Hi I have a RhoMobile application and I want to use partials for certain parts of the application Also I would like to categorize the partials into subfolders Ie I will have foldersfiles as follows appCommonWidget widget erb appCommonWidget widget erb etc ie each widget has its own folder since there may be other files accompanying each widget However when I try to use render partial it seems that it will not accept the file path as is but will only use the last part of the path Ie when I use the following in some erb file render partial CommonWidget widget locals etc then I will get a runtime error claiming that the system cannot find appWidget widget erb Is there anything I can do to ensure my partials can be found Nb Im using RhoStudio Regards Dan el With iOS Apple defaulted WKWebView allowLinksPreview property to true This means that in a WKWebView force touch on a link will first open a preview and then with more force will open the link However at least in Rhodes this opens in Safari browser rather than in the app At least for the case of iosdirectlocalrequests I have not tried but guess that if it would try to open and get a error in Safari since no real server For almost all cases it is probably not desirable for this to be true in Rhodes Opening in Safari will expose the server port and invite examination and hacking Even if it were to open within the Rhodes app WKWebView it will often lead to unintended consequences because in order to get the preview then the request is made and the server calls the controller There might be cases where a developer wants to take advantage of this behavior but it would almost certainly have to be enabled on a casebycase basis for each link and in any case would normally need to open within the app WkWebView not in Safari Developer would have to be aware of the consequences of the controller method call needed to fetch the preview and take it into account to insure no unintended sideeffects WebViewenableDragAndDrop introduces a security vulnerability it leaks internal URLs when dragging a button link etc If iosdirectlocalrequests then this negates the security through obscurity of randomizing the server port It could be mitigated in an app by not using URLs in the HTML and using only Javascript callback registrations for navigation In general WebViewenableDragAndDrop seems problematical It would need to be intelligently enableddisabled for specific pages and further for specific items on a page I suggest watching Cordova etc to see what they do about this It is going to be a problem for WebViewbased hybrid platforms because you do not have effective finegrain control over page elements In f a a eed f e fd f cac fb a feature was added to enable global draganddrop for iOS The rhoconfigtxt setting WebViewenableDragAndDrop seems ineffective
