 What does it do When using a Listbox SingleSelect type TV one can set the Force Selection to List optional effectively allowing the manager to choose from the list OR enter a custom value The same option however was not available for Listbox MultiSelect type TVs but this PR enables it Why is it needed The need to benefit from both the ability to choose a value from a predefined list AND to enter a custom value if needed is not related to the choice if the given input accepts a single value or more as well so it is not reasonable to allow such option for the Single variant but not for the Multi Since there was a bug that prevented new values to be added to a Listbox MultiSelect TV even if the option was enabled my assumption that it was not allowed in the first place because it didnt work anyway fixes that and c b f d adds a very similar TV Input Option as the one already available for Listbox SingleSelect the Force Selection to List Related issuesPRs Ive found none Feature request It would be useful to have a setting that allows you to create folders with the resource ID in the media source It often happens that the source for the TV is one but resources are many with an additional ID folder it would be easier to manage resource files Many file management components have this default setting I think it would be useful to have it in the core resid What does it do Extracted the resource preview URL computation into a dedicated method inside modResource class Why is it needed Previously we were having duplicate inconsistent code to generate those preview URLs Related issuesPRs None found Bug report Summary Upgrade MODX to MODX alpha Bug report Summary After manually clear corecache works Step to reproduce Upgrade MODX to MODX alpha with http Bug report Summary Error updating table for class MODX Revolution modUser MODX Revolution modUser Array What does it do Fix date generation error for resources created by processors Why is it needed This fix will allow you to use system time property and create resources like What does it do If a resource has no parent either by being deleted or hitting an ACL policy the in that the resources parent has been removed but not the main resource if the main resource is marked as deleted the recycle bin breaks with a error as end cannot get an object Why is it needed If a user has access to the recycle bin but not access to all resources I think the recycle bin s because we cant always get the parents This just stops the error Related issuesPRs Bug report Summary The UIdescription regarding the Default Value for Template Variables is confusing and creates wrong expectations of its behavior Observed behavior The value of the input field whose label is Default Value is used to set the defaulttext field for the modTemplateVar object When getting the value of a template variable for a resource it return the raw value of the template variable in context of the specified resource When no value is found the defaulttext for the template variable is returned Current UIDescription The input field for the defaulttext can be found under the Input Options tab Here you can edit the input options for the Template Variable specific to the type of input render that you select The input field for defaulttext is labelled as Default Value under this field there is also a descriptionhelp text The default value will be stored if the user does not specify a value Related issuesPRs probably more Feature request Summary I plan to add support for legacy components to the MODX kernel as classalias deprecated Do you offer this PR is it not worth the time to spend it
