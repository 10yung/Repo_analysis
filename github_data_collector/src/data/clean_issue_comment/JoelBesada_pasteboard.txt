site which encourages use of Pasteboard for uploading images Recently all of the Pasteboard images which were embedded using the cdn URL have failed to appear on the above site This affects around posts on the site Has there been a recent change in your software which has caused this error There is no information on the Pasteboard website about how to get customer support Has the license for the secure connection expired I love this site but today I cannot access it A separate issue and I can post it as well Any of your http nonsecure links from GitHub to pasteboardco are blocked by MalewareBytes as containing a trojan Im not willing to risk infection to see if that is an error The image links for old uploads still work Considering the code here on github is years old Im guessing this site is no longer being maintained Where else to post issues You could update your READMEmd file to point people to the right location microtime install xxxxxxxxxxpasteboardnodemodulesmicrotime

you crazy D or its some bot protection for a while i like so much to pasteboard but i wish add file format zip if pasteboard is not can add zip but i wish ask you there are similar other site but style similar pasteboard can leave here list for ohter similar but this is for information share linkok pasteboard Returns Bad Gateway When someone sharing on an irc channel one user said that it breaks is current workflow His irc client is configured to open such url with a picture viewer and it obviously fail As someone else says it is perfectly legal but it is not because it is possible that you have to do it Fixes Thanks for pasteboard We made a Cloudron app for Pasteboard The Cloudron is a private server on which you can install apps The app source is at We also have selenium based integration tests under We have a series of patches in our fork to make the app possible Would be great to have them integrated I will submit a PR shortly
