reason ban user reason time in seconds time in seconds is optional by the ownermod unban user Here are my questions Can you delete the room called and make a main channel for you and the devs for reporting bugs etc Can you give me a link andor a list of permissions to use when using the command chmod because I dont know what they are Is there any way to change password for a chatroom once you have typed chown password andor private channel password and if there are no command for thatI would like to request it to be made Everything appears to work I dont see any errors but I get in the browser logs socketio t Bad Gateway When I follow the link a page appears and it does not even on refreshes Any ideas why this would occur connect to an irc channel start to encrypt content type a text line it shows the text in the sender chat but only in other clients Hi The ircproxy is working really well and it helps a lot for people not willing to install their own irc client Would it be possible to have a persistence as in normal echoplexus channels What would it require a bot connected to the channel to fetch the log is the same storage logic in use to display the chat lines between echoplexusirc channels thanks Alex Right now its a huge hack want to slap my past self This doesnt function properly Go to Go to code Go to channel foo Code panel isnt alive due to the aboves deficiencies Anything that fires listens to that event there is terrible code anger PSYC is a pretty cool protocol but the other clients currently available are a mess and not updated Many PSYC servers have a lot of features email jabber IRC and other gateways but arent very well maintained If Echoplexus became a solid PSYC platform since it is both a server and client it could attract others to create build off of Echoplexus andor create other PSYC platforms to federate with Echoplexus It also already has many of the desired features of Echoplexus defined in its protocol It would also put Echoplexus in the position of being able to shape the future of the protocol The protocol is defined here This could help solve all of the following issues Federation Issue Conversation threading Issue P P file transfer Issue Nick handling Issue Hashtag support maybe Issue IRC gatewayhooks maybe Issue And this could be part of the refactoring effort
