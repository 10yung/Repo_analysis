Would it be any training code for COCO loss available soon Will you provide trained models for other tasks such as person recognition or face recognition Thanks Besides your on lfw and on megaface I was also very curious about your baseline method Training on casia softmax can get on lfw only using resnet As we know softmax generally get for the other papers baseline can you share the detail of your network and training tricks to us your cocolosscenterloss Can they be used for facial feature extraction Do I need to increase the number of network layers In your paper its said that the centroid of class as average of features over a minibatch which implies you update the centroid during training according to different minibatches But its also said that the features are initialized from pretrained models and the initial value of centroid is thereby obtained As the centroid is determined by a minibatch why a initial value is needed Thanks for the great idea of using classification layer for cosine distance computation Could you please elaborate on how you train that layer As I understand you initialize weights with average feature vectors for each class and what do you do with biases Do you use them for training
