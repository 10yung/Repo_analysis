I am using Street Complete in an area where I added all the ways and roads some Months ago however they still dont show up an the map in the background The quests the app is showing me are fine How often does the map get updated Or is there maybe a bug If not I would suggest to update the map data more frequent The app treats metered WiFis like any other WiFi connection instead of treating them as mobile data How to Reproduce In settings change Autosync to Only on WiFi Connect to a metered WiFi Answers will get auto synced The isActiveNetworkMetered check is whats missing If you are suggesting a new quest please choose the Quest suggestion template Add a clear and concise description of what the bug is How to Reproduce Add steps to reproduce this behavior Versions affected Add the Android and StreetComplete version After some time using the app all quests domeyime disappear none is shown it generally happens after completing a quest all other icons disappear from the screen and no quest can be looked for requesting more quests doesnt help most often quests reappear after a random time sometimes over minutes its indeed very frustrating as nothing can be done until quests reappear more or less magically add vegan tags to ice cream stores General Affected tags to be modifiedadded brandwikidata notbrandwikidata these are the main tags amenity leisure cuisine shop etc can all also be updated as driven by the Name Suggestion Index Question asked Is this location part of the X brand Checklist Checklist for quest suggestions see guidelines x To be added tag is established and has a useful purpose Distinguishes brand locations explicitly thanks to unique QID Standardises other related brand tagging per brand as taken from NSI The only caveat here is that the tag notbrandwikidata is not currently widely used however I would appeal to the fact that not is an established prefix and the iD editor already checks for this tagging to prevent false positive brand tag suggestions x Any answer the user can give must have an equivalent tagging Quest should not reappear to other users when solved by one If it is the brand brandwikidata prevents future quests If its not the brand but the name is correct notbrandwikidata explicitly marks this If its not the brand and the name is not correct then updating the name prevents the quest reappearing x Easily answerable by everyone from the outside but a survey is necessary x Not an overwhelming percentage of elements have the same answer No spam x Applies to a reasonable number of elements Worth the effort Ideas for implementation This quest type would be similar to brand tagging upgrades suggested by iD so the behind the scenes implementation could really be along the same lines as done there Im not too familiar with android development or Kotlin but if you can use the javascript package directly then you could even use the provided matcher like iD does Otherwise I suppose it would need to be rewritten in a suitable language to see the same behaviour Element selection Elements tagged matching the categories present in the NSI shop leisure amenity etc Then check for fuzzy matches against the name tag NSI provides matchNames for alternate possible names that could be the brand Metadata needed I believe all metadata needed is available from the Name Suggestion Index country codes specifying where a brand is present if it isnt global alternate possible names and taggings the tags that should be added to the brand If anything needed can provided in a structure thats more convenient then that could probably be arranged too by opening up an issue to ask Proposed GUI A simple possible answers question Yes this is the brand location in question Adds brandwikidata tag No but the name is the same Adds notbrandwikidata tag No the name is different User is prompted to input the new name Check again if the name still fuzzy matches the brand If yes add notbrandwikidata If no update the name tag Could show the brand logo if available alongside the question I know that google maps does this when asking users if POIs are a brand location I am pretty sure in the past the roof shape quest had constant sort order In one of the latest update it changed to recent used order The old stable sorting was better IMO since I knew the first one was gabled and could select it without double checking Versions affected Lastest play store beta Does the current version push internal osm messages from other osmmembers to the StreetComplete app user before and even while an edit session Like messages which are send via system The background of this question is can i reach a SteetCompleteeditoruser via the osminternal message system beside any email app tools If not please implement such an option to do so I thing the iD and JOSMeditor are showing users when new internal osm messages are received If you are suggesting a new quest please choose the Quest suggestion template Use case Add a clear and concise description of your use case and what you thus think is missing and why Talk to other osmusers about their database changes Proposed Solution There may be several different solutions for your idea or use case add your deliberations about it here to help out sort out the best one Also add screenshots or blueprints to visualize your idea if applicable Add a messageviewer or even chatoption for StreetComplete Have some quests displayed on the map Go to the settings switch to dark mode go back The quests are now gone The GPS precision is not infinite and the app displays it as usual with a blue circle around the current position The issue is that the size of this blue circle is not properly updated when zooming in and out In other words the scale of the blue circle doesn t seem to be the same than the scale of the map it seems to be in the scale of the previous zoom setting bot the current one How to Reproduce I think that the simplest way to visualise the bug is through these two screens These two screens are almost identical expect by the size of the blue circle Screenshot de westnordost streetcomplete Screenshot de westnordost streetcomplete I can switch from the big blue circle to the small blue circle by pressing through the zoom button then the zoom button To switch from the small blue circle to the big circle I can press the zoom button followed by the zoom button I can do this consistently this is not a GPS issue Actually I can switch off my GPS and let the phone rely on the Wifi positioning approximation and the result stays the same it was actually the case in these screenshots pressing followed by makes the circle bigger and pressing followed by makes the circle smaller Versions affected How to Reproduce Reinstall app gave it a location permission go to settings disable all quests except one type exit settings Now after quests load sometimes disabled quests are shown sadly not always in about or cases Closing app and opening it shows only enabled quests Versions affected Android StreetComplete master version Why I even care to report this Reported as I hope that it is related to
