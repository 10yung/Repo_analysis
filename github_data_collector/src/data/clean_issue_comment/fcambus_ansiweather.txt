Hi When running ansiweather I am getting a whitespace as the first character on the first line of output ansiweather Weather in London F Wind mph E Humd Pres inHg SunR May SunS May Also is there a way to override the Weather in text and just have Temp for the output Edit Bash on Mac High Sierra if that makes any difference Small change to allow for specifying verbiage to prefix the temperature output If provided Temperature is prefixed with dashes like other data output Allows for things like this by specifying a newline in dashes Current weather in San Diego Temp F Wind mph SSE Humidity Pressure inHg Sunrise Dec AM Sunset Dec PM
