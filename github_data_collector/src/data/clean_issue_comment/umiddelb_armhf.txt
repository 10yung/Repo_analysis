Hello Regarding the umiddelbarmhfwikiHowTocompileacustomLinuxkernelforyourARMdevice I wonder how does it work without ever specifying ARCHarm in any make invocation or ever mentioning it at all I doubt the tutorial expects the kernel is being built on some ARM host so the host is likely x and we are building cross In this case in particular the recipe cd linux make defaultconfig less config will try to find devaultconfig in archx rather than in archarm and should fail If ARCHarm should be set in the environment it should better be explicitly stated in the tutorial I think What do I miss
