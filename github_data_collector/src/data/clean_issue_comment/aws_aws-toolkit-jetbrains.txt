Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe A clear and concise description of what the problem is Ex Im always frustrated when I am unable to automatically retrieve database connection credentials from AWS secrets manager and use those credentials to log in with DataGrip Describe the solution youd like A clear and concise description of what you want to happen Id like to pass a secret name to a datasource and get a connection as a result Describe alternatives youve considered A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered Manually copying values from a secret is a current workaround but autorotation could cause headaches Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here As a user of this plugin I want to be able to connect to an RDS instance using an Amazon managed secret That way I can manage my database passwords without having to manually open the console and update my password when it autorotates Echoes but specific to using secrets manager Minor documentation License I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache license Attempt to avoid choco codebuild provides dotnet Windows build succeeds without netfx devpack Did the tests silently skip Also this says The base image of the Windows Server Core contains the following runtimes dotnet For reference provides dotnetinstallps but thats for dotnet core which the image already includes We apparently need NET framework plus whatever the devpack includes powershell alternative to choco

changes I am taking the nuclear option on our credentials abstractions in prep for multipartition support At the end of the day we need to be able to create AwsCredentials scoped to the ToolkitCredentialsProvider now ToolkitCredentialsIdentifier and the AWS partition We want to cache these across projects so the user can be only prompted once like MFA prompts but this means we need to get the region data into the flow where we create credentials This has led to changing method signatures and ripping out useless indirection License I confirm that my contribution is made under the

Define a String parameter with a default value of cron Define a resource AWSEventsRule with the ScheduleExpression property having the parameter above as its value Deploy the project Locate the new Change Set The parameter value will shown as cron When executing the resource CloudWatch rule will fail with Parameter ScheduleExpression is not valid Expected behavior The parameter value cron should be shown and used by the Change Set Screenshots Your Environment OS Mac OS JetBrains Product PyCharm JetBrains Product Version Community Edition Toolkit Version SAM CLI Version JVMPython Version

about what other options there are other than passing known hosts into the sam build somehow when downloading the requirements but does manage to download the file Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe When updating or creating a CF stack using AWS Console we may use empty parameters Currently version the plugin doesnt allow a deploy with empty parameter values Describe the solution youd like Be consistent with the way CF Console works accepting empty values Describe alternatives youve considered Theres no alternative the CloudFormation template has to be modified to work around this limitation Additional context No additional context Description Add an SSO credential provider License I confirm that my contribution is made under the terms of the Apache license
