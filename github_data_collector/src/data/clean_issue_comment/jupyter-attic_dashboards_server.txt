Hi Im trying to get dashboards server working using the Cloud Foundry setup I can upload a notebookdashboard to the server and I can communicate directly with the kernel gateway However there is a problem when trying to view a dashboard When trying to open INTRO I get an error internal server error but if I follow the failed resource I get this Error Error getting notebook info homevcapnodemodulesjupyterdashboardsserverdataapikernels ENOENT no such file or directory stat The failure happens in line in the dashboardsserver api routes file I think the RegEx on line is to blame Anyone having the same issue You make clear that dashboardssserver is retired in the Readmetxt file However if it is retired its there another solution Or in any case we should keep using dashboardsserver I saw this project in action yesterday and it is pretty neat thats why I ask Thanks x I have a dashboard notebook which uses Output widgets and callbacks to bind outputs of one cell to widgets rendered in another This lets me have a single set of controls that effect several different plots and then use the layout extension to lay them out nicely While all the above works in the notebook and the preview dashboard when I publish this to the dashboard server the output widgets dont render if I move them back into a single monolithic interact block they do render I think this might be related to the fact that Output widgets have only recently gotten support in embedded bundles issue in ipywidgets Any idea if there is a way around this since it makes it quite hard to build a nicely laid out dashboard I lost a lot of time because the server was displaying in log STACK undefined and jupyterhub was only showing Internal Server Error After adding displaying explicit error msg I found out it was permissions issue Filed to upload file EACCES permission denied open srvdashboardsnotebookUntilted ipynb I think it would be useful to display whole error msg Hi I am trying to increase the KERNELRETENTIONTIME from milliseconds to I changed that value in these files in dockercompose as env variable in configjson file usrlocallibnodemodulesjupyterdashboardsserverconfigjson in apijs file usrlocallibnodemodulesjupyterdashboardsserverroutesapijs For every change I restarted my container but anything could change this waiting time i have a table that render result in more or less seconds and Im blocked to see the result due this limit Thanks untitled Hi Dropdown widget in dashboard server is being displayed to up instead to down and this cause an overlapping by the limit of the browser window dashboardserver jupyternotebook anaconda Ipywidgets dashboard issue Hi there I am trying my best to follow the instructions here here and here in order to deploy a dashboard as a web app I work for a school board and the endusers of my reports are those who do not know how to program but would love to use widgets to explore the data interactively So Im basically Alice Ive installed the packages specified in the documentation and done the following to get the kernal gateway notebook server and dashboard server running run the kernel gateway in the background using default settings jupyterkernelgateway listening on port run the notebook server juputer notebook listening on port run the dashboard server jupyterdashboardsserver NOTEBOOKSDIRpwd KERNELGATEWAYURL listening on port However when I go to and select my notebook nothing shows up except for the following jup The notebook has a few select widgets and they interact with one another calling python callbacks to do certian things Here is a part of what the notebook looks like before Could you please help me to understand what I am doing wrong and even if the notebook were to show up what I would have to do to share it with another user and have it maintain interactivity Thanks very much Al Im interested in using two widgets with the Jupyter Dashboard Server IPythondisplayFileLinks fileuploadFileUploadWidget from These widgets work successfully from the notebook view but when I deploy to the Jupyter Dashboard Server these widgets dont appear Other widgets such as the dropdown menu from interacthue smoker sex time day in helloworldipynb and ipywidgetsIntSlider work just fine in the dashboard server Im running the servers using the dockerdeploy solution from Ive modified the Dockerfiles for both the notebook and kernel to include RUN pip install fileupload Im not sure if this is a bug or if Im missing a crucial step for making this work
