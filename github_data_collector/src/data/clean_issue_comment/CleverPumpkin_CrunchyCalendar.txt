 I mean when pressing the arrow shown in the attached image you would be able to go to next month arrowcalendar Would it be posible to change calendar behavior so it just displays one month at once user can just scroll for that month and pressing that arrow would show next month For this case lets consider that the shown month would be June and when the arrow were to be pressed it would show July Hello rAseri I can select multiple dates but cannot deselect date Could you tell me the way to do that I have a REST service that returns an array of dates and an int value depending of that value the date will have a specific color Example if the value is between and the color will be green if the value is between and the color will be yellow and so on PD The library is awsome the only thing I have left to implement is this help Thanks Is there a way to change the font family text size etc for the DaysBarView and the header monthyear of the calendar I would like to match the calendar text attributes to the rest of my application Hello again How can we deal with different timezones Is there any builtin solution or what is the suggested method Thank you Ive been working with Crunchy Calendar for a couple days and am fitting it into my use case where I need square event indicators and possibly more than indicators showing on each calendar cell Is this something that you might have on the roadmap for this library or would you be willing to look at a PR if I had some suggested changes to have event indicator types Or would I be better off maintaining my fork separately Hi Again thanks for such a good work One feature I like about the google calendar app is that the entrys time will change where in the day it appears For instance an entry early in the day will be shown high up and a entry at noon should be in the middle of the day view and a entry at night should be by the end of the day box Thanks
