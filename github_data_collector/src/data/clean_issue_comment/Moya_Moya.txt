 Please let us know what version of Moya you are using so we can better pinpoint andor solve your issue Please wrap code blocks in backticks like so swift your code goes here The code will automatically get its syntax highlighted and doesnt need to be indented spaces to be shown as code When referencing a dependency managerrelated issue think CocoaPods Carthage SwiftPM please add its configuration file and version to the issue It would be helpful to put the contents in a code block too using ruby for CocoaPods and swift for SwiftPM Also please make sure your title describes your problem well Questions end with a question mark Im trying to install Moya beta but failed all am I missing something st try Pod install CocoaPods could not find compatible versions for pod MoyaRxSwift In Podfile MoyaRxSwift nd try carthage update No available version for github MoyaMoya satisfies the requirement rd try SPM The package dependency graph can not be resolved unable find any available tag for the following requirements Implements To release you will have to use swift run rocket version Before releasing it will comment all the lines that contains dev Possible next steps Use rocket to generate the Moya docs website after the release Put danger on the Packageswift and make rocket comment it during the release Ive made few tries and looks working well but I didnt really make a release then I didnt use the createrelease task but the code is not changed then it should work Please let us know what version of Moya you are using so we can better pinpoint andor solve your issue

problem well Questions end with a question mark Added a resume download case This is used when canceling a download and resuming at a later time Usually when using background download all requests are terminated when a user kills the App It is possible however to resume download When a request is canceled a task resume data is returned in the errors user info for NSURLSessionDownloadTaskResumeData Using this data we can resume the download when the App restarts Thank you for contributing to Moya Choosing a base branch master bug fixes non breaking API changes documentation fixes development

sure that when the pull request is merged the issue will automatically be closed Hi there Im experiencing a crash when the app is built using Xcode default generated build configuration called Release thus I think it may be related to the compiler optimizations This is the LLDB log TestSPM was compiled with optimization stepping may behave oddly variables may not be available thread queue

libdylddylibstart frame x f d c libdylddylibstart Steps to reproduce Create an empty iOS project Single View Application Add Moya just the Moya target as a dependency using SPM using Xcode GUI latest version up to the next major currently Add a TargetType file and add some basic code as soon as possible like for example the following in your AppDelegates applicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptions swift MoyaProviderYourTargetTyperequestyourEndpoint result in printresult Edit your Run scheme to use Release build configuration instead of Debug one Run and wait for crash to happen More info Im using Xcode Version B I am available if any further clarifications are needed and take the chance to thank you for your great work Framework compiled with carthage seems not compatible with bitcode Deployment target in the build settings is macOS and bitcode options are not enable Can you help me with this issue Currently we use a pretty naive removal of testing dependencies for SwiftPM by setting an environment variable We should be able to use Rocket and update our Rakefile script to just remove testing dependencies on each release and keep it in the development process thanks to that The idea came from this PR that I saw which sounds really amazing cc fmeloni I know you wanted to play with Rocket here as well maybe you would like to try this one out
