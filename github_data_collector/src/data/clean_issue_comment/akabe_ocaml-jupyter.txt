ocaml install Jupyter produces errors finishing with The packages you requested declare the following system dependencies Please make sure they are installed before retrying zeromq caml macOS Beta homebrew fixed by brew install zeromq before Ocaml install Jupiter Rather obvious fix then it works fine Thanks great project I want to write an OCaml function that will read the contents of a given cell and return them as an OCaml string This is probably not an issue with a library but I am wondering whether you think this is possible to do through the current API and if you can point me at the right direction Thank you and happy holidays error base brandomiranda jupyter kernelspec install name ocamljupyter opam config var sharejupyter Traceback most recent call last File

characters Called from file topleveltoploopml line characters Hi Im trying to install ocamljupyter for jupyterhub My installation seems to work with python kernel The installation of ocamljupyter was successfull But when i try to open a new file with Ocaml kernel i get that error I think its a permission problem but i dont know which filefolder is concerned by the error Maybe you could help me

using Jupyter and your kernel instead of EmacsTuareg for my introductory course I am using Arthur Chargu rauds kernel fork based on which supports better error messages I was able to install your kernel under the appropriate opam switch but I have to pass option easytypeerrors to ocaml in order to activate the better messages How can I do this Adding the option to argv in the json does not work as the kernel does not recognise the option
