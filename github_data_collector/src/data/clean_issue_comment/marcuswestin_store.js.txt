doesnt accept a third parameter expiration even if I call StoreaddPluginExpire Is it possible to check if a field was rewritten between when a value was retrieved and set I see the update function doesnt do any of the checking You could just assign a new Date on writes and compare them before settings Is there a way to clear store for only one namespace When I create multiple stores with different namespaces and I call clearAll on any of them it clears the data from all the stores var ns storenamespacens var ns storenamespacens ns setfoo bar ns setfoo bar ns getfoo bar ns getfoo bar
