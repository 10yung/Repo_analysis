I have a card video from Nvidia installed on my pc including driver How do I show her on gotop The command that show temperature is nvidiasmi querygputemperaturegpu formatcsvnoheader Theres one way to put this command over gotop configurations Hi Is there a way to force show all Logical cores on the left side I just upgraded from Ryzen to Ryzen x today and noticed it only showed cores instead of Dragging the window bigger or zooming out fixes the issue ask CLI arg to output snapshot of system metrics CPU mem disk et al as JSON why Diffing For example lets say your machine feels laggy You open gotop and things look pretty normal but you dont remember the metrics from the last time you opened gotop so unless something is very obviously wrong machine is super hot runaway process is hogging memory you wont have any useful comparisons to make Whereas with the JSON output option you could just gotop json gotopmetricsdatejson to establish a baseline and then when things get laggy compare your current situation to the baseline The Solarized theme doesnt work well on light themes Lightdark have identical palettes but the foregroundcolors are different and greys obviously get used differently So the solarized theme uses the foreground color instead of and uses the average of base and base for DiskBar This commit also adds two color themes utilizing the extra violetorange colors and using the appropriate grey color for DiskBar Please search existing issues to avoid creating duplicates Also please test using the latest build to make sure your issue has not already been fixed

for temperatures are C and F so I added the degree symbol to the format string in tempgo Using the official unicode characters U and U will probably have compatibility issues in some terminals so I opted for their canonical decomposition Best Felix gotop v displays harddrivebay temperature as C on two different iMacs both have fusion drives but displays correct information on Macbook and Macbook
