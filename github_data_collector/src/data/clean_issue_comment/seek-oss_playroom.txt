Currently in my playroomconfigjs I am only able to specify a single directory for my components js moduleexports components componentssrc However it would be useful that I could point to a number of component sources by passing an array of paths like this js moduleexports components componentssrc additionalcomponentssrc Hi I use Nextjs for my application so I need to write img srcimagejpeg and backgroundimage urlimagejpeg to display an image stored at publicimagejpeg relative to the project root reference to docs on this However Playroom appears to resolve img src paths and backgroundimage url paths from the root of the project I need to use either img srcpublicimagejpeg or backgroundimage urlpublicimagejpeg to display the image stored at publicimagejpeg This makes the paths for my images in the Playroom environment incompatible with the paths that images need to resolve properly in the Nextjs environment Ideally I would like all image paths starting with to resolve to paths starting with public in the Playroom environment For example imagejpeg would resolve to publicimagejpeg Whats the best way to accomplish this Im using CRA TypeScript and wanted to test out playroom but immediately run into this error node UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning Error Cannot find module srcComponents playroomconfigjs js moduleexports components srcComponents outputPath buildplayroom

confused by the error message about missing webpackdevserver given that yarn thinks its installed yarn why webpackdevserver yarn why v Why do we have the module webpackdevserver Initialising dependency graph Finding dependency Calculating file sizes Found webpackdevserver info Reasons this module exists playroom depends on it Hoisted from playroomwebpackdevserver Done in s The project itself lighthouse doesnt actually use webpackdevserver and uses webpackserve instead If I explicitly install yarn add dev webpackdevserver the error goes away I wouldve thought that explicitly adding webpackdevserver to playrooms dependencies would be enough but it isnt in this case Im not sure why Hi Firstly thanks for this super awesome tool I really loved how simple it is and how simply it works I just wanted to share a fork that I have been working on for my own use cases You can see examples of some of the cool things that managed to work in playroom at the end of this comment So I integrated the Monaco editor and migrated some of the core Playroom react code to Typescript and hooks because I found it easier to work with The last and probably the collest thing I was able to make work was being able to use React hooks and that means probably all of Reacts functionality from the playroom editor The JSX is still formatted and interpreted correctly even if its has multiple parents tags because we wrap it in a fragment And no return statement is necessary so its kinda svelteish in its look and simplicity It makes a lot of cool stuff possible You can also import your own hooks with your components no additional code is required probably should add config though I also have tried useEffect and fetched data all correctly All of this works on its own just like the old playroom But another cool integration that I made is with this library I wrote not yet published But its essentially some React primitives mainly the Box that wrap functionality from styledcomponents styledsystem framermotion to allow styling and animations declaratively through just props And with hooks now writing almost anything should be possible treating the playroom as a functional components I have deployed this integration at if anyone wants to give it a try Also if the contributors would want to discuss integrating some of this with the playroom library I would love to make a pull request but I probably broke a lot of the CICD stuff because I am not well versed on it Sorry I am not certain of what the process for this is because this is my first time contributing to open source Also markdalgleish loved your talk on design systems would love to hear what you think about some of this PS There are still a lot of anys in my typescript but I was just trying to make it work I havent got intellisense to work correctly with the user types in Monaco but I see a path where the types generated by reactdocgen can be put into a dts file and fed into the monaco editor that I did with the React types which worked Here are some examples of things that becomes possible You can directly use the links and play around with the code thanks to the sandboxing and how the creators made

children are ignored I would like to ignore more props that are being injected by libraries like material UI such as classes and innerRef I wouldnt mind taking a stab at a PR Anyone have an idea of an ideal API youd like to see for this Thanks for the great library I dont want to have to specify a custom webpack and use our default react scripts Is this possible Putting this here as ill probably implement this but It would be nice to have an ability to copy a shortURL instead of base links for pasting in Slacketc I was pairing with another dev the other day and we passed links back and forth taking over our slack convo with huge link blocks I ended up just using bitly but it would be nice if I could copy a shortlink right from the playroom Im using playroom as part of a design system and encountered an issue with playroom running out of memory We recently added a SVG icon component which includes possible SVGs which are about kb when loaded all at once Ive verified the entry file we pass to playroom is all correct but now playroom runs out of JS memory while building I havent had a chance to look at the source yet but if anyone has any ideas where this might be happening I could use the help Thanks Last few GCs x ms Marksweep MB ms average mu current mu allocation failure scavenge might not succeed x ms Marksweep MB ms average mu current mu allocation failure scavenge might

tool that I use every day What changes does this PR bring Adds new playroom config option for customStyles Accepts a string of CSS that will be inserted into the head of the Playroom page Will allow consumers to make visual tweaks to things like codeeditor height fontsize and lineheight Any critique is welcome
