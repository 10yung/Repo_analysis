BackgroundGeolocationonProviderChangeonProviderChange BackgroundGeolocationstartGeofences Expected Behavior According to the ios documentation Whenever the user crosses the boundary of one of your apps registered regions the system notifies your app In this plugins documentation it says In this mode no active locationtracking will occur only geofences will be monitored With these two points of data I expect that the ios App has used your location x times in the background prompt should only appear if weve created and used geofences and should only show locations that the user has interacted with the geofences Actual Behavior The App has used your location x times in the background prompt appears wether we have created or used geofences and suggests that our app is using the background location far more than we actually are Steps to Reproduce Set up the plugin like above Escalate your app permission to nonprovisional always allow DO NOT create geofences or create geofences that you will never overlap with Change location multiple times but never into a geofence Wait amount of time for the ios system prompt Context There is no good documentation about this specific prompt from Apple nothing to tell the actual expected behavior Too Im not certain if this plugin works like I expect it to or if Ive configured it in a way that it wont work like I expect it to when app terminated i set stopOnTerminate false how to get location on minutes help me please Currently i am doing my tests with two devices OS Version Android OS Version Android on the device everything works well the backbround Task is working corectly and it rigers the invehicule activity but on the Android device i receive only one location and then it goes blind when i start the plugin any idea about this best Your Environment Plugin version and Platform Both iOS and Android OS version iOS android Device manufacturer model various React Native version Plugin config Will include in debug log later Description One of our testers is in a rural location and often enters cellular cells where there is poor reception A few times a day the phones cellular data connection will have trouble and this plugin ie RNBGL will be unable to post location data to our server We have variously seen these types of error messages in the debug log serverexamplecom is not responding Will try again after records Response Unable to resolve host serverexamplecom No address associated with hostname Response Failed to connect to serverexamplecomnnnn These are legitimate errors and we accept that they will occur Up to this point its all fine and good However after one of these errors occurs and the phone enters an area with good reception or wifi we expect the plugin to detect this and start uploading data again However this is not the case We often have to restartopenforeground our app and then the plugin will start emitting again So a sequence like this happens Testers phone has network connectivity issues Plugin stops uploading location Error messages are seen in the log Tester goes to a new area with good reception Alternatively tester goes home and connects to home wifi A variable amount of time elapses Tester opens the app Plugin resumes uploading location again Expected Soon after step occurs the plugin should resume uploading In other words step only lasts for a short amount of time Observed Step lasts until the tester opens the app Sometimes this can be minutes or more In one instance it lasted for about minutes Expected Behavior See above Actual Behavior See above Discussion Most of the time the plugin works as expected So if this issue doesnt occur then all is good However when one of the abovementioned error messages occurs the plugin stops uploading Also when this happens I can see in the log that the plugin is still acquiring locations and saving them in the offline database for uploading later So the plugin is still operating and doing stuff just that for some reason it doesnt upload to the server When connectivity resumes the plugin successfully uploads all the offline data points we have maxRecordsToPersist of Debug logs Will email separately if needed later Im going to test out a debug version of our app with some extra connectivityrelated debugging Hopefully that will produce a more useful debug log WARNING If you ignore this template so
