This is a bit of a long shot but though Id post to see if it would be of use to anyone else Our current workflow is to use makerjs to create dxfs of the objects we are going to cut out on a cnc machine We import the objects in vcarve and then nest and toolpath If we could nest the objects in makerjs it would be amazing for reasons The nesting in vcarve isnt great If the objects were nested in makerjs we could calculate the exact sheet usage required right in the browser and know what to order without having to export and nest first Appreciate this might be something of a niche use case would be interesting to hear if anyone else would find this feature useful I was dealing with path booleans with makerjs recently when I encountered a problem where a boolean operation results in fragmented segments that end up being discarded resulting in entire holes or contours lost I did some digging and it seems that the Text objects I was dealing with are in fact Bezier Curves approximated with arcs When the bezier curve goes flat the arcs radius becomes huge and the angle becomes very small That seemed to cause issues when the arc is intersected with lines I converted the arcs in question into straight lines and that seemed to solve the problem But I guess a better solution would have to be implemented by the devs I have polygon on canvas i want to export it as DXF no fiddle or any working example i found online please help me Hi All Can anybody point me in the right direction to install maker locally what files will be required to run it Thank you Typings usually dont need to be installed by the end user I didnt find any hint towards them actually being used in the code so we can keep these KB from being downloaded in production Hey I don t understand which object to transfer as the last argument to new Text font opentypeFont text string fontSize number combine boolean centerCharacterOrigin boolean bezierAccuracy number opentypeOptions opentypeRenderOptions Text because I have opentypeRenderOptions undefined And how do I make a thin neat font bad font Just like to say what a great resource Would be great to have the parameters boxes to sit along side each other you could keep x y coordinates together and perhaps not include the slider part I dont know if this is something you can do at the moment AutoCAD does not accept files with color code When exporting dxf the default color is black and is defined as in coreexporterts is an invalid value for autocad and it will fail to open the file for it The right black value is
