Parse nonASCII characters in StatsBomb and other data for use with soccerPosition and other future plotting functions For example Kylian Mbapp currently renders as Kylian Mbapp Collect more pitch dimensions length width in metres to pass to soccermatics functions for accurate visualisation of xycoordinates Many performance datasets eg WhoScored provide relative xycoordinates eg a scale of but true dimensions ie in metres are required in order to determine true distances eg pass length shot distance and accurately visualise data on the pitch The file pitchdimensionscsv contains this information although only recent EPL teams and a few others are currently listed These data were just grabbed manually from Wikipedia pages with units being converted to metres where only yards were given m yards The altname column contains alternative teamname definitions eg as they appear in to aid team identification Expanding this list if pitch dimensions would be useful so I welcome any contributions made with a pull request A rough list of functions and utilities Id like to add to the package Recommendations welcomed under construction still just a pipedream Visualisations Postmatch odds based on simulating shots Voronoi diagrams Delaunay triangulation convex hull Wrapper functions to animate metrics frame by frame Defensive coverage plots Advanced analytics Wrapper functions for common metrics xG xA forward progressions PossAdjT A etc Event sequence plots and possession sequence metrics possession spell and final product ie does it end in final third end in shot end in goal Directness synchronisation of movement direction space utilisation Space control dominance eg ratio of Voronoi areas convex hull areas Goalscoring threat xG in each frame based on view to goal based on distance angle of ball from opposition goal number of defending players in front of goal number of attacking players nearby etc similar to this karuninblogexpectedthreathtml Pressing effectiveness eg average distance of defending players from ball area of bounding box formed by defending team time for n nearest players to close gap after possession change etc Machine learning stuff Infer individual ball possession Infer shot and pass events Modelling optimal positioning with deep imitation learning Automated formation discovery Misc Add option Juego de Posicion pitch markings Make a geompitch layer as a less monolithic plotting function New system for working across multiple data sources ie transform StatsBomb Opta whatever data so they can be used in a single function for xG plots passmaps whatever Add to list of true pitch dimensions
