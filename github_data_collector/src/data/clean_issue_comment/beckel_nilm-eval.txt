Hello I am new in this area not just NILM field in Machine Learning in general I am trying to run an experiment using Matlab based on FHMM algorithm but I get an error It is line of the disagfhmmm file pyObj pynilmtkdisaggregatechrisfhmmFhmm I read about the integration of Python with Matlab but apart from that my doubt is where is that function pynilmtkdisaggregatechrisfhmmFhmm because I searched in the folders but it is not here How can I use that function Im going to conduct a research assignment with NILM and I need some input on how to use the NILMEVAL I will collect plug data in my house together with the smart meter data My goal is to make an algorithm that can be used in other homes similar to mine without needing additional training To do this I want to train three algorithms and evaluate them on the new household From public datasets From my own house From both public and my own My questions are How can I continue using a trained algorithm in NILMEVAL It looks like it resets every time it runs Can NILMEVAL be run without the plug data when I have trained an algorithm If so what kind of resultsplots will it output To test an algorithm blindly on new smart data it looks like the only thing I should configure is to give it training days Is this correct Hey beckel I met a erroThe index is beyond the matrix dimension when I run the scripts runexperimentm Is there anything wrong about the weissinitialyaml I am working with the ECO dataset and Im trying run the fhmmpy on it I have been unsuccessful in fitting the appliance data because it throws me divide by zero warning Is there some preprocess I dont know about before running the fhmmpy In the meantime I was using some values in the notebook and itseems to be fitting the ECO meter data poorly because eventhough there arent any NaNs and infinite values I am getting array must not contain infs or NaNs error Any idea why else this maybe happening Hi I run kolters algorithm with default configuration and experiment hover I got an error Error using kmeans line KMEANS does not accept complex data Error in SpectralClustering line C kmeansU k start sample Error in kolter line clusters SpectralClusteringadjacencyMatrix numOfClusters I use matlab a and wonder if it is the version problem Did any one meet this problem Any help would be appreciated Thank you Hi Looking at the code in Parson algorithm calculate diff model params init ones lengthstatemeans lengthstatemeans numstates lengthinit idx repmat numstatesnumstates emitmean statemeansidx statemeansidx emitcov statecovsidx statecovsidx What is the meaning of emitmean and emitcov For example for emitcov we obtain OFF ON OFF ON It means that the variance OFF to ON is I am using the available code to run some simulations and while computing the results I am not able to find resultyaml file in the code base I know this question is asked before but still there is no information of what this file should contain It would help if you could explain what the five columns in resultevents explain createexperiment runexperiment running weiss algorithm with weissinitial configuration and setup file size of evalDays size of evalDays size of trainingRange size of trainingRange Index exceeds matrix dimensions Error in weiss line signatureIDs dist knnsearchsignaturesphasesofsignatures phase eventvecs Error in nilmeval line result functionhandleevaluationandtrainingdays setup fid Error in runexperiment line nilmeval experimentfolder setupfile Hi Beckel After running the experiment Weissinitial some results are produced in this folder path GitHub nilmeval Matlab results in the form of mat files for only households am not sure why it didnt produce for all houses Now I would like to visualize this by plotting them Your report says user specify the plots content in a YAML file named resultyaml in this location inputresultyaml and execute the plotExperimentm script but I dont find this resultyaml file in my current working directory Should this be written by me or is there a sample file that I can input Pls clarify and advice Thanks Balaji Hi Beckel After having done the troubleshooting two nights ago Id now prepared set of OPL DataSet in format mat very similar to that of yours Appliance Now I would like to use my dataset and run nilmevalMatlabalgorithmsparsonalg from NILMEVAL repository Could you guide as to where do I start the application demo Alternatively if you have a starting point ieguide to testing the same algo with ECO dataset atleast that could be fine as well Thanks looking forward Balaji
