 Context Im currently using OrbTk to build a simple GUI for a small tool Im working on In the process Ive been creating some simple widgets like a numeric input text block with and buttons Problem description Solution There are not very many widgets currently available Im wondering if the maintainers are currently interested in new widget contributions from the community such as that described above Is the repo currently in a stable enough state for this to even be worthwhile Is there any plandesire to create a repolibrary of community built widgets PS I would normally have asked these questions on the chat server but I have not yet been granted access Describe the bug As in title no matter what font size I specify when creating new TextBlock the outcoming font size does not vary To

update function with different fontsize Ive also tried with appendchildto without using build on messageentity and the effect is the same Expected behavior I expected to be able to change fontsize in appended widgets Desktop please complete the following information OS Windows Home no browser Version latest branch develop as for Hi first of all thank you for a good work Im using orbtk to create an installer for another program for Windows I would like to get all the configurations from user in one view and then send it to installation view Here is my sending views state rust impl State for

to bind styles locally and globally to our widgets This is inspired by the React Native StyleSheet API Examples and MockUps rust use orbtkprelude use uibuttonstylesPrimary Secondary fn main

Aditional I dont know if it would be a good idea to be able to create macros for different types of widgets rust textblock text OrbTk verticalalignment center horizontalalignment center First I am not an expert in Rust and I do not know how they plan to structure this project when supporting android ios and ubuntu touch natively I think it would be good to separate the different platforms in crates this is useful for people with little knowledge in Rust and who want to contribute to this project smile I hope it helps Also I think it would be good to separate in features the crate of orbtkwidgets for conditional compilation Posible solution Crate Name Include by default orbtkredoxos heavycheckmark Internal crate orbtkwindows heavycheckmark Internal crate orbtklinux heavycheckmark Internal

of the examples and I noticed that I was not able to tab through widgets buttons text boxes slides etc Are there by any chance any plans for keyboard and general accessibility Add overlay widget to OrbTk Details check Overlay widget should be used to draw its children on the top x Absolute Layout x Overlay widget Access overlay widget from Context Add example
