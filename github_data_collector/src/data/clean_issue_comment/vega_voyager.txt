Hi Currently the React being used in this package does not support the newer React Is there a roadmap to getting this updated to support the newer React So that It can be used in newer applications kanitw Please X Check for duplicate issues X Describe how to reproduce the bug the goal of the new feature request Provide an example spec in JSON and if applicable screenshots or GIF videos eg using When using the latest development version of voyager alpha and embedding into a react application as advised in the readme I am finding the voyager chart to be very unresponsive I can drag but dropping does not work and if I click any button in the data sidebar nothing happens Hello I am trying to deploy voyager on Ubuntu server but I am experiencing issue when I run yarn build It is always crashing and I must reboot the server Steps of deployment are git clone voyager cd voyager yarn yarn build Dependencie yarn version npm version nodejs version v Ubuntu server LTD Please help Iveta Problem I tried to build from the master branch today and saw an error that says Node Sass does not yet support your current environment OS X bit with Unsupported runtime img width altScreen Shot at PM src Ive tried building using node v and node v and the same error persists The error message mentioned nodesass version so I went and checked which nodesass version I was using When I do a fresh clean clone of voyager and run yarn install in the nodemodules folder I get nodesass v This is the minimal version required by voyagers packagejson but it only supports till node v Solution Requiring the latest version of nodesass v as of today solves my problem I find this solution a bit surprising though because I thought yarn install would install the latest v xx version for me but that wasnt the case Sanity checks x Make your pull request atomic fixing one issue at a time unless there are many relevant issues that cannot be decoupled x Make lint and test pass Run npm run lint and npm run test x Make sure you have rebased to the latest master x Provide a concise title so that we can just copy it to our release note Use imperative mood and present tense Mention relevant issues eg When I doing simple example from tutorial import AfterViewInit Component from angularcore import CreateVoyager from datavoyager Component selector approot templateUrl appcomponenthtml styleUrls

Message is Cannot read property Close of undefined I understand this is simplistic attempts at import using standard JS May I suggest an CSV parser with stars MIT Licensed I have used it with solid results X Provide an example spec in JSON and if applicable screenshots or GIF videos eg using Uploaded sample CSV backfor Mcsvzip Please X Check for duplicate issues DONE X Describe how to reproduce the bug the goal of the new feature request Add a dataset from a URL Use it for some explorartion Click Change dataset only the Vega samples appear not the current dataset Refresh the window the dataset has vanished find grep csv finds no data on the server So is all data temporary via this dialogprocess Perhaps I am missing something X Provide an example spec in JSON and if applicable

to the right Currently scrollbar on fields occludes plus sign Image inline snip X Provide an example spec in JSON and if applicable screenshots or GIF videos eg using Using alpha Please X Check for duplicate issues X Describe how to reproduce the bug the goal of the new feature request Debian Stretch From alpha yarn test used GB of memory to run specifically at NODEENVtest node scriptsjestuijs Is this expected Seems very high for a test maybe I just need a larger server to run all tests X Provide an example spec in JSON and if applicable screenshots or GIF videos eg using Run NODEENVtest node scriptsjestuijs After seconds over GB of memory is in use by the test Error thrown FATAL ERROR CALLANDRETRYLAST Allocation failed JavaScript heap out of memory I cloned and checked out tag v alpha and ran yarn yarn build on Node v and had a build error v Object has no member named ForceSet It builds under Node v so Im assuming the officially supported version of Node is That should be mentioned in the README Im running Ubuntu bionic
