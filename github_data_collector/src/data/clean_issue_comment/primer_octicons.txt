 Updating the contribution guidelines a bit to send submissions to an issue Also updating the contribution language around this process primerocticons Hello the readme states that the SVG file can be downloaded here however when opening that link the only thing I see is this octiconsfigma But there is nothing I can do on that page excluding the signup Am I missing something here Or is it broken in some way Funnily enough when you stay on that page for a while you can see other peoples hand roaming around in the same confused manner I tried this in latest Firefox and Chrome on a Mac Thank you title image description heart glyph updates Outlining the heart in the glyph vs via css enables the stroke to be centered on the path without increasing the glyph frame dimensions Regardless of stroking method the inset point needs to be slightly rounded or the angle increases in an awkward manner This also updates the vertical centering in the frame to make it easier to align with text heart glyph diff detail There were a few unnecessary points on the path with some misaligned beziers that made it slightly bumpy rather than smooth infinity glyph proposalrationale This is for use on pricing pages for features marked as unlimited eg contributors repos etc linearrow glyphs These are based on the caretchevron symbols and are used on pricing pages to denote contains all of these features We also use the up arrow on small screens when the plans reorient to be verticallylisted cc katmeister Im trying to use Octicons as toolbar button icons within an Atom package I have installed octicons as a dependency of the package and now am able to use the SVGs like this in my stylesheet toolbarButtonsidebarTogglebefore content urlpathtobooksvg What I havent been able to achieve is to color the icons in the same stylesheet I assumed that something like toolbarButtonsidebarTogglebefore color red content urlpathtobooksvg might work but it doesnt I suppose the reason is that the SVGs are embedded but their code is not affected by the embedding documents styles Is there a way to achieve what I want I found ways to colorize using CSS filters but none of the filters allow to simply specify the color One can come up with suitable filter sequences but the colors Id like to apply exist as LESS color variables from Atoms theme ie they can change and the relation between color and filter sequence is complicated I have seen that the package exposes a JavaScript interface which among other things allows to access the actual SVG code which in principle would allow to inject a color or to create an SVG element within the document which can then be styled But if at all possible Id like to avoid programmatically changing document elements and stick to CSSLESS The octicon for issue notifications appears to imply urgency I dont have an origin story for this octicon but if I had to guess it would be something along the lines of A clever take on the letter i An issue being tightly coupled with a bug and therefore requiring urgentimmediate attention Can we explore introducing an alternative notification octicon for issues introducing i in place of This might be a personal issue but I notice while triaging a large volume of notifications my attention is unnecessarily drawn to when often times there is littleno urgency behind the issue itself iolsen pointed out to me that we never added the internalrepo icon to Octicons pmarsceill is the original designer and I added it to githubcom when we added the option for repos to be internal vs

here since this repo is public The website proposes to download the here but the link is broken GitHub uses an infinity icon and a linearrow on the pricing page and wed like to use them in signup Unfortunately it appears that marketing had to use a nonocticons set to make those happen Ive drafted up a couple icons to achieve the same stylistic goals while matching the octicons checkmark and x which are the mostused icons on these pages provided for context below The linearrow icon is derived from the chevron octicon and is already in use in a signup flow experiment and Id like to use the infinity icon in another one shortly I think this would be a particularly nice addition especially since itd let us support all of the cases on the pricing page too The circle shape is not circled enough and the animated rotation is not ideal This problem is the most noticeable when the spinning icon changes back to a static one Heres a jsfiddle to see it live note the circle edges floating around I tried to play with transformorigin but the main problem is in the shape of the circle
