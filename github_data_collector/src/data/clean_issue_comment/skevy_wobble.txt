The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

repo and language details I added a setValue function that acts as sugar for updating config and starting This is somewhat akin to setEndValue in rebound Name of method is totally up for debate Second I added a raf config option again name up for debate that stops step from registering its own requestAnimationFrames With raf false all spring advancing must be done manually That said I mangled the living hell out of step and advanceSpringToTime in order to get this to work It needs some cleaning up Perhaps step becomes what advanceSpring is now Usually in GL land steptick functions are called by your main draw loop to do whatever timebased advancing they need to do so thered be some parity to existing convetions that way Finally check out the squares demo I added again its messy If you watch the performance monitor heap allocation remains constant and theres only a single raf frame thumbsup Im noticing pretty bad GC sweeps every few seconds using a dozen or so springs I think the majority of this is coming from the objectclosure oriented way springs are updated via updateConfig updateConfigupdatedConfig PartialSpringConfig this thisadvanceSpringToTimeDatenow const baseConfig fromValue thiscurrentValue initialVelocity thiscurrentVelocity thisconfig thisconfig baseConfig updatedConfig thisreset return this For reference this SO answer details pretty nicely all the things that are going to allocate memory in js I havent looked too closely at advanceSpringToTime yet but I dont see any major culprits at first glance I like the minimalism of wobble and Id like to submit some PRs if you want to discuss alternative syntax here first to avoid the s Works well for a single spring but starts being a major performance snag having many Springs all calling requestAnimationFrame Using this in a webgl app targeting fps Is there a way to not have them all register their own raf on every step and instead manually loop each one Similar to how rebound does it I have a single raf callback that I do all polling updating and then drawing in Multiple rafs kill the performance I havent played with this library yet It seems interesting If there is GIF showing at least one animation from the library it will be awesome
