 hilistview cannot scrolling in scrollview Any solution When I press the button to expand the view I simply want the view to expand without me being dragged down How do I disable the focus down when I expand hi how can i change some attribute of each list item for example i want to change background in every odd list item my expandablebutton is a image arrow when i click it i want to change the it and set another arrow like to or to etc how can i do we use it like this below listsetItemActionListenernew ActionSlideExpandableListViewOnActionClickListener Ridxxx Ridxxxxx The problem is when i have many click ids and the click ids are added Dynamic how can i do My mind is not clear can you help me to summarize it for me Thank you for your help i have try setOnItemClickListener method for doing something when user click listview item like this playListViewsetOnItemClickListenernew AdapterViewOnItemClickListener Override public void onItemClickAdapterView parent View view int position long id onStartVideoposition but it did not work why have some else method to realize this setItemActionListener seems to work only when click action button thands to your help This improves the scroll animation which occurs after an item has been expanded a lot imho Not only it solves but also manage the special case in which the item is taller than the container ListView In particular after the item expands it makes some computation and then If the just expanded item is already fully visible nothing happens If it is bigger than the container ListView it is scrolled so its top bound is on top of the list If its top bound is out if the container ListView it is scrolled so its on top of the list If its bottom bound is out if the container ListView it is scrolled so its at bottom of the list I made this edit particularly because of case Im using items that when expanded can be really tall Not sure if other cases were already covered but Im quite sure I experienced issues also when items were smaller I tested it on the most recent API and on API and It works as expected in all cases I made the PR on top of your last commit and in a separate brach so you can merge with no problems Further improvement to make it perfect could be starting the scroll animation together with the expand animation ie in the onAnimationStart callback instead of onAnimationEnd Unfortunately this requires not only to get the end height in advance from the ExpandCollapseAnimation instance for example but also to take account of the old expanded item which in the meantime could be collapsing Ill work on it if Ill have some spare time its not critical for me atm It works well in my activity viewsBut It have multiple expanded items in my fragment viewThats my code mListView ActionSlideExpandableListView viewfindViewByIdRidfilepathlist footerView activitygetLayoutInflaterinflateRlayoutfooterloadmore null mAdapter new FileBrowserCursorAdapteractivity listmCurrentPath mListViewsetEmptyViewmEmptyView mListViewaddFooterViewfooterView footerViewsetVisibilityViewGONE mListViewsetAdapternew SlideExpandableListAdaptermAdapter Ridexpandabletogglebutton Ridexpandable mListViewsetOnScrollListenerthis mListViewsetOnItemClickListenerthis
