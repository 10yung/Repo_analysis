Config file Its sometimes useful to post contents of your configuration file If you do some make sure to mask out your phone number login id clientstatickeypair fdid expid otherwise you risk your account getting taken over Also please always post contents of your profiles configjson and not just a different path you pass to yowsupcli see What is inside a profiles configjson Versions Please include python version yowsup version yowsupcli version as well as versions for consonance dissononce pythonaxolotl and cryptography packages Some of this information can be obtained if you run yowsupcli with debug flag or through yowsupcli version If you are not using a released version but code directly from the repository please indicate the commit hash To Reproduce Include information about how to reproduce even if the problem is sporadic any hints about the environment would help Expected behavior A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen OS please complete the following information Which OS did you encounter the bug on Additional context Add any other context about the problem here Summary of Maybe the KaiOS FirefoxOS fork for low powered phones official WhatsApp client can give some insights how to make this work better By emulating it you might even be able to pretend being just a JioPhone user and thus make detection very difficult The app which seems to be pure HTMLJavascript has been made available for non JioPhone jailbroken KaiOS phones and the FOSS GerdaOS here see also Maybe it helps Registration status fail The output is here
