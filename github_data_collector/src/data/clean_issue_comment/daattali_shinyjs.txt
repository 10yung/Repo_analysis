I am trying to create a form and use a ClearButton to reset all my inputs once the user gets done filling a form I tried using the function reset shinyjsreset wrap the inputaddon into an exclusive

often want to see output from the R commands evaluated in runCode With this change the following code captured in the roxygen documentation now works properly shinyApp ui fluidPage useShinyjs Set up shinyjs runcodeUIcode shinyjsalertHello shinytagsbr shinytagslabelOutput textOutputruncodeoutput containerpre server functioninput output runcodeServer For example In using runCode I keep running into problems because my systembrowser is automagically converting single and double quotes to the equivalent UTF open and close pairs When the string is handed to R for evaluation it gets unhappy For example typing this manually in a shinyjsruncodeUItypetextarea shinyjsalert Boo and then clicking run yields Oops that resulted in an error Try again Error unexpected input shinyjsalert It would be helpful if runCode converted the UTF openclose quote symbols back to appropriate standard ASCII singlequote characters Hi Dean long time no see I cant say that enough your package is awesome The only thing Im currently missing is the support for Shiny events Right now Im implementing king of a busy indicator which can be easily setup with a custom JS code as shown in the example Yet it would be really great if something along the following lines would be possible what do you think Cheers Andrzej r libraryshinyjs shinyApp ui fluidPage useShinyjs divid loader server functioninput output onshinybusy showloader onshinyidle hideloader When trying to add onclick events to multiple selectizeInputs in a for loop I ran into strange behaviour Doing the same using lapply looked works perfectly fine When using a for loop the result is that if I click the first input the value of the second input is set to Clicking the second input also sets the second input to I expected that clicking the first input would set the first input and clicking the second input set the second input This is what happens when I use lapply In my real code I have a lot more inputs and there when using the for loop always the last input gets set to no matter which one I click To me this seems to be a bug but I might be missing something libraryshiny libraryshinyjs ui fluidPage useShinyjs

shinyAppui server related to but only one function doesnt work and makes importing both difficult r rawNamespace importshiny except runExample rawNamespace importshinyjs except runExample Would you consider renaming it to runJsExample This looks like a function used mostly interactively so this change shouldnt introduce downstream problems Just a simple function to play a sound from a Shiny app Licensing note the MP file I embedded for the example is public domain from here Hi Dean Im only a few hours in to learning your project With your simple PageCol example if I run the ui fluidPage scenario then everything works nicely across browsers Firefox included However if I use a wwwindexhtml file for the UI which I require for creating a custom Dashboard and do the extra steps required then the example code works nicely in RStudio and Chrome but not Firefox Please see attached screenshot for the Firefox console errors Have you come across this issue before in FF Hopefully its reproducible I would welcome any insights or suggestions img width altfirefoxconsoleerrors src My Shiny App file structure is globalR serverR wwwindexhtml serverR libraryshiny libraryshinyjs jsCode

with Joe at the shiny devcon he agreed that using V only as a parser is overkill and I should try to write my own parser Its not a simple job but Ill leave it here as a potential TODO All I want is a way to parse the provided JavaScript filetext and extract all the shinyjsfoo names from it and itd also be nice if it validated the javascript
