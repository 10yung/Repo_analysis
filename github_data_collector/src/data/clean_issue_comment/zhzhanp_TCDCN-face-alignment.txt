 Thank you for sharing your nice work I would like to use your implementation in my research but it is essential for my purposes to train the model myself Is there training code with instructions available Thank you In the TCDCN paper the filter weights are not spatially shared I want to implement the network in caffe but caffe seems to not support the locally shared or unshared weights Can you share your implement details of this part And which deep learning toolbox do you use Hi I want to detect The facial feature points for different datasets that for example have images How can i estimate a facial bounding box because each image want a different bounding box Hi Im getting following error Undefined function bbApply for input arguments of type char Error in TCDCNpreProcessingppreProcessing line TCDCNmainpmain line Error in demo line mainlistFileNamemodelFileoutputFileName
