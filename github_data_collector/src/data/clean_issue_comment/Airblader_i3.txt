windows and the wallpaper The texture stretches across my primary monitor and is initially only a few pixels tall about If I mouse down inside a window or change focus to another window the height of the texture increases If I mouse down or mouse up on the wallpaper the height of the texture will increase for both events Every time the height increases the contents of the texture change The height of the texture will only increase up until it reaches the y coordinate of After it reaches this height its contents do not change when I change focus or mouse updown The height of the texture resets to its initial height if I change the parent container to tabbed mode and back to split mode ie toggle gaps xprop reports that the texture has a class name of i frame where as much more information is
