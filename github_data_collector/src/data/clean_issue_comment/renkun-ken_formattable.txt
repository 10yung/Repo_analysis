Hi I had a query dont know where to ask Can we use formattable with crosstalk Is it also possible to use datatables crosstalk and formattable together renkunken Ive produced great results very quickly with this package but now I am stuck Is there a way to globally adjust the row heights in a table Ive tried adding a style rule across all columns but it seems that I can only adjust the left and right padding Changing the top and bottom padding has no effect Is there some other way to control this parameter Thanks Im trying to produce a table showing CAPEX on a persite basis However there is an error that keeps appearing when I include a particular site Code appears in between two numbers Here is the code chunk formattableTopNSitesTable align c listRank Diff formatterspan icontextsapplyRank Diff functionx if x arrowdown else if x arrowup else Rank Diff BusinessType formatterspanTopNSitesTableBusinessType R PGBV formatterspancurrencyTopNSitesTableR PGBV digits CPGBV formatterspancurrencyTopNSitesTableCPGBV digits Difference formatterspancurrencyTopNSitesTableDifference digits Any thoughts on this The addition of unicodebidi plaintext in to fix placement of symbols has an undesirable sideaffect where in some browsers it breaks the direction of text causing RTL alignment to change to LTR image Above is a screenshot of output on different web browsers with versions with manual hack removing the unicodebidi attribute from the table Source of output also available here at JSfiddle Minimal reproduceable example is given with r libraryformattable librarytibble testtbl tribblecolA colB colC colD Test Behaviour a Good b Good c Browser dependent d Browser dependent formattabletesttbl listTest colorbarFA B I built a table using is formattablex aligncllr Trying to output it as HTML using formattable the alignment parameter is lost because the formattable does not check my is object for align data it is just a parameter of the function A workaround is to explicitly reuse the align format from the parameters formattableis alignattributesisformattableformatalign Is it possible to format a whole table row based on the value in one of its columns Hi I asked this question on stack where I was looking to achieve the usage of colortile rowwise and the answer provided which works great librarytidyverse libraryknitr librarykableExtra libraryformattable setseed df dataframeletters letters foo rnorm bar c baz rnorm bash rnorm stringsAsFactors FALSE fori in nrowdf df i colortilepink lightbluedf i df kableescape F kablestylinghover fullwidth F columnspec width cm addheaderabovec Hello World However what I would like to do now is to expand the use of colortile towards colours in a traffic colour gradient redyellowgreen Here the solution isnt very effective if I use red and green as parameters to colortile as the central colour is brown I tried adapting this answer however the manner I am using colortile is different than the one in the question as Im implementing the function rowwise in a loop and I get numerous errors Was wondering if you guys would know of a workaround it would be greatly appreciated Hello I have a column of numbers c etc and I want to use the colortile function to color them proportionate between the range of c rather than the default which is used cminx maxx Is there any way to do this Thanks Hi there I am using formatter function into the formattable package and it works great But Id like to use proportionbar into formatter for a same variable but it doesnt work Here is my code formattableeval list areacol cTrimestre Trimestre Trimestre Trimestre proportionbarclightblue Moyenne proportionbarclightblue Moyenne formatterspan style x stylecolor ifelserankx green gray x sprintf f rang f x roundrankx The result But I would like to apply the proportionbar to my last variable Moyenne to see the proportion AND to have sprintf f rang f as the value for my column Any ideas Thanks a lot When the value for colorbar is small relative to the length the bar the text seems misplaced In the image see Nova Scotia Increasing The is placed to the left of the bar Newfoundland and Labrador Increasing The is misaligned with all the other numbers in its column Is this the desired behaviour It may well be Im new at most of this If this is correct how can I stop it from happening screen shot at pm
