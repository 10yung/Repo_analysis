Hello I just created an animation with facets using tmap The frames are representing single timestamps So far everything works fine The only issue I couldnt solve is that each facet in each frame has an adapted colour scale range I want to fix the colour scale range so that the values are visually comparable over time By the way I think this should be default with an option to set an argument freescalesfillframes TRUE Is that somehow possible Or is there any workaround Thanks a lot Hi When I try to modify a layer of county labels using tmtext I am able to use the function in tmapmodeplot but when I switch to view mode the formatting of the text goes away Any ideas Thanks Adam When saving a plot as pdf with tmap the result file does not keep the spatial information of the shapes or rasters used is there a way to include it Command used tmapsavemmapresultmappdf I also posted it on Stack Overflow Hi I would like to have control of several overlays with only one displayed at a time Weve done this in the past with raw leafletR see Rthreehospitalmodelshtml There will be other layers that can coexist What is the correct way of placing layers into base groups vs overlay groups in tmap In addition is there a way of controlling initial choice of visible layers Thanks Hi mtennekes When I export an animation with tmapanimation as an mpg there are some very noticeable compression artefacts Is there a way to adjust the export quality or turn off compression gif looks fine suggesting its compression rather than a problem with shapefiles The attached screenshots show the problem theyve been scaled up but otherwise unadjusted Below is the relevant log file Linking to GEOS GDAL PROJ Version ImageMagick Q x Copyright ImageMagick Studio LLC License Features Cipher DPC Modules

Thanks Phil Screenshot Screenshot Hi I was creating some maps with lines and text and I found this weird behaviour The following should be a reprex of the problem First I create some data with lines and text r packages librarysf Linking to GEOS GDAL PROJ librarytmap create some fake data mysfc stsfc stlinestringmatrixc ncol byrow TRUE stlinestringmatrixc ncol byrow TRUE stlinestringmatrixc ncol byrow TRUE stlinestringmatrixc ncol byrow TRUE mysf stsf dataframemytext c geometry mysfc Then I create the map and everything is fine r tmshapemysf tmlines tmtextmytext size alonglines TRUE Warning Currect projection of shape mysf unknown Longlat WGS is assumed The problems occur when I try to modify xmod and ymod to move the labels since in this case they do not preserve the alonglines TRUE option r tmshapemysf tmlines tmtext mytext size alonglines TRUE xmod c ymod c Warning Currect projection of shape mysf unknown Longlat WGS is assumed supCreated on by the reprex package v sup Is this a bug If not is it possible to solve the problem Thanks When using leaflet one can assign highlightOptions to the different layers to make them pop when hovering Is there a way to achieve this with tmap Ive seen this multiple times when trying to teach tmap at least times in the last few weeks People have a lot of trouble remembering that the syntax is different tmap instead of tm It would be much better for usability if this function also started with tm Apologies if there are good reasons this doesnt make sense but I love the way tmap makes it easy to make thematic maps that mix raster and vector data including support for sf and very intrigued by a lot of the functionality of stars in working with rasters Is this in scope for support in tmap Thanks for considering For a cont styled raster with custom breaks label alignment is unexpected when using scientific notation with a fixed number of digits This seems to be because the leftaligned string has leading white space Is this intended or was the intention for digits to just define the number of significant digits in which case perhaps the white space should be stripped out R libraryraster librarytmap r
