Stripe automatically sends upcoming or billing invoice to customers but it doesnt mention for which plan or subscription its going to charge Weve tried to configure at Stripes dashboard but didnt find any setting or option that could add subscription detail plan detail in invoice template Any help or guidance how should we proceed Thanks SubscriptionSchedules save fails due to both defaulttaxrates and taxpercent being present on existing phases Example code Creates a subscription schedule with at least one phase schedule StripeSubscriptionSchedulecreate fromsubscription sub Some arbitrary modification schedule This fails due to both defaulttaxrates and taxpercent being present on existing phases schedulesave r obstripe cc markostripe remistripe cc stripeapilibraries The biggest difference I can find is that we no longer output null for optional fields in comments Should we I dont think it should be too hard There are a few other comment regressions like diff property Stripe Collection reversals property mixed reversals Feels on how important those are to fix Should be doable I have an issue with following Stripe StripesetApiKeyENV STRIPEKEY invoices Stripe Invoiceall limit invoicescount always returns even if when I iterate over results it clearly shows more records countinvoicesdata returns correct number of Reproduce with php phpcsfixer rulesnativefunctioninvocation fix allowriskyyes phpcsfixer from Details Integration branch for the new client services PHP API x New StripeClient class x Add AbstractService and a couple of concrete services x Fix CouponService deletion test x Add FileService x Add namespaced service x Add service with methods for nested resources TODO many things cc remistripe Pretty experimental yet but it works I will polish this up and split it into smaller PRs Sample syntax php requireoncevendorautoloadphp Instantiate client stripe new Stripe StripeClientsktest Retrieve method coupon stripecouponsretrievemycoupon Create method namespaced resource issuingCard stripeissuingcardscreate authorizationcontrols maxamount Custom method namespaced resource details stripeissuingcardsdetailsic Update method nested polymorphic resource updatedPaymentSource stripepaymentSourcesupdatecus card metadata key value stripestripephp v When updating an object to unset metadata Id expect setting the metadata key to null to unset it But null doesnt have any effect unlike with the Stripe Node SDK and instead an empty string is required This has no effect php Stripe Customerupdate customerId metadata somemetadatakey null This unsets somemetadatakey php Stripe Customerupdate customerId metadata somemetadatakey InternetJones from the stripe IRC agrees that unsetting via null would be a little more expectedconsistent behaviour It would be very handy when working in an IDE such as PhpStorm if the docblocks for object properties reflected their simple and expanded state Take the Subscription class for example and specifically the Subscriptionlatestinvoice property whose property is documented here It would be great if that was instead php property stringInvoice latestinvoice This would inform the IDE that it may either be a string or an Invoice object I understand docblocks are slated for some point in the future Im making this purely to be helpful and to track this specific need for that time I think the Stripe ApiResponse should be psr compliant for easier integration in frameworks that handle psr responses like Laravel Symfony and others What do you think
