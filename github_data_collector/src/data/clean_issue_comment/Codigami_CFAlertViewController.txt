It should be nice be able to change action button text font as parameter See preview img width altScreenshot at src Hi The CFAlertTitleSubtitleTableViewCellxib and CFAlertViewControllerxib files have CFAlertViewControllerDemo setup as the Module instead of CFAlertViewController It works in the demo for obvious reasons but when importing into other projects it doesnt Small oversight while testing New Issue Checklist x I have read and understood the CONTRIBUTING guide x I have read the Documentation x I have searched for a similar issue in the project and found none Issue Info Info Value Platform Name ios Platform Version CFAlertViewController Version Integration Method cocoapods Xcode Version Xcode Issue Description and Steps It would be nice to have the possibility to change some alert properties dinamically from a background thread while the alert is visible to the user eg title message Sorry for asking a probably mundane question here but would there be a way to set the statusbarStyle to lightContent for CFAlertViewController Im forced to use controllerbased status bar appearance because I need to hide the statusbar in an unrelated VC and the rest of my app uses lightContent statusbars I tried extending CFAlertViewController like so swift extension CFAlertViewController open override var preferredStatusBarStyle UIStatusBarStyle return lightContent but that didnt change anything Issue Info Info Value Platform Name eg ios Platform Version eg CFAlertViewController Version eg Integration Method na yet Xcode Version Xcode Repro rate Repro with our demo prj YES Demo project link Issue Description and Steps Dynamic text settings on the device are ignored these are becoming more common in iOS I had a few requests for support for this from users after I only partially implemented dynamic support myself in an app refresh messing up a few screens I think it should be fairly simple to add as the code already supports scrolling if text becomes too large and line wrapping if the headings are large I think it would just be a case of changing the font used in most places Any plans to add this shardul The android counter part has the above features Any plans on adding it to iOS
