Federico writes I am using the alluvial R package to generate some plots for my research work and I am very happy about its semplicity and the nice figures I get from it I found some problems using the ordering argument in the alluvial function When I pass a list object to the ordering argument in a three axes data frame list object with three numerical vectors I only get the order I expected to the first axes but not the second and the third I had a look at the source code alluvialR in GitHub and I found a solution working in my case by commenting lines and replacing line with r a i and replacing line with o ordering i Actually I did not understand exactly how that part of the code works but in my case the abovementioned edits did the job Hope this feedback may help you to improve the package The matrixaesthetics branch includes the option of singleton vector or matrix assignments to the four aesthetic parameters col alpha border and hide Except for some quirky code to combine the col and alpha assignments they are all treated the same way using the internal flowmatrix function In ggalluvial ive taken to calling the alluvial segments flows I tried a bunch of different input styles which seem to hold up Since the examples include a variety of inputs for these parameters it didnt seem necessary to include specific ones in a testthat script Though im glad to add any extra examples or specific tests if youd like to see them Currently ribbon aesthetics eg color transparency border can be applied for each row in the data frame In other words given that there are k variables to be plotted and n combinations of the values of these variables it is only possible to set color for n ribbons However each ribbon consists of k segments It would be nice to be able to set aesthetics to every one of nk segments What would be the most userfriendly way to specify these aesthetics This is related to and Ideas A list of length nk with dim equal to cn k with each component being a named list of arguments to the splineplotting function Many thanks for the great work Currently each xspline represents a single row in the source dataframe Is it possible to split the xspline into segments each one between two consequent columns This would allow assigning different colour to each segment eg depending on the location of the segment in the whole xspline I need this in my work to highlight transitions between two specific categories Regards anassal
