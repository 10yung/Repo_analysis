Hi I am getting an error while installing the package RNeo j It pops up that there are other build tools need to be installed But all the tolls mentioned in the url are installed in my MAC Downloading GitHub repo nicolewhiteRneo jmaster usrbingit clone depth nohardlinks recursesubmodules varfolders d g kdj sd kl wydp gpTRtmpaLNr Lremotesca fdb ba nicolewhiteRNeo jeea ac neokit Cloning into varfolders d g kdj sd kl wydp gpTRtmpaLNr Lremotesca fdb ba nicolewhiteRNeo jeea ac neokit Error Could not find tools necessary to compile a package Could you please let me know if I missed any steps Thanks In RStudio I got the error below when connecting R with Neo j vis HTTPS protocol graph startGraph username xxx password xxx Error in curlcurlfetchmemoryurl handle handle schannel next InitializeSecurityContext failed SECEUNTRUSTEDROOT x The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted Same issue was raised back in and it seems like Nicole addressed it by specifying sslverifypeer Basically Nicole set an option that skips verifying the SSL certificate I am wondering if same issue as in surfaced again or I missed anything Thanks Its great that you can filter the list but unfortunately you can only filter by complete strings Changing the getLabeledNodes code to accept starts with ends with contains would improve usability Currently you can do the following getLabeledNodesgraph LabelName attribute searchvalue to improve functionality this could be altered to accept up to parameters still ensuring only one attribute is filtered on getLabeledNodesgraph LabelName attribute starts with sear getLabeledNodesgraph LabelName attribute ends with alue getLabeledNodesgraph LabelName attribute contains chva a Functionality Ask for userpassword b Encode userpassword c READ ONLY option blocking creation and updates If for some reason the R script will be shared with other users would be nice to have an encoded string to provide the authentication and READ ONLYREAD WRITE access to the DB Access Key The graph connection object could transport the the readwrite property to the other functions b Even it could be very easy to decode the Base encoding for most regular users those characters wont make any specific sense Is it possible to add a functionality equivalent to the one provided by popotojs following the API authentication protocol popotorestAUTHORIZATION Basic dHdlZXQ cGFzc dvcmQ Basic is a prefix dHdlZXQ cGFzc dvcmQ equivalent to tweetpassword GFzc dvcmQ dHdlZXQ c equivalent to HTTP API Authenticate to access the server Authenticate by sending a username and a password to Neo j using HTTP Basic Auth Requests should include an Authorization header with a value of Basic payload where payload is a base

duplicates TRUE or getOrCreateRel createRelalice KNOWS charles props duplicates FALSE createRel In this case duplicates with default value TRUE to not modify the actual functionality in previous

Following one of your examples I tried to create a retweet with two labels due the retweet is a copy of a tweet I want to have it in two different categories I tested manually the use of multiple labels following Then I tried to replicate the same functionality in R createNode has the possibility to create multiple labels createNodetheGraphcTweetReTweet Is it valid getOrCreateNodetheGraphcTweetReTweet and getUniqueNodegraph cTweetReTweet name Alice Maybe Im confused and I have to use two different statements for each label to create the nodes but which would be the best option to retrieve unique nodes with multiple labels In the code I have something like addConstrainttwGraph Tweet id addConstrainttwGraph ReTweet id getOrCreateNodetheGraphcTweetReTweet I checked the code on getOrCreate and calls node trycreateNodegraph label TRUE createNode has the possibility to create multiple labels createNodegraph functiongraph label character query CREATE n

first key value pair listed in must be uniquely constrained for the given node label Im confused I am trying to install the package from the terminal as root using the devtools and I am getting this error below Could you please let me know how to fix it I have already googled and tried the suggestions but still is not working I know it must be about the gcc lib version but I can not fix it Thanks
