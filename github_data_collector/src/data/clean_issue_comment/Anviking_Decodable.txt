Will there be new version of Decodable supporting swift Use preferred capitalization of CocoaPods Change ErrorProtocol to Error Fix typos Fails with No Such module as Decodable But when I run it installs fine and can distribute the app to appstore too import protocol DecodableDecodable Error This is an experiment to see what happens when we remove all existing functionality and rely on Swift s Codable instead x Remove all existing functionality x Create a few overloads this initial implementation is likely ssuboptimals complete nonsense though Update tests Investigate how different usecases of eg DynamicDecodable would be translated subclassing JSONDecoder Would it be possible to gracefully migrate our syntax to rely on Swift s Codable instead Would there even be a point in doing that yes I have an array of dictionaries each with a Type field that is used to determine which struct should be used for decoding it Currently I have some unsupported types I would like to just ignore those and keep parsing the rest of the array instead of throwing an error and cancelling the whole parsing operation at one point I also dont want to end up with a dummy object just for the sole purpose of returning a nonnil object in the decode function Is there anyway to do that with the latest version Swift includes a built in Decodable protocol Tried to build my project in Swift Xcode and got naming conflicts all over the place Obviously its early but wanted to bring this to everyones attention Im not sure what development of this library will look like in the future but figured this issue could begin that conversation Thanks So many times I did have situations with JSONs For example json with Events json enddate T Z name Session startdate T Z enddate T Z name Session startdate T Z enddate T Z name Session startdate T Z So decoded struct should look like swift struct JsonReposne Decodable let events Event static func decode json Any throws JsonReposne return try JsonReposne events json but this will not work Workaround is to put JSON into dictionary and pass that dictionary swift static func decode json Any throws JsonReposne let data data json as Any return try JsonReposne events data data Maybe this is worth adding to Decodable itself
