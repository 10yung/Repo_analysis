As the topic says I am getting this error when starting the installation I have installed osmc on it and a plex server imagen Hello I have set up a Pi with PiHole and OpenVPN using pivpnio All is working perfectly and the extensive information Ive found in forums has been very helpful Ive run into an issue The default ip scheme in OpenVPN is and Id like to change it to as this is a second Pi on my network serving the same purpose I have modified the openVPNconf file server push dhcpoption DNS and my remote testing system connected via vpn receives a x address and connects fine It is able to resolve local dns systems Ive added to dnsmasq but not anything outside of my network Internet The log file for pihole shows the following Dec dnsmasq query A wwwraspberrypiorg from Dec dnsmasq forwarded wwwraspberrypiorg to Dec dnsmasq reply wwwraspberrypiorg is Dec dnsmasq reply wwwraspberrypiorg is but the remote system errors out This site cant be reached wwwraspberrypiorg took too long to respond ERRCONNECTIONTIMEDOUT Hopefully Im not missing something simpleIve searched quite a bit and havent found any similar informationsolutions Futher info Kernel IP routing table Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface UG eth U eth U tun I am unable to ping my gateway which leads me to think that it isnt routing from vpn gateway to gateway then out to the Internet Thank you for your help Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Yes When I decided to change my Public DNS Address to the one I desired to use instead I wasnt able to located nor edit the Defaulttxt text file in the directory stated in the answer etcopenvpneasyrsapkiDefaulttxt NOTE this may be because I am trying to perform this operation on my Raspberry Pie Describe the solution youd like As I rummaged through my etcopenvpn folder I found the serverconf file and was able to access it and change the appropriate settings detailed above Describe alternatives youve considered NA Additional context For some reason I wasnt able to edit the contents of the serverconf file without going into the terminal and sudoing the edits myself In other words from the home directory just copy and paste this into the terminal sudo nano etcopenvpnserverconf Then just edit what you want Thank you all Aviel In raising this issue I confirm the following please fill the checkboxes eg X X I have read and understood the contributors guide X The issue I am reporting can be replicated X The issue I am reporting can be is directly related to the pivpn installer script X The issue I am reporting isnt a duplicate see FAQs closed issues and open issues Describe the bug The if statement at Is always evaluated to True as an echo will always produce a new line even if a var is empty To Reproduce Just try this part of the script alone binbash if echo availableInterfaces wc l eq then IPv devavailableInterfaces echo No interface specified but only IPv dev is available using it else echo No interface specified exit fi Expected behavior Script should bailout if it cant find any available interface as well Additional context found this while reviewing test branch code Will be submitting a fix for this today latest tomorrow Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe On test branch when choosing VPN Protocol user should do yes for wireguard or No for OpenVPN Describe the solution youd like Instead of of a yesno selection a radiolist defaulted to wireguard would be better and more intuitive Describe alternatives youve considered Instead of Yes or No Buttons or radio list having buttons wireguard and OpenVPN can be good as well however not really sure how to do it with whiptail as i am not that good with it Additional context na In raising this issue I confirm the following X I have read and understood the contributors guide X The issue I am reporting can be replicated X The issue I am reporting can be is directly related to the pivpn

problem Please describe Yes once PiVPN install process complete if the static IP params are not removed the Pi will not reconnect to mesh network So we must remove the dhcpd added lines Describe the solution youd like Offer a choice to set a static IP or not If user select Yes the actual way to configure is continuing if NO is selected it continues like a nonraspbian device do Describe alternatives youve considered None Additional context We use RPI over AREDN mesh network to provide Internet access to certain in mesh devices Configuring static IP in PiVPN just keeps the device out of network on reboot We use DHCP reservation instead of fixed IP because in case of IP collision IP of the nodes can be changed to mitigate problems I have followed the process out line in how to add multiple ports say and in UDP and TCP for load balancing etc but is it not loading all the etcopenvpnconf files and openvpn is not listening on the additional ports I have configured with each conf file The varlogopenvpnlog shows only the serverconf file loading Is there an updated process for the Buster kernel release of Raspbian Hello thank you for that great installation script But I ve got an issue with it I set up an openvpnserver with TCP because I had a few problems with UDP in the past When I use the public ipaddress I don t have connection problems But when I use the public domain of my FritzBox the following message is shown in the terminal while connecting to the vpn SIGUSR connection failedsoftinitinstance received process restarting Restart pause seconds Although I can connect to the vpn and use it it takes some time to establish the connection I searched the internet but the result weren t very helpful So how can I solve that problem Thank you for your answer in advance Creating this to keep track and in case community wants to help out with Distro Testing Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Master Branch is currently supporting a lot more distrosVersions than Test branch some getting deprecated others still LTS Test branch needs to be tested in different versions of raspbian Debian Devuan with both OpenVPN and Wireguard to make sure all is fine and then added to the list of supported OS Describe the solution youd like Test with different systems and report back results Describe alternatives youve considered I personally like to quickly disregard older versions however in this situation at least LTS should be supported Additional context Na
