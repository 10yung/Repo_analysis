 Description utilsnlpmodelsbert is outdated and not supported anymore removeupdate related tests remove utils update examples Other Comments Description Biweekly release Checklist Go over all the following points and put an x in all the boxes that apply If youre unsure about any of these dont hesitate to ask Were here to help x My code follows the code style of this project as detailed in our contribution guidelines CONTRIBUTINGmd x I have added tests x I have updated the documentation accordingly Description The test machine runs out of space as pipeline data builds up Other Comments Description Describe your expected feature in detail The code and yaml file for the tests are available in the repo To test the tests create AML subscription and workspace first then execute the pipeline Expected behavior with the suggested feature For example Adding algorithm xxx will help people understand more about xxx use case scenarios Other Comments Description My machine has GPUs and I wanted to split them into two training jobs Is it possible I found the parameter to specify how many GPUs to use but not their IDs Therefore each job competes to use the GPU with the ID instead of the ones that are idle Please advise Other Comments Description I am following Text Classification of MultiNLI Sentences using BERT to train a binary classifier on my data One thing special about my data is that the training labels are noisy Following the paper on weak supervision training one solution is to use noiseaware loss function I think it could be realized by allowing a weight to each training sample so that each sample is weighted differently when computing loss But I didnt find anyway in the code to add this ability Note that this is different from allowing weights on each label class as in CrossEntropyLoss Other Comments Description Changed the order of moving a model to a device and constructing the optimizer ref Related Issues Checklist Go over all the following points and put an x in all the boxes that apply If youre unsure about any of these dont hesitate to ask Were here to help x My code follows the code style of this project as detailed in our contribution guidelines CONTRIBUTINGmd x I have added tests I have updated the documentation accordingly Description The contents of two notebooks under sentimentanalysisabsa absaipynb and absaazuremlipynb are the same Expected behavior ie solution No duplication Other Comments Description Describe your bug in detail pip installing utilsnlp brings none of the dependencies After installation I ran into a dask issue then a toolz issue related to needing dask dataframe And after the toolz issue I ran into unknown module transformers setuppy should include dependencies dask dataframe transformers There is a bug with the repo when tranformers is above that version number How do we replicate the bug pip install the repository without installing the requirements Please be specific as possible use a list if needed For example Create a conda environment for gpu Run unit test testtimerpy Expected behavior ie solution For example The tests for the timer should pass successfully Other Comments This behavior can be avoided with some of the requirements being listed in setuppy system specific requirements can be omitted but the above requirements are not system specific and fail most code paths Description Describe your expected feature in detail Expected behavior with the suggested feature For example Adding algorithm xxx will help people understand more about xxx use case scenarios Other Comments
