containerisation of zeppelin easiest way to run for sure So Id like to tweak your Dockerfile to do some stuff slightly different but when I clone and try to build the container locally I get the following Have you seen this before Im not behind a proxy so this should work Is this a docker networking issue Or the Zeppelin build is indeed dodgy ERROR Failed to execute goal

file to this docker I tried to add it to Zeppelin conf spark conf external folder and nothing happened it just ignore it although I added export ZEPPELININTPCLASSPATHOVERRIDES to zeppelinenvsh file I also added the relevant mariadb jar for that and still nothing Thanks for the help D Currently the version installed by this docker image is python Is there any plan to upgrade to If not do you know what this would entail on the end of someone consuming this docker image
