Will get this merged this week and we should push a patch to npm so that this change is reflected in our web font CDN CSS Sorry for the delay Originally posted by chrissimpkins in I was attempting to patch Hack using althack however before I did so I wanted to make sure that a default git clone of this repo a make ttf would work Doesnt seem to be doing the trick I checked out the dev branch and it seems to install fine from there so not exactly sure what the issue is in the master branch that is causing it Heres the full output from a clean git clonemake ttf of the master branch buildttfsh

uni touch x Unable to execute ttfautohint on the HackRegular variant set Build canceled make ttf Error Please let me know if you need anything else Im still running macOS Problem Uppercase the character for U A Latin capital letter T with comma below looks at the moment like U Latin capital letter T with cedilla Lowercase the character for U B Latin small letter t with comma below looks at the moment like U Latin small letter t with cedilla Details Found on the Font Playground on viewed with Chromium Version Official Build Built on Ubuntu and Firefox Quantum bit running on Ubuntu bit Relation to the Design Targets nonASCII not subjective multiple all fontsizes crossplatform Evidence Proposed Solution I propose to have the comma below implemented like it has already been done for the related characters U Latin capital letter S with comma below and U Latin small letter s with comma below Context The with cedilla version started to be used instead of the with comma by necessity in the times before the with comma version was included into fonts and into Unicode This change would help align the Hack font with Unicode by using glyphs which correspond to the descriptions of the character codes References See the References and External links from paren Windows Visual Studio pt Parentheses are misaligned slightly when they are colorized In the above picture it looks like the red parentheses popped up a little more I tried to build customized Hack dev branch with MinGWw environmentI used Git Bash shell but problem was same and faced following errors In file included from hbftcc hbfth fatal error ft buildh No such file or directory include ft buildh woff sfntc In function main woff sfntc error OBINARY undeclared first use in this function setmodefilenostdout OBINARY These errors dont stop building but it seems that there are some compatible issues with mingw Attempting ttfautohint hinting Warning Option w G is deprecated Use option a qsq instead This font is not a valid font in SFNT format with TrueType outlines In particular CFF outlines are not supported Unable to execute ttfautohint on the HackRegular variant subset Build canceled This error stops building and occurs while attempting hinting to subset fonts pic In IntelliJ IDEA left bracket is thicker than right bracket in pt I dont have so much knowledge about font rendering but Im guessing the cause is area is darker than area bracket bckt Ive tested in VS code and result was same in there Environment Windows screen In many monospaced fonts the shape of the curly single quotes U U and curly double quotes U c U d is the same as the shape for the comma Its the case for DejaVu Sans Mono upon which Hack is based Source Code Pro inconsolata and others In Hack however the comma and the semicolon are very roundish but the curly quotes keep the squareness of DejaVu Sans Mono Examples quotesdejavusansmono quotesinconsolata quotessourcecodepro quoteshack U A U B These symbols are used to denote the ascending and descending nodes in orbital mechanics and I would love to have them in hack Id like to have a memory icon however the one from Font Awesome uf results in different glyph Adding this icon would be appreciated This is a useful character for representing a space in a visible way Id love to have it in Hack
