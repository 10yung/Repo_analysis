My need include a tool to allow the end users to monitor this set of containers as part of an application which is deployed as a set of containers managed via dockercompose Ideally I would be running lazydocker as one more container within the app stack no need for lazydocker to display or manage other servicescontainersimages present on the host apart from the ones related to the current app no need for lazydocker to create containers modify containers config So far I have included Portainer as a selfcontained container monitor solution along with my application stacks but it seems to include too many features that do not apply to my case manage vs monitor not be tailored to monitor a single set of containers running on localhost as much as monitoring different hosts and on each manage all container resources So far I managed to achieve a good part of what I need by adding to my stack a container that can run lazydocker and docker mounting into it the root dir of my dockercompose file What is missing imho documentation the current readme and docs do not make explicit the differences in behaviour that exist between running lazydocker on the host and running it within a container docs or changes to the existing lazydocker container so that it is easier to use it in a way that it can find an existing dockercompose project on the host an easy way to allow lazydocker to filter out unwanted imagesservicescontainers by usage of tags Describe the bug While attempting to build lazydocker on my Pinebook Pro the process failed on step with The command binsh c

many containers running and it is difficult to find the one or several of them Describe the solution youd like Hope to achieve similar commands docker ps grep xxx docker ps containerid volume Same as above Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Log Timestamps take a lot of space in the UI It would be nice to have an option to hide them or change their format Describe the solution youd like A config to hide timestamps Describe the bug Lazydockerlazygit just exits on really fast scrolling To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Go to lazydocker Scroll with MX

the last project that I started using dockercompose is shown and I am unable to figure out how to switch to other running projects CleanShot at Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe If you run lazydocker but docker engine is not started you get a weird error output An error occurred Please create an issue at errorswithStack error during connect Get open pipedockerengine The system cannot find the file specified In the default daemon configuration on Windows the docker client must be run elevated to connect This error may also indicate that the docker daemon is not running homecircleciprojectmaingo x b d usrlocalgosrcruntimeprocgo x fc usrlocalgosrcruntimeasmamd s x For a casual docker user it is not clear on the first sight that docker is not running Describe the solution youd like As a user I would like to see a straight message that lazydocker can not connect to docker and I would like to receive a hint that docker is not yet started Error Could not connect to docker In the default daemon configuration on Windows the docker client must be run elevated to connect This error may also indicate that the docker daemon is not running For a detailed error message a verbose flag would be a good idea Describe alternatives youve considered Keep it as it is Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Currently if projects are running on a machine they are both shown under the current project which is assumed to be named the current working directory and isnt always correct Describe the solution youd like List of current projects are shown so they can be viewedmanaged independently Describe alternatives youve considered Not sure what else could address this Additional context I think this may not be possible until this issue is addressed Hi I was wondering if theres a way to configure ports for a container in lazydocker Currently I have been using kitematic to configure ports by click on container click on Settings click on HostnamePort configure port accordingly It would be convenient if that can be done in lazydocker I watched the lazydocker tutorial and I learned that there is a way to edit lazydocker config but not the config of the container itself Im getting a German language interface because of my mostly German settings My LCMESSAGES is however set to enGBUTF which of software respects Sadly it appears lazydocker does not For now I will workaround with LCALLLCMESSAGES lazydocker
