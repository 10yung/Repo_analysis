Hi Laurae Congrats with this superb library With few observations xgboost some times returns the same probability to each one and having the same probability with different labels makes getmaxacc report the inverse of accuracy the max threshold also is incorrect if we assume that positive obs are threshold not To reproduce it getmaxaccrep c It gives accuracy with threshold Thanks for your time I am having trouble installing Laurae Laurae into Rstudio version I write into R devtoolsinstallgithubLaurae Laurae And receive the following error Error in readdcfpath Found continuation line starting modeling at begin of record I have found another user having trouble with a different package but am unsure how to apply the solution to my answer Cheers Hello Laurae thanks for your response earlier about my question about emulating daForest This time I have a question sort of related to validationdataNULL in that I want to make sure I understand how to properly do training testing to try to avoid overfitting I tried running CascadeForest and got excellent results on training and held out validation data where I knew the labels but when I applied the model to test data exclusive of my train validation data and where I did not know the labels but the contest website gave me my score the model did not perform very well So I believe I am overfitting Basically I trained CascadeForest using dtrain dvalid like this CascadeForesttrainingdata dtrain validationdata dvalid traininglabels labelstrain validationlabels labelsvalid Where dtrain labelstrain predictor columns known labels of my total training data dvalid labelsvalid predictor columns known labels exclusive of dtrain the other of my total training data My AUC was something like when I then predicted on dtrain and also when I predicted on dvalid So that made me happy and I then applied the predict function to dtest which is exclusive of dtrain and dvalid and where I dont know the true labels but I submitted my predictions to the contest website and got a AUC not nearly as good as So that made me think I should use crossvalidation in CascadeForest like this CascadeForesttrainingdata dalltrain validationdata NULL traininglabels labelsalltrain validationlabels NULL Where dalltrain is all my training data and labelsalltrain is all my known labels for all my training data But I got the error as noted in validationdataNULL I have not yet tried the solution you suggest to fix the lines of code to work for crossvalidation but is this the proper way to do crossval Then if I get a good AUC indicated by the model on crossval dalltrain and then apply the model to dtest then that is the proper way to try to avoid overfitting and I should hope for a better score Thank you very much Hello Laurae this is is not an issue per se but a questionsuggestion is there a way to create the function of daForest using your cascade MG scanning algorithms Thank you daForestpdf Trying to install the Laurae sparsity package so i can convert from sparse matrix to SVMLight however i keep getting this error message Installation failed Timeout was reached I am behind no proxy and have all dependent packages installed Ive also tweaked around with optionsdownloadfilemethod with various methods but to no avail Searched the web tried everything and still no success Is the package still available for download and installation Im using R version platform x w mingw arch x os mingw system x mingw status major minor year month day svn rev language R versionstring R version nickname You Stupid Darkness Hi I try to set validationdataNULL but after Layer it stops by this message Error in alloccoldt lengthcolnamesdt lengthcols alloccol has been passed a NULL dt Could you help me Thanks
