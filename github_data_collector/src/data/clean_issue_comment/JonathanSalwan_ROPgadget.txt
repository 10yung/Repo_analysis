 ROPgadget binary dbghelpdll badbytes d ropchain Unique gadgets found Error ROPMakerhandlerArch Arch not supported yet for the rop chain generation ROPgadget v Version ROPgadget v Author Jonathan Salwan Author page Project page dbghelpdllzip This is an x binary Attached Hi I added a silent option which disables printing during analysis The flag is off by default in order to keep the current behaviour This is handy when integrating ropgadget into my own scripts in a programmatic manner to not clutter the output Hi I used patterncreate with peda a lot and I could redirect its output to a file for example and run the program with that file as input however I cant find the same functionality in pwndbg cyclic from pwntools is great but is there a way to redirect or pipe its output For now copypaste works but I was wondering if there was another way maybe a way to do cyclic run or cyclic filetxt Best Florian Now multibr is off by default we are missing vital gadgets like syscall ret int x ret call xxxxxxxxx ret Since the documentation Enable multiple branch gadgets is too vague I didnt understand it before I read the source code And I dont quite understand why it is off by default I think we should provide as many gadgets as possible and let users decide what to use right Especially this option affects so much i am trying to built ropchain on bit pe file but its giving bit instruction set only Excuse me Can ROPgadget support ELF on RISCV architectures zachriggle wuyongzheng During recent Hitcon Quals Ive noticed that gadgets ending with syscall are not found It does not work even with version which is supposed to support it ROPgadget version Version ROPgadget v Author Jonathan Salwan Author page Project page ROPgadget binary vdsodump grep syscall Running objump on the binary objdump Mintel D vdsodump grep B syscall b b b e mov eax xe b f syscall edb c df mov rdir ede f syscall It does not work regardless of Elfraw mode Attached is vdsoso base encoded vdsob txt When buildings ropchains for shared objects how does aslr is bypassed by your tool Also what does Error Cant find a writable sectionmeans By calling sysexit directly from Argsparse which is called from the constructor you make it difficult for one to programmatically build args I would suggest instead having parse raise an exception This could be explicitly handled in any caller the only one in your library itself being the CLI It would basically be changing exit lines to raise Exceptions instead and ropgadgetmain to catch this exception Instead of printing the error message directly you could of course also pass the message to the Exceptions constructor and print it in main It seems that we should never see the following x ldp x x sp x ret adrp x x c add x x x c add x x x str x x ldr x x str x x ret Note that there are two ret gadgets The full sequence per objdump is f f c a ldp x x sp c c f d ret f adrp x add x x add x x c f str x x f ldr x x f str x x c f d ret
