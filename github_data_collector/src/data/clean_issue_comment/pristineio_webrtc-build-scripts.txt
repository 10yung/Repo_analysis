 I have no idea to how to fix it in this project Cloud someone help me to fix this Tks I want to compile an android version but encounter some problems when executing buildapprtc Here is the outcome Setting up build environment for Android Export the base settings of GYPDEFINES so we can define how we want to build User has not specified any gyp defines so we proceed with default ARMv with Neon

preparegypdefines executebuild Hello First thank you for your effort in providing the build scripts and are really very helpful I tried to build WebRTC libraries for armv and x platforms I noticed that some files are generating and some files are not generating Below files are generating libjinglepeerconnectionsoso audiodevicejavajar basejavajar libjinglepeerconnectionjar Below files are not generating libboringsslcrso libcsharedso libprotobuflitecrso libbasecrso Console Log Please suggest me what I am missing Am I missing any dependencies I installed BoringSSL library and tried again But even though the above files are not generating Thanks in advance Regards Chandramouli Hello I am working on a streaming app of screen sharing To share my screen I am getting continuously the video stream into CVPixelBuffer format I want to adapt my video source to take my CVPixelBuffer variable instead of my local video device Does someone know how to custom the video source please Thanks Eric Hi can I still use these scripts if I need to build an old revision of the webrtc library for iOS Thanks When I run a compiled Apk on my Android phone its wrong orgappspotapprtc EAppRTCMobileActivity

Please change buildsh files commands from GYP to GN for future building of webrtc ios i am facing a lot of problems and hurdels in building webrtc ios Due to GYP i am getting the following errors Running ninja ninja Entering directory outiosx Releaseiphonesimulator ninja fatal chdir to outiosx Releaseiphonesimulator No such file or directory Im try build the libjinglepeerconnectionAndroid by my self its ok to build but I cant see the VideoCapturerAndroid VideoRendererGUI class Something wrong in here How should I do can build them thank you I am trying to create a local media stream in my iOS webRTC app See code below let localStream pcFactorymediaStreamwithLabel ARDAMS let audio pcFactoryaudioTrackwithID ARDAMSa localStreamaddAudioTrackaudio var device AVCaptureDevice for

source videoSource localStreamaddVideoTracklocalVideoTrack selfpeerConnectionaddlocalStream localVideoTrackaddlocalVideoView Everything works but when after I add the localVideoView to the localVideoTrack I get an error RTCI Frame nativeHandle unrecognized selector sent to instance x Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInvalidArgumentException reason RTCI Frame nativeHandle unrecognized selector sent to instance x All of the code is running on the main thread and the app has the appropriate permissions and plist keys When I walk through the code line by line using the debugger everything seems to be running correctly This code was taken from the ObjC AppRTC demo it has just been converted to swift I cant seem to find the difference between my swift project that crashes and the working AppRTC project Any idea what I am doing wrong I am testing on a bit device Thanks
