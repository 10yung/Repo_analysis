Just wanted to let you folks know you have all done some amazing work and I want to thank you for your contributions to this project I dont know what happened back in January and I cant easily explain the mysterious things that have seemed to happen since then but Im willing to provide and share what I have been relentlessly developing I studied a lot of Michaels scripts in addition to the scripts here on Master my goal was to create an installation utility that works without needing to use the MDT GUI I managed to do that and included AD integration WG selection credentials testing and validation registry creation recursion enabling multiple deployment shares including details in the GUI I put together to compile a live working version of BITS with either standard MDT or the PSD Master Ive emailed Mr Niehaus a few times and though Im certain hes on the cuff about what Ive done or continue to do Ive thrown everything I could think of at this process Im now sharing Im sure theres quite a bit that I didnt do right Im certain I may have even upset some people with the level I went to make a point or to create this Seems to be a recurring theme in my life or in general Fact of the matter is Im out of steam And frankly I feel as if Im much less fighting entropy and much more just fighting myself at this point Sort of falls under diminishing returns and I could use some help I hope the principle of what I managed to do is what matters most Doubleclicking on a Task Sequence in the PSD Wizard creates duplicate entries nested below the selected Task Sequence If a space is present in the path of the MDT installer file the resulting arguments being passed to MSIEXECEXE will not be correct and will prompt the following Removing the space from the path allows the installer to install MDT FixedStandardized capitalization spelling errors punctuation and grammarComments LogVerbose Messages Reworded some phrases for clarity Expanded cmdlet aliases for readability dir GetChildItem where WhereObject foreach ForEachObject Worked through all files except for scripts folder The WritePSDInstallLog Message on line of the NewPSDWebInstanceps file refers to now exiting elsewhere this phrase precedes a break command but here there is none I dont know enough about whats going on to figure out if the log output is incorrect or if there is a missing break The user is able to hit the OK button to start the imaging process on the TS Selection pane even if the user hasnt selected a Task Sequence This results in the process failing The image attached shows the error While WinPE looks to see if the missing files from ADK are missing would it be an easy fix to have those files auto added by the hydration kit if it detects ADK If not could we get a URL to the file location to make the users life a touch easier If you leave off the ISO file extension in the hydration pack the installer cannot find the file and throws errors but does not cause the script to fail If there is an existing ADK installation left running in the background the ADK installer throws a error which causes the hydration script to fail There is an error In ADK and ADKPE detection Here two functions works in FRFR and enUS OsCulture ADKADKPEdetectionzip
