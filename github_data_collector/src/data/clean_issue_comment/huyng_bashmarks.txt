Xin ch o link is dead Could you fix it Current version mandates installation in local This change would allow the script to be installed in say usrlocabin Hi I use bashmarks all the time and it is extremely useful to me Feature request a shortcut to set the current directory as a bookmark without typing the name I would have a list of directories that function as work places I frequently navigate to Every time I have to set a bashmark as in cd myverylongworkingdirectory s myverylongworkingdirectory cd towhereIwasbefore The shortcut would be to simply state s cwd where cwd is the name of the current working directory that is parsed to remove characters that bashmarks do not allow The cwd can be anything else it need not be cwd as long as bashmarks recognise it as the current working directory A trivial feature but one that will be useful to some Thanks The original touch SDIRS command fails if a user has a path with spaces This isnt super common but has happened to me on one of my machines found this fix and thought itd be a good thing to add Hi when using ZSH with his Git alias plugin the g alias is already taken to link Git command Chaging g to go see line sed d t becomes sed d t With this commit you can list bashmarks that start with a certain text by passing that text to the list command For example l drill Usersroublesdrill drillfoo Usersroublesdrillbar drillbar Usersroublesdrillfoo frontend Usersroublesgitpagingalfred srcmainfrontend git Usersroublesgit and now if I want to list only the bashmarks that start with drill l drill drill Usersroublesdrill drillfoo Usersroublesdrillbar drillbar Usersroublesdrillfoo Also the list function now supports tab completion to show the best matching bashmark Gurus This tool is great and I think more value can be added if we can show a numbered list and allow users to jump to a directory based on the number This is similar to how you run the history command you see a numbered list of history commands and then you can use n to re run a particular command Similarly l foo Usersroublesfoo bar Usersroublesbar fubar Usersroublesfubar nada Usersroublesnada alice Usersroublesgitalice bob Usersroublesgitbob And then users can use something like n and jump to Usersroublesgitalice n pwd Usersroublesgitalice This simplifies the workflow a lot the current function l is typically aliased to something else on Ubuntu Whats the recommend way to alter the alias for bashmarks with modifying the code ie l lll I use yadm to manage my dotfiles across many different systems The current mechanism they have for managing files that are different are symlinks so for example sdirs default sdirsclassA special oneoff system ie different andor extra bashmarks A yadm alt command will link sdirs sdirsclassA or sdirs sdirs based on configuration The current bashmarks will stop on the symlink during a s and my guess d Possible solution to see if SDIRS is a link if so follow it to the real file change if n SDIRS then SDIRSsdirs fi touch SDIRS to if n SDIRS then SDIRSsdirs fi tmpreadlink SDIRS if n tmp then echo Updating sdirs tmp SDIRStmp fi touch SDIRS
