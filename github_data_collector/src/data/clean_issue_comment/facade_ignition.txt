When a ViewException is thrown naturally the error page says ViewException Would it be possible to replace that with the actual exception Of course we can look in the stack trace to see which exception was really thrown but this could be more useful Ignition is producing a lot of unnecessary output when debugging unit tests Is there an easy way to just display the PHP error and stacktrace and disable Ignition when running PHPUnit Hey Guys I get the following error message at irregular intervals I have to delete the specified file manually then the correct error page is displayed Maybe that would be a solution Thx Daniel Im trying to publish to view errorPagephp so I can add some nonces to the script tags to allow inline execution Is it possible to do this Right now I enable CSP headers locally so I can thoroughly test the policies but this causes the ignition error pages to white screen Refused to execute inline script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive scriptsrc self unsafeeval reportsample cdnjscloudflarecom polyfillio noncelimPubnAgNzzrXJGElhOOkumznqYNyiP Either the unsafeinline keyword a hash sha pUoCk oQT wzDlWLeNglgiRHfP hm I gIdzgd HxQ or a nonce nonce is required to enable inline execution This PR is similar to I just ran into a test that failed because somewhere in a controller it fails a safety check and calls abort The test fails with the following message Response status code is not a redirect status code Because this message isnt very useful i decide to dump the TestResponse Doing that currently shows something like this The exception message is at the top of the html which means I have to scroll through a lot of inline javascript before seeing useful information about the error This PR adds the exception message to the bottom of the html so that dumping the TestResponse immediately shows useful information Its a shame that Ignition is being used by Laravel its awful how slow it is compared to the old exception page when using automated Browser testing with screenshots like Dusk we cant see the entire name of a long View file switching this class forces the text to wrap which allows us to see the whole file in the screenshot This is my composerjson require php doctrinedbal fideloperproxy guzzlehttpguzzle laravelframework laraveltinker shalvahlaraveljsend requiredev facadeignition fzaninottofaker laravelui mockerymockery nunomadurocollision phpunitphpunit I cannot understand what causes this error and I cannot diagnose Hey friends Do you have plans working on this soon The hostname info should be included in the context tab as it is quite useful in multiserver environments
