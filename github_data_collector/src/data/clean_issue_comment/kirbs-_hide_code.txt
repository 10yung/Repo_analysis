Hi First of all Id like to thank the contributors of Hide code It is an excellent extension for hiding codes when exporting notebook as html files But recently I met a problem about the format in the exported html files In fact all the letters with accent marks like etc were exported with a bad format Here is an exemple to show the issue that I had The output that I wish F ri s The one I had in my html file F ri s Could some one tell me how to solve this problem please Thanks a lot Best wish ouy Steps to reproduce create a notebook rename a notebook Observed result error FileNotFoundError Errno No such file or directory old name Observed result No error Win Firefox bit Python hidecode Steps to reproduce create a notebook with spaces in the title test space choose export to HTML check the name of the downloadable file download is not required Observed result The file named after first part before space an extension is missed test Expected result The full title is used or at least HTML extension is present test spacehtml Win Firefox bit Python hidecode I installed hide code and also all prerequisites as mentioned I am able to export the notebook to HTML format but not PDF It shows Internal Server Error I have been following similar issues that had been raised before in the platform but unfortunately I could no get my issue resolved I ran in the normal scenario where it was throwing the error mentioned above Then following various other issues raised I ran jupyter notebook NotebookAppserverextensions hidecodehidecode but still I could not understand the root cause of it However ran the above code for once and clicked on the button to export it as PDF and the output of it generated on the prompt is shown below base C Users Sachin Nandakumarjupyter notebook

Hi there This is a really great package Im having some export issues Here is what i tried when i click on the export buttons for pdf html etc i get a page not found error img width altscreen shot at pm src NOTE this error is fixed if i launch jupyter from the directory where my files live But often im not working in that directory Its a nice fix for now however noting this issue If i try to use the CLI to run this jupyter nbconvert to html createlegendtestCopy ipynb the output html file still has the code plots etc that i have hidden so it ignores the metadata to hide things note that i did save the file and confirmed the tags were in the cell metadata Any ideas why this might be happening id be pretty excited to use this in my classes the students create reports Many thanks Hi When
