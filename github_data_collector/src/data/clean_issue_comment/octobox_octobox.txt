 Proposal What feature youd like to see Id love to see Octobox manage which repositories Im watching not watching ignoring or have set to releases only Id like Octobox to manage this setting for my GitHub repositories using the same filtersrules Octobox offers to manage my notifications today Specifically Id like to have a list of rules perhaps regex or even just substring matches for various fields on a repository When new repos are created or even on a regular schedule Id like to see Octobox apply those rules on all repositories in a specific GitHub organization so that I know Im always watching the correct repos Motivation I enable Automatic watching in GitHub settings It offers these two features When you re given push access to a repository automatically receive notifications for it When you re added to or join a team automatically receive notifications for that team s discussions I spend a lot of time reviewing notifications from new repositories and deciding whether to continue watching them or unwatch them Especially repositories that are created and deleted as part of a CICD pipeline for GitHub applicationsintegrationswebhooks Id love to delegate that work to a tool like Octobox Pitch Let Octobox take the work out of managing your watched repositories Do you ever realize youre missing notifications from an important repository you didnt know existed sometimes follow a notification about being subscribed to a repository only to discover it was already deleted build a GitHub application or createdelete repositories as part of an automated build pipeline constantly manage watching and unwatching on a large large GitHub organization Let Octobox help Setup rules to enable Octobox to automatically watch and unwatch new repositories or existing repositories on a specific organization Never worry about missing your notifications on repositories again Related issues questions about Octobox behavior on unwatched repos features on repos I own vs repos Im watching unwatching for specific organizations filtering specific orgsrepos This is a small sample I suspect quite a few other issues exist that could be addressedimproved by a feature like this Proposal What feature youd like to see Link to issues on github on issue view menu view Motivation Not everything renders correctly in octobox and stuff is squashed it would be useful to jump an issue out and see it in the original context Pitch A link from the issue number displayed in the view to its actual page would make it easy to jump out and use the full github setup rather than cramped in a sidebar Proposal What feature youd like to see A new filter to allow filtering by issue number eg issue or a go to issue shortcut Motivation I maintain a Rubygem RSpec that has a large backlog of issues Id like to tackle soon and want to keep an on theyre often edgecases that require time for a small improvement but I dont believe in abandoning them and I have currently a large amount of book marks holding this information Pitch Being able to look up an issue by number is great for converting old todo lists into starred inbox items currently I cant find some older issues prehaps they have no notifications stored but would like to star them and use octobox as my go to management tool Are you experiencing this issue in octoboxio or your own instance octoboxio X My instance Summary of Problem What are you trying to do Starting octobox with docker compose in a container What happens The container fails to start with an Illegal instruction instruction error that seems to originate from the ffi gem See a fuller log here What should have happened Ocotobox starting normaly It used to but a few months ago after pulling a new image it started failing Steps to Reproduce the Issue Im not sure how to reproduce this as this only happens on my personal server The same image version runs properly on other machines Versions Operating System and Hardware Which versioncommit of Octobox are you using Running the latest tag of the docker image with the b be b digest Ive pulled the newest version once in a while the last couple of weeks trying if it would work again but so far no success How are you deploying Octobox Docker Heroku Openshift etc Docker that is running Ocotobox is running on a CentOS machine with latest packages and Docker version build bf a I didnt file this as a bug because it probably is not directly an issue with Ocotobox sassc might also just be a manifestation of the issue but with both assumptions I could be totally wrong The Docker setup instructions do not show how to run the test suite with the dockercompose command Ive successfully set up the app and started the Rails server with the following command which is in the instructions GITHUBCLIENTIDyourclientid GITHUBCLIENTSECRETyourclientsecret dockercompose up build What is the dockercompose command for running the test suite It should be added to the Docker setup instructions Having trouble installing Be sure to check out the installation docs Are you experiencing this issue in octoboxio or your own instance X octoboxio My instance Summary of Problem What are you trying to do Use octobox for my public repositories What happens Notifications on from private repos are displayed they are properly disabled and with the message to upgrade if you want to be able to see the actual notification What should have happened Should I dont know if this is me missing something or should be a feature request I expected to be able to disable reposorganizations so I dont have an in inbox that half of the entries are private because it includes my work organization which I dont want Am I supposed to be able to disable specific orgs Disable displaying private notifications Also I have not installedenabld the github octobox app for the work organization so that isnt it Maybe it is because Github only lets you route organization notifications to different email addresses but not disable web notifications by organization Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above A repo got renamed and the URL changed The name change was picked up but the URLs for issues and PRs has not so all the notifications point to the old URI part which is no longer valid Are you experiencing this issue in octoboxio or your own instance x octoboxio My instance If your issue is related to an Octoboxio subscription purchase please ensure you have installed the Octobox GitHub App for the repositories concerned Problem Notifications which came in before the name change now link to a on github Goal The Notification URLs should be rewritten when a change in repo name is detected Possible solutions When a repo name change is detected check issue URLs and update accordingly Steps to solve the problem Create a repo Create an issue Rename the repo or change its URI part Try to access issue via octobox Supersedes Description Creating a superset of our own logic even just a single thing to further distinguish GitHubs vague reasons in the Notifications API aka didnt prove to be a good solution for seeing open review requests There were many times things didnt line up There are too many different moving parts to the state machine that is reasons for a notification and ultimately the information contained there isnt as important as the actual current state of the subjectwhich leads us to here These changes sync requested reviewers as did but with team review requests as well and focus on the state of the subject and not at all about the notification reason This aligns much better with How Octobox currently works for basically everything else and GitHub because we arent interpreting any differing state fighting with the semantics of the Notifications API Its currently being tested at HashiCorp and weve had much much better results this time around due to the simplicity of it UX A new state filter is added to the sidebar for individual review requests on your user something thats applicable to anyone Team review requests do not have their own sidebar states See considerations below for more A URL filter is available to use manually and for future considerations teamreviewrequestedoctobox Fsecurity Both individual and team review states are fully integrated in to the search syntax reviewrequestedchrisarcand would be all notifications with a PR awaiting review from me teamreviewrequestedoctoboxsecurity would be all notifications with a PR awaiting review from the Octobox security team Both filters can have multiple commadelimited values and both can be negated Both of these filters match the existing syntax on GitHubs end but are underscored see considerations Instead of their own sidebar states with the search syntax above you can create your own pinned searches for the GitHub teams youd like to monitor This pairs very nicely with since pinned searches are just as good as the outofbox set youre given Considerations On not having dedicated sidebar states per team review request Simply put this is to avoid having to add the logic of syncing a users GitHub teams with Octobox This can be done but I dont have the time at the moment and theres plenty of consideration to be had for howwhy wed want to do this With pinned searches the functionality I want is there without taking on this syncing This work can be easily built on top of if team syncing is a thing anyone wants to do later On search syntax Technically the search syntax isnt exactly GitHubs GitHub does something weird in that it mixes both underscores and hyphens Example reviewchangesrequested reviewedbychrisarcand note keys are hyphenated and values underscored The syntax for this feature in Octobox is the first where we have a multiword key The search syntax logic we have doesnt currently support hyphens it thinks its a negation and mangles it and it wasnt something I wanted to bother digging in to especially since its sort of nice that its just all underscores now Hence reviewrequestedchrisarcand typepullrequest Proposal What feature youd like to see Some PR and issue threads have more comments than can be displayed on one screen I can navigate to a PR or issue and open it with the keyboard but Id like to be able to navigate between comments in the thread Motivation Pitch This will improve efficiency by not requiring users to switch between keyboard and mouse Are you experiencing this issue in octoboxio or your own instance x octoboxio My instance If your issue is related to an Octoboxio subscription purchase please ensure you have installed the Octobox GitHub App for the repositories concerned Problem I love this project and it has become essential to my day to day work Thank you very much for all your hard work on this I pay my subscription through opencollective and yet regularly notifications from private repos are hidden with Private notification on upgrade to unlock After some time and many refreshes this goes away and notifications are shown properly again This happens on both my laptop and phone so not environment related
