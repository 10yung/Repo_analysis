Describe the bug Issue in skipRows with headertrue strictColumnHandling truemaxRowssomenumber Parsing or Formatting Formatting Parsing Parsing To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior js const csv requirefastcsvparse const rows header header n col n col col n col n col col n col col n col col n const stream csv parse headers true skipRows strictColumnHandling truemaxRows onerror error consoleerrorerror ondatainvalid row rowNumber consolelogInvalid rowNumberrowNumber rowJSONstringifyrow ondata row consolelogvalid JSONstringifyrow onend rowCount consolelogParsed rowCount rows rowsforEachrow streamwriterow streamend Expected behavior i am accepting the output like this Invalid rowNumber row col valid header col header col valid header col header col valid header col header col Parsed rows but actual output given is Invalid rowNumber row col Invalid rowNumber row col valid header col header col valid header col header col Parsed rows Desktop please complete the following information OS WINDOW OS Version eg Mojave Node Version Additional context i am executing your code of skiprowsexamplesjs with some modifications strictColumnHandling true and maxRowssomenumber i am doing wrong or its there an issue v introduced a breaking change import csv from fastcsv const parser csv parseStreamstream headers true encoding utf cannot read property parseStream of undefined I think your documentation should include that headers are handled case insensitive when specifying them as an array however if not specified as an array they are handled strictly case sensitive This had me confused for a few hours Also when specifying headers as an array if they are not in the correct order or have columns missing no error is given and no data is processed An error only appears when too many headers is present not too little I think this should be mentioned in the docs as the only thing mentioned is You may alternatively pass an array of header names which must match the order of each column in the CSV otherwise the data columns will not match however I think it should read otherwise the data columns will not match and NO DATA WILL BE IMPORTED Let me know if you agree thx Im exporting some data from an SQL database and while LibreOffice Calc can import the data just fine fastcsv fails For example one line is exported as CSV like this Item NamebgColor fgColor and the parser fails as it thinks that the field is and expects the next char to be a semicolon The parser should continue until another delimiter is matched then see if all escape chars are even If the escape chars are odd then the delimiter is supposed to be part of the field value and the parser keeps on going Test cases should ensure that helloworld hello world helloworld hello world delimiter within odd escapes helloworld hel lo helloworld hel lo world next char is not a delimiter helloworld hel lo world The condition should be if next char is escape then increment escape count and buffer else if next char is delimiter then if escape count is odd then increment buffer else set next field value and reset buffer else increment buffer
