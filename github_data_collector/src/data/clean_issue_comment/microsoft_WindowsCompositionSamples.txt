I want to adapt your code to my own project but in code WindowsCompositionSamplesSampleGallerySamplesSDK ThumbnailLightingThumbnailLightingxamlcs I feel confused about the code in Pageloaded event there is a call for UpdateEffectBrush and then in UpdateEffectBrush there is a call for SetImageEffectimage and then in SetImageEffect first Code CompositionEffectBrush brush effectFactoryCreateBrush problem is effectFactory is an object without an instance Before this code I did not find any instantiations of this object Where did you complete the initialization before Pageloaded Can you answer my confusion Thank you Issue Type Please check one of the following with an x to indicate what type of issue you re submitting x Bug Report Please search GitHub for a similar issue or PR before

Sample request Documentation issue or request Other Please describe Question I found it is a little pain to write code about drawing keyframe animation if it have a complex path say curving as I need to enter every single geometry point Is there a specific class that enable devs to define a path which includes geometry data that enable the animation drawing along with those data so that we dont have to hardcode the geometry point one by one I did some research about Win D and Composition and there are several Path related classes but Im not sure whether those are referring the same Path as I do since they refer more about drawing the geometry shape Issue Type Please check one of the following with an x to indicate what type of issue you re submitting x Bug Report Please search GitHub for

starts to lag till the ListViewItemPresenter pointer animations are fully executed This only happens with small shapes in my case a x px area Expected Behavior If filing a bug tell us what expecteddesired behavior is If suggesting a changeimprovement tell us how it should work The app shouldnt lag Steps to Reproduce for bugs Provide a link to a live example or an unambiguous set of
