 this is a draft My PR adds BreadthFirst Search and Max Heap Sort add BreadthFirst Search code Heap code add description add README fun TComparableTshuffleitemsMutableListTListT val rg Random Random for i in itemssize val randomPosition rgnextIntitemssize val tmp T items i items i items randomPosition items randomPosition tmp return items This algorithm doesnt shuffle it correctly not every permutation is equiprobable You have to do val randomPosition rgnextInti to fix it More information the merge sort result is always null or empty I just googled for a Kotlin Stack class and found this library id like to open this up for discussion things that are currently undefined no POM was there ever any intent or success with git submodule add no packages declared in the kotlin source curious things happen with root package in jvm no README declaration of whether this lib attempts pure java or js stdlib inconsistent due to junit imports in the same hierarchy as the source code tests are nice but this lib is inconsistent id like to use the simple Stack class and go back to playing with my own project but my inclination is to suggest one of the active maintainers provide one or more or pom gradle and raw git submodule imports with package hierarchy chosen git submodule add KotlinAlgorithm into srcmainkotlin does not imply a pleasant packagename but theres no reason it could not be robust as a git submodule for now im fine cutting and pasting these gems but had to scratch my head a minute to figure out what is going on an unexpected cost
