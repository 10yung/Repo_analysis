so right now we update after all functions complete maybe we can update RPROMPT after each function completes basically if we find the gitstatus env var use that I noticed that this issue has been open for a while and decided to try implementing it after reading the gitter There are a few issues right now but Im mostly looking for feedback before putting more effort into it Namely Customization options for colors Customization for state text State doesnt redisplay after executing command maybe precmd hook Should the plugin automatically activate bindkey v Zshell has the ability to go into vimode with bindkey v settings If you are using ohmyzsh this feature can be enabled by including the vimode plugin However the interest with geometry is to port the visual indicator over vimode implements its own visual indicator function vimodepromptinfo where it toggles between vimcmd and main mode indicating NORMAL and INSERT mode respectively The request here is to include the visual indicator as a plugin in geometry Thank you in advance cc fribmendes desyncr
