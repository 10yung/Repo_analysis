We create albums in Microsoft OneDrive by creating a new folder in the pictures folder These show up fine in the files viewer and I can see the different albums but they dont show up in the photo albums view here Clicking on all photos does show the photos in those albums Not sure if this is a limitation of the way photos are supported on onedrive or the result of not populating some field on upload After testing master to see if it fixed the errors I had seen transfering contacts Google Microsoft and reporting behavior here on I figured Id try another transfer type to see how that fared I tried transfering mail Google Microsoft I tried with a Google account with lots of mail I see a lot more output here compared to the contacts transfer but unfortunately lots of Exception stack traces The transfer is still running and at this point I dont see any mail in assuming thats the right place to look I pasted lines of logs at There are a lot of mentions of things like comgoogleinjectProvisionException Unable to provision see the following errors Error in custom provider javalangIllegalArgumentException Hiya I have a client that would like to use DTP to transfer data to a Solid data pod I see that there is some code in here related to transferring contacts tofrom Solid which appears to have been started by bwillard who I met once at MyData Hi Brian The thing is I cant figure out how to use it when running the DTP Demo docker container using Running Locally docs I have created a public instance of the DTP Demo to test with I expect hope to be able to follow these steps Go to Choose contacts from the data type dropdown Click Next Find Solid in eitherboth of the from and to Choose a Service dropdowns But instead I only see Microsoft and Google I looked into the Angular app and I believe I learned that these options come from the TransferService which requests this API Solid isnt listed in here either All this leads me to believe that perhaps the solidrelated code from portabilitydatatransfersolid isnt activated or exposed in the API at least by default and in the build for the docker hub container image Does anyone know how I can make use of the Solid transfer extension for DTP Ideally I would see Solid as an option in the transfer contacts API I would see solid as an option in the demo angular app I could create transfers tofrom Solid using the API Appreciative to anyone who donates attention and help bengo Hey there Im so glad this project exists Thanks for working on it and helping me out Im wondering if its possible to run the datatransferprojectdemo container image from docker hub but in such a way that it listens for http requests not https This is because Id like to access the running container through a reverse proxy that Id prefer speak http to the application Currently when I follow the instructions for Run Locally and then issue an http request like this I get an error curl html headtitle The plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS porttitlehead body bgcolorwhite centerh Bad Requesth center centerThe plain HTTP request was sent to HTTPS portcenter hrcenternginx center body html Of course curl k works but only because of k Id like to be able to run the image such that the above request succeeds with an HTTP response I can see in here that its possible to configure the application such that useHttpsfalse But AFAICT this yaml file has to be built into the jar file that is run by this docker container and that jar file in the docker hub image is preconfigured to have useHttpstrue Im a noob when it comes to Java Is there any way for me to run the docker hub demo image in a way that useHttpsfalse For example by setting an environment variable andor mounting a custom configuration file If not would it make sense to add this as a feature to how the app boots up I could pass an env variable pointing to my own common config yaml file or alternatively env variables for each config like useHttps In lieu of advice or such a feature the only way I can think of doing this without buildinghosting a custom image is to somehow override the container images command to unzip the appdemoserveralljar contents edit configcommonyaml or apiyaml to add useHttps false rezip the jar run the jar as the image otherwise would Thanks for your advice Currently AppCredential keys are assembled in different ways between the transfer worker and the api On the API the names are automatically derived from the service name On the transfer worker they are fully written out We should write a Util class which calculates the keys based on the service name and use it in both the API and the transfer worker In the photos importer albums are always prefixed with Copy of I know theres a TODO to i nize it but it would be nice if there were a way to omit the prefix altogether Were planning to ask users to supply a name for the new album and dont want Copy of prepended to that Its possible tools might want to name the albums themselves eg Flickr Export October Thanks for considering this They have a drive API maybe they have one specifically for photos as well We recommend googlejavaformat in the developer documentation for the project but we do not currently automatically check contributions for code style We should add a Travis CI step to check the formatting on each pull request Developer
