Hi Swipe doesnt work on iOS Any idea how to fix Hey I dont know is there any one pod like this one with swift support Thank you Is there a way to not have the scroll view animate Id like it to transition to the next image at a specified duration without the animation Basically I would like it to animate similar to this Android library Id like to setup the SwipeCell with some insets so I would be able to change where the content should begin Is it possible with the current API I get the follow project warning for Xcode hi I want to change swipe direction Right to Left inset of Left to right is it possible i mean if index the it shows the rightest view and by default load the rightest one for RTL languages Many people depend on this software Please find a couple people that have made positive contributions to the project and give them commit access Then define the scope of this project so they execute your vision correctly Then good things will happen Hi I am using your library and i have encountered i strange behaviour When i push a view controller that contains a swipe swipeView as soon as try to populate my list of views inside the swipeView in get an exception in method setFrameForView line centerx has NaN value It only works if i populate my list at the viewDidAppear Not on viewDidLoad or any other method before viewDidAppear The error is not happening when i present modally the viewController Thank you Jimmy Whenever I try to swipe tap event is fired No matter I return true of false from shouldSelectItemAtIndex I added Carthage support by creating XCode framework project Also mentioned Carthage support in the readme
