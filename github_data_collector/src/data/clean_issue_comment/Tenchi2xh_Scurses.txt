It would be nice to be able to either completely reset a frame panel or remove some of the widgets As I understand they can only be added currently I had to resort to modifying the internal state of FramePanel to achieve this Can also contribute this if it is considered welcome feature Also great library used it and loved it I was thinking that have a small window running along the bottom of the screen that could expose a console prompt and accept custom commands to execute in the background Does scurses have the ability to integrate with a library like scalajline to target stdin and stdoutstderr to a single frame within a scurses screen
