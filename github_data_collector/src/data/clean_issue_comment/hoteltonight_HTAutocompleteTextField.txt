 It looks like this project hasnt been updated for a while but Im trying it now and its still working nicely One thing I dont understand is how a user can decline the autocomplete entry For example what if the autocomplete data includes Samuel but the user wants to enter Sam I dont see a way to do that Issue seems to ask about this but the solution given there was to enable the autocomplete button I tried that but that didnt seem to provide a capability of declining the autocompletion I suppose a small tweak to resignFirstResponder could skip committing the autocompletion if the button is visible In that case clicking the button would be the only way to accept the autocompletion and clicking outside the field would decline it Alternatively I could replace the autocomplete button with a different button that cancels the autocompletion Is there a better builtin way How can i force user to enter text which is in my datasource only HTAutocompleteTextField was created to be as a singlepurpose UITextField subclass that enables a specific type of text suggestion and autocompletion Since its inception however it has strayed from its original purpose and suffered a bit of feature creep The intention of this release is to right the course making this library both quicker to understand and easier to use With these changes I am proposing that we link to useful alternate text suggestion and autocompletion libraries including forks of HTAutocompleteTextField instead of accepting Pull Requests that alter functionality of this library In other words I am proposing that future contributions be in the form of nonfunctional changes such as bug fixes updates to support new iOS SDKs and refactoring Im doing this selfinstitutionName HTAutocompleteTextField alloc initWithFrameselfframe selfinstitutionNameautocompleteDataSource self And the function textFieldcompletionForPrefixignoreCase is not getting called If I use the setDefaultAutocompleteDataSource the function gets called but i cant set the autocompleteType or anything idk if im doing something wrong Ps Im using a UIView not UIViewController I had a problem with names appearing as NNull I tracked it down to my datasource returning nil instead of As this is easy to protect against it would seem useful to do so Change line in commitAutoCompleteText of HTAutocompleteTextFieldm from if selfautocompleteString isEqualToString NO to if selfautocompleteStringlength as you do in refreshAutocompleteText It could be really cool if this could support searchbar Auto completion of addresses using Google Places API
