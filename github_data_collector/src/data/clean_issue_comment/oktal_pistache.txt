Hello Im researching Pistache API just for educational purposes and have found the small part of code that from my point of view can be improved It would be so greatful if you can get a feedback about changes that I propose Lets start When you send a request using Client RequestBuilder and Request objects you set a timeout value clientgetaddresstimeoutstdchronomilliseconds This field is stored in RequestBuilder Im thinking about moving it to Request class from RequestBuilder class It will reduce a lot of code in Client and Connection methods when timeout is passed from doRequest to ConnectionperformImpl call I have doubts about having timeout value in Request entity from OOP point of view I have noticed that some methods in Request and Responce classes can be moved to Message class for instance const HeaderCollection headers const headers filed is stored in Message class but getters in other class Looks like as a bad design What do you think about my proposals Hello I would like to use pistache for a project and I need to know how many requests per seconds it can handle Simple explanation for the project pistache will be used for the backend of an app like linkedin it will have the same number of requests of linkedin can pistache handle hundreds of requests per second I follow the instruction to install pistache build from source on my ubuntu But always get the follow error Hi I recently cloned the new Pistache project and I keep getting this error when I try to compile the project with pictache Error no matching function for call to equalstdbasicstringcharconstiterator stdbasicstringcharconstiterator stdbasicstringcharconstiterator stdbasicstringcharconstiterator PistacheHttpHeaderLowercaseEqualoperatorconst string const string constlambdaconst char const char RestClientTest C usr local include pistache httpheadersh Kindly look into this Moreover is there any example for implementing HTTPS based server using pistache passbyvalue Passing parameter response of type PistacheHttpResponseWriter size bytes by value File routerh Line Hi dennisjenkins Is it possible to clean up the issues and pull requests i mean resolved answered invalid unmergable issues and pull requests Now there are about opened issues and pull requests that most of them are useless It can be help us to find the main issues and can trace the activity of development processes it also better to contributors to focus on the particular points that need improvement and bug fixes Best Regards Requestbody is defined as follows cpp stdstring body const return body Is there is a reason for not defining it as follows cpp const stdstring body const return body If not then can we add the above to the Request class I am doing testing via CURL and its working fine Example Call curl H foo bar This call I am converting to ab command like this ab v H foo bar c n l Output This is ApacheBench Version Revision Copyright Adam Twiss Zeus Technology Ltd Licensed to The Apache Software Foundation Benchmarking examplecom be patientINFO GET header GET arena HTTP dsn dev Host examplecom UserAgent ApacheBench Accept LOG header received HTTP Upgrade Required date Mon Dec GMT server envoy contentlength WARNING Response code not xx LOG header received HTTP Upgrade Required date Mon Dec GMT server envoy contentlength Can someone help with this This issue follows issue as it had never been answered In order to implement timeout on server side you need to override the onTimeout function as explained in the User Guide However when using a router we cant easily override the Timeout function as we have access to a RestRouter object and not its handler directly How can I solve this issue and implement timeout on server side using a router Hello I use Https Rest Api with SSL I test with curl and It works well can I use curl without crt key files do i have to use certification for using curl without crtkey files
