 It would be good to have a test factory available for automatically generating a bunch of unit tests which test the same block of code with different parameters such as is possible in pytest The end result of a test factory is a lot nicer than testing all the parameters within a single unit test as you would only have to write the code once but there would be many potentially combinatorially cases tested individually and you can see which of them fail at the end instead of just that there was at least one failure in the collection of parameters
