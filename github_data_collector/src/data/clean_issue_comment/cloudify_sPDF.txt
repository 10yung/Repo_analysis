Almost a duplicate of but I hope this should compile have updated travis descriptor disblader cloudify Basically the title Just updated everything to run with fixed a few errors that arose imagequality integer When jpeg compressing images use this quality imagedpi integer When embedding images scale them down to this dpi Hi Federico I have created a patch to enable sPDF to auto detect xvfbrun if it exists it will run wkhtmltopdf using xvfbrun This would allow sPDF to run in a headless Ubuntu server or any other debian headless server Hi I was not able to run sPDF in Ubuntu as WKHtmltopdf is unable to run in Debian as headless The suggested approach was to use xvfb Could sPDF be improved to allow it to run with xvfb Below is a sample of the command xvfbrun usrbinwkhtmltopdf lowquality googlepdf I did a fork of the project I cant a good place to expand the api hence i did a hardcode to add usrbinwkhtmlpdf as the argument where the path is xvfbrun I created an implementation for wkhtmltoimage but was unable to test because wkhtmltopdfimage seems to be hanging in the tests Please review and comment about anything Basically I just copied and pasted the Pdf and PdfConfig classes and changed some strings here and there I could simplify the implementation by simply extending those classes and only overriding findExecutable But I cant test this so thisll have to do for now Im trying to configure the DPI option but cant find any option to do so Is there a way to add your own parameters by overriding something Currently PdfConfigtoParameters is hardcoded so I cant change what parameters are used Maybe adding aval custom Seq String Seq that can be overridden in the PdfConfig The test that hangs is OutputStreamDestinationDocument pipe process STDOUT into destination stream Is required This library works on my mac just fine But on ubuntu I have it installed like this shell which wkhtmltopdf usrbinwkhtmltopdf wkhtmltopdf V Name wkhtmltopdf I am using it like this scala val html String html val pdf Pdfusrbinwkhtmltopdf PdfConfigdefault val destination FilecreateTempFilehtml pdf pdf val exitCode pdfrunhtml destination if exitCode LoggererrorsPDF generation task exited with nonzero exitCodeexitCode if destinationlength LoggerwarnsGenerated PDF is empty But I see that exitCode is and the generated PDF is empty Whats wrong Why is it silently failing It does not print any other helpful debug info at all How can I make it print debug info and underlying error
