are always on external drives when i dont have that setting on it constantly lag so i cant really watch without that setting for now i downgraded it b to and it works again but i cant use the newer versions until its fixed pretty much also i moved the from the apps folder and changed its file name and put w the original name but despite doing the whole Set IINA as the deafult application when is open when i tried to open a file it try to open it w the i archived and renamed i can only reset every filetype one by one in the getinfo i think you need to fix that the Set IINA as the deafult application will set the specific iina currently in use as deafult app over other iina apps as well and not just other apps in general i guess thats another bug then at least make it set the iina w the deafult name in applications folder as a minimum fix Please use English if possible If you really feel the need to use a different language to get your point across you may add a description in
