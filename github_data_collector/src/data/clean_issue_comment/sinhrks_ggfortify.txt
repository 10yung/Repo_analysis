Hello First thank you for this exceptional package Second Id like to add to the remarks made in and ggfortify integrates really well with the broom package which became part of a larger effort to work on statistical models with tools like tidy data and ggplot How about making ggfortify part of that family of packages Would that give it more visibility andor help its current developer base with extendingimproving it Poking alexpghayes and dgrtwo in case they might already have thought about this Again many thanks for the package and apologies if the question has already been answered elsewhere The following code requirexts requireggfortify autoplotasxtsAirPassengers tscolour green gives the error on master branch no recent code changes Error in dataframeindexmodel arguments imply differing number of rows Looks like some dependency changes sinhrks Could you look into it when you get a chance Hi ggfortify developer I noticed that therere two almostidentical documentations on for plotting PCA One is here cranrprojectorg one is from here rpubscom However the axis for PC and PC are different for example if you look at first plot from the documentations linked above output from libraryggfortify df iris c autoplotprcompdf In fact the PC from prcompdf should be in a range between and so is this a bug in the recent release v Thank you for your time Hello I often use the optionparameter setlags in the lagplot function from R to specify exactly which lags I want to plot The current gglagplot function only allows you to specify a range of lags lags and plots only those so I cant do something like this lagplotldeaths setlagsc dolinesFALSE I was wondering if you chose to only allow to plot a specified range or if implementing the setlags is a plannedwanted thing Why ggdistributionppois seq lambda gives me continous function Great to have this package If I can ask for enhancement please add support for mvr class object For example the object from pls The legend is missing species asnumericfactoriris Species autoplotprcompiris colour species environment environment Warning message In if value in columns the condition has length and only the first element will be used Picking a column from the data frame works without a problem autoplotprcompiris data iris colour Species Legend shown Hola Is it possible to use lda MASS Can you please provide an example Thanks I firstly used the command survivalPlot autoplotsurvivalFit confint FALSE and got a sensible looking plot normalsurv Then I added a line colour and the placement of lines changed autoplotsurvivalFit confint FALSE survcolour red badsurv The legend also disappeared Decide how to handle ggrepel unique kwds
