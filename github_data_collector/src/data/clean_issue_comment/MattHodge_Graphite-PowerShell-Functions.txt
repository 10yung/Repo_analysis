Fix for Ive just copied the DateTime conversaion that is used in SendBulkGraphiteMetrics The conversion from DateTime to Unix time is broken powershell SendGraphiteMetric CarbonServer MetricPath test MetricValue DateTime GetDate SendGraphiteMetric Cannot convert value to type SystemUInt Error Invalid cast from DateTime to UInt At line char SendGraphiteMetric CarbonServer MetricPath test Metri CategoryInfo InvalidArgument SendGraphiteMetric RuntimeException FullyQualifiedErrorId InvalidCastIConvertibleSendGraphiteMetric I am trying to add various metrics for our different windows machines For example Counter Name PhysicalDisk Disk Bytessec But all I am getting back from our server is VERBOSE Metric Received Myserverhddsdrivediskbytessec No data just a date From a windows machine I get VERBOSE Metric Received Here are the powershell versions of the machine PS C Windows system psversiontable Name Value PSVersion WSManStackVersion SerializationVersion CLRVersion BuildVersion PSCompatibleVersions PSRemotingProtocolVersion thanks First wanted to say this is an amazing script many thanks for making it I just wanted to check whether you were thinking of adding some additional functionality where previously logged perfmon counters to csv file could be parsed Im looking to add additional servers to gather metrics to dump into CarbonGraphite Do I create an additional config xml When trying to use the counter Counter Name LSSIP Peers SIP Connections Active I get the following error GetCounter The specified object was not found on the computer At C Windows system WindowsPowerShell v Modules GraphitePowerShell Functions StartStatsToGraphiteps char collections GetCounter Counter ConfigCounters SampleInterval CategoryInfo InvalidResult GetCounter Exception FullyQualifiedErrorId CounterApiErrorMicrosoftPowerShellCommandsGetCounterCommand It looks like it is because the output has multiple sources for the output instead of just one value When i change the counter to just one value like Counter Name LSSIP Peerstotal SIP Connections Active It works fine Eric I have an issue where the metrics that are collected for CPU processor time differing from running getcounter cmdlet I can have the StartStatsToGraphite running in a console sidebyside to another PS console running getcounter cmdlet both polling Processor Processor Time at second intervals and the metrics vary greatly On the side with the cmdlet running I will have cookedvalues of to however on the side running the StartStatsToGraphite the verbose output says to Small tweaks that might be useful Allow dot in sample counter name Hi there im wanting to monitor metrics from a fairly busy web app hosted on an IIS box I came across this which is great but the script takes about seconds on a big box cpu gb ram etc to push all the metrics I want to graphite Im assuming this is because its processing them in single threaded fashion Is there a way to make this multithreaded at all
