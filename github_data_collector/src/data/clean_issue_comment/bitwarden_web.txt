The csv file exported from Lastpass stores credit cards as the following csv Card Name on CardFOO BAR TypeWhatever Number Security Code Start DateJanuary Expiration DateNovember Notes Card NameFolder However the imported cards on Bitwarden dont get the expiration date imported this information goes to Notes section Importing a CSV file generated by enpass imports all the entries without passwords So its useless Version Shell Renderer Node Architecture x When I import from Password CSV all my login fields are imported into custom fields Password User ID and URL are all in custom fields I have passwords to import Several are imported as safenotes with no way to add Passwords User IDs and URLs to the safenotes I am manually adding my logins as a fix and many are out dated logins that I dont need as making a custom CSV is not an option as the format of the exported CSV is too confusing for me There are multiple columns of Passwords so I dont know how to fix the format to merge the Password columns Also one comment when deleting the bad logins I cant select all of them There is a limit on the website as to how many are selected I have to select all twice to delete all of them Please do not submit feature requests The Community Forums has a section for submitting voting for and discussing product feature requests I can export my personal vault which will include the folders that I have put my personal vault items in I can export my organization which will not include the folders that I have put the organization items in even though theyre right there in the UI As far as I can tell there is no way to generate an export of items in my organization that include the folders Ive personally assigned to them This is bad It would be better if one could only close the add item window either by clicking save or cancel I presume it would be a simple change I might add a pr in the next few days PS Thank you to everyone who has contributed to this amazing password manager It really has made my life easier Hi When clicking on Check Breaches in the Data Breach Report section we get a failed to fetch This is due to the API V BitWarden is using being deprecated It suggests to update to API V This version of the API has been discontinued please use V Keepass XML import seems to silently ignore images This makes me worry what else might be excluded that I havent noticed yet If I import a KeePass XML file with REFs the BitWarden cant unwrap them Refs are documented here Mostly they are useful to get over KeePasss single URL limitation I have dozens of entries with reference eg REFPI C B FFBD ABC BBB C BAD C pointing to password in the UUID C B FFBD ABC BBB C BAD C only thing differing is the URL Many websites offer onetime recovery codes in case the second factor is lostinaccessible Example of GitHub recovery codes format xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxx Similar codes are released by Google and many others I want to store those recovery codes in bitwarden I can see two possible places Custom fields Notes However inserting each code in a custom field is extremely tedious and error prone you cant copy paste the whole block eg Meanwhile the Notes cant be hidden so it is a privacy concern if someone looks at the screen while you are copying the password Id like something to address this problem The possible solutions that I can think of are A button to hide the Notes Default to Notes to hidden mode and add the eye button Another field Hidden notes Easier compilation of custom fields inserting a value with a new line creates a new one Adaptation of for the web vault
