In the preview screen when you have lots of tasks but only want to kickoff some at the top its annoying to have to scroll all the way down Also the run tasks label isnt active ie the HTML should be html input typecheckbox idselectedKey label forselectedKey Run taskslabel so that when you click on the text it deactivates the checkbox Test on CODE Deploy deploymentrequest We have two projects mobilen nnotification mobilen nnotificationworkerlambda If you select mobilen nnotification in the deploy view the build history shown on the right is a mix of both projects this risks being quite confusing as it may suggest the wrong build is deployed on PROD This is likely because the build history is queried by a contains or starts with match instead of a complete match adds a new index this changes modifies the app to make use of the same timestamp conversion function as is used in the index otherwise the index will not be used A scheduled job see can fail to kick off for a few reasons and it should be really obvious through the interface when this has happened Similarly if a scheduled job fails someone probably wants to hear about it We might Add a status dashboard that shows all failed scheduled jobs Add a topic or other notification mechanism for letting people know about failed jobs It makes sense that the scheduler introduced in should avoid deploying on bank holidays One approach for doing this might be to download at build time and add it to resources This could then be parsed at startup perhaps that should be verified at build time and quartz configured appropriately using a HolidayCalendar Even though the build reached the of the process of deploying RiffRaff didnt mark it as Completed As far as Im aware we are mostly deploying the master branch to PROD and very rarely branches except emergency fixes and such It would be wise to have a big warning if you were about to deploy anything else than master to the PROD environment Even though it never happen to me yet I did scare myself a couple of time by mechanically picking PROD in the dropdown The S upload both standalone and also within the autoscaling type prefixes the package when it uploads files by default unless disabled by setting prefixPackage false This comes from the package name aka deployment name in riffraffyaml It is not possible to customise this but there are good reasons for doing so in more complex configuration files I suggest the behaviour should be to use the app name instead which can already be overridden in the configuration The example in question is this riffraffyaml It winds up uploading files into mediaserviceTESTupload whereas it should probably upload into mediaserviceTESTusage as app is overridden This is an easy change to make in all places that S Upload is used my only concern is that this is a breaking behaviour change and its not clear how many places would be impacted We might need to review all riffraffyaml files to figure out how many files use an S upload task and also override app in the same deployment cc akash philwills If a deployment template contains a parameter with a nondefault value eg prefixStage false but then a deployment based on that template overrides the parameter with its default value then the following warning is given despite the override being necessary as far as I understand it The CAS proxy has this project name MemSubSubscriptionsContent Authorisation Proxy CASProxy it contains parentheses and this seems to stop the projectName filter from working Searching for MemSubSubscriptionsContent Authorisation Proxy CASProxy but if we trim off the part of the search term with parentheses we get results Searching for MemSubSubscriptionsContent Authorisation Proxy
