When I entered a world a chat message told me there had been errors Attached are the mod list and the latestlog I took a quick look at the log and tried downgrading vanillaFix from to but the error still appeared modlisttxt latestlog OpenComputers CCTweaked AppliedEnergistics rv stable Heres a ME Controller with a single item in its drives OC Its being invoked fine on OC But heres on

serialized data should have room Relay The whole setup is like so yes its powered Setup Discussion Changes navigationfindWaypoints gives addresses of waypoints also it can be used for verification label of waypoint cant be changed by player who do not have access to concrete waypoint blocklike generalised support for WorldGuard and similar protective plugins and mods Label protection are use same method like vanilla sign Versions Minecraft Forge OpenComputers Pure forge install without any thirdparty launchers with only OpenComputers installed Description Drones with chunkloader upgrade stop operating after going to a dimension where portal exit isnt in a loaded chunk That applies to going from the overworld to the netherthe end and vice versa The drone resumes operation after the chunk that the drone ended up in gets loaded eg a player loads it If the chunk that the drone teleports to after going through a portal is loaded before the drone goes through the drone runs as intended without a halt This happens on singleplayer as well as on multiplayer server Ive tested it a bit and according to the logs from locally hosted multiplayer server the drone actually loads the dimension that it gets teleported into after going through a portal and even generates chunks around itself if its a fresh area and fresh portal that wasnt used before The issue is after that the dimension gets immediately unloaded I believe this could be the same issue as described in this issue only that its not an incompatibility with another mod but rather an issue within OpenComputers itself Logs generated when going through a fresh portal Server threadINFO FML Loading dimension world netminecraftserverdedicatedDedicatedServer b f a Server threadWARN FML OpenComputers loaded a new

Unloading dimension How to reproduce Teleport yourself away from the spawn chunks blocks should be more than enough thats for later when testing going from the nether to the overworld this step list is for testing overworldnether Make a drone with chunkloader upgrade and EEPROM with a simple program to fly in a straight direction eg local drone componentproxycomponentlistdrone local chunkloader componentproxycomponentlistchunkloader chunkloadersetActivetrue make sure the chunkloader upgrade is running dronesetStatusTexttostringchunkloaderisActive verify it by setting status text dronemove move units east while true do droneswing do some action to yield end Construct a nether portal so that when entering youre moving in the drones moving direction in the above program east Go through the portal and if its facing southnorth in the nether remake it so that it faces eastwest Still in the nether Clear the space if its obstructed in front of the portal that is in the drones moving direction east to visually determine later if it moved before the player entered Go through the portal back to the overworld place a drone in front of the portal facing east so that its gonna enter the portal and turn it on Wait a few seconds and go through the portal the drone is going to restart its operation and be near the player still moving instead of being stationary further away after already finishing moving while player was waiting for a while in the overworld note that you might be facing a different direction when you exit the portal in the nether Additionally the drone going from the nether to the overworld can be similarly tested as well yielding the same results Now waypoints are too unsafe navigationfindWaypoints result cant be verificated anyone can create duplicates of waypoints with same labels waypoint label can be changed by other players who cant break concrete block even For solve this problems I suggest follow let navigationfindWaypoints result contains a addresses of waypoint check player permissions before setting of label What do you think about this Using black or any darker color results in transparency instead of rendered color This shows default rendering it should have had a black head around the gray eye and black stripes Instead they are transparent and actually removes some of the render faces on the yellow blocks most noticeable in the lowest yellow squares missing right face The following image is how I would expect it to look except for the missing transparency This is taken using Sildurs Shaders OpenComputersMC Tier hologram projector according to luaorg the following should work local temp ioinput save current file ioinputnewinput open a new current file do something with new input ioinputclose close current file ioinputtemp restore previous current file sadly everytime i try to run this i get the error expected string got table i have tested this out in lua and ioinput returns a table if this isnt an issue please provide an alternative Minecraft Version Mod Version Forge Version Using MultiMC Description of issue When calling robotuse either from the lua interpreter from an EEPROM program or from a program in the filesystem the robot will destroy the bucket once it is used If the robot has more than bucket in its equip slot the function behaves as intended bucket is used filled with milk and placed in the active or first available slot How to reproduce issue Place a robot with OpenOS installed Equip it with a bucket Place a cow in front of robot Call robotuse in the lua interpreter Bucket will be destroyed Alternatively write a program either on an EEPROM or in the filesystem that calls robotuse Place cow in front of the robot and start the program Bucket will be destroyed Repeating either of these methods with multiple buckets in the equip slot produces expected behavior as described in issue description Mode flag is not passed through to the buffer when creating the reader Causes binary files in devfs to not function as expected since they are read as non binary files binshlua should be able to execute a command passed as an argument but currently fails to do so in interactive shells as shexecute in libshlua expects an environment table as the first parameter That environment table is given when running commands in the interactive shell but is missing from the noninteractive shexecute call Meanwhile binsourcelua passes an environment table as the first argument to binshlua when starting the sh process manually As such Ive decided to add a simple check if the first parameter is a table If it is its assumed to be the environment table and wont be passed on Otherwise ENV will be used and all arguments will be passed on This should maintain compatibility with any existing usages of binshlua as a child process Admittedly Ive only tested it locally by manipulating a copy of binshlua after installing OpenOS onto an OC computer Sidenote I was not sure whether to remove the env table from the argument list or whether to skip it when unpacking the arg list I went with the second option as I thought itd be preferred given how returning does the same
