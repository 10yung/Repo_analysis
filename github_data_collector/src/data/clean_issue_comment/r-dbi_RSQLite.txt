Need to be able to set the configuration for SQLite database to MULTITHREAD Currently not available in this RSQLite API But is available in the C API Can you port this MULTITHREAD option to RSQLite please dbAppendTable is very slow on a file It is fast for the inmemory DB r tab pkgcachemetacachelist Remove the list columns tab tab sapplytab islist dimtab con DBIdbConnectRSQLiteSQLite tempfile create TRUE systemtimeDBIdbWriteTablecon pkgs tab user system elapsed dimDBIdbReadTablecon pkgs rmcon con DBIdbConnectRSQLiteSQLite tempfile create TRUE DBIdbCreateTablecon pkgs tab dimDBIdbReadTablecon pkgs systemtimeDBIdbAppendTablecon pkgs tab user system elapsed dimDBIdbReadTablecon pkgs supCreated on by the reprex package v sup Prepare for release x Check current CRAN check results x devtoolscheck x devtoolscheckwindevel x rhubcheckforcran x rhubcheckplatform ubunturchk x rhubcheckwithsanitizers x revdepcheckrevdepchecknumworkers x Update crancommentsmd x Polish NEWS x Review pkgdown reference index for eg missing topics Submit to CRAN x usethisuseversionpatch devtoolssubmitcran Approve email Wait for CRAN Accepted tada usethisusegithubrelease usethisusedevversion I would like to utilize sqlite busyhandler and squlite busytimeout to check if a database is locked and to retry RSQLitedbWriteTable once the database is no longer locked Is there any implementation of this in RSQLite What would it take so enablesupportconfigure RSQLite to allow using generateseries see The generate series Table Valued Function Trying after remotesinstallgithubrdbiRSQLite results as follows dbExecutedbSELECT value FROM generateseries Error in resultcreateconnptr statement no such table generateseries In addition Warning message Closing open result set pending rows It was suggested to me that requesting this is the key to enabling SQLites generate sequence to be used in Rs sqldf library under MS windows Presumably an approach is similar to only with this source hadley suspects you are to blame for so Im opening this here wink In short I ran out of disk space writing a tibble to a local SQLite database and got the error Error in resultcreateconnptr statement cannot rollback no transaction is active which was not particularly helpful to understand that the problem was a full disk wink and update DBI documentation hi if im understanding things correctly any values that match sep inside a quoted field will derail a dbWriteTable import from a file connection libraryDBI tf tempfile x c header header onetwothree writeLines x tf db dbConnect RSQLiteSQLite works as expected readcsv tf fails dbWriteTable db x tf and delimited files with quotes carry those quotes into the column values thanks for considering this y c header header onetwothree writeLines y tf dbWriteTable db y tf with quotes dbReadTable db y without quotes readcsv tf I found the hard way that SQLite does not support date types This discovery could have been short circuited had RSQLite given me useful information when I attempted to use dbWriteTable with a dataframe that had a POSIXlt type The error message I get is Error in rsqlitebindrowsrsptr value Parameter does not have length To make sense of this youd have to be intimately familiar with RSQLites innards That error is almost absent on Google even when omitting the digits Finding rsqlitebindrows in the appropriate cpp file in this repository shed no useful light on the issue Had I not stumbled across the answer in an unrelated exploration problem diagnosis would have taken a long time Throw us a bone if the data type in my dataframe is why the data cant be saved please let me know this
