 right now there is no way for client integrators to exclude the git enhancements offered by pluginbashlike eg the new git status stripe widget we could address this moving the pluginbashlikegit aspect to a toplevel plugin then client integrators may choose not to include that plugin Also allows client definition plugin to customize tabs in the about window using aboutjson with MultiModalResponse includes the enUS translation strings of the default about allows client definition plugin to customize proxy server by proxyjson Fixes Fixes Hello Thank you for submitting a pull

conventional strategy here I propose to use kuishellclient as the client definition home and kuishellclientconfigd as the client configuration directory containing configuration files such as namejson configjson and etc A client could specify kuishellclient client definition as a dependency in packagejson and Kui will build the customized client upon that We would like the value attribute added to the input element for the bottom command input bar this will help make writing tests easier for our custom client seems the text value is hidden in a shadow dom div currently that cant be accessed by
