great to be able to configure links to be opened in an incognito mode either all or using a site matchlist This would be useful for sites that pop up ads after the first few articles or that you just dont want to be acceptingsending cookies tofrom Would anyone else find this useful and if I implemented this is it something that would be accepted into mainline Please add a setting allow users to set a specific amount of space they want to be filled up with their rss feeds for offline viewing with full text retrieval So users can set whether they want mb gb gb etc I have enabled the option for full text retrieval on all of my feeds yet only a few articles from each feeds are downloaded with full text retrieval I assume this is because you do not want to occupy that much space on a users device I think it would be awesome if Flym would let me add some stories to custom favorites or at least allow me to tag them As there are a few stories that i would like to revisit later politics sports etc and having them mixed up together like it is currently makes it quite difficult to find the stories I favorited Feature Request Add TTS function and podcast function Hi All is it possible to implement vibration alert warning sound and alarm sound continuous sound for the arrival of new articles for certain sources Thanks In addition to the share option it would be helpful to have a fast way to copy the link of the current article to the clipboard A suffestion would be by doing a long tap on the headline of the current article when in article view Thanks This is a great app Some video platform like Youtube or Peertube use the MediaRSS extension to provide metadata about the videos They generally do not use the whole tags available but provide tags for the video description the thumbnail and the number of views It would be amazing if Flym could at least display the thumbnail and the description for videos An extract of a Youtube feed xml mediagroup mediatitleCan You
