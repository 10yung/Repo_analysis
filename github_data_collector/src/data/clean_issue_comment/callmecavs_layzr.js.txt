Some browsers now support a loading attribute on images and iframes A recent article on Smashing details how lazy loading scripts can be modified to first check for native support for lazy loading before triggering JavaScript based solutions What are your thoughts on adding a parameter something like prefernative that would check if native lazy loading is supported and only run Layzr if its not supported Do you have any plans to support the IntersectionObserver API It is supposed to be more performant than ElementgetBoundingClientRect and is becoming widely supported Hi dear This PR stops loading img which is not displayed displaynone The function getBoundingClientRect which is used in inViewport cant take correct position when the node is in invisible element can it So I added a check in inViewport to know whether its displayed Please tell me if I did anything wrong Thanks best regards Hello I have added new option which allow to use optional container with images for lazy loading not only window Also I added two html pages for manual testing scrollWindowhtml and scrollOverflowContainerhtml What do you think about review and merge it This PR fixes a problem I currently have Simply I have a div on my page which is overflow auto Inside this div I have a bunch of images that I want to lazyload with Layzr The issue is that Layzrs handlers method only operates on window This means that only scrolling the window itself will trigger lazyloading and scrolling any other element wont I propose the addition of handlersFor which will add the scroll handler for the given node Note I looked into detecting resizing of a div though its not a problem I have It seems that this is a popular solution and very efficient However it would introduce a dependency for an edge case which is probably rare Having said that maybe we should expose requestFrame perhaps under a different name as a hook for adding other triggers
