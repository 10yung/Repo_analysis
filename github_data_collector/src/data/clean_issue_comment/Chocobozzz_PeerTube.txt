is it possible Federation of peertube instances with each other in private network with local DNS What do i need to implement my own federation in a private environment with the local domain name I already have deployed instances but i am facing issue when making federation between instances What happened Max resolution version of the video starts to load in the background even before clicking on play What do you expect to happen instead Do either of the following until I press play Load only the first few seconds of the video like invidious does Do not load anything This is meant for people like me with metered connection If I leave the page open and go to the bathroom I can have a few gigs out if the video proposed is p or more Steps to reproduce Autoplay is disabled in the browsers options Without an account access an instance Click on any video Look at network stats under the browsers developer tools There is a continuous stream of XHR request loading the video chunks Additional information PeerTube version or URL tested on Browser nameversion Firefox v bit on Linux Here is an example on a p video after s of page standby region In order to develop a captcha plugin using I have to store somewhere the generated text Storing it with PluginStorageManagerstoreData doesnt seem to be a good idea The best solution is probably to store it in the user session So we need a mecanism for plugin to get and store data in the session under their namespaces The filterapiusersignupallowedresult hook is called in two places on the register form submit and in getConfig I propose passing the request IP in the getConfig call too The reason why Im developing a plugin that will allowdisallow the registration for some countries So I can test before the form submit if I want The plugin can still know if we are in getConfig or on the form submit by testing paramsbody I noticed that when developing a plugin the hooks where called multiple times Sometimes with old code I found the issue here It works with plugin under development I did not try with plugins installed directory from npm but Im pretty sure it will be ok note descriptions will need to be rewritten The way I wrote them is more as a placeholder to get feedback on the modification Screenshot Account video channels PeerTube resolves The PR defines two sets of acceptable framerates standard and hd standard framerates which are used to check a videos conformance to player standards If a video uses a nonstandard framerate we check if even downsampling is possible before rejecting resolves todo federation tests Screenshot Nettoyer les t tes de son magn toscope VHS cc photo png A firefly becomes visible only during twilight just like people will be able to watch videos through this feature only when other users will become visible aka seed I think its important to give this feature a name it can be a different one because some people due to lack of knowledge will probably misunderstand it and theyll want to blame PeerTube but if we give this feature a separate name theyll know that this is just a small feature that doesnt represent the whole PeerTube software If it sounds so bad why should we implement it It may sound bad but there are ways to reduce its downsides like displaying a warning and well it has its own big advantages like no need for big server storage and there are other big platforms which do only that eg bitchute and people really seem to need this So what is this about This feature is about giving people the possibility to upload torrent files which are a few kilobytes in size and thus create Firefly videos which people can watch as normal videos if at least person is seeding it Other methods to reduce its downsides as I wrote above display a warning thatll say that this isnt a normal PeerTube video but rather a Firefly video which works like this and does this and that And guide them on how to hide all Firefly videos if they arent interested in them temporarily hide Firefly videos from search results recommended Trending pages etc that have zero seeds so that people dont even waste their time clicking on them Similar issue but it was a question and rather incomplete So Ive decided to create this one If you have a question please read the FAQmd first If you report a security issue please refrain from filling an issue and refer to SECURITYmd for the disclosure procedure If you report a bug please fill the form What happened I try to follow an Peertube Account or Channel from Mastodon or Pleroma They tell me the request got sent I even get a notification at peertube that I have a new follower What do you expect to happen instead I expect the information that the follow was successful Steps to reproduce Additional information PeerTube version or URL Browser nameversion Firefox NodeJS version Link to browser console log if useful Link to server log if useful journalctl or varwwwpeertubestoragelogs
