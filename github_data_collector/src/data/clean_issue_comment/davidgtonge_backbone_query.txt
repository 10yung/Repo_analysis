The following example from readme will not return any results Are there any plans to update this library so it is compatible with latest versions of backbone Thanks Justin MyCollectionquery or titleNews titleAbout Returns all models with the title News or About Please add support for bower I admit to not being very familiar with requirejs but Im running into some issues trying to load up backbonequery Im using backbone boilerplate as a base and Im unable to get BackboneQueryCollection to be defined Is there any pointers Very similar to Query Engine perhaps we should team up What are your thoughts Here is a comparison that Ive done up Backbone Query good readme documentation runs on nodejs and in the browser supports NoSQL queries similar to MongoDB etc Query Engine includes live interactive demo sourcecode documentation only runs on nodejs and in the browser supports NoSQL queries similar to MongoDB etc supports filters applying a filter function to a collection supports search strings useful for turning search input fields into useful queries supports pills for search strings eg authorben priorityimportant supports optional live collections when a model is changed added or removed it can automatically be tested against the collections queries filters and search string if it fails remove it from the collection supports parent and child collections when a parent collection has a model removed it is removed from the child collection too when a parent collection has a model added or changed it is retested against the child collection First off this project is awesome I have data that looks like this courses title Biology assignments done false due T Z done false due T Z done true due T Z title Math assignments done true due T Z done false due T Z done true due T Z So basically a collection of courses which have a list of assignments Im using backbonerelational to model this courses is a QueryCollection the individual course model is a RelationalModel and the individual assignment model is a RelationalModel as well The query I want to do is to find all of the assignments in all courses that are due within a specific range and are not done From the examples and being somewhat familiar with Mongo its what I use on the server I think that would look like this coursesquery assignments elemMatch done true date T Z Im just matching one specific date not a range for simplicity purposes The problem is that the above query does not return anything It seems as if its not applying the elemMatch criteria to the assignments field of each course Any idea why that might be Feel free to call me names if Im doing something incredibly dumb here my brain is a bit fried from staring at my computer all day Thanks
