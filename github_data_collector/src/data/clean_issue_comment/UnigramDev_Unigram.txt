Itd be good to upgrade to newer ones like in the whole app The bug seems to be present just in the same screen when the phone number has to be inserted In case it isnt clear the bug is about the color not being the same of the background in the upper part To reproduce Logout Login Enter your phone number Once in the phone verification page go back This will be the result It would be nice to have the same intro that is present in the iOS app that uses animation instead of static images Hi Id would be great to rotate a photo while viewing it inside the app As currently I need either to rotate my head screen or to save all the photos sent to me and open in another viewer With the preview its shown the whole chat name but if I press the picture I will go to its extended view instead of chat info With the mouse hover they should be separated When a message is sent to a channel linked to a group this message appears in the group as well iOS client shows a channel title for this kind of messages Id like that to happen with Unigram Hello Please add below features See the First profile image with the Home key See the Last profile image with the End key Unigram Also I cant Save the profile image with the CtrlS key please fix it
