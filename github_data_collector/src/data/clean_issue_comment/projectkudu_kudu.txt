cannot be restarted and will not generate any logging output In the below attached logs it can be seen that the last log entry is from T Z but I have smashed the restart button multiple times since then and also created multiple deployments Note I know the app fails because nothing is listening on the port However it should try every time when I restart the app service plan Repro steps deploy an

services extension example which uses IIS Native HttpModule I assume it s possible since there is a way to register it Registering an IIS Native HttpModule Following post confirms it should work However when private extension with native module is added app services I got module not found error applicationhostconfig shows globalModules is registered properly verified against local server Same module works as ISAPI filter on app services from very same location properly so it s neither bitness nor path issues Similar managed module works fine too Tried few different native module paths with no luck D home SiteExtensions isapitest isapitestdll D home SiteExtensions bin isapitestdll D home site wwwroot bin isapitestdll D home site wwwroot isapitest isapitestdll D home site wwwroot isapitestdll Same module works properly on local windows servers R and as either ISAPI filter or extension Search shows results for nodejs native modules only Ill appreciate any help Thanks Currently when connecting to the KuduService via the scm url eg the current behavior when using the updated SameSite changes is a Repro steps Firefox in this case Make sure your have a fresh session Enable the new behavior via aboutconfig networkcookiesameSitelaxByDefault to true Try to go to the Kudu service via the scm url References SameSite IETF changes MS DevBlogs ASPNET Docs I have created a Azure DevOps pipeline and when the artifact drop on the location kudu console doesnt unzip it Please check and let me know what is the issue kuduconsole For deployment issues please provide us with the following information Repro steps your project built successfully on your dev machine but failed on Azure please write down your build tools and their versions ie Msbuild Project structures in order

more information Debug your Azure website remotely it is recommanded that you share your Web App name directly or indirectly we can take a look at whats going on Mention any other details that might be useful Thanks Well be in touch soon Since yesterday after every deployment we make to our App Service the application fails to start Were using RunFromPackage as deployment method and are seeing the following error in the App Service event log Application LMW SVC ROOT with physical root D home site wwwroot failed to start process with commandline dotnet Alexandriadll with multiple retries Failed to bind to port First KB characters of captured stdout and stderr logs from multiple retries Unhandled Exception SystemIOFileLoadException Could not load file or assembly D home site wwwroot Alexandriadll An assertion failure has occurred Exception from HRESULT x C Process Id File Version Description IIS ASPNET Core Module V Request Handler Commit a afc aea e d db bd ccc In this case Alexandriadll is our application entrypoint Its an ASPNET Core application Or deployment setup consists of the default production and a custom staging slot with App Service instances running at minimum Were running theRunFromPackage deployment on the staging slot with auto swap enabled so the application can be deployed with zero downtime This issue is impacting all of our customers after a deployment A simple restart of App Service fixes this issue After searching around a bit the issue were experiencing here seems to be very similar to Basically two questions are open for me here Why is App Service unable to load our dll Why would App Service autoswap an application that isnt even able to start That seems completely crazy to me and should be prevented by all kinds of health checks on the side of App Service Please let me know what useful information I can provide in addition
