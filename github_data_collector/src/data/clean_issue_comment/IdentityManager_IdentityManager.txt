I just installed IdentityManager and each time when I run the project on localhost i get HTTPS required and have not been able at all to remove this requirement from my localhost application Ive checked the configuration and ApplicationStart methods as well and have yet to be able to get this removed so I can continue Any ideas Im using Visual Studios Community if that helps at all maybe there is a setting I can uncheck And I used this link as my tutorial to set it up I setup Manager under I setup Admin under Each site is using Cookie Authentication with separate startup code Each site is using UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication Each site is using AdditionalSignOutType oidc Each site has their own cookie name using HostSecurityConfiguration Manager using AdminHostSecurityConfiguration Admin Admin has its own Role name Manager has its own Role name The user is given both roles in the IdSrv The issue is that if you login to Manager all is well Local Storage is good and Cookie is created If you jump over to the Admin Url then you get an error The cookie isnt created You are forced to logout and then you hit back to login and all is well If you jump over to admin The issue happens It seems to be an issue if these sites are under the same domain with sub virtual directories I dont think the cookie is the issue I think that the Local Storage key that is created first is the issue and it should be a unique name I can solve the issue by separating these sites to managerdomaincom or admindomaincom But I dont want to do that I hope I was clear enough Does anyone know how to resolve this or is this a bug Also I have another site where Im just using local storage only with oidcclientjs and dont have this issue Seems like the cookie creations process has failed me I want to impliment role based authentication in my web Api projetc i had added scope with the name of role and assigned with adminusersuperadmin in my controller used Routegetallsupportcategorieslu AuthorizeRoles admin public IHttpActionResult GetAllSupportCategoriesLU try return OksupportApplicationServiceGetAllSupportCategoriesLU catch Exception ex return

working can you please provide the sollution for any code needed for role based authentication and how to pass the roles in bearer token and how i can get the roles for authentication Hi Ive configured my Identity Server in a selfhosted enviroment just fine In the same project I also have mapped routes to Identity Manager and Identity Admin idm and admin Both of them are using LocalhostSecurityConfiguration When a login in IdentityManager for the first time it works as expected but if I open a new tab and access the Identity Admin in order to get access to it I need to click on the logout button and then I can click on the login button to get into the system The problem is that when I do that I lose access to Identity Manager so I need to do these steps again there that is click on the logout then login and after that I lose access to Identity Admin that I just have logged in Does this happen because of the LocalhostSecurityConfiguration Is that expected to happen How can I try to fix it any ideas Hi In past I have used this repo to build Identity Manger Now we are moving to Identity server So just wondering to be in sync do we need to update anything with Identity manager as it used some reference of Identityserver core Or it doesnt matter Or best bet to build our own new account admin Also I dont find recent updates or any new build for Identity Manger Do you guys still support Hello Does anybody have a document that explains how to install and use this software with an existing web application that has Individual User Accounts already installed I viewed two videos from the wiki and could not follow all the steps because the presenter moved so fast with the coding and never showed what it looked like when it was finished There should be one place where a person could copy all of the code to put into the Startupcs file I know how to use Nuget to install the packages but I dont know all of the other coding that needs to be done to get it up and running for my web application Any help would be gratefully appreciated Thanks Tony Is it possible For example I ve mapped routes for IdentityServer IdentityManager and IdentityServerAdmin in MVC application and configured one default OpenIdConnectAuthentication with mvc client scopes and clientId It works until I try to login in IdentityManager or IdentityServerAdmin after that I catch error because module trying with settings configured in OpenIdConnectAuthentication for mvc application Maybe somehow I can configure OpenIdConnectAuthentication for each map or something else Ive read the article and watched both videos IDM is working great with the included admin page but its not wired up to the AccountController that WebAPI template generates did I miss a step where I inherit from it or was I suppose to start creating a new one from scratch I feel like this is never clearly covered in neither tutorial Updated AutoMapper to version to support new versions of AutoMapper Updated mapper in RoleQueryResultResourceData Updated mapper in UserQueryResultResourceData I am trying to change from LocalhostSecurityConfiguration which works to HostSecurityConfiguration When using HostSecurityConfiguration I am however getting Error You are not authorized to use this service I am getting on adminapi and in the request header I can see that Authorization header is set to AuthorizationBearer HVLA zFWS NCcR Me usgeKKmJkd gY KmMWCd zjGu w JYqGzEpM y A L qRosoPN L GZslHASWdClnv s LQ UzZC e iGIttBphxFq zhTZABzO iw PopfIvEz
