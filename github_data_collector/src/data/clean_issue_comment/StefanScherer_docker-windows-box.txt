Im trying to figure out whether I can use the Vagrant boxes youve built as input for building a registry disk which can be used with KubeVirt I was just wondering whether you have any guidance on the redistribution rights for such disks The gut feeling says that its probably fine as long as the image is not activated but I couldnt find any official guidance on this Do you happen to know where I can find more information a statement on this Add a Vagrant environment with a Windows domain and Active Directory to test Windows Containers in enterprise scenarios See for a work in progress
