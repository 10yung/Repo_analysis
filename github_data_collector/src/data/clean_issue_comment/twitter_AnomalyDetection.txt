 What it is going on I want to know if this algorithm has a python version I want to run an anomaly on time series my codes are below temp c anom tstemp frequency startc anom Time Series Start End Frequency AnomalyDetectionTsanom maxanoms direction both alpha onlylast NULL threshold p evalue FALSE longterm FALSE piecewisemedianperiodweeks plot TRUE ylog TRUE xlabel Year ylabel Temperature title AnomalyTemperature verbose FALSE but i kept having an error stating Error in AnomalyDetectionTsanom maxanoms direction both data must be a single data frame Please i need help Thank you I noticed that the algorithm allows me to output the estimated value for each found anomaly Could someone help me understand how this estimated value is calculated This question arises as I got negative expected value for certain anomalies and was curious as to how these are calculated Thank you After installing dependency and the project I follow the simple example in README datarawdata res AnomalyDetectionTsrawdata maxanoms directionboth plotTRUE resplot When I run resplot an error occurs Error Column x is a datetime and must be stored as POSIXct not POSIXlt Does anyone know how to solve the problem Thx I have successfully run this on multiple dataframes but occasionally dont receive output or an error Upon researching the issue I think the error comes from the following line in the source code xgraph ggplot ggplotxsubsetweek ggplot aesstringxtimestamp ycount ggplot themebw ggplot themepanelgridmajor ggplot elementblank panelgridminor ggplot elementblank textggplot elementtextsize when I run this and on a dataframe where I dont receive output from the AnomalyDetectionTs function I get the following error Dont know how to automatically pick scale for object of type function Defaulting to continuous Dont know how to automatically pick scale for object of type function Defaulting to continuous Error in function rownames NULL checkrows FALSE checknames TRUE arguments imply differing number of rows Resolves issue
