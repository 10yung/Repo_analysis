Everything is working in both development and production but when I run heroku run rake dbmigrate I get this error PGDuplicateColumn ERROR column invitationtoken of relation users already exists Theres no prior installation The column only appears once the devisetousers migration is identical to the one provided in Github Any help would be most appreciated I cant find a duplication of the error In my app I invite people solely by their email addresses I dont have other information on them like First Name and Last Name which are required on my resource Now when they accept the invitation the normal way with setting up a password no problem I merely added first name and last name to the invitation edit form and added those parameters to the devise sanitized parameters Problem solved Except when it comes to Social Media registrations See I also allow you to accept the invite by logging in from Facebook or Google In the omniauth callbacks I simply look up the user record that invite created by the invitation token and do a useracceptinvitation on it Normally works great EXCEPT Facebook doesnt send me first name and last name I need the user to finish filling out their profile AFTER they accept the invitation and login But alas Devise does not have a way to accept an invitation on an invalid resource Its right in modelsrb in the acceptinvitation method Theres a save with no option to say validate false Ill work around it for now by putting some garbage in the first name and last name fields before accepting if theyre blank and then resetting them afterwards Or in the profile setup Ill check if the user is still invited and then complete the invitation at that point But I really do think there is a use case for accepting invitations on invalid resources Just my opinion I could be and usually am wrong I am using sidekiq to deliver emails later When I use this gem the rawinvitationtoken is not set anymore and left empty How can I receive the tolken manually I am using Mailgun and sometimes some emails wont get delivered depending on ISPs Example An admin invites a user but the email cannot be delivered Question Is it possible for the admin to get the invite URL so he can send it to the user on Messenger Slack etc What kind of backup strategy do you use for this scenario Sidenote Getting a new token manually Devise inevitable asks one user to invite another invitee Given the invitee hasnt consented to giving their email or name I wounded if you or anyone else has an opinion on if storing the users email is in breach of General Data Protection Regulation GDPR use of Personal Data If yes or even maybe then it might make sense to add something to the Readme warning others about this The following warning is coming up when I run my tests in Rspec rvmgemsruby gemsdeviseinvitable libdeviseinvitablemodelsrb warning instance variable acceptinginvitation not initialized usersinvitationacceptinvitationtokenmNTJWyyeyQpx Ncs invitationtokenmNTJWyyeyQpx Ncs Hi I have two different types of user groups for my app Customer and Staff When the admin is sending an invite I am trying to create different forms for both groups to ensure appropriate inputs for each are filled up Please let me know how to go about doing this When accepting an invitation edit method in Invitations Controller has code to sign out a userresource if one is already signed in See This is something I needed in my project and tried to add myself overriding the edit method in the Invitations Controller But I noticed my method wasnt even being called It was because of the before filter requirenoauthentication Then I noticed the original edit code already had the code I needed but it was just not being executed I ended up overriding the controller with only this line prependbeforeaction requirenoauthentication only update destroy This would be helpful for mobile apps and web apps I can overwrite the method but what are the implications of removing the authenticity token support If we can rely on the invite token being semiprivate because its only accessible by the person receiving the email then removing the authenticity token should be fine but I want a sanity check
