We didnt manage to get rid of the last generated file we generate apilatestmd and we rely on the GitHub GUI to display it properly I moved it from webdocs to One way to get rid of it would be to serve it via Jeckyll in GitHub Pages Or we could leave it alone With the beta release we have These will simplify to once is officially released But as of version these worked jsdelivr works pretty much the same but it is able to successfully resolve to the minimized version It would be nice to return to shorter URLs somehow Other charts such as the coordinate grid charts will supply the range to the scales if scales are specified by the user The range is based on the effective width width minus margins However the row chart will only set the range of the scale if the scale is defaulted or elasticX is on In which case it will replace the scale entirely also unfriendly because its possible to use elasticX with non linear scales Probably safe to fix this although it might cause subtle changes to users who have already worked around this Hi I am trying to render labels rotated but labels rotate position starts at always Can we change that same problem gordonwoodhull I found that I was unable to zoomin to my graph even with mouseZoomabletrue and documentation didnt explicity specify this case After some googling I found your answer in SO and I thought users in future shouldnt be wasting time on this The commit contains update in documentation and rebuild docs This can be removed once the below is the case dcjs should only elast the X domain once on render if both options are set b e cb e lifted elasticRadius from bubbleChart to bubbleMixin but the doc block was not updated so the documentation didnt move Cant seem to find this documented in the obvious places I am looking forward to diving into scatterPlotjs to make possible pan and zoom on both axes Now its working only for one axis x I would also want to stop filtering when zoom is applied but not necessarily it could involve a lot of work in coordinategridmixinjs I guess Any hints or some indications Were trying not to change the interface for DCv but ES and D v will require some changes to user code If there are enough changes that its worth the effort we could consider providing a codemod For example d upgradecodemod is a codemod that upgrades d v code to d v It looks like the javascript part of the picture is a utilitytoolkit called jscodeshift This is related to which also needs better control over the zero point of the chart It came up in this SO question dcjs dynamic zooming to fit range of values thanks Isaac The row chart expects always to start at zero and has code to set either the start or the end of the domain to zero Then it draws the rects starting from where the scale says zero is If the range start is not zero this will be off the chart Example fiddle A temporary fix but it has flicker because as usual its fighting with the charts transitions and pretransition wont work here subWell maybe it could with more worksub js chartonrenderlet functionchart var transform chartselectgrow rectattrtransform var tx transformsplit split chartselectAllgrow rect attrtransform null attrwidth functiond return d selectthisattrwidth tx chartselectAllgrow textrow attrtransform null
