Phaser v Excellent work with the typescript types update for matter I have run into a type that still seems to be missing Accessing the body property of a matterImage object doesnt have any awareness of matterjs BodyType properties and the compiler throws an error if you try to access the speed property Property speed does not exist on type object BodyType Body Body Property speed does not exist on type objectts I tried to add a MatterJSBodyType type to the phaser body property on the GameObject type manually but it still didnt work body object PhaserPhysicsArcadeBody PhaserPhysicsImpactBody MatterJSBodyType I dont really have much experience with manipulating the dts files of types so I could very well be doing something wrong line body object PhaserPhysicsArcadeBody PhaserPhysicsImpactBody I suspect that line needs to be modified with something Please do not update the README or Change Log we will do this when we merge your PR This PR delete as applicable Updates the TypeScript definitions Describe the changes below Reference comment by jonchun extends from PhaserGameObjectsGameObject implements interfaces for mixins use Omit for setSize signature conflicts in ComputedSize use tsignore for state property conflict spineAnimationState significantly different than GameObjectstate added semicolons to better match rest of definition files Parallel downloads on an android device can be not more than default is based on HTTPS protocol that android devices are using Ive read about that somewhere unfortunately cant find the link So I think it will be nice if the phaser will automatically set that value in the game configuration if the device is android and of course if there is no manual config of that property Havent tested for ios devices Spanish Cuando

x ffff graphicsstrokeCircle graphicssetAlpha Additional Information PhaserWEBGL renderer PhaserCANVAS renderer Im doing post efx but I found if I need to use the camera buffer I have to call camerasetRenderToTexture and if with some shader efx I have to create a new pipeline which actually takes a large block of memory for vertex batching which is unnecessary and if I need to create texture for multipass pingpong rendering I cant find a better way to do this or I dont know how if I use rendertexture this one can only draw things on it without shader if I use shader this one actually is a quad display object so I cant reuse this with the renderer in the same frame ticking and if I use camerasetRenderToTexture without a new pipeline to have my final framebuffer what is the right next step to apply my shaders with it for example in a handler function of cameras postRender event my current solution is in the cameras postRender event use native gl code to handle the rest steps obviously thats a bit awkward the second parameter type for pipelineaddAttribute method will make user confused normally Ill use this method like this ppladdAttributeinBlur rendererglUNSIGNEDBYTE true Float ArrayBYTESPERELEMENT Uint ArrayBYTESPERELEMENT that is directly use GL consts to pass to this method but actually this method requires a number to use for example addAttributename true offset line so should we just improve the TS doc or change to use another way this is not a bug so I made it as feature request if doc improvement is enough Ill PR thanks I had an issue recently where I could not rotate or zoom the cameras without the bounds of the camera changing relative to the values when using setRenderToTexture The solution is by changing the file
