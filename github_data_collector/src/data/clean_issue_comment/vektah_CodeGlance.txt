Whenever I go to the CodeGlance settings panel in Settings it is marked as being changed and Apply is always clickable I suspect that there is a value being compared that gets cast to another value and so never passes the equality check to itself Hello CodeGlance Team First of all I wanted to say a big thank you for this project This is a very helpful If I may I would like to as for a request which is widely adopted in Xcode and is very helpful In Xcode if there is a tag MARK Something Screen Shot at The Xcode Code Glance will display it with a different font much bolder Please see the screenshot as well This allow from the Code Glance mini map a faster and clearer way to to just clock and get to the lines of code needed Thank you so much When opening a TypeScript file the TypeScript Service starts and spawns at least one nodejs process The last week Ive noticed that up to processes were started and they keep growing in memory usage using up all physical memory and then using swap disk until its used GB causing my MacBookPro to freeze and eventually reboot only to restart IntelliJ at the same point and again starting node processes Ive been searching high and low for the cause and thought it was a problem with the NodeJs plugin or the version of Node But when I finally disabled the CodeGlance plugin and restarted IntelliJ the problem went away Im using IntelliJ IDEA ULTIMATE but had the problem also with NodeJS as well as tested Visual Studio has the ability to show a preview of the code at a certain part of the file when hovering over the minimap it would be cool to have that functionality in this plugin too It looks like this in VS Similar to choosing the Accurate render style doesnt persist correctly and will occasionally flip back to Clean even within the same session in the IDE PyCharm version build Hi I noticed my WebStom had spikes of cpu usage and tracked it down to this plugin Might have to do with big JSON files with items collapsed I dont have any shareable testfiles sorry But my file is lines long hierarchical JSON It just doesnt appear as it should IDE info IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition Build IU built on March JRE release b amd JVM OpenJDK Bit Server VM by JetBrains sro Linux amd Plugin version I think I want to cook up again Because in my case in pycharm PyCharm Community Edition Build PC built on March JRE b amd JVM OpenJDK Bit Server VM by Oracle Corporation Linux MANJARO and CodeGlance it is still not working I only see the one occurrence of the searched term that I selected Additionally it would be awesome if it would also work with the ideavimsearch and if you could implement the feature to always highlight the other occurrences of the word under your cursor
