Current implementation of creating actions is blocking def action T name Stringaction T ActionResult T ActionField T save or delete actions could potentially communicate with DB so therell be nice if they could use async API This could be better approach for some usecases def action T name Stringaction T Future ActionResult T ActionField T I found that row customisation is hard There is no simple way to split row for example to colmd and colmd Additional field in FieldData with current position positionInRow should fix this problem Hi Maybe I am doing something wrong but after adding withMetakeyvalue I was expecting keyvalue JSON object in the frontend and hidden in HTML An example with such case is available in Play Example folder at I cant see this happening Thanks They have to be unique but with indexes you might end up in a situation where you save with something else then selected if the possibleValues returns a different order for some reason like the dictionary entities might have changed causes two problems IDEs expect it to define a namespace and give errors all around its used as selectors in jquery Once the data is captured on the modal the parent form should be updated otherwise user might get really funny problems hard to spot
