 When launching configure on Ubuntu Server x EC on AWS it gives me this error configure line syntax error near unexpected token FUSE configure line PKGCHECKMODULESFUSE fuse Fuse packages I have installed and them versions libfusedev ubuntu fuse ubuntu press f to pay respects We could look for each n bytes in pi thereby making it take exponentially longer but it would enable much better compression Maybe we could also do multiple passes storing the metadata in pi as well with a higher compression setting and so on and so forth Itd also be really nice to implement a separate compression tool rather than a filesystem like zip so that we could compress single files In the readme it talks about knowing the location of your file in pi but the output data is just a bunch of random characters when i open it with a text editor i think pifs can then achieve compression The README states They said compression was impossible Youre looking at it Theres a fundamental flaw in this statement Compression Compressed Filesize Uncompressed Filesize So for instance we compress MB of data into a MB archive then we have a compression of In order for us to have a compression wed have to compress our files down to bytes We still require massive amounts of storage to index the digits of pi and we still need storage space for the software that is supposed to calculate the digits of pi in order to retrieve our information So its probably best to state that this method is almost compression instead As you probably already know in three days GDPR compliance must be implemented for all storage solutions that process data of European citizens In your README I noticed the following line holds every file that could possibly exist This sounds extremely alarming as it looks like in three days use of this technology will be considered illegal Please advice on how I would go about removing my personal data from They said compression was impossible Youre looking at it instead of compressing files Im ending up with files about times bigger than there size The README says that One of the properties that is conjectured to have is that it is normal which is to say that its digits are all distributed evenly with the implication that it is a disjunctive sequence meaning that all possible finite sequences of digits will be present somewhere in it My organisation requires all software to be formally proved to always give the correct output The fact that it is conjectured is not enough Please add a unit test that proves the normality of pi
