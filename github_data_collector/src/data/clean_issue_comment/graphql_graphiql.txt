desired details Context x Use new GraphQL Config x Remove extra endpoint extension About endpoint In new GraphQL Config there is no extension called endpoint so all sources of schema are defined as schema in GraphQL Config file Related and This alpha version of GraphQL Config supports GraphQLjs v Were testing our graphqltoolkit which has core logic in the CLI for both v and v in the CI Related Also user can add their own custom schema loaders in two different ways yml schema yourownschemapointer loader myloaderloaderFn or the developer can add their loaders in the library code ts const

get like below ts const myOwnField configgetmyownextension Hi Im working with protected route by jwt in the graphql In the integrated tests can pass the token for inbound authentication everything works great I would like to know how can I pass the token in the graphiql playground to be able to use the queries Thank you very much in advance Can we change the repository description to say GraphiQL the GraphQL LSP Reference Ecosystem for building browser IDE tools Use react rc and ensure there are no regressions for x use instrospectionQuery rather than constant deprecated x bump resolutions for x minor validation error formating issues x ensure GraphiQL works end to end view deploy preview cypress suite oustanding issue with graphqlconfig and server tests potentially graphqlconfig is not working with check server for regressions use with a vscode extension manually check for more specific regressions in GraphiQL other LSP implementations that are related to breaking changes acao benjie Took a long long time than I initially anticipated but I finally released graphql rc It includes a number of small breaking changes Can you please test it with packages in this repo so I can release without worrying about breaking GraphiQL Note It doesnt yet include twostage introspection that I currently working on and will add in the next release since its not a breaking change from untyped es see old branch converttots decided to break it out into a few phases and use allowJs at first CC ryanmwalker Bumps yargs from to details summaryRelease notessummary
