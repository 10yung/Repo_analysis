Example the video is the device is so the leftmost part of the bottom bar is in the white area displayed because of the light theme Picture Screenshot Gallery Visibility is fine on the dark theme more info at email from Mishelle on th January FDroid marked your app with This app has features you may not like NoSourceSince Do you know why and how to fix this Is this because of the license change Or because of the new photo editor Latest release was on FDroid FDroid Link It seems to be that the double tap zoom doesnt work if fit to screen is the same as native size Example x png image on an sony experia z x resolution If the device is in portrait orientation so the the width of the image and the the device match nothing happens on a double tap If the device is turned to landscape orientation so that neither resolution match the screen zoom defaults to fit to screen and double tap cycles between fit to width native size and back to fit to screenheight Expectation In the above portrait case the double tap should cycle fit to height and fit to screenwidth which in this case is native size Example x png image Same behaviovior as above just that the defaultnative now is fit to height In both examples if manually zooming just a bit double tap will cycle through the expected fit to heightwidth before getting stuck in native again Version tested v Pro from playstore I tried to play some video files on Android using the new gesture based navigation When doing so the video plays fine but the seek bar at the bottom where you can jump to a certain pointtime in the video does not show for me When I try to fiddle around the bottom area to make it show I only get the Android gesture bar behavior but not the seek bar Is this a setting I missed somewhere I could not find it yet in the app or the FAQ so far Steps for reproducing according to the reporter Go to Discord or probably any app Attach a picture Use Gallery to find the picture Select a folder Filter for only GIFs and videos Cancel Come back later and open Gallery Change filter back to everything All pictures are unfavorited and almost all folders are unpinned Would be nice to add content providers to included folders similar to adding USB drives For example google drive provides one Image Opening the editor seemingly opens a new empty black screen what automatically closes opens up a second time then returns the gallery with the same initial image opened Hi from GooglePlay thanks for answering to my review i moved this here because that way of communication is rather bad Sometimes when you temporarily show hidden folders they show but you click them and the photos inside dont appear Even if you wait Kinda annoying to be quite honest hope to see it get fixed Android Pie LGv The zoom doesnt work when an images width and height are equal
