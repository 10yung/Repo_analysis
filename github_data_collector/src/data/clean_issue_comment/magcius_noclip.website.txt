If the camera is tilted towards the ground it is possible to continuously tilt the camera downwards until it is upside down I am not sure if this behaviour is helpful when exploring maps as it can easily happen by accident and quickly gets confusing and disorienting This also happens with many early implementations of first person cameras within Unity Most implementations solve this issue by clamping one of the axes I believe a similar solution would also work here If this is an intended feature I suggest adding a checkbox which toggles camera clamping When I slide the camera speed slider all the way to the left then switch stages the camera speed slider remains at its new position but the actual camera speed resets to the default value until I move the camera speed slider This is an issue on SSBB where the camera moves too quickly by default Shine Sprites remain upright during the spawning animation and while animating and only end up offaxis when Mario collects them Footage at However the shine sprites are rotating or tumbling offaxis It would be incredible to see some of these levels in VR especially without worrying about issues like frustum culling or getting real emulators to support VR This branch gives user the ability to navigate maps using a controller Its primarily setup to work with XBox One and Playstation controllers so other kinds of controllers may not be fully supported This could definitely be improved in the future with more controller functionality and better control but this is more of a starting pointproof of concept If a controller is not immediately recognized it may need to be disconnected and reconnected before it is picked up Current Xbox One Controls Left Stick Move Right Stick Rotate Camera Left Trigger and Right Trigger SprintSpeed increase A and B Rise and Fall Start Pause The FPS meter code is here This code seems to assume that as soon as the script to produce the frame has finished running that the frame has been produced but there is a lot of work in the browser after javascript completes to draw the frame to the screen On my laptop for example the site claims fps but chromes FPS meter shows that I am only actually getting fps This should be using the requestAnimationFrame timestamps to determine the effective framerate Maybe Im missing something obvious but there doesnt seem to be a way to navigate around the world model when using a touchscreen device The models load fine on my Pixel latest Android and stable Chrome but theres no keyboard or mouse so no movement the camera cant be moved Swipingtapping does nothing Is it possible to implement dragtomove or similar Thanks WebGLReport says This browser supports WebGL Platform MacIntel Mozilla Macintosh Intel Mac OS X AppleWebKit KHTML like Gecko Version Safari webgl WebGL INTEL WebGL GLSL ES WebKit WebKit WebGL Intel Inc IntelR IrisTM Plus Graphics Not available No No Supported Extensions WEBKITEXTtexturefilteranisotropic WEBGLcompressedtextures tc WEBGLlosecontext WEBGLdebugrendererinfo WebGL Functions Implementation Status of new functions implemented EDIT This is with WebGL supported enabled through the developer menu
