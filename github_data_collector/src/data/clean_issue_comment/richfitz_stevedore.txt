Add it in both containerrun and in the networkconnect methods Several bad cases here ports An object mapping ports to an empty object in the form porttcpudpsctp env A list of environment variables to set inside the container in the form VARvalue A variable without is removed from the environment rather than to have an empty value enable the endpoint in dockercontainer with r selfresize dockerclientmethod containerresize self fix fixid and then test with r testthatresize d testdockerclient nm randstr stevedore x dcontainercreatenginx tty TRUE stdin TRUE onexit xremoveforce TRUE xstart i xinspect xexecctput T xterm cols stream FALSEoutput xresizeh w junk return value i xinspect xexecctput T xterm cols stream FALSEoutput xrestartt i xinspect xexecctput T xterm cols stream FALSEoutput but nothing happens Theres a lot more added to the package since they were last expanded Would require reconfiguring the docker daemon to accept TLS connections but thats just a case of setting up daemonjson and restarting harder than but needs doing Getting windows support working probably requires implementing the contents of RhttpR to work with named pipes likely this file will split into a transport layer simple in the tcp case fairly simple for unix socket and possibly complex for named pipes Its possible that the fifo function can do most of what we need
