Combinors Combinators Drop of arbitraries these are arbitrary combinators in the Arbitraries docs so just Combinators In a nutshell New feature Fix an issue Documentation improvement Other please explain Bug Report Travis reported an issue with webUrl arbitrary To Reproduce Steps to reproduce FAIL testunitcheckarbitraryWebArbitraryspects s WebArbitrary webUrl Should always generate correct values Property failed after tests seed path endOnFailure true Counterexample Shrunk times Got error Error expectreceivedtoBeexpected Objectis equality Question and Help It isnt really clear how to use the Function arbitraries such as compareBooleanFunc It would be great if some usage examples could be added to the documentation to illustrate this Bug Report Based on the documentation my understanding is that the dedup arbitrary is supposed to guarantee that the resulting tuple contains no duplicates However I see duplicates on every single run The empty string always shows up Occasionally various nonlatin symbols such as Chinese characters show up too To Reproduce Use this packagejson json dependencies chai fastcheck Run the following script with node testjs javascript const assert requirechai const fc requirefastcheck fcassert fcpropertyfcdedupfcunicodeString vals assertisTruevals vals verbose true I reproduced this with node v and node v Expected behavior The above script should terminate without any output Your environment Packages Softwares Versions fastcheck chai node Bug Report High rate of duplicate values are generated when using fctuple To Reproduce js const fc requirefastcheck const cases fcemailAddress using just fcemailAddress results in no duplicates fctuplefcinteger fcemailAddressmaparr arr using tuple with a different type eg fcinteger results in no duplicates This is the case where behavior seems incorrect fctuplefcemailAddress fcemailAddressmaparr arr using the same type in a tuple results in duplicates at a much higher rate than one would expect casesforEach arb description consolelogdescription const seenEmails fccheckfcpropertyarb emailAddress if seenEmails emailAddress consolelog temailAddress seenEmails emailAddress true numRuns seed should also be able to replicate without providing seed consolelog Expected behavior There should be no duplicates or at least an extremely small chance of duplicates in the rd case as demonstrated above Your environment Packages Softwares Versions fastcheck node Why is this PR for Define browser version to be esm build Final aim no more bundlejs required for jsdelivr and others In a nutshell New feature Fix an issue Documentation improvement Other config for jsdelivr and others yes no Potential impacts Default JavaScript file served by jsdelivr should be the ES module one See Why is this PR for Support ES Modules and CommonJS Related to In a nutshell New feature Fix an issue Documentation improvement Other please explain yes no Potential impacts Under dev Idea Add troubleshooting page Motivation Reference various common questions or issues Example As an example nodemodulesfastchecklibts streamStreamdts error TS Symbol only refers to a type but is being used as a value here Do you need to change your target library Try changing the lib compiler option to es or later Symboliterator IterableIteratorT nodemodulesfastchecklibts streamStreamdts error TS Cannot find name IterableIterator Symboliterator IterableIteratorT Can be solved by installing typesnode Knowing that and Objectcreatenull are totally different objects we need to be able to distinguish them in stringify This will be a must have as soon as we add the ability to generate objects without any prototype
