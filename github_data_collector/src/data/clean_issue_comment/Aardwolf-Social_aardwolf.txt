Create docker images for Aardwolf Todo before merging x Dockerfile x dockercomposeyml x dockerentrypointsh x Documentation Some things to consider in order of usefulness Aardwolf logging to STDOUT Automatic Travis docker image builds amd arm Deployment to Docker Hub Image scanning Updating versions for security updates setvalue serializejavascript Something like rust pub trait FormWithState type State fn asstate self SelfState impl FormWithState for CreatePostForm type State CreatePostFormState fn asstate self SelfState CreatePostFormState And this could even be automated with procmacros like this rust deriveFormWithState pub struct CreatePostForm name OptionString formwithstateignore csrftoken String Here are the OS architectures that we support by default Based on what Nodejs Supports NodeJS Downloads Windows bit MacOS bit only Linux bit only Linux Binaries ARM ARMv ARMv ARMv The current limitation for this is NodeJSWebPack which only has support for the architectures listed above Setting up without WebPack is fairly straightforward but requires additional work If someone could flesh out the WebPack documentation that would be amazingly helpful Right now the templates are progressing forward but require some manual intervention to add the Bulma styling as well as the FontAwesome resources Updates can be done here The purpose of this task is to review the READMEmd at the root of the project Since this is essentially the face of the GitHub repository it is very important that the information is accurate dagger This issue follows behind issue Anything which is ticked from that issue has a visual depiction that can then be coded into HTMLCSSTera files It is these files that will serve as the actual functional part of the web UI Items marked with are considered MVP requirements Mainbr Log In Create Account Base Error Page Asidemainbr News Feed Messages Calendar Groups Lists Photos Favorites Weather New Event New Group MainProfilebr Profile view Profile Edit Containers These are linked from asidesettings br Edit Profile Preferences Muted Keywords Muted Users Notifications Security Privacy TwoFactor Authentication Data Import Data Export Authorized Apps Authorized Followers Invites Plume has a really amazing looking setup script which I am struggling to integrate I seem to be running around in circles trying to resolve dependencies with zero progress So far I have been tracking my efforts in the dbsetup branch My current guess is that there are a LOT of architecture things which do not align with what we have and thus would require someone more familiar with what we have done thus far Here is a link to setup script Plume setuprs Highlevel description Groups should be constructed similarly to useractors in that they will have an AboutBio page The bio page should include a tag cloud where the group administrators can put searchable keyword tags For Aardwolf the standard privacy settings will apply Authentication for group administrators should be handled the same way as personas excepting that one or more people may share the same persona Technical discussion The actor should have some kind of identifier UUID prefixsuffix which marks it as a group Messages sent to the group ID will be automatically reflected back to the other group membersfollowers List of planned features for Aardwolf Basically the idea here is to keep a running list of features that we are going to work toward adding The categories below should be reasonably selfevident however it is okay to ask for clarification D Base Functionality The usual suspects post reply to post share post etc Mastodonlike functionality CW Events Groups Lists Favorites one stop shop for favorite items Granular privacy settings Adheres to Accessible web standards as best we can Voluntary Product Accessibility Template Post editing requires a way to keep track of edits to prevent abuse Recommended Functionality Userdriven One button for each audienceprivacy level replaces dropdown HTTP Signatures Adminselectable AltText enforcement Off PromptSuggest On Allow Public posts to be visiblesearchable even if allow followers is off Stretch Goals Live Chat via Matrix Video Sharing via PeerTube EndtoEnd Encryption IPFS filesharing Photo Albums via Instagramlike Federated App
