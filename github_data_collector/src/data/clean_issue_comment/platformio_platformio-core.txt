 pio platform install someplatform withallpackages It should install ALL required dependencies toolchains frameworks upload and debug tools BUG Platform IO Remote OSX When trying to connect to a remote target after upload the following error occurs Starting Serial Monitor on minilocaldevcuusbmodemFA bdictionary changed size during iteration Terminal will be reused by tasks press any key to close it Closing and and trying again will then work Hi All P Series is based on ESP with C RM NBIoTGSM chipset from Cavli Wireless ESP is already supported in PlatformIO but from P board we get NBIoT libraries for easy development and it also has eSIM management onboard Please see P C RM and its datasheet here We will be happy send out samples for development Thanks What kind of issue is this X PlatformIO Core If you ve found a bug please provide an information below Configuration Operating system PlatformIO version Description of problem Tests does not output to serial port as expected on mbed os Steps to Reproduce Create a embedded test with mbed os using the UNITY framework provided by platformio Actual Results The test compile and runs on the board but does not output anything on serial port Expected Results The test compile and runs on the board and output the results on the serial port If problems with PlatformIO Build System The content of platformioini ini envdiscof vg

Additional info I was able to fix this issue by creating a mbedignore on the mbed folder for the unity framework featuresframeworkunity When I include the unityh file the one that is included is from the mbed framework when I do not ignore it so the modifications done by platformio to the macros variables that allow me to print to the serial port are not used What kind of issue is this true Question This issue tracker is not the place for questions If you want to ask how to do something or to understand why something isnt working the way you expect it to use Community Forums or Premium Support PlatformIO IDE All issues related to PlatformIO IDE should be reported to appropriate repository PlatformIO IDE for Atom or PlatformIO IDE for VSCode Development Platform or Board All issues building uploading adding new boards etc related to PlatformIO development platforms should be reported to appropriate repository related to your hardware Feature Request Start by telling us what problem you re trying to solve Often a solution already exists Don t send pull requests to implement new features without first getting our support Sometimes we leave features out on purpose to keep the project small PlatformIO Core If you ve found a bug please provide an information below You can erase any parts of this template not applicable to your Issue Configuration Operating system WIndows

from lowend to highend use cases We have supported three boards HummingBird FPGA evaluation board which will run Nuclei NNX processor FPGA bitstream file Nuclei RVStar Evaluation Board GD VF V Evaluation Board which this MCU on board is based on our Nuclei RISCV Processor Core Our support for Nuclei Platform currently is using our Nuclei Embedded Software Development Kit and you can find our support repo here Currently our software development tools are kept in github release here I think we still missing the following tasks need to be done Add information about nuclei platform and boards to main documentation Add information about nuclei platform and boards to PlatformIO Web Site Questions And during the support I also found that debugging in VSCode is slower than debugging in GNU MCU Eclipse with RISCV support even we are using the same openocd and riscvgdb tool and also open all the windows like registers call stacks peripherals variables etc VSCode is much slower than Eclipse do you have any experiences in these I also found that in these line of code py argsextend c gdbport pipe tclport disabled telnetport disabled In openocd manual it suggest to write the openocd file into log file in order to ensure that the pipe is not saturated when using higher debug level outputs I tried to modify it like this py argsextend c gdbport pipe logoutput openocdlog tclport disabled telnetport disabled Then the debug server connection speed and download speed will be faster than before if you use load command with previous version the download speed will be KBs but after my modification it will be KBs Download Speed Before Download Speed Before Download Speed Now Download Speed Now Debug is really slow in VSCode when all debug windows are clicked and opened vscodedebugslow Thanks Huaqi PIO does not put the correct Arduinocompatible mcu andor architecture defines on the command line during the build Any valid Arduino library that has for example ifdef ARDUINOARCHESP maybe not that specific one but you get the picture fails the build I raised this issue so long ago I cant remember when close on years probably For that reason Im not going to waste any more of MY time tracking down whether its systemwide or boardspecific but it just failed again for one of my users It is THE single reason that a I have not used it since then b I argue very firmly in other support groups who claims that PIO is Arduinocompatible since is clearly most certainly is NOT and c I tell anyone who will listen to steer well clear of it until this bug is fixed and use something that actually works Seriously guys isnt it about time this got fixed How can anybody recommend this as a serious alternative when it is russian roulette whether any perfectly valid Arduino library you want to use may fail to compile Makes pio test verbose output the same as pio run verbose showing exact shell commands that are executed sAlso silent flag probably needs to be exposed toos In case of native test what I now see instead of Linking piobuildtestprogram Is this g o piobuildtestprogram piobuildtesttestoutputexporto piobuildtesttestmytesto Lpiobuildtest

generateprojectmain to generate de default maincpp I have a custom framework and I would like to create a default maincpp Is it possible Allow dumping of runtime configuration to JSON pio project
