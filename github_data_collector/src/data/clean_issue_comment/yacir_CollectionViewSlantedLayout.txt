Hi I just tried out this layout in my project which is using RxSwift and RxDataSource for collection views I realised that the application crashes on binding the sections This is how I initialise datasource and bind it to the collection view items let animationConfiguration AnimationConfigurationinsertAnimation bottom reloadAnimation bottom deleteAnimation bottom let dataSource RxCollectionViewSectionedAnimatedDataSourceTopListSectionModelanimationConfiguration animationConfiguration configureCell collectionView indexPath item in let cell TopListCell collectionViewdequeueReusableCellforIndexPath indexPath cellconfigurewith item if let layout collectionViewcollectionViewLayout as CollectionViewSlantedLayout cellcontentViewtransform CGAffineTransformrotationAngle layoutslantingAngle return cell sections bindto collectionViewrxitemsdataSource dataSource disposedby disposeBag Crash on binding Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInternalInconsistencyException reason request for number of items in section when there are only sections in the collection view It seems like the number of sections is not set when the prepare function in CollectionViewSlantedLayout is called I managed to fix this by checking the number of sections in the helper numberOfItems var numberOfItems Int guard let collectionView collectionView collectionViewnumberOfSections else return return collectionViewnumberOfItemsinSection This fixes the crash however it lead to another crash Terminating app due to uncaught exception CALayerInvalidGeometry reason CALayer bounds contains NaN nan nan Layer CALayer x e f position CGPoint bounds CGRect delegate UIView x fa ed e frame e e e e transform nan nan nan nan gestureRecognizers NSArray x f layer CALayer x e f sublayers CALayer x f de CATransformLayer x e bc opaque YES allowsGroupOpacity YES transform CATransform D nan nan nan nan I tried to debug the issue but I havent gotten to a conclusion yet Could you think of a reason for this crash Thanks for your help
