on systems which allow more than open FDs Other than that there is no any change in functionality This fixes issue This change allows users to properly define and use wildcard based interface naming when using the ethstat plugin You can also specify explicit interfaces if this is desired Example Plugin ethstat Interface ens Interface eth Plugin ChangeLog ethstat plugin Add support for Interface regexps in ethstat plugin Version of collectd Stable Operating system distribution Linux Vi generic Ubuntu SMP Tue Nov UTC x x x GNULinux Kernel version if applicable Linux Vi generic Expected behavior Collect cpu once in Milliseconds and write it to custom graphite format with timestamp in milliseconds Actual behavior All collectd write plugins show seconds dimension between metrics Steps to reproduce I patch default cpu plugin like this for accepting interval c pluginregistercomplexread group cpu name cpu callback cpuread watch interval MSTOCDTIMETintervalms userdata NULL void

done in attempt to fix seen in ChangeLog Checkpresence plugin Add new plugin to detect new and missing hosts This PR adds a new plugin that keeps track of hosts that have been seen by collectd and sends notifications when a new host is seen or an existing is no longer seen for a period of time respectively It depends on liblmdb to provide the underlying index chosen for low cost Example notification when a host is seen Notification severity OKAY host littlenetlocal plugin host type host typeinstance found message Host is found littlenetlocal Example notification when a host goes missing Notification severity FAILURE host littlenetlocal plugin host type host typeinstance lost message Host not seen for seconds littlenetlocal Version of collectd Operating system distribution Docker jfloffalpinepython Kernel version if applicable generic Background This happens inside a Docker image I made that pulls and installs and makes some adjustments Before making the story overcomplicated lets focus on the collectdconf Actual behavior Collectd hangs at random intervals at high CPU usage nothing happens anymore It happens from once per weeks to times a day No clue at all
