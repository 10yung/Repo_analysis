Fixed the problem in This error is common in new version of MATLAB Tested in following settings windows MATLAB a using Visual Studio Community Ubuntu MATLAB a using gcc version Dear pdollar or anyone First of all pdollar thanks for your contribution Secondly in more detailed info I would like to knowhow is the AP computed Cheers Xavier Hi Thanks pdollar for this excellent work Im trying to run edgesDemom before that I install it as Installation in readmetxt But when the program running to the line in edgesDemom it call the edgesDetectm and then edgesDetect call the edgesChnsm in lines in edgesChnsm it call gradientMagcpp and Matlab was down I have tried several times and it is same Help img width altimage src url img width altimage src url The environment I use Mac OS Mojave Matlab Xcode Clang to configure mex Could anyone please tell me the meaning of maxDist parameter I am confused about the function of correspondPixelsAnd there is a compiled lib so I cant see code Can you give some explanation about it Thank you Hipdollar I try train tree myselfbut it alaways have the error Unable to read file BSRBSDS datagroundTruthtrainThumbmat No such file or directory PSwhen I reduce the number of the patchit run okI guess if it is related to the number of data can you help methanks a lot How to get this code run for grayscale images pdollar im new to matlab and I got some problems trying to make it work I did everything carefully in the installation method a but then when I try to run edgesDemom I got this error Error using imPadMex Requested x x GB array exceeds maximum array size preference Creation of arrays greater than this limit may take a long time and cause MATLAB to become unresponsive See array size limit or preference panel for more information and several others but they come from the first one I think Error in imPad line J imPadMex I pad type Error in edgesDetect line I imPadIpsymmetric Error in edgesDemo line tic EedgesDetectImodel toc As I said im quite new to matlab and didnt find yet where this imPadMex error does come from any help would be greatly appreciated I am able to train the Structured Forest using the BSDS image dataset But I am confused with the ground truth label in this directory BSRBSDS datagroundTruthtrain For each image the groundTruth label in mat format consists of struct with fields Segmentation and Boundaries Question I dont understand why we have labels for each image Isnt it more natural to have one label one struct per image Question And also If I want to train my own dataset how can I setup my own ground truth label both Segmentation and Boundaries Thanks Hi thanks a lot for your works i want to use the model to predict the boundaryedges from depth image your github page says it is aviable on internetbut i cant find it So where can i find that model
