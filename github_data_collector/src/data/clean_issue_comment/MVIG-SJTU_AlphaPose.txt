 Screenshot from Hi I have attached screenshot of Error My pwd is AlphaPose The detector Dir is already available but it is giving me error of ModuleNotFoundPlease could you help me for the same Thanks in Advance Cheers Ash Hello Im trying to run the demoinference like that python scriptsdemoinferencepy cfg configscocoresnet x res lr e xsimpleyaml checkpoint pretrainedmodelssimpleres x pth video videoscorte mp outdir outputs detector yolo savevideo And Im getting the following errors Also tried to run on jpeg images but the errors are the same The version of Python installed is and the requirements were installed as indicated at docsINSTALLmd Am I missing something or doing something wrong Thanks in advance Hi I am not sure whether my command is right or not But I got the runtimeError and I dont know how to fix it Perhaps I missed some steps while building it Really need your help thanks Hi my cpu usage is but gpu usage is I install pytorch for gpu and I am using master branch of AlphaPose on windows with nvidia geForce gtx gpu I set posebatch to and detbatch to otherwise I got cuda out of memory error the sever configuration is CPUIntelR XeonR Platinum CPU GHz GPUV but when I try to inference a video it inferences super slowthat is the inference message it cost s perframe in addition it could be terminated without any warning Hi thanks for sharing your code I have some question about crowdPose I cant find the code of crowdPose which you specify in doccrowPose It seems that the readme file is outdated There is no maching option in demoinferencepy Hiim working on Windows python and get error as below when runing scripts demoinferencepy with nessary parameters Traceback most recent call last File
