viewindexafter indexing The screenshot below are captured after applying and using npm as it corrects the text alignment It is not necessary to do so to see the results of this PR Before patch img width altScreen Shot at src After patch img width altScreen Shot at src The CSS for the controlgroup field most Joomla fields uses an old floating hack to align the label with the field I presume this is something that predates even J Basically it floats the label to take it out of the flow of the page and then places a left margin on the field to give it a fixed inset width I propose moving them to use flex instead It is a typical scenario flex is used designed for Less CSS required Flex naturally supports RTL so no RTL CSS required Media queries look at the width of the viewport and are the only way to change the orientation of the current controlgroup fields Flex would allow us to change the orientation of the field depending on the space available to it A much more versatile and safer way to approach responsive fields especially It is a change that would touch a large part of the Joomla UI so I am reluctant in making such a change without bringing it up as an issue first Maybe there is a reason this wasnt done before that I am unaware of Summary of Changes Remove title tooltip that has redundant info overlapping tooltip Testing Instructions Install Multilingual Sample Data
