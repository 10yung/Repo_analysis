See Searching inside JtR I found nothing Anyway this is something that jfoug maybe can easily fix BTW Google tells me hash cat can crack it telegram john and all other similar tools need to stripreplace any from path before using it as login field or any other field Easiest fix is to always use basename on all paths always although for GECOS fields we might actually want parts of directory names I am not entirely confident that the change is really necessary Still its safe Most or all formats that have a minlength has so because its implementations never allow anything shorter But weve seen plenty of cases where WPAPSK passwords are shorter than even for ASCII We should allow minlength decreasing the default Is it possible to bruteforce Roboform rfp files I have a single wordlist abb I checked all the rules john listrules But I did not find the rule which in general is very much in demand from the given characters Creating all kinds of combinations of characters Example john wwordlist stdout rulesShuffle Expectation a b ab bb ba bab bba abb I went looking for competitors hashcatUtils and crunch cannot do this either I suggest adding this rule to JtR ps maybe a question wish should have been asked on the mailing list but I lost the email address to which I need to write but could not find subscribing to the newsletter in a new way is troublesome There is a fileovpn configuration file that requires a password to connect There is a private key hash in the file If you can add support for this format AMD has removed the OpenCL AMD APP SDK for Windows and Linux files from their servers It seems that the necessary steps to make AMD OpenCL work has changed Anyway it is still possible to find and get driversSDK for AMD products I guess We need some tests hardware and volunteers See separator changed to This is a great improvement to our old hack of simply Base encoding the deprecated hccap struct A corresponding pot line in JtR will only contain ESSID and calculated PMK something like WPA PMKESSIDpassword That is TYPE is set to next field is PMK and all other fields but ESSID are empty
