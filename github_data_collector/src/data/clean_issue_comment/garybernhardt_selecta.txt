Thx for this awesome plugin I found a really mysterious bug It works well with either tmux or gnu coreutils but not with both Specifically Selecta works well inside tmux if I comment out the following line from my zshrc export PATHusrlocaloptcoreutilslibexecgnubinPATH Selecta works well outside tmux no matter if I comment out the above line or not Selecta does not work if I use both tmux and gnu tools The error message is the following stty standard input unable to perform all requested operations Traceback most recent call last from usrlocalbinselecta in main from usrlocalbinselecta in main from usrlocalbinselecta in withscreen from usrlocalbinselecta in withtty from usrlocalbinselecta in block in withscreen from usrlocalbinselecta in restoretty from usrlocalbinselecta in stty from usrlocalbinselecta in command from usrlocalbinselecta in pipe usrlocalbinselecta in block in command Command failed stty b cb ffff f c a f RuntimeError so yeah I think it might be because of the incompatibilities between binstty and gnu stty or else My environment macOS High Sierra tmux brew coreutils zsh I havent dug into this too hard yet I will probably try and get strace on it if nobody knows why this isnt working echo e n n selecta ui appears I select set x RESULT echo e n n selecta nothing happens next prompt immediately shown just to show that this is how you normally set something from a subshell in fish set x RESULT echo e n n echo RESULT Im guessing its failing to get devtty from within the subshell for some reason I found this handy so I figured Id share Feel free to close if you dont want it Ive realized that for my two main coding use cases git add and opening files in Vim I almost always need to select more than one thing For instance Ill usually change prod code together with test code and then want to add both to git CMjava choices srcmainjavacomgithubrschmittcolliderClojureMapjava srctestjavacomgithubrschmittcolliderClojureMapTestjava This quickly gets annoying since Ill end up typing the exact same query twice for no good reason If I want to git add or open say five files which is hardly uncommon this gets tedious enough that Ill switch to git add i git add p or copyandpaste using the mouse because invoking hs repeatedly is just too cumbersome I took the time to whip up a prototype of multiselect functionality in Heatseeker and so far it really seems like it has legs It looks like this screen shot at pm Thanks to Rust stabilization you can now install Heatseeker using Homebrew to play with this feature brew install The controls are ControlT will toggle the currently highlighted choice and move the cursor down Enter will select everything that has been selected as well as the currently highlighted choice ControlG will select everything that has been selected but not the current choice unless it has been selected with ControlT To support multiselect the SelectaCommand script can be modified as follows note that Im using this with tabe rather than e vim function SelectaCommandchoicecommand selectaargs vimcommand try silent let selections systemachoicecommand hs aselectaargs catch VimInterrupt redraw return endtry redraw for selection in splitselections exec avimcommand selection endfor endfunction And the zshrc function insertselectapathincommandline only needs a oneline change shell selectedpathfind type f hs paste sd return If I run bash c cat ls selecta and C out of the selecta prompt then I get the following error homemichaelpjbinselecta in block in command Command failed stty bf a b c f ff aff f ff n

stops appearing but I can still enter commands Ive tried with norc noprofile noediting posix and that doesnt help I also see the error when I run zsh c cat ls selecta but have no problems running the command directly at a zsh prompt I dont see this using sh on my system which is dash Im sure this is some weird terminal interaction but Im afraid I dont have any more leads than that In general it seems to only happen when selecta is running inside a command substitution Ive made the scoring algorithm smarter about sequential matching characters and word boundaries to improve results when querying for acronyms Its merged to master along with some other changes in d c dd f f a da fc b fa b edc The README contains a summary search it for algorithm Id love to hear feedback from actual Selecta users especially after youve used it on actual projects As far as I understand selecta currently requires a tty However it might also be useful to just have a sort of fuzzygrep In my case I have a script which yields a list of urls and I want to get a list of urls fuzzy matching a string ordered by score
