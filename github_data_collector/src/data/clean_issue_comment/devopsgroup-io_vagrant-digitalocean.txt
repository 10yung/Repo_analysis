Im having problems installing vagrantdigitalocean on a fresh installation of Ubuntu The vagrant package which comes from apt is which comes prepackaged with vagrantlibvirt version shell vagrant version Vagrant vagrant plugin list vagrantlibvirt system When I try to install vagrantdigitalocean I get the following version conflict shell vagrant plugin install vagrantdigitalocean Installing the vagrantdigitalocean plugin This can take a few minutes Bundler the underlying system Vagrant uses to install plugins reported an error The error is shown below These errors are usually caused by misconfigured plugin installations or transient network issues The error from Bundler is conflicting dependencies fogcore and fogcore Activated fogcore which does not match conflicting dependency Conflicting dependency chains fogcore activated versus vagrantlibvirt activated depends on fogcore Is there a known workaround for this problem Automatically assign a floating IP after the droplet is created Fixes It would be nice to be able to specify along with imagesizeregion a floating IP to use on the droplet Being created When I setup a Vagrantfile I typically make all these settings configurable via a filealong with a set of default settings I would like to allow the developer to specify a floating IPwhich is already provisioned and not assigned on the DO account to attach to the droplet after its up and running This is particularly useful for our application which requires a domainsubdomain be pointed to it to function properly its core to the functionality of the application so that we dont have to change dns records and wait for TTL or update etchost records each time we recreate the droplet If this is really easy to do and you can point me in the right direction I can take a look at submitting a pull request but my ruby experience it pretty rudimentary I have only ever used it for editing Vagrantfiles After asking passphrase and creating a droplet Vagrant tries to copy synced folders and it output is Command rsync verbose archive z chmodugorwX noperms noowner nogroup rsyncpath sudo rsync e ssh p o LogLevelFATAL o IdentitiesOnlyyes o StrictHostKeyCheckingno o

vagrantshare system vagranttriggers vagrantvmwarefusion Hi Guys I am using puphpet vagrantdigitalocean runing vagrant up does create the droplet at DO and gets the IP But right after that it freezes Puphpet is saying that its not their issue but vagrantdigitalocean Can you please verify if this is an known issue and if yes what is the solution Best Regards Danyal brew cask install vagrant force brew cask install virtualbox force vagrant box insecure box centos vagrant init centos vagrant up you get E T ERROR netsshauthenticationsession f e all authorization methods failed tried none publickey DEBUG ssh NetSSH connection debuglevel log END INFO ssh SSH not ready VagrantErrorsSSHAuthenticationFailed SSH authentication failed This is typically caused by the publicprivate keypair for the SSH user not being properly set on the guest VM Please verify that the guest VM is setup with the proper public key and that the private key path for Vagrant is setup properly as well INFO subprocess Starting process usrlocalbinVBoxManage showvminfo b af de ff ea e c a be machinereadable you also can not ssh i into the box but if you add configsshinsertkey false it all works Vagrant up seems to hang after creating the user account I can vagrant ssh into the box and a droplet is created correctly but the original command never comes back from the vagrant up command Also if I include a provisioning script its never executed I have to vagrant up provision that I am running this from a Win x box if thats an issue C Dev vagrant xenjekyllvagrant up Bringing machine default up with
