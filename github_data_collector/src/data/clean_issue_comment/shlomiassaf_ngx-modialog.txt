Hi everyone I have a question about a feature of ngxmodialog not sure if it exists or not so this is just a question Is it possible in ngxmodialog to move the modal once its opened In particular when cursor is near the top of the modal header an icon appears that shows that its movable and we can click on that to move the modal around the page Environment Angular version ngxmodialog version Browser chrome Firefox IE Thanks in advance IMPORTANT Please provide a sample using Im submitting a x bug report feature request question about the decisions made in the repository Do you want to request a feature or report a bug Both so im wondering if ngxmodialog still works with angular i attempted to get it working everything seems to be working find except one issue that im facing What is the current behavior NullInjectorError No provider for Modal a NullInjectorError due to the dependency injection not working properly in the constructor declaration of modal public modal Modal If the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via or similar you can use one of the templates above as a starting point set up ngxmodialog declare public modal Modal in the constructor of the desired component ng serve What is the expected behavior the code will compile with no errors Please tell us about your environment Angular version angular Browser Chrome IMPORTANT I could not reproduce the issue using plnkr so I attached a small zip file ngxmodialogdemozip Im submitting a bug Do you want to request a feature or

thin line ie the modal template is not rendered The modal html looks like the following html modaloverlay styleposition fixed top px left px bottom px right px zindex div cssbackdrop
