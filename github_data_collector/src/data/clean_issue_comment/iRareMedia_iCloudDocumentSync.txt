I am observing iCloud changes through iCloudFilesDidChange and what I am seeing is that calling retrieveCloudDocumentWithName actually triggers iCloudFilesDidChange which causes iCloudFilesDidChange to be called over and over again if I call retrieveCloudDocumentWithName from within iCloudFilesDidChange What I want to do is observe changes on a specific file if there is a change download the file and save it locally However due to the fact iCloudFilesDidChange is called over and over again if I call retrieveCloudDocumentWithName from within iCloudFilesDidChange theres no way to stop that Maybe I misunderstood something fundamental if so sorry Thanks for any help I shared my build with someone and they get stuck on saving specifically somewhere around here from what I gathered from my logs Get the URL to save the new file to NSURL fileURL self ubiquitousDocumentsDirectoryURL URLByAppendingPathComponentdocumentName Initialize a document with that path iCloudDocument document iCloudDocument alloc initWithFileURLfileURL documentcontents content document updateChangeCountUIDocumentChangeDone My build works fine on my device so I cant figure out if theres any cloud setting on their device that Im missing Did anyone else get stuck here I rewrote this in Swift Its available here Testing if delegate responds to deprecate method twice when first one should use nondeprecated version at iCloudm line if selfdelegate respondsToSelectorselectoriCloudFileUploadConflictWithCloudFileandLocalFile should be if selfdelegate respondsToSelectorselectoriCloudFileConflictBetweenCloudFileandLocalFile I tried to upload datadb file to iCloud and it showed uploaded successfully And it return YES when I checked if theres db file in iCloud Now I retrieved the documentData by the method retrieveCloudDocumentWithName How to transfer the documentData and save it into documents with name datadb I got it Its just for documents not for other files I get this error from the method saveAndCloseDocumentWithName after the saveToURL method Error while creating the document iCloud saveAndCloseDocumentWithNamewithContentcompletion blockinvoke ERROR Could not get attribute values for item LMDiClouditoveritiosappsMyAppDocumentsOthersmyfilexml n Error Error DomainNSFileProviderInternalErrorDomain Code The reader is not permitted to access the URL This library worked like a charm under xcode and iOS now that I opened the project with Xcode and iOS iCloud sync is really slow and blocks the main thread a lot I already have tried many approaches like dispatching on a different thread Not possible by the iCloud API and trying to make as few syncs as possible What could it be Thanks Hi I am running my app on iPhone and iPad When I upload a file from iPhone it is not appearing in iPad The files are appearing individually wrt device I tested it on iOS it always return NO when app is just launched After about s it will work and return the right value Its a very serious bug hope you can look into it
