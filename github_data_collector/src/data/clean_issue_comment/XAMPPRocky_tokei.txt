Tokei isnt counting files with no extension as shell whose shebang is binbash Its indeed not accounted for in getfiletypefromshebang Fwiw the best reference I know of for find all shell and other files is ack whose heuristic is Has extensions sh bash csh tcsh ksh zsh fish or first line matches bbatckzfish b Is it possible to install Tokei with yum Our CI machines only can use yum and not dnf Currently we have files which allows for outputting line counts per files but Id like it per top level directory Imagine tokei directories which would output summaries for lines for each provided directory Adds support for the Apache FreeMarker template language with ftl ftlh and ftlx as associated file extensions The file extension y is now associated to Yaccs source files and no longer to Happy which I have no idea what language it is Signedoffby Li Peng lipeng gmailcom This would be purely enhancement but I would like a little color or extra formatting in the terminal output I find it helps with looking quickly through an output personally Im not too sure exactly how I would color it Possibly coloring the lines between the words and the lines different colors Additionally bolding the columns headers and languages As a followup to it would be preferable if instead of text there was a display tokei running on a directory This was previously done with asciiema but I no longer want to use this service and would prefer an alternative Initially I thought of making a gif however making a gif that is high quality of tokei running would take up a relatively tremendous amount of space and I would want to avoid that both for when people clone the repo as well as when they download to view it on the GitHub README Video file formats would be small however they do not display inline on GitHub and to my knowledge there isnt a well supported gif like format that works across all browsers This is valid c code which effectively define a struct examplec c comment struct Point int x int y int z tokei vvv examplec TRACE tokeilanguagesyntax Start TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype Comment No TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype Was the Comment stack empty true TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype comment TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype Comment No TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype Was the Comment stack empty false TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype Comment No TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype Was the Comment stack empty false TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype struct Point TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype Comment No TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype Was the Comment stack empty false TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype int x TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype Comment No TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype Was the Comment stack empty false TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype int y TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype Comment No TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype Was the Comment stack empty false TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype int z TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype Comment No TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype Was the Comment stack empty false TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype Comment No TRACE tokeilanguagelanguagetype Was the Comment stack empty false Language Files Lines Code Comments Blanks C Total So tokei seems to mistakenly think that the backslash escapes the asterisk and then the block comment is still open Similar issues for css php lua and maybe many others css cool comment color red php php cool comment echo hello n lua cool comment printhello all valid effective code It would be nice if tokei could parse gitattributes and respect linguistdocumentation rules Eg tokei believes that the project ANESE is written primarily in assembly when its actually written entirely in C DeepinScreenshotselectarea Onefetch is a tool that relies on tokei for language detection the part in particular markdown Tests A test file is required with language additions The file should contain every variant comments and quotes as well as a comment at the top of the file containing the manually verified lines code comments blanks eg lines code comments blanks The comment should use the syntax of the language youre testing A good example of a test file is testsdatarustrs Currently for tests to successfully run the top comment needs to have a specific format X lines X code X comments X blanks Which to md file does not mention I propose adding to the md file to specifically mention the required format of the top comment
