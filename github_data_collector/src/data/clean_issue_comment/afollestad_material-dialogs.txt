What module does this apply to Core Description what youd like to happen Hello It would be very handful to have the possibility to access the dialogs title view and other views too Context As reported on another issue I recently experienced visible vertical scrollbar on dialogs title and toolbars subtitle when using AndroidX Preference library in my project For the toolbar the fix involves setting the proper subtitles styling while on the dialogs it was necessary to disable the PreferenceFragmentCompats vertical scrollbar as it is not possible to access the titles view Then to disable scrollbars on material dialogs setting up a preference theme is needed xml item namepreferenceThemestylePrefThemeitem style namePrefTheme parentPreferenceThemeOverlay item nameandroidscrollbarsnoneitem style This will cause the scrollbar of PreferenceFragmentCompat not working As for the toolbar Id like to be able to disable scrollbars also on dialogs titles without having to disable PreferenceFragmentCompats vertical scrollbar Im already aware that it is possible to access the titles view from the dialog view but I find this method tricky is this a reliable method Describe alternatives youve considered An alternative solution could be to let developers define custom titles textAppearance Hello Thank for your useful library I have a materialDialog that I fill its data with listItems function It maybe have lots of dataup to or options So if I change my screen orientation to landscape I should scroll my dialog in order to find proper option to click Some of our app users just told us that in that situation there is no sign whether we have other options to click or not So for that I started to add a scrollbar to this dialog I find id of recyclerView that contains my options and use some of its function like set Boolean enableVerticalScrollbarsth like this to true but it strangely doesnt have any effect on that dialog Maybe I could use method of materialDialog but I think this is not an appropriate way because I just want to show a list of options So please add scrollBar to this dialog when we have lots of optionsfor example more than options in portrait in landscape to improve user experience Library Version Affected Devices Google Pixel XL with Android Describe the Bug Dialog which BottomSheet behavior is able to cancel

GridIconDialogAdapter in GridItem so we can change the attributes of the text via the gridItems handler Describe alternatives youve considered Currently I have a custom implementation like the grid such that the image is replaced by a loading bar every time the user taps on an item think of the chat colorchanging dialog on Facebook Messenger I also want to indicate the current grid item that is already selected and to do that I want to bold the text of a particular title but since GridItemtitle is a string I cant set it The only alternative would be to append a selected string to the current text or to create a custom view Current implementation kotlin data class ColorGridItem DrawableRes val iconRes Int override val title String val context Context GridItem private lateinit var
