 It stopped working with Xcode Even with the trick to unsign the binary and update the plugins the extension doesnt work anymore I can see that the extensions are loaded for eg Alcatraz appears in the Window menu but the code map is nowhere to be seen This is most likely due to the fact that Xcode reworked entirely the code editor component It didnt seem that their extension framework was improved in Xcode vs what they announced and showed in Xcode so for now there is no way to get back the functionality in a more official way You can modify the time to eat and then save the color information cancel the synchronization when typing performance is slow Itll be nice to have a view on the git diff in the minimap img width altscreen shot at am src Error messages that appear at the righthand side are obscured by the MiniMap Often the issue navigator will show the warningserrors but it is not possible to view runtime errors using the issue navigator and its an extra step even for those that can be viewed in the issue navigator Thanks like this image a b efb b dbf a ab one suggest can you change position this plugin to Plugins item i notice a lot of plugins move here like this image ed ad ec e d bec The plugin list that used by me is below Alcatraz ColorSenseRainbow DBSmartPanels DerivedData Exterminator DXXcodeConsoleUnicodePlugin FuzzyAutocomplete HOStringSense JSFormatter Lin MCLog OMQuickHelp Peckham RTImageAssets SCXcodeEditorInset SCXcodeMinimap VVDocumenterXcode XAlign When I remove SCXodeMiniMap Xcode works well The version of my mac is and my Xcode is version of C There is a feature in Visual Studios rightside minimap that is just delightful and I wonder if youd consider adding it to your software VS has a color bar on the map that denotes deletions changes and additions Its very handy for jumping between the parts of code that youre working on Heres a tiny screen grab of what I mean Xcode C In comparison mode it would be nice if the minimap was on the left side of the left comparison window that way it would not break the comparison flow in the middle It appears that this bug described here is caused by SCXcodeMiniMap Removing SCXcodeMiniMap fixes the issue as well as installing SCXcodeMiniMap without FuzzyAutocomplete casues Xcode to crash again
