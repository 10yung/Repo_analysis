the links of datasets were not opened The matlab code in srextractplanem invoking sourceEdgeDetectTestexe generates only partial info vx vy vz score numLines But expected is KB file as present in cache vpdetection text img SRF LRvanishingpointstxt The start end and length of lines in sets not present Tried in x machine Behavior in matlab code and CMD for the sourceEdgeDetectTestexe is same Any suggestion Thanks Hi First of all thank you for the excellent work and code I was trying to evaluate my own method with you quantification script But there seems to be an error in the function computedifferencem At some point in the code the function tries to use variable warpedImage Compute Structural similarity index SSIM index ssim ssimindeximgt warpedImage Compute information fidelity criterion IFC ifc ifcvecimgt warpedImage But warpedImage was not defined before I am guessing it should just be replaced with im such that the code becomes Compute Structural similarity index SSIM index ssim ssimindeximgt im Compute information fidelity criterion IFC ifc ifcvecimgt im Is this correct or did you intend to have another preprocessing step which produces warpedImage Thanks again for the great work Cheers hi all the code needs to execute EdgeDetectTestexe so it needs Windows SO Is there a workaround or can anyone give the exe source code so that I can compile it on linux If not anyone could give me another solution tnx Hello The cvpr paper is an excellent work and I tried to run the code However it appears errors as follows Undefined variable vision or class visionShapeInserter Error in srextractplanesrdetectplanefromvp at shapeInserter visionShapeInserterShape LinesBorderColor White Error in srextractplane at modelPlane srdetectplanefromvpvpData img opt Error in srdemo at modelPlane srextractplanefilePathdataPath filePathimgFileName opt Error in srdemobatch at imgHiRes srdemofilePath opt It seems some code were missing or I made some mistakes to miss something Would you help me solve it Thank you very much jbhuang
