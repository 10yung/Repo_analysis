I would like to create a tmp directory at the beginning of reStart and delete at the end of reStop How might look example code This is my first scala native project so no idea why this happens

scenario where I want my dev server to run locally with dev only env vars addCommandAlias serverdev project server set envVars in reStart Map awsregion useast reStart but I cannot access those variables in any task that restart triggers eg this failsprintlnsysenvawsregion of course I can get this working simply by exporting manually like export awsregionuseast sbt serverdev There is at least at least one cryptoprovider that makes some changes to the JVM its installed to breaking the standard HTTPS implementation I have to test my code with such JVM but I dont need it doing anything else in my project This change allows overriding javaHome just for reStart Potential fields when process is started Start time PID Potential fields when process is running for showing with reStatus Start time run time CPU usage Mem usage Potential fields when process is stopped Start time end time wallclock run time CPU usage Max mem usage The difficulty might be getting the PID but if we have that we can probably go to proc for the other things This patch is my original work and I license the work to the sbtrevolver project under the project s open source license For esoteric reasons but reasonable ones can probably be imagined I have some projects with executable classes living in the sbt test configuration testrun works fine and show testreStartmainClass is set as expected but running it fails Here is a trivial reproduction mkdir p tmprevolvertestprojectsrctestscala cd tmprevolvertest echo sbtversion projectbuildproperties echo addSbtPluginiospray sbtrevolver
