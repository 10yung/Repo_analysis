Hello Im sorry but I tried with several versions of python and as you say with but I always get this error message when I do fbs freeze can you help me Thank you Capture d e cran a Add the ability to list modules to be excluded when freezing with PyInstaller The macOS Catalina dark mode isnt working as expected with fbs freeze The fbs run window seems to work fine The same behavior is observed with the example project I tried to add the NSRequiresAquaSystemAppearance key to the infoplist This seems to help but nothing was displayed on the window Im running the Qt Screen Shot at AM Screen Shot at AM Hi Possibly off topic but this was the closest forum for this I could find I was very happy when I saw there is a standalone QtDesigner on and I got it and installed it on Windows It starts and runs fine However when I checked HelpAbout Plugins I can see Failed Plugins mentioning pyqt dll see this screenshot QtDesigner The message is The specified module cannot be found although the module is present in C Program Files x Qt Designer plugins designer I ran the pyqt dll in Dependencies and this is what it says pyqt dependencies Apparently pyqt dll is missing references to python dll python dll and Qt Coredll even if Qt Coredll is actually in C Program Files x Qt Designer Could I solve this problem by copying python dll python dll and Qt Coredll to some directory say the same where pyqt dll is C Program Files x Qt Designer plugins designer and if so where should I get these files from apparently some specific versions are needed since I copied python dll python dll in this folder from a LibreOffice installation and that did not help Alternatively would it be possible to include these files in the standalone QtDesigner build in the future Thank you for your work and thanks in advance for any suggestions For many popular packages the hooks included with pyinstaller are sufficient but for less prominent or nonpublic packages custom hooks are required This PR allows users to specify additional directories for pyinstaller hooks in their settings files This looks like additionalhooksdir somehooks somemorehooks and causes pyinstaller to look for hooks in all listed directories in addition to fbsfreezehooks Thank you for making fbs Please let me know if this is the right approach to take If so I will go ahead and add a test I think there is a bug with the getresource method Indeed it is written in the tutorial that this method should return the path srcmainresources However on one project this method returns srcmainresourcesbase and on another one it returns src main icons I am running Windows Home version and I am using python Your operating systems MacOS Catalina Your Python version Must be or because you followed the above instructions Your fbs version Your PyInstaller version Your PyQt PySide version A copy of any error messages you are getting Use to format them sfvenv alexrockhillAlexsMacBookPro SlowFastQt sudo fbs installer waited
