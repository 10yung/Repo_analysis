Fixes iOS Xcode screen shot at pm Added support for extracting x assets similar to how x assets are handled This also requires adding new launch screens so that iPhone and Plus run in their native resolutions instead of the scaled iPhone resolution Without that iPhone Plus reports itself as having x screen scale instead of x Tested by running the code on the iPhone Plus simulator Extracted assets were named with the xpng suffix Fixes I might be mistaken but I think the iPhone plus simulator has x icons Is there a way to get these Also added blank Launch Images for iPhone Trying to extract iOS assets Doesnt quite work Takes too long to start and crashes sometimes Tapping on the detail disclosure button in the IPA tab shows the apps Infoplist When exporting emoji using iPad Simulator on iOS images are corrupted or cut on top For example NatureBear Facepng and NatureBear Face xpng are corrupted while NatureEarth Globe EuropeAfricapng and NatureEarth Globe EuropeAfrica xpng are cut on top Corrupted Emoji This is a cool project but does the HIG even allow devs to use apples images in their apps
