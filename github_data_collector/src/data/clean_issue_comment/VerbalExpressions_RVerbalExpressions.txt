Just an idea Might be nice to have a function called rxraw which allows user to explicitly specify a part of the rx For example rxalpha rxraw Az Yes I know about rxmultiple This is just an example when I know what the rx should look like but I cant get the rx functions to bend to my will Other possible names could be rxexpert rxasis I have been thinking how to organize package documentation We basically have a few groups of functions that may make sense to be introduced together at least in pkgdown Singlecharacter functions These are functions that return one character and do not require any wrappers rxalphanum rxbr and rxlinebreak rxdigit rxsomething rxspace rxtab rxwhitespace rxwordchar and rxword with default repsome argument Character sets These function output ranges or sets of characters wrapped into for which we dont have a way to express them with single character This is important when nesting them into supersets below when outer set of need to be peeled off From the user stand point they may not be any different from Singlecharacter functions rxalphanum rxalpha rxlower and rxupper rxpunctuation rxrange Appenders These functions take data argument and simply append something to it thus modifying the behavior of previously appended functions rxcapturegroups rxcount rxendofline and rxstartofline rxoneormore and rxnoneormore rxwithanycase Expressionwrappers These functions allow user to specify the sequence of characters out of which all should be matched to the string rxavoid and rxseek rxfind and rxliteral which I now dropped rxmaybe which is rxfind with rep argument set to maybe rxor which might need a bit of extra work see and thus will be out of this category Superset functions These functions specify a list of mutually exclusive symbolsexpressions only one of which should be matched to the string rxoneof rxanythingbut and rxsomethingbut eventually rxeitherof will be moved here as well if we decide to keep it I find this grouping helpful when reasoning about the functionality our package covers There are a few functions I dropped rxanyof duplicate of rxoneof rxdigits too little advantage compared to rxdigitrepn rxliteral duplicate of rxfind rxnot duplicate of rxavoidsuffix rxnew has been moved to utilsR Right now we have rxor implementation which compares data and value r Do not run rx rxfinda rxorb or at best rxorrxfindb In the comments you mentioned r Do not run Not sure if I like this I would prefer findvalue foo or findbar Rather than having to nest a rule inside of or maybe use glue Might the solution be similar to how now in dev branch we organized rxoneof r Do not run rx rxfindgr eitherofrxfinda rxfinde rxfindy In a sense this is rxoneof with ab instead of ab and limited to two arguments only I actually believe nothing prevents us from allowing more arguments if we go down this route I think going this route will add consistency to the package We need more endtoend examples Emails urls SSNs license plates etc Lets collect links to those here and later implement Basically boils down to detecting that data is not of rxstring class and acting as though first argument is the value argument Reference UPDATED sanitize now has method dispatch so we can simply write r unexported function for sanitizing arguments sanitizeargs function if missing returnNULL res sapplylist sanitize

Function works both in chain and stand alone r rxliteral attrclass rxstring character rxliteral rxliteral attrclass rxstring character Hadley says should also implement a few essential methods We should rethink all of our functions with vectorization in mind When implementing a vector class you should implement these methods length c If is implemented rev head and tail should all work Problem I think the package will be incomplete until we find a way to express groups of characters Heres a challenge to express email pattern matching in rx regexexample Challenges First of all I dont know of the way to express single word character alnum We used rxword to denote w and perhaps it should have been rxwordchar rxoneormore r rxchar functiondata NULL valueNULL ifmissingvalue returnpaste data w paste data sanitizevalue I also extended rxcount to cases of ranges of input r rxcount functiondata NULL n iflengthn n isnan returnpaste data n n lengthn paste data n Finally we dont have a way to express word boundaries b and it might be useful to denote them We shall call this function rxwordedge r rxwordstart functiondata NULL paste data b rxwordend rxwordstart Finally our biggest problem is that theres no way to express groups of characters other than through rxanyof but if we pass other rx expressions values will be sanitized twice meaning that we will get four backslashes before each symbol instead of two r this function is exactly like rxanyof but without sanitization rxgroup functiondata NULL value paste data value Solution Heres what it looks like when we put all pieces together r x rxwordstart rxgroup rx rxchar rxchar rxoneormore rxchar rxgroup rx rxchar rxchar rxoneormore rxchar rxalpha rxcount rxwordend x b w w alpha b txt This text contains email firstlastgmailcom and nonamepostio The latter is no longer valid regmatchestxt gregexprx txt perl TRUE firstlastgmailcom nonamepostio stringrstrextractalltxt x firstlastgmailcom nonamepostio The code works but I dont like it Constructor rx look redundant I believe theres a way to get rid of it entirely using specialized class see below It is not very clear what rxoneormore is referring to I wonder if all functions should have rep argument with default option one and options someany in addition to what rxcount does today Should rxchar without arguments be called rxwordchar Should rxchar with arguments be called rxliteral or rxplain We should be very explicit about sanitization of arguments To the extent that we should just mention input will be sanitized rxgroup is artificial construct a duplicate of rxanyof but without sanitization Here I see couple of solutions a Allow nested pipes as I have done above Create S class and this way detect when type of value argument is not character but rxstring Input of this class do not need to be sanitized because it has been sanitized at creation b Do not allow nested pipes Instead define rxanyof to have and allow multiple arguments mixing functions and characters Then hypotherical pipe would look like this r rxwordedge rxanyofrxwordchar repsome rxliteral rxanyofrxwordchar repsome rxliteral rxalpharep rxwordedge Its a lot to digest but somehow everything related to one particular problem Happy to split the issue once we identify the issues worth tackling Awesome short name and a hex with blue and red pill Tagline Rx is a painkiller for regex r availableavailablerx rx Name valid Available on CRAN Available on Bioconductor Available on GitHub Abbreviations Wikipedia Wiktionary Urban Dictionary nounfrom the symbol meaning prescription this seeks to label someone very annoying that can only be taken in small doses at set periods of time Sentiment Btw vx is also available name if you decide to go for that one But I really like the painkiller message
