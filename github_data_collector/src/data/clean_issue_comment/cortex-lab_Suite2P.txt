Hello I had a question regarding how to interpret the results of the python suite p deconvolution Its not clear to me what the yaxis of the deconvolution result means Is the height of the spike suggesting thats the number of spikes occurring at that time point Thats what Step from Figure in this paper suggests Step Spike deconvolution is performed on the neuropilcorrected traces that represent the average activity of pixels inside an ROI The result is a trace the same size as the fluorescence trace containing estimates of the number of spikes in every bin On the other hand I see others are thresholding the output to figure out when true spikes occur Here another researcher on the MouseLand Issues page suggests as much And based on the original OASIS paper I notice on Figure mentions of thresholding can be helpful To be honest Im not sure I understand if the output of the python suite p is the same as L on this graph so any clarification would be helpful Im overall confused because the amplitude of the spikes Im getting are into the hundreds and thousands Which makes me think I need to threshold But if I threshold I dont have an actual sense of how many spikes occurred nor can I be confident comparing spiking activity between cellssessions Hello Im quite new to this field I was wondering what data should be used as input to OASISpreprocessm Raw fluorescence measurement F or FF Hello I have been running suite p with ssh on a GPU cluster with JupyterLab with some success However now I want to switch to using the GUI using X protocolbut it seems that the default setting in the GUI is to not use the GPUs How and where exactly do I change the necessary parameters to get maximum performance out of the GPUs What are the necessary parameters I guess numworkers numworkersroi and opsuseGPU I tried loading the ops file from an earlier run with JupyterLabwhere numworkers was and numworkersroi was I dont know what the opsuseGPU value was set at defaultand it gave me a memory error I am running on a or sometimes a NVIDIA GPU cluster Thanks Evan Hello I get this error just after suite p finishes detecting ROIs Im running the runpipelinetiffsorbatchipynb jupyter notebook in jupyter lab NameError Traceback most recent call last ipythoninput a a e ad in module run one experiment opsEnd runs popsopsdbdb miniconda envssuite plibpython sitepackagessuite pruns ppy in runs pops db t tic print ROI DETECTION AND EXTRACTION ops ipl roiextractroidetectandextractops ipl ops ops ipl fpath ops savepath miniconda envssuite plibpython sitepackagessuite proiextractpy in roidetectandextractops classifiersclassifiernpy shutilcopyclassorig classfile printNOTE applying classifier sclassfile iscell classifierrunclassfile stat keys npixnorm compact skew NameError name shutil is not defined Do you have an idea what the problem might be Thanks Evan First thanks very much for developing this very useful toolbox I downloaded the newest version of suit p today I set opsdeconvType L and run wrapperDECONVm to get the spike train results Then I get this error Undefined function or variable Fbase I check the code and its true that there is no Fbase under L situation Moreover I also notice that the neuropil coefficient was set to by this command coefs min opsmaxNeurop ones NN since opsmaxNeurop is always Could you please explain why Thanks very much when using a specific experiment to get target image targetImage not empty This is resolving issue I tested the new code when targetImage is not empty Please have a look for when targetImage is empty However I based the new code primarily on the old code that existed for the case when targetImage is empty Hi guys In lines and you reshape the data from a dimensional array into a dimensional array with dimensions Ly Lx nPlanes nFrames Hence the code crashes if the length of the rd dimension is not divisible by nplanes For example say you have a tiff file with frames and you want to sample from planes I am getting Error using save Cannot create FS H O Room Aplane procmat because F S H O Room A does not exist This doesnt makes sense as I am not inputing the mat file from the F directory Please help Hello I am trying to load tiff files with many frames but for those that have more than frames I get a datFcell that is only long that is I am missing frames Is there something I can do Thank you Hello I started using registers p for my chronic imaging I usually have between and imaging sessions on the same cortical area on which Id like to track neurons Is there an easy way to compare more than just two sessions using resisters p thank you
