 Kinda strange that Forsaken Remastered needs that Passing in a VkFormat that hal doesnt yet support results in Illegal instruction core dumped on linux presumably because the enum result is not valid It looks like many of the memtransmutes that convert to Rust enums are unsound I didnt do an exhaustive search but I did find these Dolphin runs great when running using libportability rather than the default packaged MoltenVK However there is one graphical glitch appearing in several games the player shadow is duplicated in the top left corner of the screen It looks like an issue specific to the libportability layer as it doesnt show when using MoltenVK or another Dolphin backend I hope this is a good place to report such issues Screenshots Wind Waker Notice the boat shadow on the topleft corner of the screen in the sky img width altWind Waker src Avalanche Notice the surfer shadow on the topleft corner of the screen under the HUD img width alt Avalanche src Testing environment Macbook Pro with integrated graphics Intel Iris Graphics macOS Dolphin libportability v Tested by running LIBVULKANPATHHOMEgfxportability libportabilitydylib ApplicationsDolphinappContentsMacOSDolphin This is natively supported on macOSMetal and helps reducing the number of render pass switches gfxrs has already updated its our turn now See how transitioned on Travis only
