TestAccAWSWafSqlInjectionMatchSetchangeNameForceNew s Running a typical upload of file to S results in large memory usage when file size is large Example below resource awss bucketobject object bucket yourbucketname key newobjectkey source pathtofile etag filemd pathtofile When uploading a large file of GB the terraform process increased in memory from the typical MB resident set size up to GB resident set size The memory size remains high even when waiting at the apply changes prompt It looks like the use of filemd function is generating the md checksum by loading the entire file into memory and then not releasing that memory after finishing The problem is increased when processing multiple files using a fileset function for a for loop eg resource awss bucketobject

Linux on a GB RAM laptop runs out of RAM easily with this issue terraform v Terraform v provideraws v providernull v Expected Outcome Create the md checksum reading file in buffers of sensible size I tried running the md sum utility under linux fedora on the GB file and this MB resident set size That would be a good example of how to implement the checksum Workaround My current workaround for this may help others with problem Its not ideal in that it is using a shell command but works well for now Use alternative below resource nullresource filesstoreupload triggers alwaysrun timestamp

Otherwise use Relates Closes Description Adds support for kinesisanalyticsv API which enables supporting the Flink runtime as requested in This is a breaking change as written so I would like feedback on the best way to go about adding this support My best alternative approach thus far is to make a new resource type perhaps a kinesisanalyticsapplicationv with the new schema defined here I have refrained from updating the documentation until the issue of where support for this new API should live is resolved This is my first contribution I tried to follow the contributor guidelines but
