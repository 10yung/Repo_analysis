been generated by Renovate Bot View repository job log here Please enter a clear and meaningful title for your feature request Thanks Description Give at least some information about the need and value of this request With the new release of Apollo Federation new keywords and directives can be used in the graphql schema declaration More information on all that Apollo Federation allows can be read in their official documentation Out team has managed to figure out a workaround for generating resolvers with the key directive added to the schema but at the moment graphqlgen cannot generate resolvers for types that use the extend keyword A typical error that is generated when trying to run graphqlgen with a type that uses the extend keyword would look like the following Error occurred while reading schema Error Field company Couldnt find type MyType in any of the schemas This feature request aims to include Apollo Federation support with regards to generating resolvers Additional

Breaking changes Drop support for Nodejs dce Remove execashell and execashellSync The shell option should be used instead Remove execastdout and execastderr childProcessResultstdout and childProcessResultstderr should be used instead Remove errorcode number or string in favor of errorexitCode number and errorexitCodeName string Rename stripeEof option to stripFinalNewline f ba d dc a Rename cmd in childProcessResult and error to command Default preferLocal option to false If you are executing locally installed binaries youll need to manually specify preferLocal true Ensure windowsHide option is always true so that no window pops up on Windows c errorsignal is now undefined instead of null when no signal was used Set errorkilled to false when child process timed out Make errorkilled always boolean not undefined Ensure errors always have the same shape errorstdout and errorstderr are now an empty string instead of null when the command failed Features Add TypeScript
