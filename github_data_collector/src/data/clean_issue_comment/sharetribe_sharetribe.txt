 There is an issue with CLP editor when of sections is higher than ordering fails This PR fixes the issue Hello everyone We have set up a new discussion forum for Sharetribe open source community Its a Discourse forum at wwwsharetribecomcommunity We hope to see the forum growing actively Please go and register and start discussing So when should you add a new Issue to Github and when post a new thread to Discourse The rule of thumb is you should add a new Issue only for reproducible bugs in Sharetribe code and documentation All support questions should go to forum I hope to see you on the forum Mikko from Sharetribe
