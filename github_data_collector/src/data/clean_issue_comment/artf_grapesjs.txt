Hello everybody How do i open a selector like general as i select the element I am new to javascript but i tried something out like this editoroncomponentselected functioncomponent ifcomponentattributestagName div const styleManager editorStyleManager styleManagergetSectorGeneral open true what iam doing wrong Thx for help Hi quick question I have an image and I just want to add a link on it Using the model what is the easiest way to add a link on the image I tried to use modelreplaceWith but the problem is that if I put some styling on the image and then call modelreplaceWith the styles are removed Is there a better way to achieve this Thanks This bug is also on the online demo Add a Text Block to the page start typing and hiting enter to make several break lines Unselect the block Double click on the block to start editing again Now if you click on the view code button you will see that the HTML nodes inside the Text Block have some draggabletrue attributes This always occure at step three The first time you edit the text and add break lines everything is fine as long as you do not want to edit the block again later The problem is in the final HTML displayed on a website these attributes are still there You can not select anything because the navigator interpreting the draggable attributes And yes I am saving in database both of the html and components separately It seems like a bug to me or I misunderstood something else draggablehtmlbug draggablehtmlbug Hi I am using grapesjs in a project that uses proportional scaling everywhere based on your advice I can now default the font size selectors to em and make em the only option editoronload function const styleManager editorStyleManager force fontsize to EM const fontSize styleManagergetPropertytypography fontsize fontSizesetunits em fontSizesetunit em fontSizesetstep fontSizesetmin fontSizesetmax everything is fine but when I set the units to EM the value of the selector is staying as the default in piixels in this case so the selector shows em whilst the gadgets are appearing in the editor with the font sizes I define as part of creating my gadgets Is there a way to sync these up so that the fontsize shows the correct value I have tried fontSizesetvalue but this is overridden thanks Darren B Im using GrapesJs with Angular and am extending the functionality using Angular components So my template looks like this rswccustomcomponent lockeditinginpages customcomponentidcustomcomponentKG g xE Yf SzTRTPA ESjULVAlwmCsi idij i rswccustomcomponent rswcmenu lockeditinginpages idi un rswcmenu div classcontainer div lockeditinginpages idicom pInsert your text here p div div This all works fine Ive added DomComponents to the designer and the components show up in the layer designer and I can even change traits with no problem Everything renders as it should However while I can select my Text component and see a badge I cannot select rswccustomcomponent or rswcmenu When I click on the items theres no blue rectangle and no badge is shown the only way I can selectchange them is through the Layer panel on the left What do I need to do to make these selectable Bug after release still exists Repeat steps and you will get error Uncaught TypeError Cannot read property indexEl of undefined It can be to reproduce in your demo When I drag a component say a Map onto the canvas it now creates three copies of that element in the DOM However the model is correct and if I refresh the screen it renders correctly Without trying to erect an entire sandbox to reproduce any quick thoughts on what might be causing this Thanks Andrew Not sure why But all of a sudden when I start dragging components onto a canvas I get this This seems to happen when I edit a template save it and reload it It also seems to happen when I try to drag a new component to the LAST element of the page if I try to drag and element inside of a DIV container inside the template its fine But if I try to drag it at the beginning of the template I get the duplicate items I referenced in I have a feeling this is related somewhere theres a null array thats not supposed to be null WIthout trying to erect an entire sandbox to repro outside of my application any quick thoughts on what might be causing this Any ideas on things I could do to track down the problem Hi artf i hope you are doing good Im seeing some issues around the color picker if one is open and afterwards a click is made on the canvas the color picker will not close even if the option clickoutFiresChange of the plugin is set to true this is because the event propagation is taken by the iframe of the canvas and is not passed through The only workaround that i have found is by adding a secondary event that can catch the click on the canvas at the moment im using componentselected but im thinking for a better solution Here is my proposal getColorEl if thiscolorEl const self this

a pull request Thanks a lot for this excellent library im learning a lot diving into the source code Best regards Juan
