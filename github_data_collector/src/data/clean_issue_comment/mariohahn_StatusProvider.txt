First of all thank you for the awesome framework I currently got a problem with it displaying a sentence when a tableView is empty The problem here is that the containing tableView changes size due to business logic and by that the text get wrapped from line initially to lines making the animation look weird My proposal for that would be to expose a variable like maxLabelWidth that if set applies a constraint to the UILabel like UILabelwidth maxLabelWidth Would be awesome if you could add this in a future version Is there a way to acquire a reference to the ActionButton I want to present a popover when the action button is pressed and I need this reference to position it correctly Is there an easy way to make my status views cover the whole view of the viewController These covering views should also dynamically adapt to the size of the viewController on different devices Awesome project Perhaps add an example that shows best practice of using StatusProvider with a UITableViewController This would be very helpful Im not sure if I should make use of tableViewbackgroundView or set tableViewseparatorStyle none or show a view that covers the tableView Any reason for having the siosdeploymenttarget pointing to iOS I checked the code and unless Im missing something I dont see a reason why not supporting iOS
