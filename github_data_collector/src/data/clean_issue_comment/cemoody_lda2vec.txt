I got here from the blog article at I notice that sometimes phrases are considered such as classified information or drone strikes Since word vec is at word level only how did you tackle phrases Thanks As we know Plexity can evaluate lda model performance What about lda vec Is there any code can be referenced thanks when I run lda vecrunpy Ihad this error cannot import name printtopwordspertopic from lda vec C Users Asus AppData Local Programs Python Python lib sitepackages lda vecinitpy can anyone help me many functions and files are missing in lda vec library which is installed using pip for which I had to move around files from git to the folder where lda vec is installed And there were many other spelling and paranthesis mistakes from python point of view But I am not able to find a functionfile by name move which is necessary in order to run lda vecrunpy the error generated is File C Users Sudheera Downloads lda vecmaster examples hackernews lda vec lda vecmodelpy line in module from lda vecutils import move ImportError cannot import name move from lda vecutils C Users Sudheera Anaconda lib sitepackages lda vec utilspy Spacy v has added a language submodule in its API Please use nlp spacyloaden or import spacylangen instead I m trying to adapt this example to my own tweets data but I got really confused about the loss function calculation The calculation in the code is not identical to the formula in the paper The above two pictures show the Loss function formula in paper but in the code it only contains the first part of the sum L d There is a dubious calculation of l underlined in the following picture which I think might be the second part but it s not added to the loss before lossbackward And I had to add a multiplication of clambda to the original prior code right under the red line in the above picture because the returned value of modelprior is actually a minus value of the formula without the lambda factor I don t know Chainer so it s very hard to decide whether l was calculated correctly as the second part of the sum and could be readily added to the loss before backward Its also hard to decide the intention of the fraction variable and whether it should be multiplied to the l part of the sum too Actually I tried adding l to loss without multiplying it to fraction but didn t get the expected result To get preprocesspy running for Hacker News I did the following from the lda vec root mkdir exampleshackernewslib cp r lda vec exampleshackernewslib In the hackernews datapreprocesspy file I added the following import sys syspathappendlib In the hackernews lda vec module in lib I added the following to preprocesspy import spacy spacyloaden from spacylangen import English from spacyen import English In my python environment I did the following python m spacy download en Note that pandas is a requirement Then in lda vecexampelshackernews you can run python datapreprocesspy Will update if I get everything else working Just found that in the twentynewsgroups example the downsampled word list is never used after calculation I fixed this by moving the downsampling to an earlier place and changing all the later pruned to clean but some preprocessing results like vocabpkl corpuspkl and vectors are still not influenced by the downsampling and the further solution if needed seems not straightforward I build and install correctly setuppy at the rooth No problem with running script in lda vec folder but when i try to run lda vecrunpy in twenty news group example folder it return Traceback most recent call last File lda vec lda vecmasterexamplestwentynewsgroupsdatapreprocesspy line in module from lda vec import preprocess Corpus ImportError No module named lda vec Add the path with syspathappend doesnt change anything
