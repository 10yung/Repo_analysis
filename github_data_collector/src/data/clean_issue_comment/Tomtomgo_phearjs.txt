A quite silly problem that takes me nearly one hour I found all the worker for phearjs is crashed The reason is I didnt put phantomjs in path which is not mentioned in its download page and I assume phearjs can find it Hope it can save time for other users Hello there I tried to install Windows but failed ofcourse I dont have memcached butI do have bitnami stack which I can install through Anyway I am not interested in caching nowso I have Node js installed I have phantom js last version No Memcached yet Followed this code git clone cd phearjs npm install The installation create error and debug log is attached npmdebugtxt Now starting the service with node phearjs getting this error modulejs throw err Error Cannot find module C Bitnami phearjs phearjs at FunctionModuleresolveFilename modulejs at FunctionModuleload modulejs at ModulerunMain modulejs at run bootstrapnodejs at startup bootstrapnodejs at bootstrapnodejs Might be a nice addition to have the option to return images generated by phantomjs as Base phearjs is effectively incompatible with Windows because of the memcache dependency It may be desirable to have a config flag that removes the memcached dependency when running phearjs for Windows users who want the scraping features without caching capabilities PS I can attempt to make a PR for this but it might take weeks to find a good time for it Let me know if I should
