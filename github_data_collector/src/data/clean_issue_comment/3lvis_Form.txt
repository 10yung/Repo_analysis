Hi I have a problem when i try to run this project in a iOS device For detail check the gif jul I happen only in iOS on both iphone and ipad FormField refers to FormSection which refers to FormGroup strong reference On the other hand FormGroup contains Sections which contains Fields Such an arrangement can be a source of memory leaks Hi everybody While profiling my project in Instruments Ive noticed that my view controller using Form was generating a memory leak Ive tried to find the culprit but I didnt succeeded Ive found that the demo project BasicObjC in my case is also concerned As Im not really good at debugging memory leaks and retain cycles I asking for your helpideas What Ive found using Instruments and tools MLeaksFinder FBRetainCycleDetector When dismissing a popover a memory leak is detected it seems to come from FORMFieldValuesTableViewController but Im not really sure about this When dismissing the view controller containing the form a leak is detected on UICollectionView If anyone has a clue I would be really grateful Including these two lines in my pod file useframeworks pod Form Im getting a Swift version error when I try to build At that point I Edit Convert to current Swift Syntax Unfortunately I then get an error that says the file I import in the line import UIColorHexh does not exist I go through and remove all code that references that file Then at that point I try to build but am getting a Apple MachO Linker Error Any suggestion on how I can resolve these issues The project looks amazing so Id like to be able to give it a try Hi The Issue I am trying to automate the process of filling form field data based on data present in other fields Basically implement a rules engine of sorts into forms For example if a checkbox gets checked itll hide a specific field further down the line and vice versa if its unchecked The logic behind this is already fleshed out and functional but only when the form isnt too big so that there are nonvisible fields Ie if theres fields at the bottom of the form that one has yet to scroll through and I attempt to update any field visible or otherwise through the use of FORMTargets a NSInternalInconsistency exception is thrown That the number of items before the update must be equal to after the update plus or minus the modifications The Code datajsontxt Attached you will find a very simple json to demo this on as of this writing August st I am on the latest version of the engine and am using the demo HYPSampleCollectionViewController from the BasicObjC scheme I am just swapping out the filename voidcheckRules FORMField field selfdataSource fieldWithIDcheck includingHiddenFieldsYES NSMutableArray targets NSMutableArray array if fieldvalue boolValue targets addObject

targets addObjecttarget selfdataSource processTargetstargets Above is the code I use to check the current field values and generate targets accordingly This is called in every fields fieldUpdatedBlock So yeah as mentioned the code does work its just that when theres fields out of view that the number of items somehow gets corrupted afterwhile processing the targets If I modify my json to only have one group so that it can all fit on the screen without having to scroll then there are no issues For example here is the exception logged when attempting to toggle the Is Juvenile switch Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInternalInconsistencyException reason Invalid update invalid number of items in section The number of items contained in an existing section after the update must be equal to the number of items contained in that section before the update plus or minus the number of items inserted or deleted from that section inserted deleted and plus or minus the number of items

provide I just encountered a problem for elements having same id wont work So far I was using id name same as title which user decides But giving same title in both elements former element interaction is not possible in this library This information will not be entered by users We developers have to choose unique id for all elements So can I use numbers starts from as id for all elements like for first element and for second element and so on Please advise me on this as soon as possible Thank you This library is helpful for reading JSON and building form UI I want to allow users to create form templates which creates JSON then the JSON is used using this library So is it possible using this library Is there any library for this to create form templates Im trying to trace the logic of how your group headers keep track of their collapsed state The scenario would be like so Collapse a group Scroll down so the group disappears from screen Scroll back up so it gets reinstantiated for view Im failing to figure out where you guys figure out if it should be collapsed or not I only see the part where you assign if it is collapsible Thanks Hello I am trying the FORM to render dynamic User interface I like my button actions to be dynamic too Like when user clicks a button open an URL from a Textfield in the same screen Or copy some data from a field and paste in another textfield in same screen So looking for dynamic button actions Is this something can be doable Appreciate any suggestions here Thanks Pranav
