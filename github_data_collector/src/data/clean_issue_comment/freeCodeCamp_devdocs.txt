bottle cmake codeigniter django falcon godot julia matplotlib numpy pandas python scikitimage scikitlearn statsmodels The Sphinx cleanhtml filter removes all formatting from dt elements However this is not entirely desirable since the formatting makes things look better For example the header for BaseException original is transformed from this exception BaseException to this exception BaseException cc Thibaut since you might have a reason for implementing this this way no worries if you don t reply though denilsonsa on Trello We already have Momentjs documentation See Momentjs However it is missing the documentation for momenttimezone which is an optional part of momentjs I imagine the scraper would be mostly the same You could even group both documentation pagess moment and momenttimezone under the same Momentjs project insie devdocs D Work Coding DevDocs devdocsbundle exec thor docsdownload default DOM Events FAILED ErrnoENOENT No such file or directory gunzip CSS
