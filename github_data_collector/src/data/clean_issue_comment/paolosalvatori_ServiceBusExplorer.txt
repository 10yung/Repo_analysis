I am getting this error Exception Could not load type MicrosoftServiceBusMessagingMessagingEntityClient from assembly MicrosoftServiceBus Version Cultureneutral PublicKeyToken bf ad e I was running the release downloaded from Github releases page I unblocked the zip file before unzipping and running SBE I also tried building the latest code from develop and it has the same issue also The develop branch contains code that is using the new Service Bus SDK In the default configuration it requires the ports and for outbound traffic which will affect some users with locked down environments If using a proxy you would have to somehow make it use AmqpWebSockets see It is also dependent on NET instead of The latest code in the developer branch is using the new SDKs for Service Bus Relay and Event Hubs These dlls and most likely some of their dependencies need to be included when releasing The Options dialog box would be more user friendly and use less screen estate if tabs were used to separate the settings on different tab pages Customer reported that some of their IOS device cant receive notifications The azure notification hub product group confirmed that some devices use installation and their channel expired so azure notification hub didnt send notification message to those devices We also use the NotificationHubClientGetInstallationString SDK to make double confirmation Its returned Installation Class contains PushChannelExpired property and this value is also True But when we use the service bus explorer latest version to check the ChannelExpired value it show as false Please help us fixing this issue MicrosoftAzureNotificationHubs v has been unenlisted from NuGet Unenlisting is not as bad as being deprecated but still not a good thing Information about unenlisting and deprecating NuGet packages may be found here We should switch to an enlisted version of MicrosoftAzureNotificationHubs The recently merged PR includes changes that cause ServiceBusExplorer to use the new SDKS for ServiceBus Relay and EventHubs Currently the only functionality that is using the new SDKs is the purging of ServiceBus messages However the new functionality does not have support for setting the TransportType to AmqpWebSockets which is required if you are connecting to ServiceBus through a proxy TransportType in the new client translates to ConnectivityMode in the old client but there is no automatic mode in the new client which would correspond to ConnectivityMode AutoDetect To handle that the GUI needs to be changed Preferably it should support configuring the proxy settings too This is brought up in issue The workaround for this is to just Receive and Delete the messages Hi I would like to know if auth with active directory is supported clientIdclientSecrettenantId CC paolosalvatori Thanks in advance for your response I created an IoTHub listener and everything works smoothly But when I right click on an event and choose Save Selected Event context menu option literally nothing happens and the content does not go to the clipboard Affected services IoT Hubs Event Hubs
