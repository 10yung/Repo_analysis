I was trying to determine the licenses for my dependencies I found that the RubyGems API will return the license but only if it is specified in your gemspec file On larger screens the email preview iframe is being limited to a height of pixels and the full available screen size is not being used Hi Im using Rails and have not installed the gem separately I have a catch all route as the last route in my routesrb file get path mainpagenotfound This catches also the preview path What would be the recommended way to implement the catch all route so that it would not conflict with the preview path Or can I explicitly define the preview path in the route file How can I use this gem to render an incoming email as a partial I can have the incoming email in raw format as a huge string or as a Mail object Any help is appreciated This will make it show up on rubygemsorg Im doing due diligence on our gems and need to find out the licenses for all the gems Having it show up on rubygemsorg cuts out the step of having to go to the github repo Steps to reproduce Executing this code which has an error ruby class MailPreview MailView def invitation thiswillraiseanerror account Accountfirst inviter invitee accountusers Notifierinvitationinviter invitee end end Then removing the ruby thiswillraiseanerror The error persists until I restart the server How should it behave I shouldnt need to restart the server in order to make the MailPreview execute without the thiswillraiseanerror line in rails you should inherit your preview mailer from ActionMailerPreview instead of MailView I wanted to preview my templates with a different locale To make this process easier I wanted to change the locale based on the locale param I use factories for specs and I find them very convenient to use in mailviews actions Factories as well as other methods for generating sample data on the fly need to be cleaned after Since mailview is supposed to be readonly I see no disadvantage in actual prevention of data changes persistency using transactions The first commit is kinda working draft for discussion Ill add specsdocs if needed ps Ive seen but did neither like the solution nor understand the discussion there slightlyofftopic Might be useful to include in the docs mailview for human and also for automatic testing Usersr Programmingprojectvconfigroutesrb in block in top required
