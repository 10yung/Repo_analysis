Support you I think this project is greatI hope it will succeedI am always looking for a debugger that supports systemwide taint analysisbut I only found free tools like pandaUnfortunately its performance is too badWhen I run some large software in the vm the whole system is very slow I cant debug it at allFinally I found a commercial tool It is called tetraneBut I asked some people they said that this tool is not as highperformance as it is advertisedI dont know if there is a debugger that supports fullsystem taint analysis on the market and if you run Firefox the system wont slow downIn addition I am looking for an open source project which is implemented by c or c and it support forward and backward taint analysisI found an open source ida plugin Its called bincat but its not c language I studied it for a few days headache and couldnt understandIf you know any information please let me know thank you
