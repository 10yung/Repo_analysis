Thanks for a great package R really needs a good templating engine If the names of hashpeople are unknown there appears to be now way of accessing the data in its children librarywhisker hash list people list a list first john last johnsson b list first peter last petersson c list first steve last stevesson stuff c template people h Hello firsth people result whiskerwhiskerrendertemplate template data hash printHTMLresult Link to stackoverflow Hi I am just wondering if there are plans to continue the development of whisker It is a handy package I would be happy to help push version to CRAN for instance Thank you Anders Hey could you consider pushing to CRAN It would be so nice to have strict FALSE available by default without any editing in johnmyleswhiteProjectTemplate See sqlreaderRL Pretty please Best regards crubb While whisker supports sections it does not appear to support sections with nonempty lists as described in Template repo bnameb repo Hash repo name resque name hub name rip Output bresqueb bhubb bripb Using JSON This closely follows the mustache documentation by usingjsonlite to convert the hash to an R object The R object is a list with a data frame of rows r libraryjsonlite librarywhisker tmpl repo bnameb repo hash repo name resque name hub name rip data fromJSONhash list of dataframe not list of list whiskerrendertmpldata This does not conform to the specification is not correct as in collapses the name column rather than returning three results According to the specification I would expect this result r cbresquebbhubbbripb Using listoflists Using a list of lists does not work either r data list repo list nameresque namehub namerip whiskerrendertmpldata bresqueb Ive been trying to get whisker working with LaTeX which uses a lot of braces At first I thought it wouldnt be an issue since theres proper nesting r template Hello name You have just won value text whiskerrendertemplate data cattext Hello You have just won So I thought fine Ill just switch the delimeters r template Hello name You have just won value text whiskerrendertemplate data cattext Hello Chris You have just won Which is a bit weird Apologies if Im just doing something incorrectly There is an inconsistency in the whitespace generated by these two templates str header query holla query footer str header objquery holla objquery footer the only difference is that the section variable is within a list obj in the second version This version gives what I would expect librarywhisker whiskerrenderstr listqueryTRUE header nholla nfooter whiskerrenderstr listqueryFALSE header nfooter While the second version generates extra newlines librarywhisker whiskerrenderstr listobjlistqueryTRUE header n nholla n nfooter whiskerrenderstr listobjlistqueryFALSE header n nfooter This does not affect the version from CRAN Whisker seems to fail when there is a period in the name of the variable Considering that R variables quite typically have periods in the name this is problematic whiskerrenderusername listusername whiskerrenderusername listusername If there is a way around this please let me know I imagine its a quick fix Also if this is an intentional design choice thatd be good to know too Thanks I think it would be great to have the ability to turn on an option which checked to see if parameters existed and printed a warning died if missing eg something like template Hello place whiskerrendertemplate checkvarsTRUE produces a warning eg Warning variable place undefined in Due to the possibility of nested tags this is very hard to check externally so something like this is hard to verify without parsing the structure of the mustache file and comparing to the structure of the R environment repo bnameb repo This is an issue as minor typos can lead to missing variables and hard to detect errors in rendered templates See also discussion here
