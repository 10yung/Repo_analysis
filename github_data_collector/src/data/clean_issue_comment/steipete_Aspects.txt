If Im not mistaken AspectIdentifier is what being returned by aspecthookSelector method If so its advertised that it would conform to AspectToken protocol It does it in informal way by just implementing required methods What it means is that if we check the object returned by aspecthookSelector method at runtime for the protocol conformance it will actually fail which can impact user logic relying on that NSMethodSignature signatureWithObjCTypes type signature is empty Hello I am newer I read code from aspects And see OSSpinLock in use but apple develop says This is a replacement for the deprecated OSSpinLock Please check if Im wrongHopefully for your concern Theres known issues with this approach and to this date February I STRICTLY DO NOT RECOMMEND TO USE Aspects IN PRODUCTION CODE I found you wrote this in readme Im curious about what is known issues Would you mind show some details It can not hook AppDelegate func in iOS Betalike applicationopenURLoptions applicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptions steipete Its not very convenient to use Aspects in Swift now so this mr created AspectsSwift for improving swift support Compiling IB documents for earlier than iOS is no longer supported
