Seeing as node has been made the latest stable release I am wondering if it is possible to add node v support for nodeyue Is there a way to access native features from the OS by running Swift or ObjectiveC for mac apps through Yue While more apps are supporting dark mode for their UIs it seems like a good idea to bring this to Yue too I specifically like the way Electron is handling this by providing a subscriber see below The upside of this is that we are also able to subscribe to different notifications like when the user has lockedunlocked his screen etc What do you think const systemPreferences requireelectron systemPreferencessubscribeNotification AppleInterfaceThemeChangedNotification function theThemeHasChanged updateMyAppThemesystemPreferencesisDarkMode I might be missing something here but is there a way to set up virtual lists with yue As in I have a scrolling container with thousands or tens of thousands of childViews in it and I want the app to render the items lazily Right now it takes ages just to display the first few items Maybe someone can point me in the right direction If there s a way to do a custom implementation on top of yue that s cool too Thanks Is it possible to use Webview on Windows if its available The main Yue repo has not had a commit for months I am wondering if work of Yue has been halted and if so for how long I have this simple code javascript const win guiWindowcreate winsetContentSizewidth height winsetTitleYue Test winonClose guiMessageLoopquit const tabs guiTabcreate winsetContentViewtabs const testTab guiContainercreate tabsaddPageTest testTab const testText guiLabelcreatetest testTabaddChildViewtestText const testTab guiContainercreate tabsaddPageTest testTab const testText guiLabelcreatetest testTabaddChildViewtestText But when I start the app and try to change tabs the application suddenly freezes and stops In the console it outputs an error ELIFECYCLE No clue what Im doing wrong OS Windows bit Yue Nodejs v Yode v When I do requireyuegui on lua he doesnt work he says hes not finding the gui I didnt find any references in the documentation Is this planned to be implemented
