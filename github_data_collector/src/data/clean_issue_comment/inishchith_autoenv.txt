I currently installed autoenv by pip install and autoactivate envs of projects with pleasure However when I try to go further and set AUTOENVENABLELEAVETrue both within the shell by export and by modifying activatesh and I realized that envleave was never executed As I took a closer look at activatesh and compared it with the master branch it seemed not the same wc l activatesh outputs no autoleave in the local script etc Did that happened because the pypi version is not catching up with the master branch or stable one if any If so whats the recommended way to update it English is not my native language please excuse typing errors Fixes This implements sennav and meermanrs suggestion as a pull request Due to Catalinas new firmlinks this fixes an infinite loop on OSX Catalina Manually running source activatesh will enter the infinite loop condition Manually running source activatesh with the line change returns nearly immediately and enables autoenv Hello Updated to Mac Catalina OS Ive tested it on more than one Mac and have the same thing Hi Ive installed autoenv by issuing pip install autoenv which worked fine but it installed an outdated version release last updated in which does not respect new environment variables such as AUTOENVENVFILENAME This can certainly catch someone off guard as Its not mentioned anywhere Please update pypi release with latest source or at least add note to readme file that pypi release is outdated Thanks I use the directory stack a lot so itd be great to have support for pushd and popd I can see that theres a PR for it So say someone wants to remove autoenv Im asking for a friend P But then once doing brew uninstall they get this error bash usrlocaloptautoenvactivatesh No such file or directory But my friend cant figure out where that command is being run What should my friend do after installing the serverless framework I have these errors when typing workon myvenv getting these deactivate command not found virtualenvdeactivate workon command not found serverless which workon output the function but I dont see the words serverless there and I dont understand why virtualenvdeactivate stopped working Also commented out from my zshrc these lines tabtab source for serverless package uninstall by removing these lines or running tabtab uninstall serverless f

debug this Could current activated env be deactivated if I cd to folder which is not subfolder of current directory Also if I using such env source oenvbinactivate it works when I enter to this folder but then when I go to subfolder Im getting bash oenvbinactivate No such file or directory I can fix it using absolute path but it will be activated twice isnt it kennethreitz took me too long to figure out but once I compared the git versus the download from brew I discovered that the leave functionality was not there Looks like an update to brew is needed I installed autoenv using git clone gitgithubcomkennethreitzautoenvgit autoenv echo source autoenvactivatesh bashrc Then I sourced it source bashrc Then I setup a dir with env like this binbash source venvprojectbinactivate export APPSETTINGSconfigDevConfig export DATABASEURLmysqlpymysqluserpasslocalhost testcharsetutf mb But when I cd to that dir I get a No such file or directory error autoenv autoenv WARNING autoenv This is the first time you are about to source vagrantprojectenv autoenv autoenv begin contents autoenv binbash M autoenv source homevagrantvenvprojectbinactivate M autoenv M autoenv export
