Hi Not sure if anyone is familiar with running the Splash benchmarks Repo is Splash but it is Splash with the patches Below is the link to the repo I am working off of to test this out for performance Splash provides a makefile and my struggle is getting the CMakeLists file to basically do what Splash s make file is doing Is there a way to run the splash make file from the CMakeLists Or should I try to configure something inside of SOURCES by just putting EVERY file needed by Splash into one directory Thanks for your help The vagrant box does not support vmware it only supports virtualbox If a different box is chosen then either vagrant provider can be used For instance this is the error that I get since I do not have virtualbox installed vagrant up Bringing machine IncludeOS up with vmwaredesktop provider IncludeOS Box ubuntubionic could not be found Attempting to find and install IncludeOS Box Provider vmwaredesktop vmwarefusion vmwareworkstation IncludeOS Box Version IncludeOS Loading metadata for box ubuntubionic IncludeOS URL The box youre attempting to add doesnt support the provider you requested Please find an alternate box or use an alternate provider Doublecheck your requested provider to verify you didnt simply misspell it If youre adding a box from HashiCorps Vagrant Cloud make sure the box is released Name ubuntubionic Address Requested provider vmwaredesktop vmwarefusion vmwareworkstation This makes SMP alwayson makes the RNG shared and makes the SMP worker code platform independent There are some things cropping up that gets annoying after a while Chainloader spams like crazy even though it shouldnt be saying anything at all Indeed if you build qemu without the Oh no its a bit ELF check you can boot without the chainloader at all The bridge needs to be setup before you can even run boot If you write a bogus network driver name you get a silent exit from vmrunner even with v The incantation to create a build folder is getting long mkdir p build pushd build conan install pr clang linuxx source activatesh cmake popd This PR lets you schedule normal threads automatically to free vCPUs If you create a normal thread on another CPU it will not get delegated unless you enable automatic migration there as well Automatic migration is in other words PERCPU Each CPU can have its own decision making regarding potential thread migration I am
