an update eg stuff that was valid in Webpack x but not x Would help me to learnfamiliarize but also would be nice to contribute back to what you folks are building Hello For seo I need to generate meta tags For this I have a mixin that is used globally const serverHeadMixin created const head thisoptions if head const title head if title thisssrContexttitle getStringthis title const meta head if meta thisssrContextmeta ngetMetathis meta true It takes data from head The head itself is located in the component head title title meta And here I need to turn to routeparams I managed to reach out to i n which is in the project this way script import createI n from Util i n const i n createI n export default and use it in head title i nt metamainPagetitle i njs itself export function createI n return new VueI n locale ua fallbackLocale ua messages But with a router in any way I need to get the parameters of the current route How can I do that file routerindexjs export function createRouter i n const router new Router mode history fallback false routes return router I managed to reach the router like this import createApp from app const router createApp But currentRoute mutable object appjs file import Vue from vue import App from App import createStore from store import createRouter from router import createI n from Util i n import sync from vuexroutersync import headMixin from utiltitle Vuemixin headMixin export function createApp const store createStore const i n createI n const router createRouter i n sync store router const app new Vue router store i n render h h App return app router store ERROR in srcrouterindexjs Module build failed SyntaxError Unexpected token routelevel code splitting const createListView id importviewsCreateListViewthenm mdefaultid const ItemView importviewsItemViewvue const UserView importviewsUserViewvue srcappjs srcentryclientjs ERROR in app d d a dc c js from UglifyJs Unexpected token punc app d d a dc c js I cloned this now This app listens on port while my api server listens on in my local dev environmentI am trying to implement user authentication in it using jwt when the client recieves the token from api serverthe client state updates with the token But How do I make the server side state aware that the user is logged in In general how to sync client side and server side state An ugly hack I thought of is that when the user logs in with correct credentials the api server should open a socket connection with the server and trigger a state update on server side Is it an acceptablescalable solution What are the best practices regarding this MORE DETAILS a in router I implemented the navigation guard if routerappstoregettersisLoggedIn next else nextlogin Now on login in my Login page I post an action to my api server NOT the vue server on port and store the token in client side state But when I reload the logged in dashboard page it cant find the token on server side state the function isLoggedIn above returns false and it tries to render the login page please see the code above the client side DOM thus doesnt match the server rendered page and client tries to rerender the DOM on client side In file srcentryclientjs we have beforeRouteUpdate mixin Vuemixin beforeRouteUpdate to from next const asyncData thisoptions if asyncData asyncData store thisstore route to thennextcatchnext else next And in srcviewsItemListvue we have been watching for vuerouters page watch page to from thisloadItemsto from And I thought these two code fragments are doing the same thing is it just for demonstrating or other purposes Thanks
