aspnet core or for oAuth The webforms example is a bit out of date compared to the differences in aspnet core I think it is a big disadvantage to not have the NET Client Library MicrosoftTeamFoundationServerClient included in the OAuthWebSample That makes things soo much more simple The following is the only missing code once the access token is retrieved Please update the sample VssOAuthAccessTokenCredential credentials new VssOAuthAccessTokenCredentialAccessToken VssConnection connection new VssConnectionnew Uri org credentials var client connectionGetClientProjectHttpClient var projects clientGetProjectsResult Of course you also need to add the nuget package MicrosoftTeamFoundationServerClient to your web project first Brought Step Register App in Azure up to date as the Azure Portal changed over time and the current documentation became meanwhile somewhat confusingmissleading Some examples When registering an app in Azure there is no more option native the name is Public client mobile desktop Updated application type key to correct value The ReplyUri of the registration and the application itself must be the same In the source code the replyUri is set to urnietfwgoauth oob therefore to prevent errors it makes sense to set it to the same value also when registering in Azure value before was Updated reply URL to a value that is in sync with the source code of the sample In the ManagedClientConsoleAppSampleREADMEmd it says azureDevOpsOrganizationUrl update this with the url to your Azure DevOpsTFS collection eg for Azure DevOps When I am just updating the organization URL in the mentioned format I get an unsuccessful NOT FOUND response when the HttpClient is trying to GetAsync The reason is that the HttpClientGetAsync combines the BaseAddress with the relative request URI without the Organization name when there is a slash missing behind the URL of azureDevOpsOrganizationUrl This was not possible to happen in the vsts URL before as the organization name was part of the FQDN at that time so this problem was introduced by the switch to devazurecom Also the new URI statement around the URL when setting the BaseAddress does unfortunately also not ensure that there is a trailing slash at the end of the BaseAddress afterwards Suggesting to fix README containing the trailing slash and mention that it is important Also eg update Programcs like internal const string azureDevOpsOrganizationName organization change to the URLname of your Azure DevOps organization internal static string azureDevOpsOrganizationUrl NOTE This must use HTTPS and trailing slash is required ariable used is unknown DeviceProfileSampleProgramcs and ManagedClientConsoleAppSampleProgramcs have the following code check to see if we have a succesfull respond if responseIsSuccessStatusCode ConsoleWriteLine tSuccesful REST call Which should be check to see if we have a successful respond if responseIsSuccessStatusCode ConsoleWriteLine tSuccessful REST call
