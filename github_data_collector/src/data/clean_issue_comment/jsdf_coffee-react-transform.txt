box to type anything if there is no space or if the person wants to type another thing Like here untitled Were using this compiler in our app and leaving coffeescript for the semicolonbraces hell looks like a very unappealing option Does anyone know any good forksalternatives Or maybe there are people who are willing to maintain it When Im writing a custom component I simply cannot use curly bracesbrackets to evaluate an expression The following code wont compiletransform cjsx App ReactcreateClass render propschildren CoffeeLint and CJSX itself throw the following error stdin error unexpected at line col Quick and dirty fix for This removes whitespace and newlines around an escape character when an escape character is present replacing it with a single space Im using this currently and it does the job but Im positive that there is a better way to do this I implemented this because I didnt have too much time to dig into how the parser works Id imagine itd be better to just skip over this type of escape so that the transformed output correctly compiles As per CoffeeScripts default behavior of evaluating statements I was surprised to find that the following statements within a spread operator result in the CJSX error SyntaxError Unexpected end of input unclosed CJSXEL render SomeComponent foo bar render foo bar SomeComponent foo render foo bar SomeComponent foo render foo bar SomeComponent do foo Expected output is for a structured assignment of foo foo and passing that result to the spread method I really want to use coffeescript again but I am using the modules beta dev of Meteor This means I can import pacakges and such But I am not sure if it will work with coffeescript Any idea is there a meteor package that wraps this functionality to add to the meteor builds automatically This style of object creation appears to break with coffeereacttransform Noted this while using cjsxloader whos author delegated this issue here Without the comment the following compiles and renders fine coffeescript xIndexView ReactcreateClass displayName viewsuserIndexView render return div classNameuserindexview h Say Hello to Reactjsh RCollection
