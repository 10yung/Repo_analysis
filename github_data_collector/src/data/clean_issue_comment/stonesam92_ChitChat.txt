Fixed some formatting in the README Running ChitChat on MacOS Mojave and recently encountered this issue screenshotted below where WhatsApp is asking me to update safari For reference I currently have Safari on my machine img width altScreenshot at src Whenever I switch apps with the CMDTab shortcut I see an app notification badge even when the only threads with new messages are muted I know that WhatsApp does this in at least iOS as well but it would be nice to have an option to avoid this behaviour to cut down on distractions Almost every app with tablike entities can switch between the tabs by pressing number ChitChat could also benefit from this Conversations through and even should be accessible like this ChitChat is disconnecting from WhatsApp within an hour every time I open the application and never reconnects during the instance of the application Once I close and reopen the app it works every time for a few minutes up to about an hour I havent noticed if theres a pattern to the amount of time that it stays connected This occurs with ChitChat macOS Sierra WhatsApp iOS iOS D on iPhone s This has only been tested on and occurs with the same local wifi connection for maybe the past weeks It used to work without issue Updates have been configured to install automatically on my Mac and iPhone I havent payed attention to what was installed over the last weeks What sort of troubleshooting should I do Could you perhaps implement zoom so that you can zoom out on the entire interface HI Need js file for iphone or ipad to inject Regards Alok Ive noticed that this repo and arent being updated anymore Did people want this app to have continued development I have contributed to in the past but with Whatsapp Desktop I stopped because it seemed that people werent very interested However if they are I dont mind keeping up the repo I dont think that stonesam is active so I can just create a new repo for continued development EDIT It is now being continued at the icon on the menu bar used to turn blue when i have a new whatsapp message it doesnt anymore does this option still exist or have i disabled it somehow its a really nice feature and im sad its not there anymore First of all this app is amazing and is so simple but does everything I need Im trying to convert it to an internal web chat app where I already have a web app Im trying to unhide the title bar and move the webview down so they dont overlap Ive tried moving the origin of the webview in the appDelegate to the size of the titlebar but thats not working Anyone know of a fix
