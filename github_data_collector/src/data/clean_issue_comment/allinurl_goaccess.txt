Hi my webserver is behind an apache reverse proxy Therefore my apache LogFormat looks like this LogFormat a l u t r s O Refereri UserAgenti proxy Output Jan GET faviconico HTTP Mozilla Windows NT Win x rv Gecko Firefox If i choose the Common Log Format CLF in goaccesssconf it does work but shows unknown browsers I tried a few other strings without success What would be the correct logformat in goaccessconf Im working on an error in our software right now Were seeing s because some javascript broke and isnt doing the right thing Im using that feature Time Distribution and its really great One thing Id like to see though is a graph by hour over the course of a few days Right now if I feed it say days worth of data it will graph per hour only so is for all days So it would be nice if it had graphing for Every hour for several days and not aggregating each of those hours Total requests over several days I would keep it simple and not worry about what types of requests are being graphed because people can filter the log data themselves before feeding it to goaccess For example I just used grep to filter out all the types of data I did not want to see ie only include the s I wanted The main purpose of this is that I want to see if there is a downward trend on this because there should be given that I believe its a caching problem Hello I found out that MAXIGNOREREF is set to in goaccesssrcsettingsh Im using the referer spam list from piwik with over entries but i noticed that some of them doesnt get ignored That doesnt seem right or does it Hello guys I have a problems with parsing Nginx log file using goaccess Please can you help me to create the correct logformat For example Dec GET decustomersectionloadsectionscart updatesectionidfalse HTTP Mozilla Windows NT Win
