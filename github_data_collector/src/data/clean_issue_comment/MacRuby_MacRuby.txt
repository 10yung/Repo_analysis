Add as a script to uninstall as per This PR should fix MacRubyMacRuby There is no tests attached cry I would appreciate if somebody suggest how to write tests Hi in rubydeploy the mtime comparison always fails since Xcode copies the file to the build dir without preserving mtime Ive written a perdefault disabled cache command line switch that caches the compiled rbo files SHA of the source file in rbocache which speeds up rubydeploy by a huge amount for big projects If run with cache rubydeploy will mirror the directory structure of ContentsResources in rbocache and save the compiled rbos and the SHA of the source files there on a per ARCH basis The next time rubydeploy cache gets invoked it checks to see which rbos it can just copy and which have to be compiled and then cached The mtime checking is kept too Currently theres no cache pruning you just have to remove rbocache from time to time if you adddelete many files but that can be added
