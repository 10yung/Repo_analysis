this security advisory to provide information about a vulnerability in NET Core This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability Microsoft is aware of a remote code execution vulnerability exists in NET software when the software fails to check the source markup of a file An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of NET Core In an email attack scenario an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how NET Core checks the source markup of a file Announcement The original announcement for this issue can be found at a namemitigationfactorsaMitigation factors Microsoft has not identified any mitigating factors for this vulnerability a nameaffectedsoftwareaAffected software Any NET Core application running on NET Core or a namehowaffectedaHow do I know if I am affected If you have a runtime or SDK with a version listed in affected software affectedsoftware you are exposed to the vulnerability a namehowfixaHow do I fix the issue To fix the issue please install the latest version of NET Core If you have multiple versions of NET Core installed you will need to install multiple runtimes or SDKs depending on what you have installed You can list the versions you have installed by
