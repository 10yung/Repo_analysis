Version Using persistentIndextrue causes an error when calling schemaBuilderconnect making it unusable since you cant get past that step Code to reproduce link to jsfiddle javascript Running this the first time will create the database and insert a record but there will be no data in the pk index table Running this the second time gives an error when calling connect If you change it to persistentIndexfalse it works fine var sb lfschemacreatetestdb sbcreateTableAsset addColumnid lfTypeNUMBER addColumnasset lfTypeSTRING addPrimaryKey id persistentIndextrue consolelogschema builder

console Error But the strange thing is after few edit effortsfew times of edits error message wont appear afterward Everything is working as expected But with the initial page load we always see the

query that will return a list of task Here is the query javascript var query dbselecttaskid tasknote fromitem innerJointask taskideqitemtaskid whereitemauditorideq groupByitemtaskid Here are the sample data for both table taskmaster and itemdetail javascript var taskdata id initiatorid scheduleid status description Task Example A id initiatorid scheduleid status description Task Example B var itemdata id taskid auditorid tagid assetname Item A assettypename Type A description example A id taskid auditorid tagid assetname Item B assettypename Type B description example B id taskid auditorid tagid assetname Item C assettypename Type C description example C So with the Sample data above the query should just return one row of task id and description example A but somehow it return twice The result will be correct when third data rowcommented is added which will return two task id and two descriptionexample A example B Here is the example jsfiddle Update jsyaml to fix This video by
