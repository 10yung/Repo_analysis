 Like x hours ago vs in x hours In English its can be extended with a little bit of hacking by adding the ago and in words to the beginning or the end of the sentence but it causes issues when localized to other languages In hungarian for example it would be x r ja or x r val ezel tt for past and x ra m lva for future Notice how the inflections are different for ra based on wether its in the past or the future Its also weird that the ago and in words are not included in the generated text Wrong debe ser un n mero non Correct debe ser un n mero impar Summary The problem was already mentioned in apidock in There is no valid scenario where a symbol should be separated from the amount it describes its as bad as breaking the number itself so this behavior should be finally addressed imho Steps to reproduce Use some locale where the currency symbol has a space in it like de ruby HTMLEntitiesnewencodeClassnewextendActionViewHelpersNumberHelpernumbertocurrency locale de named euro Because of the simple space the semantic is if needed is ok to separate from euro which is not true Expected behavior The space need to be considered part of the currency so it should be a nonbreaking space The expected result should be nbsp euro Work around Replacing the space by nbsp would sort it out a proven work around for over years ruby HTMLEntitiesnewencodeClassnewextendActionViewHelpersNumberHelpernumbertocurrency locale degsub u A named nbsp euro Proposal replace the format n u of the locale example of de by format n u A u Is there a way to downcase a locale URL in the browser For instance to I know this is likely offtopic We have an app which currently has languages with more being added slowly How can we allow the user to for example use Spanish as a language but have the currency of Chile Argentina or Bolivia etc and not use the Euro We already have companylocale and we would like to add companycurrency Then we could do something like numbertocurrencyprice locale companycurrency Our problem at the moment is how to select the currency with the country name in a dropdown This is how we choose between allowed languages companylocale ruby en de is fr es enGB map do locale I ntname locale locale localetos end This is how we could choose between all supported currencies companycurrency but this only shows the unit ruby I navailablelocalesmap do locale I ntnumbercurrencyformatunit locale locale localetos end How can we also show the country belonging to each currency unit I also asked this on SO there is a key that is failing csactiverecorderrorsmessagesrestrictdependentdestroyhasmany hasone should be deactiverecorderrorsmessagesrestrictdependentdestroyone other a railsi n railslocaleteyml locale file should not have legacy interpolations FailureError it shouldnot havelegacyinterpolations ArgumentError invalid byte sequence in USASCII usrlocalbundlegemsi nspec libi nspecmatchershavelegacyinterpolationsrb in block levels in top required specunittranslationspecrb in block levels in top required Finished in seconds files took seconds to load examples failure Failed examples rspec specunittranslationspecrb a railsi n railslocaleteyml locale file should not have legacy interpolations more common language
