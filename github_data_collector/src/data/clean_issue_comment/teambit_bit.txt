 Description I used to share some components between react and react native in a few apps I used Git recursive merge strategies to achieve this first I write a react component that I use then in other branch I make it to work in react native too later If I make any changes to one of the branch Ill make a merge to reflect those changes back to other branches too I need the same effect in Bit to share component in way that two components get updated by new code but be different by usage is there anything similar in Bit example git checkout b react echo export default props span stylessomestylespropschildrenspan StyledTextjs git checkout b reactnative echo export default props Text stylessomestylespropschildrenText StyledTextjs later I want some new styles to be applied git checkout react echo export default props span stylessomeNewstylespropschildrenspan StyledTextjs git merge reactnative git checkout reactnative cat StyledTextjs export default props Text stylessomeNewstylespropschildrenText The version in Bit bitdev for some components is one increment behind the main version number in the project We have recently updated a lot of components in our master project and this has bumped the version number When you run bit status in our main project you get this nothing to tag or export use bit add file to track files or directories as components Now when I go into our new project and update the npm packages to the latest and the run npm install we get issues like this alexanderkaranAlexandersMBP cchomeweb npm install npm WARN deprecated leftpad use StringprototypepadStart npm WARN deprecated corejs corejs is no longer maintained Please upgrade to corejs or at least to actual version of corejs npm ERR code ETARGET npm ERR notarget No matching

Usersalexanderkarannpmlogs T Zdebuglog alexanderkaranAlexandersMBP cchomeweb Doesnt make sense I go to cccircleprogressbar in bitdev and see the version number is but when I go back to the main

AUTHORED exported true No idea how to fix this one and development has stopped on the other two project as I can not run npm install Is it possible to bump all version numbers in the main project or force all components to export again mkdir tmpbittest cd tmpbittest bit init mkdir comp echo compindexjs echo compfilejs echo compfilespecjs bit add comp bit show comp Id comp Language javascript Main

bit Before submitting a new issue please search past issues open or closed Description I am using bit import bitenvscompilersreact compiler using npm but this will not install in my project Specifications Bit version Node version npm yarn version Platform Bit compiler include version Bit tester include version Context and additional information Following the tutorial i cannot install the react compiler using the commands stated for npm bit import bitenvscompilersreact compiler Bit build will not work either Both commands result in Command failed git config list git is not recognized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file Description Ive tagged a few components one has a dependency on a private component from a different account than the one Im exporting to bit shows an error but doesnt specify which of the components is the problematic one error unable to export components to bitfrosting because they have dependencies on components in bitsrcbilling bit does not allow setting dependencies between components in private collections managed by different owners Describe the solution youd like in addition to that error I would like the id of the problematic component so I dont have to go through all my other components to check Describe alternatives youve considered I looked at the source code and found the issue but it would be really nice if bit could just point you in the right direction Description I added component A with all its files and then added another component component B that was actually included in component A bit gives an error warning files already used by component component A could not track component component B no files to track Describe the solution youd like bit should make B into a component and replace the relevant files in A with a dependency on component B Describe alternatives youve considered what I did to resolve this is to untrack A then add B and then add A again Description I just integrated bit into my project when I build my components everything is going well and I dont get errors but when I see them on the platform I get the following error in the overview section Element type is invalid expected a string for builtin components or a classfunction for composite components but got undefined You likely forgot to export your component from the file its defined in or you might have mixed
