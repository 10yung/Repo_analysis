Previous to this commit there were no example code that uses the experimental openal bindings This example shows how to play a continuous stream of audio on an openal source by queuing unqueuing and reusing openal buffers It plays some wubs and prints some pitch and rhythm info in sync As stderr may be written while the world is frozen eg the runtime dumping the traceback of a panic the redirection of stdout and stderr to Androids logcat cannot be done in Go but in C This implementation spawns a detached thread which will wait for stdout or stderr to be readable and when so read one line at a time and write it to Androids logcat Fixes golanggo cenv could add Env Config for different arch disbitcode could disable some ios archs bitcode support
