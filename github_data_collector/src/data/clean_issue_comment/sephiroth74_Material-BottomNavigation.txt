Is this library compatible with the jetpack navigation component When I click a menu item the fragment doesnt shift it remains the same as before the swipe feature is working fine in viewpager How do I solve this I saw this guide in the wiki on how to make the FAB Menu move together with the BottomNavigation However it doesnt seem to work anymore Is there another way to achieve that Hi Is there a way to make BottomNavigation right to left the first item in menu XML sit on right of screen ive tried adding androidlayoutDirectionrtl to View itself in layout xml but didnt work at all ifheightMode throw new IllegalArgumentExceptionlayoutwidth must be equal to matchparent How should you use this in a ConstraintLayout with androidlayoutwidth dp How to hide shadow above bar appelevation dp not work Is there a way to force the BottomNavigation to use the shifting icons no persistent title with only buttons I know it automatically uses this style with buttons but with it uses nonshifting buttons Setting AlwaysShowLabelsfalse causes these buttons to appear shifted upwards as if to leave space for the invisible label Fix format for video Its possible to get the ID of a given item by index but not the other way around If we want to be able to use setSelectedIndex to switch tabs programatically and we dont want to rely on hard coded indices we need a way to look up a tab position by ID Or better yet also provide a setSelectedId convenience method
