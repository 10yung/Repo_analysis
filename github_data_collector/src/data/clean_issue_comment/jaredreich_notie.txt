Theres no callback for the moment when notiealert disappears how can I catch it When notie is presenting any variation of alert user should be able to tab through the buttonsinputs There are immense amounts of code duplication This needs to be fixed notieminjs should be the size it is right now Add callback possibility for alert notifications Hi can we add disabled in div of select Added optional overlay for alerts so desktop users can click anywhere to dismiss Could we have an option to display a close icon in the notification So the user knows how to close the notification since clicking it may not be intuitive Perhaps something like the following Ive implemented it locally using font awesome and adding the icon html to an alert call You can add the jsnextmain to packagejson this way Webpack and so on knows to use the src file there with all the goodies like module exports and so on Adding extra styling and positional control for the confirm method
