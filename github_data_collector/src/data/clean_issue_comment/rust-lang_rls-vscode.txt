I believe the cargo build is failing on one particular package and vscode is unable to show that the error belongs to a single line img width altimage src This was very confusing as I thought at first that I had misunderstood how to write TOML I believe the cause of the failed build is that Im using a particular backdated version of nightly and I cant seem to communicate this fact to rlsvscode As a result one of the crates fails I have a nostd crate that is returning this single error message The code builds fine json resource Usersrubberducksrcstm f discoverysrclibrs owner rust code E severity message cant find crate for test n ncant find crate source rustc startLineNumber startColumn endLineNumber endColumn relatedInformation startLineNumber startColumn endLineNumber endColumn message cant find crate resource Usersrubberducksrcstm f discoverysrclibrs This is the contents of the librs file that is causing the error message rust nostd pub use stm f xxhal pub mod leds I found these possibly related issues but Im doubtful theyre actually related closes When I work on waylandrs I often have issues with the extension not displaying errors warnings on the code Im working on while it clearly must have some and it seems to be due to interaction with the rest of the workspace Basically if I consider the crates waylandcommons waylandclient and waylandserver both later crates depend on the first but there is no other dependency If I make a change in waylandcommons that needs followups in the two other crates every time it is run the extension seems to only process display errors for one of the two crates at random and so half of the time not for the one Im currently working on It seems as if it stops processing the workspace as soon as it encounters a crate that errors even if there are other crates in the workspace that do not depend on it Steps to reproduce Clone Set a breakpoint on the drawregions breakpoint on line Debug on windows Compare the y variable the debugger shows always to the output of println I installed Rust with several changed options Set up CARGOHOME to devsdkcargo Set up RUSTUPHOME to devsdkrustup Didnt add CARGOHOMEbin to PATH But I cant set up this variables in rlsvscode to make Rust available only to VS Code only when I want to develop I am currently switching from githubs atom editor to vscode and one thing that I immediately noticed was that when you type there will no added automatically like it is done with and At first I suspected that this was a global setting but after a bit more testing and a post on rvscode I found out that this seems to be an issue with the language extension Open questions Should this be a separate setting for the language extension If so how do I make this a setting I never did anything with vscode extensions fixes It would be quite convenient especially with generics if vscode would automatically insert if is typed similar to what is done with and I think adding a new item to the list would be enough open close The plugin for atom does this too Steps to reproduce cargo new heavy cd heavy mkdir examples cd examples Make a lot of examples Restart VS Code Check every time you save an example file all the examples are rebuild This is making my computers CPU load at every time I press Ctrl s It would be very great if Itll rebuild only last file saved as It works on src folder
