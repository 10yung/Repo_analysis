How can I generate an ROC curve using your code I see that there is a ROC function in metricspy but not sure how to extract raw values thatll give me the curve Hi the official master program has been downloaded and I tried to evaluate the performance of SIFT feature on MATLAB When typed into the command hb retrieval sift an error threw out Evaluating retrieval for sift Error using sub ind line Out of range subscript Error in descmemdescgetdesc line sel sub ind sizeobjdata sizeobjdata idxso gni Error in descmemdescobjvarargingetdescobjvarargin line objgetdesc obj varargin getdescobj varargin

cmdscmdfunvarargin Such kind of error also occurs when making verification and matching Could anybody help me with this problem BTW I used the original codes and default settings as provided in this website Thanks Hello I have tested Hardnets pretrained model of liberty with augmentation HardNet with python implementation of HPatches I was able to reproduce results of paper but when I tested with matlab implementation of HPatches to generate graphs I wasnt able to reproduce retrieval results patch verification and matching results were correct Can you please guide what I possibly be doing incorrect Split is full I have checked Does it has something to do with distractors Hardnetlibertywithaug mAP with python implementation same as reported on paper Hardnetlibertywithaug mAP with matlab implementation Thanks in advance Hi I have an issue evaluating the descriptors using descrdir argument Ive downloaded the sift descriptors and saved in rootdatadescriptorssift And when Im in the folder of python I run the following taught by the website python hpatchevalpy descrdirdescrssift taskverification taskmatching delimiter It gives me the Usage instruction rather than executing the command all the time instead I dont know where is problem thank you Hi When I run the script runarticle with matlab It successfully run and show logs as following runarticle tasks Loading cached

If we turn off the scalerotation invariance functionalities of ORB and BRIEF these two descriptors should be the same However it shows different performance in the paper Why Hi folks I downloaded HPatches package as well as sift and orb descriptors eg sh downloadsh descr sift It turned out that for each patch per sequenceimage there exists one and only one descriptor eg for iajuntament there are patches and sift descriptors and the same for orbs How could that be possible What if my new key point detector finds no interest point no that specific patch I had run through default opencv detectors as follows import cv print cv version import matplotlibpyplot as plt matplotlib inline IMG homemiDownloadshpatchesreleaseiajuntamente png imgori cv imreadIMG cv IMREADGRAYSCALE hw imgorishape print hw for i in rangehw img imgori iwi w sift cv xfeatures dSIFTcreate kp des siftdetectAndComputeimg None print des img cv drawKeypointsimg kp None color flags pltimshowimg pltshow if i break Some detected sometimes more that one and other did not How could we run evaluation on it Any clarification is appreciated It looks like texname is not used anywhere and I guess thats the name that should be displayed in the figure Thanks for providing this huge dataset I want to download hbenchv bintargz to run the matlab code but failed Please update the website wwwrobotoxacukkarelblobsPACKAGEBIN Hi Thanks for collecting the huge dataset and providing an evaluation benchmark There seem to be some duplications of patch combinations in the definition files For example verifpossplitillum definition file contains M duplicated entries verifnegintrasplitillum definition file contains duplicated entries and verifnegintersplitillum definition file contains duplicated entries If we consider this evaluation with without duplications the resulting numbers FPR PR curve would differ Are such settings intentional If not is it possible to correct the definition files Thanks
