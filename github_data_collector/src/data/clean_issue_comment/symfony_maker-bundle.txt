Hi When i use the command makefixtures it creates files with deprecated interfaces See Doctrine Common Persistence ObjectManager must me replaced by Doctrine Persistence ObjectManager See this commit Cheers HanXHX System Ubuntu PHP Composer Symfony The problem Im trying to install makerbundle by running composer require symfonymakerbundle dev however I get a package requirements error The error message Using version for symfonymakerbundle composerjson has been updated Loading composer repositories with package information Updating dependencies including requiredev Restricting packages listed in symfonysymfony to Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages Problem Conclusion dont install symfonymakerbundle v Conclusion dont install symfonymakerbundle v Conclusion dont install symfonymakerbundle v Conclusion remove nikicphpparser v Installation request for symfonymakerbundle satisfiable by symfonymakerbundle v v v v Conclusion dont install nikicphpparser v symfonymakerbundle v requires nikicphpparser satisfiable by nikicphpparser v v v v v v v v v v v v v v Can only install one of nikicphpparser v v Can only install one of nikicphpparser v v Can only install one of nikicphpparser v v Can only install one of nikicphpparser v v Can only install one of nikicphpparser v v Can only install one of nikicphpparser v v Can only install one of nikicphpparser v v Can only install one of nikicphpparser v v Can only install one of nikicphpparser v v Can only install one of nikicphpparser v v Can only install one of nikicphpparser v v Can only install one of nikicphpparser v v Can only install one of nikicphpparser v v Can only install one of nikicphpparser v v Installation request for nikicphpparser locked at v satisfiable by nikicphpparser v Installation failed reverting composerjson to its original content Attempts to solve it I have tried to install nikicphpparser but it requires minimeannotations Ive installed minimeannotations but nikickphpparser doesnt recognize it and still complains about minimeannotations being uninstalled I havent found much useful info on the web Ive always found annoying and frustrating that running makeentity the output is Next When youre ready create a migration with makemigration instead of Next When youre ready create a migration with php binconsole makemigration As makemigration does Then Run the migration with php binconsole doctrinemigrationsmigrate Since doctrine itself recommends to use Doctrine Persistence ManagerRegistry lets not use Doctrine Common Persistence ManagerRegistry This should be an easy merge as they seem to be signature compatible I state that I am relatively new to using Symfony and the MakerBundle I cant find a way to use the makeentity command to add properties without interactivity I will be used to working with the CLI but I think it is much faster for the user if the possibility of using noninteractive commands is offered to do the same operations that are proposed interactively For example now I am forced to do these operations bash php binconsole makeentity nointeraction VictoriousKangaroo use awk command to insert first and last name proprieties in correct position with correct annotations php binconsole makeentity regenerate App Entity VictoriousKangaroo While it would be much more convenient not to have to disconnect from the terminal and be able to complete the creation of your Entities in a way similar to this bash php binconsole makeentity nointeraction VictoriousKangaroo php binconsole makeentitypropriety nointeraction name name type string length notnullable VictoriousKangaroo php binconsole makeentitypropriety nointeraction name age type integer nullable VictoriousKangaroo It seems to me that this mode is missing from the whole bundle Is it a feature already present in the roadmap or would you be interested in inserting it This bundle makes lots of string manipulations Originally we created some utils eg and a Str utility class The only problem for us is that String requires using PHP and this project requires the legacy and unmaintained PHP Can we update the PHP requirement in the next stable version For more info New in Symfony String Component blog post String component docs Migration to String component in Symfony Demo app Check in authenticator will never pass because loadUserByUsername never return nonobject variable Check in template User provider interface As alternative we can drop this check for nondoctrine users Or replace it with catch UsernameNotFoundException instead This is linked to the issue PHPStorm warns about this situation Recently updated Best regards Hi just fixing a deprecation from doctrineDoctrine Common Persistence to Doctrine Persistence
