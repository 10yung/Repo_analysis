Hi First of all thank you for this very useful tool Im a newbie so sorry if my question is dumb Id need to batch tag a large amount of files The actual list of files works great but is not ok for this purpose too many entries I have the paths in a text file is theres a way Tag could read this text files files adresses and tag the files Thanks in advance Found it helpful to have a command to invert tags Having bound it to a hotkey in Finder is a use case for me I would need to assign tags to files that contain the comma character but I cannot find a way to do that I tried escaping with but this does not work It would be nice to be able to specify tags to ignore For instance say I tag some files as archive I could then run a search as normal but that do not include files tagged as archive A sample of the command could look like this tag f Red Yellow Blue i archive This would search for all files that have been tagged Red Yellow and Blue but that do not have the archive tag Im trying to recursively add a tag all the files and folders in a path which is working perfectly except that I have added a simlink to a directory on an external readonly drive and its now giving me the error tag The operation couldn t be completed OSStatus error Could you maybe add an option to not follow links Rixstep has released a new superfast tagging app called Rixtag using proprietary xattr not the default macOS tags The xattr is comrixstepRixtag and the tags are stored in binary plist as hex data Support possible Eg as tag xattrcomrixstepRixtag option tags paths In that regard wouldnt it be easy to let users create their own xattr Eg tag xattrcomgithubjdberry a tags paths and so on Right now if you add or edit tags recursively its also applied to the directories themselves It would be great if there was a flag or option to make it so that tag will not add tags to directories It would be useful to have a way to find files with tags matching a regex As far as I understand there is no way to do it now
