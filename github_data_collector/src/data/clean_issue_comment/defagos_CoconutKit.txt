iOS support should be quite straightforward Testing the demo I still spotted a few issues UIStepper bindings do not work anymore I also found other issues not related to iOS Parallax demos are broken x Linking with CoconutKit and MAKVONotificationCenter reveals category method conflicts newly reported by Xcode Using the cursor resizing sliders make the demo crash The top and bottom browser insets are incorrect Starting with iOS and depending on viewfitcover see this article the behavior needs to be adjusted differently Check with wwwapplecom for example The bottom toolbar covers the content it does not count in the safe area layout guides Fixing these issues requires some modernization layout work to deal with the many iOS changes mostly I already have implementations bits around but they should be brought together first With iOS at least with beta UITextField bindings do not work anymore The email validation regex becomes increasingly slow as the length of the string to validate increases with no sign It must probably be replaced updated Sometimes the top layout guide might not be correctly propagated to the child view controller After spending too much time investigating this issue without real success I stumbled upon the probable cause before iOS addChildViewController must be called after the child view controller view has been added to its parent container so that layout guides are correctly propagated The issues seems to disappear with iOS and the new safe area concept It is probably not so relevant anymore to address it Using scrollRectToVisibleanimated seems to cause some problems to adjust scrollview offset with the keyboard Could this solution be suitable Fix for warnings appearing while compiling the framework on Xcode projects with Swift Starting with iOS an external keyboard might reduce the software keyboard to it associated input accessory view In this case the will hide notification is not called the will show notification is called instead This was not the case with iOS When editing a text view located within a scroll view with avoidingKeyboard YES CoconutKit therefore does not correctly update the insets when an external keyboard is connected Input is still reduced to the area occupied by the full software keyboard when it was visible Hi when I remove several viewController from StackViewController by removeViewControllerAtIndex and set animated to YESI will remove only one VC and set animated to NO I will remove correctly is this a bug when animatedthe stack was been lockedthen I can not remove next VCis this right update useful log DEBUG XcfNavigationController removeViewControllerAtIndexanimated stack after remove XcfProfileViewController x da ab XcfProfileViewController x da a XcfDishDetailViewController x dc afe DEBUG XcfNavigationController removeViewControllerAtIndexanimated navigation bar items after remove UINavigationItem x da fd UINavigationItem x db UINavigationItem x dc e a DEBUG XcfNavigationController removeViewControlleranimated will remove XcfDishDetailViewController x dc afe DEBUG HLSAnimationStep addObjectAnimationforObject No object to animated DEBUG HLSAnimationStep addObjectAnimationforObject No object to animated DEBUG HLSAnimationStep addObjectAnimationforObject No object to animated DEBUG HLSAnimationStep addObjectAnimationforObject No object to animated DEBUG HLSUserInterfaceLock lock Acquire UI lock DEBUG HLSViewController viewWillDisappear View controller XcfDishDetailViewController x dc afe view will disappear animated YES Umeng logPageView XcfDishDetailViewController seconds DEBUG HLSViewController viewWillAppear View controller XcfProfileViewController x da a view will appear animated YES DEBUG HLSViewController viewWillAppear View controller XcfProfileDishesViewController x db c view will appear animated YES DEBUG XcfNavigationController removeViewControllerAtIndexanimated stack after remove XcfProfileViewController x da ab XcfProfileViewController x da a XcfDishDetailViewController x dc afe this VC should be removedbut failed DEBUG XcfNavigationController removeViewControllerAtIndexanimated navigation bar items after remove UINavigationItem x da fd UINavigationItem x db Currently the demos have been written for iPad but CoconutKit is meant to be used with iPhone applications as well Make the demo project iPhone friendly so that CoconutKit components can be easily tested on an iPhone as well
