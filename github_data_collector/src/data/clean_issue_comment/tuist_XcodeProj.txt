 What I spotted PBXBuildPhase type is exposed publicly twice in the PBXBuildPhaseswift First swift The build phase type of the build phase public var buildPhase BuildPhase fatalErrorThis property must be overriden Second swift Returns the build phase type Returns build phase type func type BuildPhase return buildPhase I wonder if there is a reason behind that duplication Proposal We could deprecate and later remove the type from the extension Short description When creating a new project with SwiftUI checkbox Xcode sets ENABLEPREVIEWSYES It does not do so when setting storyboard as a default but I have not found any drawbacks when it is set to yes even if SwiftUI previews are not being used Solution Add ENABLEPREVIEWSYES to build settings all Linked to I am making a build file in swift to replace my Rakefile but as the subject says a newly generated xcodeproj creates schemes files I made a simply change in XCSchemeBuildableReferenceswift if let blueprintIdentifier elementattributes BlueprintIdentifier throw XCSchemeErrormissingproperty BlueprintIdentifier blueprint stringblueprintIdentifier else blueprint string it all works fine The aim was to add environmentVariables for the development Xcodes integrated git source control features dont work with XcodeProj Steps to reproduce Clone XcodeProj steps from READMEmd Git clone the repository gitgithubcomtuistxcodeprojgit Generate xcodeproj with swift package generatexcodeproj Open XcodeProjxcodeproj In Xcode View Version Editor Show Version Editor Result Could not load authors for file SourcesXcodeProjProjectXcodeProjswift Error fatal no such path SourcesXcodeProjProjectXcodeProjswift in HEAD Alternatively Step iiii from above In Xcode make a small change to some file Source Control Commit Enter Commit Message and hit CmdReturn Result The working copy XcodeProj failed to commit files error pathspec SourcesXcodeProjProjectXcodeProjswift did not match any files known to git Context The project doesnt have documentation at all That makes it hard for developers to start using the project since they have to figure out how things work themselves What Add the following documentation pages How Xcode projects are structured Adding and removing objects from a project Usage examples Context A pattern that I have seen when developers use the library is that they create new objects and forget to add them to the pbxproj As a result the write fails because those objects are not attached to any project What I think we can improve the API to codify that requirement so that developers dont need to think about that CocoaPods xcodeproj does it like that and Proposal For each of the objects that are available provide a constructor from their parent object swift let target try projectaddTargetname MyNewTarget let configurationList try targetaddConfigurationList let configurations try configurationListaddDefaults Note that the methods can throw when the object already contains a child if it only supports one or has a child that is equal to the one being added Context As suggested on this issue Swifts Codable is not the most performant option for parsing the project plist file Despite having introduced some improvements in that PR theres still space for improvement What Evaluate the available options and replace Codable with he one that provides the best performance There are companies with large projects that rely on xcodeproj for parsing and generating their projects so theyd benefit a lot from this improvement References Benchmark Marshal Context According to this task the only blocker to have support for Linux has been fixed What Make xcodeproj Linux compatible Proposal Set up the CI pipeline to run on Linux Check out and fix any other issues with the usage of Foundation APIs
