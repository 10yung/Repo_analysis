When I try to upgrade jfinal from x to version after X The following code breaks public class Demo extends JFinalConfig Override public void configConstantConstants me TODO Autogenerated method stub Override public void configRouteRoutes me TODO Autogenerated method stub Override public void configPluginPlugins me TODO Autogenerated method stub Override public void configInterceptorInterceptors me TODO Autogenerated method stub Override public void configHandlerHandlers me TODO Autogenerated method stub The code should pass but it throws an error Demojava error Demo is not abstract and does not override abstract method configEngineEngine in JFinalConfig The plugins or middlewares are important things to enrich original JFinals functionality But its difficult for a user to find the appropriate plugin for his project because theres no an official plugin list In fact there are already a lot of plugins scattered in the Internet a lot more to go I think we should maintain an official plugin list on GitHub or website just like Nutz stringarray intarray get trim Group From Model save update SELECT From FROM Group
