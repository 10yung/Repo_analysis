It seems as though no matter what keys I filter for since I loaded a redis with a custom rdb theres no way to analyze this file with your parser Im curious if you could provide a mode where its automatically skipped like rdb command protocolskiperrors Example of failed command rdb command protocol k anything customrdb devnull Traceback most recent call last File homeposix elocalbinrdb line in module sysexitmain File homeposix elocallibpython sitepackagesrdbtoolsclirdbpy line in main parserparsedumpfile File homeposix elocallibpython sitepackagesrdbtoolsparserpy line in parse selfparsefdopenfilename rb File homeposix elocallibpython sitepackagesrdbtoolsparserpy line in parsefd selfskipobjectf datatype File homeposix elocallibpython sitepackagesrdbtoolsparserpy line in skipobject selfskipmodulef File homeposix elocallibpython sitepackagesrdbtoolsparserpy line in skipmodule raise ExceptionUnknown module opcode s opcode Exception Unknown module opcode Im trying to have a trial with free licence of rdbtools v But I could not successfully add my redis instance in remote server I tried to use my local rediscli which could successfully connect my remote Redis server but rdbtools failed There shows Internal server Error but no detail error log I could find thee to the in two lines As the redismemoryforkey will call dump command of the redis For large key the dump command will block redis as its Time complexity So this command is very dangerous for production environment Time complexity O to access the key and additional ONM to serialized it where N is the number of Redis objects composing the value and M their average size For small string values the time complexity is thus O O M where M is small so simply O I didnt find the stream struct in this wiki could you add this Hi kindly please help check the parser problem It seems the problem of rdb format how can I cope with the source code redishostrdbzip Hi how can i see webbase control panel for Redisserver Please help me out I have a redis dump file which is around MB When I run rdb c json dumprdb I get a json list of my keys with no data in them for example key key The file is definitely not empty there is plenty of data in there Any ideas I am using Redis server v and rdbtools version
