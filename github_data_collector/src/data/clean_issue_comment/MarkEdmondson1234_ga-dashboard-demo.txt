Unsure of the following issues reproducibility but line of serverR file through an error when using anomalyData plot Rewriting the plot functionality using base R plot seemed to fix this but unsure whether it changes the intended visualization formatting ie anomalyData plot to plotanomalyData Running gadashboarddemo I was getting an error at line of serverR the zoo object created was expecting a DataFrame instead of a tibble See the following related StackOverflow post Though perhaps not the best solution under line of serverR I added an explicit coercion to DataFrame aggdata asdataframeaggdata Using gadashboarddemo I was getting an error in the serverR file of using an atomic object where a DataFrame was expected is invalid for atomic vector error Upon debugging I discovered removing anoms from lines and of serverR file fixes this Within the two functions renderDygraph and renderDataTable we want object anomalies to be a dataframe and not an atomic vector since later in those functions we call anomaliestimestamp and anomaliesanoms If we define anomalies anomalyData anoms it will only keep the column anoms in memory and we wont be able to retrieve timestamp within the function The AnomalyDetection package as installed directly from the Twitter GitHub repo linked within the code causes an error when plotting the result of AnomalyDetectionTs line of functionsR on the UIR side since ggplot expects POSIXct objects rather than POSIXlt The coercion happens under the hood of the AnomalyDetectionTs function To avoid this install the following fork to avoid the implicit conversion worked for me havent noticed any impact from the fork on the rest of the code devtoolsinstallgithubhrbrmstrAnomalyDetection From John Thanks for the clarification I actually saw that the month function wasnt working correctly I corrected it by modifying the lagonetotallagtwototal code Heres an example of the modified code below r lagonetotal sumdata dataperiod lagoneperiod yeardatadate yearlagtimetimeperiod narmT By the way does the nowperiod variable serve any function I cant seem to find its use Also the diffperiod variable seems to have an incomplete formula for difference Personally I prefer to use the formula for change
