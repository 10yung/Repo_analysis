receive only lockfile updates if desired Security updates receive only security updates if desired details Im trying to integrate trextileserver as backend to QGIS Desktop via the vector tiles reader Plugin available via When Connecting to trex a URL pointing to stylejson and tilesjson files is needed in the Vector Tiles Plugin While connecting to trex that plugin sends HTTP HEAD requests to those URLs in order to check if they exist Unfortunately trex answers with HTTP when doing a HEAD reqeust on those URLS see line Which turns trex unreachable from that pluign Doing a hack i patched VTR Plugin to do a classic HTTP GET and further integration looks fine then I can display vector tiles data inside QGIS Question is it possible to implement HTTP HEAD for those tilejson and stylejson Resources Step I download some data from GADM and i import it to postgis using shp pgsql sh shp pgsql s I Downloadsgadm AFGshpgadm AFG shp publicafg psql d gadm U postgiser W h So now I have a

srid units m extent minx miny maxx maxy resolutions origin TopLeft The generated cache files on the fly which are produced by moving around in the map works fine But if I use trex generate config configtoml the tiles will be shown messy and in wrong positions in OpenLayers I figured out if I change the origin from TopLeft to BottomLeft the generated tiles by trex generate command would be visualized perfectly by OpenLayers Afterwards I removed the cache files and tried with originBottomLeft to produce the cache files on the fly this time the tiles are in wrong positions It means I have to change between originTopLeft for live caching via OpenLayers and originBottomLeft for trex generate Any idea or explanation for this problem Many thanks Bumps dotenv from to details
