See and the log messages for details okapia FYI Compare First of all they are functionally different At least vcsh foo add TAB works in the former but not in the latter The latter has only one commit that isnt in the former That commit unfortunately mixes functional and nonfunctional changes but I think the important parts of it are two adding callprogram and setting ret So I suggest to cherrypick those two changes and then to remove vcsh completion from zsh upstream I use vcsh in conjunction with zsh and vcsinfo and Id like to share the following recipe zsh zstyle e vcsinfogitpostbackend hooks reply kfunctions I vigitpostbackend vi vigitpostbackendvcsh if git config get vcshvcsh devnull then hookcom branch fvcshGITDIRGITDIRtgit f ends coloring fi With this recipe after doing vcsh enter foo the vcsinfo prompt says git mastervcshfoo rather than git master This adds the locate subcommand which takes an existing file and returns the repository thats tracking the file Signedoffby martin f krafft madduckmadducknet lotusgitignored cat gitignore bak lotusgitignored vcsh listuntracked a awesomebak Arguably this should not happen since a file thats being perdirectory ignored from Git will almost never be considered a trackable file and thus it makes no sense to include it in the output of untracked files Other popular dotfiles managers have the dotfilemanager and other handy tags on their project For example It would be helpful if this project could add some of those too to make be more discoverable I have set a global ignore file It is honored by normal repos git checkignore verbose noindex nonmatching sth Usersevargitignoreglobal sth But not by vcsh vcsh shells checkignore verbose noindex nonmatching scriptszshloadfirstzsh Usersevarscriptszshloadfirstzsh I tried creating the file at gitattributesdREPONAME I also did export VCSHGITATTRIBUTESy in my zshenv But it seems this doesnt work Do I need to change sth in configvcshrepodREPONAMEgit Hi When cloning manipulating repos that have files in protected directories sudo is required However the environment must be preserved or vcsh will add configuration files into root I figure we can save someone some potential future grief by mentioning the need for sudo E in such cases Not sure what part of the docs you would want to stick that into so I havent done a PR yet Ive just taken ownership of the vcshgit pkg in the AUR It has been pointing to the debian branch so Im trying to update it to master I got the test dependencies installed but am I missing something further as Im getting these errorsfail on attempting to make install Starting package t tearenvt skipped No need to tear down previous env t setupenvt ok t initt Failed test No repos set up yet at t initt line t initt Failed test at t initt line Failed test Our new repo is there at t initt line No such file or directory at t initt line Tests were run but no plan was declared and donetesting was not seen Looks like your test exited with just after t initt Dubious test returned wstat x Failed subtests t addt Failed test Adding a file works at t addt line t addt Failed test Terse output works at t addt line Looks like you failed tests of t addt Dubious test returned wstat x Failed subtests t deletet Failed test No repos set up anymore at t deletet line Looks like you failed test of t deletet Dubious test returned wstat x Failed subtests t tearenvt ok Test Summary Report t initt Wstat Tests Failed Failed tests Nonzero exit status Parse errors No plan found in TAP output t addt Wstat Tests Failed Failed tests Nonzero exit status t deletet Wstat Tests Failed Failed test Nonzero exit status Files Tests wallclock secs usr sys cusr csys CPU Result FAIL make Makefile test Error ERROR A failure occurred in package I have a hunch the PKGBUILD was pointing to the debian branch because of the above because the test dependency package names were in the PKGBUILD but not actually a part of the depends statement Is there an easy fix or is master just broken atm and I shouldnt bother yet
