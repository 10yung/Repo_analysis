 Xcode comes with iOS Which the current release of Bluepill doesnt appear to support only up to Couldnt see anything in the recent releases For easier debugging console output does not include that information Whether the simulator cloning is an optional feature or default behavior the creating of sim templates should be done in parallel It is very important to cut down on this time since the time spent in creating sim templates is the time that is not spent spawning the simulators and running the tests cc ob This is a continuation of where we would be able to install the Certs using iotrust Any insights what xcode OR simctl commands Often we might have to do some fixes or features in Bluepill version that supports an earlier Xcode version Eg Xcode or for that matter any branch other than the master So the Azure CICD automation should be extended to PRs that are not based on the master branch Eg cc ob jmkk Any efforts to include simctl io recordVideo support for the simulators BP creates At the moment I am using the scriptfile flag to run a bash script that enables recording for every launched simulator using the BPDEVICEID passed from Bluepill However fastlane hangs if the bash command is not executed as set and forget with a trailing ampersand The command being used is xcrun simctl io BPDEVICEID recordVideo storagepathBPDEVICEIDscreenrecordmp storagepathBPDEVICEIDlogtxt This works and creates the files in the right location with a file for logging However the resulting files are corrupted because I am not able to stop the recording explicitly before BP closes and deletes them Is it possible to also get a chance to run another script before the simulator is closed by BP In the case of reusing simulators we would want a chance to cleanup whatever was done in the pretest script made possible by scriptfile The simulatorpreferencesfile flag is not honored and the preferences file is not passed on when clone sims feature is used Thanks to rahulmalik from Pinterest for reporting this on our Slack channel cc ob The clonesimulator config is deprecated and need not be passed The clone simulator feature is always ON in Bluepill going forward ob Can you please take a look Bluepill throws the following error when the test host for a framework isnt set T Z bp invalid configuration T Z UsersjenkinswsnulliOSPLATFORMSiPhoneSimulatorplatformDeveloperLibraryXcodeAgentsxctest not found T Z INFO BLUEPILL BP PID has finished with exit code The xctestrun file would have the following entries keyTestHostPathkey stringPLATFORMSiPhoneSimulatorplatformDeveloperLibraryXcodeAgentsxcteststring To rectify it you must modify the test host in your project This bug report is to have better messaging when the test host isnt set
