could be ran against each new line in the text area similar to other online tools though I still prefer this one by far of course Currently the regex is applied to the whole content of the text which makes sense but would be great to optionally match against different strings in order to make sure it works for multiple scenarios Thanks Matching failed when trying to verify if a string is of the following comma separated format languagecodeunicodelanguage eg enEnglishru with regular expression azAZ pL azAZ pL The pL letter category cannot be used for matching possibly because the unicode flag u cannot be set I changed some urls and made them relative With this change it is possible to serve your app from any subpath in a webserver I think this picture can describe the problem
