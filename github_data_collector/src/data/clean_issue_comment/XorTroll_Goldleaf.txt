 Feature description Would be very useful and improve UX if Quark try to auto reconnect when lost the connection Benefits A use case is when you are developing a homebrew So you need to send and lauch a nro file Then you close Goldleaf and on the next time you need to run it again to send a new version of your nro But is very boring to click on Ok button on Quark in order to reconnect again Would be better if it auto reconnect again Feature description Would be useful to describe the step by step to build it It is useful to avoid mistakes For example sudo dkppacman S switchcurl r SystemVolumesData Because we need to add curl as dependency git clone recursive gitgithubcomXorTrollGoldleafgit Because we need to clone submodules Also need to link to Plutonium repository saying that install its dependencies firstly Benefits Better documentation for this project Additional information Maybe there are some useful builds steps to describe here GoldLeaf freezes when trying to install NSP Bug description I ve updated Java to the th version the file Quarkjar runs perfectly for Goldleaf I moved the nro file to the Switch and it works too on SX OS v When I m trying to instal a game from the PC as source Goldleaf freezes and nothing happens I select the file from PC then click on Install and then Install on MicroSD or Internal Memory In both cases the homebrew freezes and the client on Windows seems that is doing nothing How can I fix that Your setup Console firmware CFW with version SX OS Goldleaf version Goldtree version Bug reproduction I ve tried many NSP files but with all of them the software freezes Additional information I ve already read other issues like mine and I ve tried to use other USB ports reinstall drivers and other things Unable to Add Paths on Quark Bug description After Selecting a Path there is no pop up to name it and so path is not added Select Path Button remains highlighted quark bug Your setup Console firmware CFW with version
