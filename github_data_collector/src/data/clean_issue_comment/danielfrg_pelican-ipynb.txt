I am trying to output some notebooks containing some HoloViews visuals and I finally got something working after including both requireJS and JQuery in my basehtml file While this work it messes up another graphic I have on my page I noticed in another issue you mention the requireJS But is it correct to put it in basehtml Or is there anyway to only associate that with the html generated from the notebook Where you say First enable the metacell mode globally in your config IPYNBUSEMETACELL True which config file do you refer to Thanks for a great tool I have a problem where markdown table headers disappear theyre there in the output source but seem to get assigned height Here is an example table I also made a test notebook I have the following markdown in a jupyter notebook cell statistical test null true null false significant alpha false positive rate false alarm beta power sensitivity recall hit not significant alpha specificity precision correct rejection beta false negative rate miss The header row disappears in the rendered output with default options this is on the pelicanbootstrap pelican theme with the lumen bootstrap theme img width altScreenshot at src Unless I set IPYNBFIXCSS False img width altScreenshot at src Or alternatively IPYNBSKIPCSS True img width altScreenshot at src I take this to mean that the notebook CSS is ok but the fix CSS somehow includes setting thead to zero height How do I control this behavior Inside Jupyter notebook I want to embed image files The tree for image files are like this myblog content images mobile jpg myblog content images mobile jpg I want to refer to my static image files using SITEURL argument But when I use SITEURL or any other pelicanconfpy variables inside Jupyter like this div classrow div classcol img src SITEURL imagesmobile jpgdiv div classcol img src SITEURL imagesmobile jpgdiv div and run pelican content get the following warning message WARNING Replacement Indicator SITEURL not recognized skipping replacement And the SITEURL was indeed not passed into the HTML file rendered using Jupyter Is there anyway that I can pass variables pelicanconfpy into Jupyter When I try to use pelican to generate content from a ipynb file I always get the above error The body tag wrapped around the content when generating a summary I assume for good reason also turn up in the content of the post itself where they dont belong This is the change I propose to fix it diff git amarkuppy bmarkuppy index aba f c amarkuppy bmarkuppy class IPythonNBBaseReader parser MyHTMLParserselfsettings filename if isinstancecontent sixbinarytype unicodeliterals makes format try to decode as ASCII Enforce decoding as UTF content body bodyformatcontentdecodeutf wrappedcontent body bodyformatcontentdecodeutf else Content already decoded content body bodyformatcontent parserfeedcontent wrappedcontent body bodyformatcontent parserfeedwrappedcontent parserclose content parserbody metadata summary parsersummary as title I tried but I failed I dont know what I am doing wrong I want to use jupyter notebook as a blog post and I applying Mode A option I do this inside a jupyter notebook from edit edit notebook meta data then I insert what is required the problem is the this sometimes work and sometimes does not work and I get this error messege CRITICAL TypeError object of type NoneType has no len If notebook contain the links to another notebook with Link to Math Mathipynb plugin doesnt convert it to a href MathhtmlMatha Could it be done Some nbextensions modules are very useful like pythonmarkdown that allows you to include inline Python code in Markdown cells I have added a support for nbextensions in my fork of pelicanipynb One problem though is that it uses shell command to run the conversion code Let me know if there is a better way to do this or otherwise merge my fork I have also added a feature to copy attachment images into the output directory
