We often use inline styles for things like backgroundimages This is because the image URL is often defined in a meta field Easier than generating CSS For those use cases WP Stack CDN does not convert the URLs to CDN URLs By removing the equal sign from the RegEx pattern the pattern works properly with these types of URLs This is obviously a bit less specific but its difficult for me to imagine a scenario where this breaks something Edit I pushed an additional commit that adds SVG to the valid extensions Many sites feed MailChimp or similar via the RSS feed Protocol relative URLs to images break many email clients including Gmail and Outlook To fix this I changed the main filter to php return pregreplace httpsthissitedomain implode thisextensions thiscdndomain content This could be an option or it could just be the default until relative protocol URLs are more broadly supported Hi This isnt an actual issue but I was wondering if there was any workaround to make the deployment process faster I didnt get myself much into Capistrano just yet but I will Unless one of you guys have a solution I might try to find one One solution I have in mind is that currently we pull the full repository I think so this is quite slow especially with big WordPress installations We might be able to copy a cached version and apply a diff instead Do you think that might be possible Would that be bad practice or risky Thanks Are there any plans to update this to use Capistrano x In a case where youre defining a background url or other similar CSS case with the URL defined inside of a parenthesis the regex misses these URLs Example background urlwpcontentthemespaximgiconlinkbtnpng norepeat important background url norepeat scroll center center transparent important Hi Guys I went through a situation here that made me lose a few minutes The CDN plugin do a pregreplace on the entire rendered page to replace the old urls with the new ones The problem was when I had more than one URL to be replaced on the same line The pregreplace did just one replacement the first So for example html a href src would be replaced with html a href src Note that the href attribute for the a tag was replaced but not the src for the img Thats because they are on the same line The line about creation of deploy user does not break Because of that and given its extension it is not completely visible without looking at the source code Hi this is a question more than a bug but does anyone have a cap task to run with dbsync for changing my etchosts to spoof my domains So that when Im doing local development mysitecom points to but when Im not it resolves to the production IP Thanks for any help you can offerI googled around for this but I probably wasnt phrasing it right Best regards David Ham Hey First this is not really an issue as in an issue with WPStack but mostly just a question on how to properly use it So we have a server running Plesk Panel We are hosting multiple clients on it Each client has its own domain in the vhosts directory All directories that are in the vhosts directory can be accessed by the deploy user and are owned by root However once in lets say examplecom the deploy user does not have the right to access the httpdocs folder This is normal as the httpdocs folder is owned by the Plesk FTP user for examplecom I imagine this is why step says to recursively chown the deployto path Doing so would probably cause a bunch of problems with Plesk However this could be done and we run a custom task to reset the permission after deploying But wouldnt we have to do this permissions dance every time we wanted to deploy because we reset permissions after each deploy Could we instead make the deploy user or its group namely deploy have the right to access all folders much like root Or is this a big security concern We are trying to avoid having to manage SSH keys for each FTP user Also FTP user which can have SSH access do not have the privileges to run the sudo chown command found at line of tasksrb and we dont want to give every user sudo privileges Not sure if this all makes sense Thanks
