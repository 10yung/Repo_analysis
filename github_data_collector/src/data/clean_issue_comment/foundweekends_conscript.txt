As conscriptsetupsh always executes cs as the last thing the scripts exit status will be as cs fails due to no args are passed Id like to see either cs execution be removed from the script or offer setupsh additional flag for standalone execution to skip cs invocation Reasoning automated install scripts referencing setupsh report bogus failures Its impossible to run the conscript install script on any shell other than bash and expect it to work without making manual changes to the install script When I run cs foundweekendsgiter I get after a minute or so An unexpected error occurred Please check your internet connection Exception message connection timed out apigithubcom to Internet connection is OK can access that from other tools eg curl have set proxy using JAVAOPTS eg echo JAVAOPTS DhttpproxyHostmyproxyserver DhttpproxyPort DhttpsproxyHostmyproxyserver DhttpsproxyPort plus everything else on my system seems happy proxy wise I am on centos Java Neither the jar nor the shell script make the cs available in the terminal When conscript fails to find the default master branch or the specified branch if one is specified then it incorrectly reports Repository not found on github rather than reporting that it cannot find the branch Example Type cs sbtsbt Result Repository not found on github because there is no master branch Type cs sbtsbt branch from Result Result Repository not found on github because there is no branch Type cs sbtsbt branch Result works at the time of this writing This was very confusing as a complete newbie trying to figure out what was going wrong until I realized it simply wasnt findng the branch My platform is windows powershell version is I use admin command line try to run setupps and get errors of SSL access ERRORS Server access Error javasecurityNoSuchAlgorithmException Default SSLContext not available url Server access Error javasecurityNoSuchAlgorithmException Default SSLContext not available url Server access Error javasecurityNoSuchAlgorithmException Default SSLContext not available url Server access Error javasecurityNoSuchAlgorithmException Default SSLContext not available url Server access Error javasecurityNoSuchAlgorithmException Default SSLContext not available url Server access Error javasecurityNoSuchAlgorithmException Default SSLContext not available url I think it should do some setting for SSL connection can not directly use SystemNetWebClient it should added something between those line in setupps wc NewObject SystemNetWebClient wcDownloadFileurl CSLJ My platform is windows I set CONSCRIPTHOME and PATH as the instruction My profile dirgitconfig file is This is Gits peruser configuration file user Please adapt and uncomment the following lines name thinksource email foretribegmailcom github token e dtokenfaaa Then I try to run conscript proguardjar via command line java jar conscript proguardjar I still get error An unexpected error occurred Please check your internet connection You may need to generate a github access token see Exception message TLS SSLContext not available This is actually a suggestion Just crossed my mind that the official documentation already points to conscript to achieve one of the sbt features Scripts kind of an interesting circular dependency going on here so I guess it would make sense that the two projects talk to each other about this possibility I have sbt configured to use proxy repositories as described in the Proxy Repositories doc However when I use cs only the repositories defined in the launchconfig are used Can these be overridden to follow my proxy configuration instead When running multiple scalas instances installed using conscript as described on all of the are hanging and just reporting Waiting for lock on homebrandlconscriptbootsbtbootlock to be available Locking should be optional or different instances should not interfere which each other
