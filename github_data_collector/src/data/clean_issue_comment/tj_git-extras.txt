 and will be replaced with example None According to The merge refs are created only to check the mergeability If a branch is already merged the ref will be deleted If no one visits the pull request page or uses the API to trigger the mergeability check the ref will not update Although we could manually trigger the ref rebuild via visit the pull request web page it would be better to find an alternative way Maybe we could find the branch targeted by the pull request via GitHub API and do the merge locally The version of gitextras provided by Debian is and the one provided by Ubuntu is Both are released a year ago To provide a deb package which is up to date it seems we should maintain a PPA repo by ourselves FYI the gitextras provided by Fedora is which is already the latest release Hello all st great tool use it each day since like forever nd thing the actual unfortunate issue I have the git config as in here That particular line leads you the inclusion of local git configuration that is workstation specific The point in here is that I would like to to store gitbulk configuration in such file though gitbulk does not seem to be able to pick it up Actual behavior If I do gitbulk listall and the section bulkworkspaces is defined not in gitconfig the output returns empty list of workspaces Expected behavior If I do gitbulk listall and the section bulkworkspaces is defined in any git configuration included ingitconfig the output returns all workspaces Cheers Added colored output to gitinfo can be disabled with the nocolor option new c N option which allows the user to specify the number of commits to show in the output How to get machinereadable output eg git summary line Hi I have a little script that parse git reflog to look for recently used branches Its similar to git checkout n but more userfriendly For example nao mgaitanmorochitanao git recentbranches featurePSO refactortoavoidpackagesinterdependency featurePSO includeututilsonlyindevelopmentinstallations featurePSO movemodelsrelatedtests develop developfixed master b f e d af fe b fc d aeb d masterfixed featurePSO movemodelsrelatedtests nao mgaitanmorochitanao git recentbranches Switched to branch featurePSO includeututilsonlyindevelopmentinstallations Your branch is uptodate with originfeaturePSO includeututilsonlyindevelopmentinstallations Here is my implementation in python Could it be useful in this package I could rewrite it in bash if it was needed
