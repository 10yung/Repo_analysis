The remote resources that this librarys installer pulls in seem to have been removed from the AWS bucket where they had been mirrored following the incident documented in Specifically the resources documentedpulled in by indentlabs fork of the gem and discussed in the Github Issue referenced above If anybody has these resources locally ie in your present install of the gem please share with me I have an email on my Github profile and I will mirror them and fork the gem accordingly I want to install Treat in my Rails API only app but I am unable to install treat After adding in Gemfile it succeeded in bundle install After that as mentioned in manual I started IRB to run the commands but it throws me following error homestldevrbenvversions librubygems gemsactivesupport libactivesupportdependenciesrb in require cannot load such file zipzip LoadError from homestldevrbenvversions librubygems gemsactivesupport libactivesupportdependenciesrb in block in require from homestldevrbenvversions librubygems gemsactivesupport libactivesupportdependenciesrb in loaddependency I am using Roo gem in the project which also internally uses zip Is the version used conflicting with treat Any help will really be appreciated Hi Im running Fedora and Im trying to use treat The gem itself was installed seamlessly and I then wanted to install the French package gem install treat with gem A first error I had was about stanfordcorenlp which wasnt buildable because JAVAHOME wasnt set A simple export JAVAHOMEusrlibjvmjava openjdk resolved the problem However I meet a more important problem with the download of models for the Punkt segmenter for the French language Here is a sample of what I did and its result ruby version ruby p revision x linux irb version irb irb

What I observed Thanks for installing Treat To complete the installation run require treat in an IRB terminal followed by TreatCoreInstallerinstall But require treat did not work for me on OS X El Capitan It should be require treat with the quotation marks The birch dependency does not build on ruby I worked around this referencing this fork in my Gemfile Installing treat via Bundler and attempting to run TreatCoreInstallerinstall will nuke existing installs of nokogiri before attempting to install it Treats install attempt will fail and many of the other dependencies will fail The gem does not seem to play well with existing apps in this case Rails that use bundler for managing gems Even if I had been able to successfully install the gems above the installer later attempts to pull down assets from an inaccessible server and I respect the effort the maintainers have put into this project but my searches suggested this was the leading NLP gem for Ruby and I just spent a considerable time just trying to get it installed without much success Putting this here as a warning to others Treatinstall fails with exception TreatException Couldnt download wwwlouismulliecomtreatpunktenglishyaml response code was not OK but was Hi all The server that holds the files necessary for the core installer is currently down There is a mirror for most of the files at s amazonawscomstaticpublicassets but Ive had no luck finding any of the Reuters models anywhere So I guess there are two main issues here louismulliecom is down There doesnt seem to be a clear place to download the Reuters models If anyone could remedy either of these issue or has a solution to the second one please help Thanks I tried to install english pack TreatCoreInstallerinstall english failed with errors below Downloading models for the Punkt segmenter for the English language RuntimeError Couldnt download Max number of attempts reached Error Operation timed out connect for wwwlouismulliecom port Does anyone has the same issue It seems the language package host is down now anyone can help on this please Is there anyway for manual installation of those language packages Im just running the code in the quick tour at the bottom for classification The object clearly contains the method d sentences methods time nametag tag category tokenize parse type type methodmissing invalidcall language similarity distance unserialize serialize visualize classify so yeah Edit In addition the first time i run the code i get LoadError cannot load such file graphr its only after subsequent times that i try to run the classification code that i get the first error Edit I tried using the most up to date commit instead of the rubygem and i get other kinds of errors when running the whole code so that didnt help
