Describe the solution youd like Id like to include the possibility to suggest changes when an issue is reported Additional context Im aware some IDEs AS or IntelliJ will use those to show a prompt option and fix the issue with a single click Itd be pretty neat to include a way to describe a suggested change to issues Lets start with a mapping from the official API to ours and see if we can simplify it somehow afterwards Retrofit endpoint definition is really easy and that is why it is so commonly used java GETgroupidusers CallListUser groupListPathid int groupId However when declaring the URL within the annotation you can convert a relative URL into an absolute one just by adding a trailing slash This small detail leads to unconscious errors and unless you have already suffered it takes some time to notice Although there might be some endpoints that might differ all URL should follow the same format so mixing absolute and relative URLs would be a Lin warning Add support to create rules matching XML files Ideally we should be able to combine them with regular code rules so that we can make new detectors such as make sure the activity and its layout are named with the same words but different style DashboardActivitydashboardactivity In order to do those rules we are going to need though All intents keys that are used in putExtra methods should be have at least one use inside a getX method Pretty much for the project itself Something like two views having the same constraint applayoutconstraintStarttoStartOfidtransactionTypeIconView is a smell because you can make the second view attached to the first one and leave a single constraint creating a layout that is more resilient to changes usually there will be only one point of change for multiple view hierarchies People often call views like their ids There might be cases where this doesnt apply frameworks or even anko but anyways RecyclerView properties must be initialized with an Adapter and a LayoutManager vectorDrawablesuseSupportLibrary true if minSdkVersion Use appsrcCompat in ImageView
