Muffet complains id mozTocId not found when it sees my site link to Yet the link works jumping to the correct section of the page It appears that muffet might not yet know about link targets created with a hrefname Adding that knowledge would help reduce its noise when run against links whose sites use them Thanks Im enjoying the performance of this tool But to improve user experience of the web and lower server costs I like linking directly to the current URL for a page instead of linking to an old URL that is simply a redirect Could an option be added that would report all URLs leading to redirects as broken instead of valid I tried l to turn redirectionfollowing off but muffet still seems to follow at least a single initial redirection Hello Would it be possible to implement parameter which will disableenable colors in muffet Something like C color auto always never Use color default auto It will help on some dumb terminals to force color or just disable it completely Hi Yota just a question Is it possible to limit the check to a given Tag like img In my special case I just want to check some special links to images on a sigle URL Something like include page coverbigjpg Joerg I just tried muffet timeout The result is lines of output indicating that a great many pages experienced timeout errors Any given page is shown a great many times in the output which seems to indicate it is being processed multiple times I would expect any given link to be visited only once during a given scan When I use the v option The output grows to at least lines and this time both page that time out and pages that dont time out appear multiple times in the output So the first problem is the fact the same pages seem to be visited multiple times The second problem are these timeouts I gave it second timeout intervals and I dont believe that our CDN is unable to deliver the desired content in seconds for so many pages When accessing the links from a browser they appear instantaneously I change my commandline to muffet c timeout This eliminated all the timeout errors So the problem is on my side and not on the CDN Im running this on a Mac perhaps it has some limits to the number of opened sockets or something similar which is being interpreted as timeouts by the link checker So it might be good to dynamically discover the problem and tune down the concurrency accordingly When producing a web site from a static site generator like Hugo itd be highly desirable to be able to verify the links in a statically generated site on disk So basically Instead of specifying a URL to fetch from let me specify a file system directory Iterate through all the HTML files and analyze them Provide a mappings layer to map the public location of the web site to the directory So basically make it so gets translated to mysitebar I could then check the sites link before publishing I currently use htmlproofer for this task and it is awfully slow and it requires Ruby Muffet seems like a much superior solution Thanks As the title states would it be possible to get the resultset as JSON Not sure if its platform specific or not but when were running a scan for for fun as mentioned in just noticed muffetexe using Gb of memory and kept going Current version doesnt work behind proxy
