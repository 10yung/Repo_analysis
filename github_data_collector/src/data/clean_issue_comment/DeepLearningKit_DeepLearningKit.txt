Just starting and hence not head first too much But it may be the new Swift break the whole thing I covert it but there is lot of changes and accept them does not work I see in the code that MetalTensorDimensionsn weightshape channels weightshape width weightshape height weightshape Shouldnt the width to be the last dimension since caffe uses a rowmajor format It is fine when the image is squared but not the general case Dear Thanks for sharing your code Im running ios demo app on iPhone and getting ms Is it ok I saw your video and you got ms Hi I have create a library project to contain the common code Open the DeepLearningKitxcworkspace file and the project structure is DeepLearningKit contain all the library code and all targets with respective unit testsiOS OSX and tvOS Examples contain the example projects iOS OSX and tvOS Hi Im super stoked to see DeepLearningKit It is a great starting point for neural nets using Metal and swift I had this idea since Apple revealed Metal the first time and it is great to see that someone has started to work on it For me personally as I start to experimenting with DeepLearningKit and thinking of integrating it into real apps the first thing that comes to mind is Would be great if DeepLearningKit was a library easy to drop into any project A library with unit tests benchmarking and other nice metrics CI support that supports the collaboration and fast evolutiondevelopment I dont know if someone is already doing something familiar but my plans are Turn DeepLearningKit in a library project Add unit testing Setup travis for CI build and testing Publish in CocoaPods and Carthage Change the example code to use the library instead of the common files directly Cheers Rafael Hi I am trying to convert trained caffemodel of size MB to JSON for deeplearning kit using caffemodel jsonpy surprisingly the size of the JSON output file is x in my case it comes to MB I feel accommodating that big file on iOS app will not be feasible option Could you please guide me on how to procceed with this Is there a way to reduce the file size by configuring py script Thanks Is Metal performing better than OpenCL and OpenGL ES when doing neural network computation Hello I am a newbie in iOS and Deep learning I went through the basics of Deep learning and Neural networks The documentation doesnt say how to use this library I have a model with me which was written using Caffe Framework How can I integrate it with DeepLearningKit Any detailed documentation available online PS I ran the DeepLearningiOSDemo app which is working perfectly on my iPhone Any help would be appreciated Thank you Dear author I have some question with metal programming about thread number and thread group number setting I change the thredsPerGroup from to and change the threadGroups from to number where number is vectorcount But I didnt see any change or improve at processing time I wonder know did i do the right setting thanks
