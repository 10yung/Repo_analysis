in my code this is my docsPath def docsPath projectdocsapi when i try to use def docsPath projectdocsapi swagger cannot found the json what im doing wrong Currently it is not possible to easily extend service and builder classes with custom functionality For instance I have a need to provide extra ApiListings created directly or from a different source model This little adjustment will make this possible with minimum effort Created with GitHub Corrected URLs Was Now FWIW Here is a version based on rleibmans PR that provides initial swagger support swaggercore swagger spec based on spray not akkahttp I have configured swagger core which produces swagger definition files I want to remove the definitions part from the swagger specification Here is the swaggerjson file swagger info paths definitions type object Im pleased if I would hear or discuss how sprayswagger would supportmigrate to swaggercore I understand swaggercore did make many changes eg package structures and more flexible module structures which separates each responsibilities clearly etc And moreover swaggercore ships many enhancementsbetter generics support auto subtypes generation etc It also seems that scala support is now developing in swaggerscalamodule This was my first pass at getting everything to work with akkahttp instead of sprayio I have not even tested it in my own app but it should be very close as all the sprayswagger tests work I didnt want to rename the project but it would definitely be a consideration On the second pass through it the second set of checkins I moved the whole thing to use the latest version of swagger Enjoy Roberto Leibman PS I added sbteclipse to the plugins because I use it but feel free to remove it if you dont Hi there Spray is moving into maintenance mode Will sprayswagger support AkkaHTTP going forward Kind regards Jacobus Im aware of this is automatically translated as a setter and is is trimmed What if I really need a property start with is Would you consider releasing a version against shapeless similar to iospray sprayroutingshapeless
