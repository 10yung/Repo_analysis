Fix the KEYHOME scan code Currently incorrect Reference list of scancodes When I ran make qemu I got something like this which no qemu in usrlocalsbinusrlocalbin which no qemusystemi in usrlocalsbinusrlocalbin The error messages of the which qemu command should not be printed According to the GNU Make documentation Recipe Syntax Any line in the makefile that begins with a tab and appears in a rule context that is after a rule has been started until another rule or variable definition will be considered part of a recipe for that rule A comment in a recipe is not a make comment it will be passed to the shell asis Whether the shell treats it as a comment or not depends on your shell So I think we should change the shell comments in Makefile to make comments According to Intel and IA Architectures Software Developer s Manual Volumn Chapter Section The base address of the GDT should be aligned on an eightbyte boundary to yield the best processor performance Should we change p align to p align A few fixes for xv These are mostly infrastructure changes to paper over differences between environments but also fixing an assertion failure in mkfs and a couple of small things in the kernel itself Please note that about years ago someone created a git tag called master presumably this was an accident This causes ambiguity when performing eg a rebase git checkout master will check out the master branch as expected but git rebase master or even originmaster will rebase against the tag which is most definitely not desired The master tag should probably be deleted though I dont know how to do that using a github pull request a repository owner can do it however Use of O produces strange results when singlestepping with gdb Use O gives more predictable results Passing current offset into file is needed for drivers to handle random access devices such as devkmem This can be used in a lab assuming students have implemented the lseek syscall first A simple modification which could have saved one hour of my debugging time Since the constant is typically the size of a page use a named constant in order to make clear that this is not the case here This respect the original code from Kernighan and Ritchie The C programming Language nd ed Section page
