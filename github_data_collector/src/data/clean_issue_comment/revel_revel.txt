The command revel X qissmappVersion package a qissm results in an error that says that the command tried to import a package called qissmappVersion Do i have to format my command differently To my knowledge i did what is referenced in your manual at Can someone help me out The first issue that I ran into trying to copy the Booking example in order to use go test for full coverage When I was trying to use the Get method for the testing suite it would instantly give me a revel panicgo Recovered error in startup errorruntime error invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference panic runtime error invalid memory address or nil pointer dereference recovered panic Fatal error in startup signal xc code x addr x pc x After a few hours of debugging I finally realized that this was actually the correct response for the test because it was actually the Get method was appending the wrong URI causing a panic into a test failure What I had to do was actually use GetCustom and used this instead import testing githubcomrevelmodulesserverenginegohttptesttestsuite func TestForGETRequestst testingT suite testsuiteNewTestSuitet url suiteHost somePath suiteGetCustomurl However the Get method works normally using the normal test format from the main page tutorial but I think its better to use this way to get test coverage I was wondering why this was an issue and if anyone ran into this issue too I hope it helps Hi guys About the revel package command Revel builds the distribution in the tmp folder You need to delete the build folder from tmp after creating the archive Because as standard for Linux tmp it is a tmpfs file system located in memory At the moment if you build the package several times then there will be out of memory Fix it pls asap Hi guys Im having a problem

Revel is great I just spend a good chunk of time trying to figure out what was wrong in one of my deployed revel apps I discovered that if your controller does return cRenderErrorerr it doesnt get logged The default html contains This exception has been logged so i found this surprising that errors arent logged by default Would you please consider adding a call to eg cLogErrorerrError to the top of RenderError I believe itd follow the principle of least surprise to do so Have a great week all
