I would like to have access to the cell that contains a row I wanted to create an extension similar to this one but stackView is private extension AloeStackView func cellwith row UIView StackViewCell return stackViewarrangedSubviewsfirstwhere arrangedSubview in guard let cell arrangedSubview as StackViewCell cellcontentView row else return false return true as StackViewCell I want this access because I want to change second cells topLeft and topRight corner radius Is there a way to do what I mentioned without making stackView public If no would it be possible to make it public Thank you I want to know when each cell is visibleinvisible like UITableViewDelegate What do you think I think paging would make this library work quite nicely for creating App Storelike headers and scroll views see purposes for which UICollectionView is still used On iOS the view thats displayed within a popover now extends to include the popover arrow As a result additional safeAreaInsets are applied to include the arrow When presenting an AloeStackView in a popover with the arrow pointing left or right this currently isnt being taken into account As a result the cell insets content and separator are too close to the edges Ive tracked this down to insetsLayoutMarginsFromSafeArea false being partially the culprit as well as the separator leadingtrailing constraints not taking the safe area into account I havent seen any visual issues in the sample app or my own projects with insetsLayoutMarginsFromSafeArea enabled so Im not sure if there is a specific reason for this being disabled in the Airbnb app When I test this out with the default value set true everything works as expected tested on iOS and Ive included a screenshot of the issue on iOS As you can see the content is too close to the left side of the popover With insetsLayoutMarginsFromSafeArea enabled and the separators taking the safe area into account everything looks as expected tested on iOS and Ignore the switch cell extending off the right hand side Thats not an issue with the stack view just some internal constraints in one of the sample cells hello I need a callback for animation when I use it by my case but It was not implemented so I made a request like this I hope to be approved Im add a sticky feature to the AloeStackView What do you think While using debug view hierarchy it is showing Layout Issues Scrollable content size is ambiguous for AloeStackViewAloeStackView This pull request adds the ability to AloeStackView to adapt its insets to the superviews layout margins Motivations Avoid to explicitly set the default margin when we want to inherit from the superview margins Automatic support for universal apps iPhone and iPad can have different layout margins An example ViewController has been added to showcase this The screenshot below comes from that VC The default insets are set to The existing margin is the one that the superview defines Most of the lines in this PR are related to the example The actual trick is done by overriding the preservesSuperviewLayoutMargins property of AloeStackViewUIScrollView img src width
