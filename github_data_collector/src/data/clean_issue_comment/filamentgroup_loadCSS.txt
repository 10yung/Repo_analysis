the Security Alerts page details The following line causes an error in eg Firefox when a CSP header banning inline script is in operation Content Security Policy The pages settings blocked the loading of a resource at inline scriptsrc Now Im not sure if this is a bug in Firefox or not should it throw a CSP violation when an attribute is only being set to null but I wondered if removeAttribute could be used instead which does not cause a violation Not sure if that has any issues I couldnt see anything in the repo as to why setAttribute was used Browser Firefox Behavior CSS not loading As specified in the spec dom elements are accessible in the window object by their id If there is a element or element collection with the id global the loadCSS script assumes it as the window object this This leads to a error JS error ReferenceError loadCSS is not defined in cssrelpreloadjs Small tescode here html link relpreload href asstyle div idglobalGlobal Elementdiv script src Hello i dont know npm and never used it so you can understand my ignorance in this field What i guess is if this plugin can work as standalone plugin or only after install it via npm I used your guide with preload noscript and cssrelpreloadjs inlined directly in my html document but it still doesnt work Infact in DevTools Coverage i see the same css used and unused and also in Audits it still says to remove unused css So my question and dubt is if i need to install it via npm as said never used Thanks loadCSS is using invlid media attribute values and relies on the fact that browsers currently load them But loading those resources doesnt make much sense so wed love Chrome to stop doing that However thatd create compat concerns with libraries that are relying on that behavior If loadCSS could stop being one of those libraries thatd be awesome I was looking over the Chrome fetch priorities documentation and saw this Preload using as or fetch using type use the priority of the type they are requesting eg preload asstylesheet will use Highest priority With no as they will behave like an XHR Weve had some folks note that asstyle fetches at a higher priority than theyd prefer I wonder if the option of omitting as and identifying the link for polyfill in a different way would be a good option I noticed that there are checks to stop doing polyfill if support function returns true Yes on chrome this returns true but chrome doesnt automatically turn preload stylesheet into loading and since reactjs and nextjs rejected attributes injection such as onload only polyfill can do this therefore I suggest to create another version for those who cant have onload attribute inserted in SSR or whatever reasons another way to loadcss async that way All I did is remove the support checks in poly and the main execution Hi Ive been optimizing my portfolio site and am confused about some behavior Im seeing with loadCSS See the following link Ive been organizing my information as follows Critical CSS inline styleafterbeforeboxsizingborderbox htmlfontsize etcstyle Preload link to full CSS file link relpreload hrefcsscombined css asstyle onloadthisonloadnullthisrelstylesheet Backup link to full CSS file noscriptlink relstylesheet hrefcsscombined cssnoscript Inline PolyFill script scriptfunctiontuse stricttloadCSStloadCSSfunction script head Im confused because Im seeing variability in the results I think the CSS is being deferred as desired but I see the dreaded FOUC sometimes Its been a little hard for me to debug because it only seems to be happening at nonthrottled speeds I observe the behavior during normal operation and when I use Firefoxs Inspect Element Network with Disable cache and No throttling When I try to debug by seeing where exactly in the loading waterfall that the FOUC kicked off by throttling it wont duplicate Any ideas Milestones and can be closed right
