bounding box for generated SVGfiles If I select a JPEG that is x pixels in dimensions and use the following code primitive i mvpjpg o outputsvg n m s the background rectangle gets the correct dimensions but the bounding box for the generated SVG becomes x pixels This happens because the polygons poke out from the original bounding box of the image primitivesvg Is there a way to make primitive generate an SVG which respects the original bounding box and doesnt have the polygons poke out of the image This project is awesome I have a question on Static Animation What parameters should I use to get static animation result Thank you Hi Im Yevgeny Pats Founder of Fuzzit Continuous fuzzing as a service platform We have a free plan for OSS and I would be happy to contribute a PR if thats interesting The PR will include the following gofuzz fuzzers This is generic step notconnected to fuzzit Continuous Fuzzing of master branch which will generate new corpus and look for new crashes Regression on every PR that will run the fuzzers through all the generated corpus and fixed crashes from previous step This will prevent new or old bugs from crippling into master You can see our basic example here and you can see an example of in the wild integration here Let me know if this is something worth working on Cheers Yevgeny Hi Michael Ive come across primitive and I like it I do a lot of image processing and I sometimes like to artify my images I normally use GIMP for this with the oilify and cartoon filters and I think primitive is also really neat in this sense Now Id also like to consider adding support for snaps which you probably know are crossdistro Linux software packages supported on LTS and nonLTS Ubuntu as well as many others distributions Making a snap of primitive will enable you to feature your app in the Snap Store snapcraftiostore and reach a large audience of Linux users There are also automatic updates so thats quite handy if you want to add a new image processing algorithm and push it out there Heres the sequence of technicals bits needed to build snaps locally you can also use a CI system or our free build system buildsnapcraftio Install snapcraft a commandline to build snaps I used Ubuntu LTS as the build system snap install snapcraft classic beta git clone cd primitive git checkout addsnapcraft snapcraft The last command creates a primitiveversionsnap file something like primitive amd snap This snap can be installed and tested locally with snap install primitive amd snap dangerous The dangerous flag is necessary because the snap hasn t yet gone through the snap store review process and is not digitally signed The primitive command can be executed eg snap run primitive input image output image Everything remains the same from the application behavior Then you will need to complete a couple more steps to get the snap actually published in the store Register a developer account in the snap store Register the primitive name in the store snapcraft login snapcraft register Upload a built snap to the store The store supports multiple risk levels as channels Typically the edge channel is used to host the latest build from git master Stable is for releases that have been thoroughly tested and are considered stable for production You can also use beta and candidate channels snapcraft push primitive amd snap release edge Test installing on a clean machine snap install primitive edge After you have completed your testing and youre happy you can push a stable release to the stable channel update the store page and promote the application online We can help there and wed be happy to feature your application in our store Thanks How to define shapes by user is there any tools thanks Hi first of all congrats to your work I created an electron program that runs on ubuntu and windows Would be could if you could add a link to it on this github project or your homepage primitivelol Heres the link to my project Sincerely Cielito Lindo Productions Itd be better for lay people in computers just like only a binary installer to make all the tecnical stuff Because this app is so interesting even with the lay people in computing Would you be willing to share the code used to rotate shapes towards a fixed point in the example listed in readme Im particularly interested in using shapes triangles all with the same orientation Thanks great work
