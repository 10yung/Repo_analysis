Currently the Visual Studio Solution File guetzlisln and the project files guetzlivcxproj and guetzlistaticvcxproj are configured for Visual Studio It would be nice if those could be recompiled for Visual Studio which increases compatibility and performance Update Linux environment from Ubuntu to LTS Update macOS environment from macOS with Xcode to macOS with Xcode Update Bazel from to I have written a guetzli wrapper which works just fine Because guetzli is so slow it would make sense if it could indicate progress So what I suggest is that you create an empty progress function something like this void Progressint percentage your callback goes here That would work for me I could send a window message to my wrapper which would use a progress bar I admit I haven t looked at the code since I use an older version of Visual Studio If guetzli fails for some reason it always returns I would much rather see that different values were used Like this can t find file no output file too many arguments And so on Very simple change when running npm install I get nodemodules guetzli vendor already exists I do see that in installjs there is a line cmdmkdir p bindest shouldnt there be a conditional that confirms whether the folder already exists prior to attempting to create it Is it ok to install Vistual Studio Building guetzli release Creating binRelease mkdir p binRelease dctdoublecc c O pipe fstackprotector fnostrictaliasing MMD MP I Ithirdpar tybutteraugli stdc pkgconfig cflags libpng o objReleasedctdoub leo MF objReleasedctdoubled c guetzlidctdoublecc butterauglicomparatorcc debugprintcc c O pipe fstackprotector fnostrictaliasing MMD MP I Ithirdpar tybutteraugli stdc pkgconfig cflags libpng o objReleasedebugpr into MF objReleasedebugprintd c guetzlidebugprintcc c O pipe fstackprotector fnostrictaliasing MMD MP I Ithirdpar tybutteraugli stdc pkgconfig cflags libpng o objReleasebutterau glicomparatoro MF objReleasebutterauglicomparatord c guetzlibuttera uglicomparatorcc Creating objRelease error unable to open output file objReleasedebugprinto No such file or directory error generated gmake guetzlimake objReleasedebugprinto Error Original FreeBSD bug report Dear All I am trying to understand processorcc specially the function bool ProcessorProcessJpegData I see an if statement to check if the input has cbcr colorspace HasYCbCrColorSpace And before the function try to optimize the quantization table I found the following code JPEGData jpg jpgin RemoveOriginalQuantization jpg qin OutputImage imgjpgwidth jpgheight imgCopyFromJpegDatajpg comparatorCompareimg MaybeOutputencodedjpg My question is if the above code neccessary if my input is always have ycbcr non grayscale and always yuv Because I also try to optimize the code for our own usage Thanks Sunny Hi everybody since at the end of year guetzli is still a incredible good tool to compress images I decided to compile windows binaries I use Win Visual Studio followed the steps closely But no matter what I do I can not point the project to use C vcpkg packages as additional lib since I always get the missing pngh error When I copy this file to guetzli dir I get this error instead LNK unresolved external symbol pngcreatereadstruct referenced in function bool cdecl anonymous namespaceReadPNGclass stdbasicstringcharstruct stdchartraitscharclass stdallocatorchar const int int class stdvectorunsigned charclass stdallocatorunsigned char ReadPNGA x b a cb YANAEBVbasicstringDUchartraitsDstdVallocatorD stdPEAH PEAVvectorEVallocatorEstd Z guetzli C guetzli guetzliobj Can somebody help me Some images show visible gradient banding blocking artifacts even after cb e a Heres the crop to illustrate the issue guetzlioriginal From left to right Guetzli q Original This issue is related to
