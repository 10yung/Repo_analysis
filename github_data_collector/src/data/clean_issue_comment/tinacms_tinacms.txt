contributor for question ideas This was requested by ncphillips in this comment Summary The WYSIWYG editor should have a button in its toolbar to toggle between editing the raw content and editing in WYSIWYM mode Motivation There are still some kinks with the WYSIWYG and we should track them down and fix them but in the meantime having a raw mode will allow editors to fix formatting gone awry from the CMS instead of having to open a text editor Please fill out each section below otherwise your issue will be closed Before opening a new issue please search existing issues Summary Support TinaCMS usage with Docusaurus Basic example Supporting the most basic Docusaurus site bash npx docusaurusinitnext init mywebsite classic add Tina Motivation Docusaurus is growing in popularity as a solution for docs It would be wonderful to support it as well PS I would be interested in contributing to help make this happen Summary some languages like Persian Arabic and Hebrew are RTL it should be possible to show RTL version based website or user language Summary currently its not possible to change Save and Reset button text this can be useful for translating Motivation I need this to change Save button text based my website language Description I tried out the RemarkCreatorPlugin and followed the steps from this blog post I have substitute pages for missing languages and thought they are the perfect context to add a plugin that provides a translation for the missing language Steps to reproduce I really dont know It will probably work fine in demos and starters The file path does exists and is relative to repo root I tried out other paths too none worked I copied the class into my project and stepped through it with Chrome debugger and it definitely happens in onChange which is weird since it is called all time when editing Code I wrote looks like this Maybe there is some gotcha I didnt realize typescript const currentPageId currentLocaleCode languageData useLocalization const createTranslationPlugin new RemarkCreatorPlugin label Translate Page filename frontendcontentpagescurrentPageIdcurrentLocaleCodemd body fields fieldscontent frontmatter fields title fieldstitle description fieldsdescription localeCode currentLocaleCode pageID currentPageId fields name title label Title description Title of the page in languageDatanameLocalized tsignore required true component text name description label Description component textarea description Description for the page in languageDatanameLocalized name content label Markdown Content component markdown description Actual content of the page in languageDatanameLocalized usePlugincreateTranslationPlugin Expected result A new file with the data entered in the create form should be created at the specified path Actual result No file is created onSubmit call fails silently After clicking the create button Tina stops working Changes in the side bar are no longer written to the file system and the development server has to be restarted that Tina works again creatorpluginfail Environment Tinacms Package Versions tinacmsapigit tinacmscore tinacmsfields tinacmscore tinacmsicons tinacmsstyles

menu and it disappears somewhere at the top Steps to reproduce Try to use liveRemarkForm on a page with enough content that the editor and the outer container become scrollable When in editing mode scroll down and then scroll up to the top see in GIF below This might also be a problem specifically related to Bulma Expected result The editing bar should stay with the editor Workaround with

Tools Tool Version browser Firefox Developer Edition v b os Manjaro Juhraya yarn v node v npm v Aditional Information URL to the project repository The TinaCMS is used in the home page srcpagesindextsx The content that Im trying to edit is inside this file srccontentpresentationpresentationmd Note use the tinacms branch Error Screenshot Error Message Error TypeError prevDeps is undefined This PR is trying to fix some dependency issues that come up The various gatsby plugins are currently depending directly on tinacms which can break your build This PR makes tinacms a peerDep of all each the plugins Similarly the subplugins now have gatsbyplugintinacms as a peerDep rather then a dep Breaking This would require a change to docs describe how to get started with TinaCMS yarn add gatsbyplugintinacms styledcomponents will now need to be yarn add tinacms gatsbyplugintinacms styledcomponents We should make sure to update any effected blog posts and notify anyone else who wrote a blog post
