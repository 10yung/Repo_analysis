 facerecognition version Python version Operating System Description This is more of a question about the face recognition encoding Is there parity between how this works and the Mat representation that OpenCV creates I have a deep learning model that is trained on images that are represented with the OpenCV Mat encoding but I want to be able to use the face recognition API to get the face encodings and funnel it to my model Does anyone have any experience doing something like this What I Did Paste the commands you ran and the output If there was a crash please include the traceback here facerecognition version Python version Operating System windows This is not regarding issue Am new to facerecognition I capture videos using mobile It has precision like x WITH FPS etc This is streamed via laptop camera x with FPS There seems to be problem that the streamed video is out of bounds Is it possible to downsize the video and its speed before streaming or should i set the mobile settings as per laptop camera record And is it required or can i use it just like that I face more problem that although i have provided tolerance filter for CNN detection as it is identifying false positives because it is selecting distance in numpy array I would like to know how to find the path from which it is taking the underlying python api Pls help me Is there anyway to make it detect peoples faces in real time by using an IP Camera ok can anyone here tell me how to make it save the names of the people it detects on a webcam i mean if it sees me is there anyway to make it save it into a file facerecognition Python version Operating System Ubuntu Description Have been working with mysql databases and facerecognition module for a while now but since my last workspace change I cant even run my regularly sign up script Ran it as a dbg to try to fix my issue But received this output What I Did python dbg cadastropy Output File cadastropy line in module import facerecognition importa o m dulo facerecognition File homescalocallibpython sitepackagesfacerecognitioninitpy line in module from api import loadimagefile facelocations batchfacelocations facelandmarks faceencodings comparefaces facedistance File homescalocallibpython sitepackagesfacerecognitionapipy line in module from PIL import Image File usrlocallibpython distpackagesPILImagepy line in module from import imaging as core ImportError cannot import name imaging Error in sysexcepthook Traceback most recent call last File usrlibpython distpackagesapportpythonhookpy line in apportexcepthook from apportfileutils import likelypackaged getrecentcrashes File usrlibpython distpackagesapportinitpy line in module from apportreport import Report File usrlibpython distpackagesapportreportpy line in module import apportfileutils File usrlibpython distpackagesapportfileutilspy line in module from apportpackagingimpl import impl as packaging File usrlibpython distpackagesapportpackagingimplpy line in module import apt File usrlibpython distpackagesaptinitpy line in module import aptpkg ModuleNotFoundError No module named aptpkg Original exception was Traceback most recent call last File cadastropy line in module import facerecognition importa o m dulo facerecognition File homescalocallibpython sitepackagesfacerecognitioninitpy line in module from api import loadimagefile facelocations batchfacelocations facelandmarks faceencodings comparefaces facedistance File homescalocallibpython sitepackagesfacerecognitionapipy line in module from PIL import Image File usrlocallibpython distpackagesPILImagepy line in module from import imaging as core ImportError cannot import name imaging Just a minor clean Please update the version of PyPI to point to the latest version of the software facerecognition version Python version Operating System centos Description This work is very helpful to check if two images come from the same person But my case is I have a pool of faces of same person How can I improve the accuracy by comparing my probe image with the pool rather than random chosen one Can I get one embedding with a pool of same person face images facerecognition version Python version Operating System windows Description I am saving my facerecognition encodings in a pickle file but I want to save these faceencodings in a sqlite database I dont have idea how I can do that facerecognition version Python version Operating System Description I am trying to get started with facerecognition What I Did Running mac OS Installed Anaconda running python pip from anaconda libpython sitepackagespip python pip installed facerecognition is successful Tried to import facerecognition but its not working It keeps saying module not found Any help please
