I have a nested list and for some reason auto scroll is not working I have attached a code sandbox below for the issue Any help will be much appreciated I was also wondering if there is a way to add styles while dragging the element like an outline maybe Item being dragged is not moving Im using the basic example to do this with the lockToContainerEdges prop Sample code below const SortableItem sortableElementvalue li style color whitevalueli const SortableContainer sortableContainerchildren return ulchildrenul class App extends Component state items Item Item Item Item Item Item onSortEnd oldIndex newIndex thissetStateitems items arrayMoveitems oldIndex newIndex render const items thisstate return SortableContainer lockToContainerEdgestrue onSortEndthisonSortEnd itemsmapvalue index SortableItem keyitemvalue indexindex valuevalue SortableContainer When using srcDoc on an iframe youre pushing HTML in from your parent window into the iframe directly Because of this we need to reference the elements instances of HTMLElement and window to ensure were using the right values For instance an element made in an iframe has a different HTMLElement class instance than the one in the parent document which this JavaScript was imported This issue is quite similar to issue with sortablehelper behind popup But it is specific to Safari There are few cases when Safari calculates zindexes in strange way and you need to apply csstransformations to force sortable clone appearing above popup There is quite simple PR which can help with this issue it allows you to apply custom csstransformations to helper and I believe that it can help in my case Is there any chances for this PR to be reviewed and merged Does anybody know any another solutions for using of reactsortablehoc along with popups and Safari I can reproduce this using the demo Add these styles to Showcasestylelist ShowcasestylestylizedList css height vh overflow visible Scroll down which scrolls down the body and try clicking and dragging an item It moves the item relative to scrollTop of not scrollTop of wherever your body is at title We are having a case where we would have to keep the position of certain children is that possible Have already read through the documentation but have not found any solutions to that I see with disabled option the element is not draggable anymore but still moves when I drag another element over it How can I make it fixed position and not let it change the order In my case I need to set the first item fixed so it should not be draggable and unsortable Ive just used your library let me say it is one of the BEST REACT LIBRARIES out there But Im having trouble handling events which have been bound to the elements that are inside of SortableElement Before adding the sort feature event handlers were working fine But now they have become unresponsive it seems that control does not reach the event handlers Can you please point out what I should do to make child events work Stackoverflow question In iOS or later when combined with reactvirtualized the SortableElement dragged outside the SortableContainer may not be operated This bug occurs when the original component of the dragged SortableElement is scrolled out of the SortableContainer and disappears The cause is that the disappeared component will not fire the touch event This bug can be confirmed by accessing and operating the sample page on an iPad with iOS or later installed
