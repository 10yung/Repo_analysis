The Exchange API documentation has been updated here which outlines that new exchange API URLs and WSS have been updated I have manually attempted to modify the tribecajson and a few of the other files to use these updated url interfaces as the old ones have been deprecated but I have been unsuccessful in getting Tribeca to connect I believe something must be in the code somewhere that needs updating to allow the interface to connect to the exchange This happens after manual installation npm ERR code ERROUTOFRANGE npm ERR The value of err is out of range It must be a negative integer
