 Hi defunktsan Proxy authentication function has been added please merge if you like Regards Fixes At present when you call Gistreadgist It just prints the gist information to the console Instead the right behaviour is it should return the gist contents so that we can assign it to a variable and use it We need to change the behaviour with the CLI tool to print the returning information from Gistreadgist instead of directly printing into the console inside the method For CLI Current behaviour ruby Gistreadgistoptions read filename Expected behavior ruby output Gistreadgistoptions read filename puts output if output For API Current behaviour ruby puts file content Expected behaviour ruby file content Included notice about new Docker Image base on this gem Fixing this should be easy sh urlfinal curl Ls o devnull w urleffective I installed via apt and it could not find the gist command in the terminal Then I installed via gem it could not find the command either It only worked after I soft linked it to usrbin with ln s varlibgems gemsgist bingist usrbingist Is the problem with this project with gem or with apt Or am I doing something wrong disappointedrelieved It would be nice if there is an option for setting up default gist id for current directory The default gist id can be retrieved Maybe via gistid file Just like rubyversion or rbenvgemsets where they determine the default version or gemset by using the values in that file Nothing happens This could be done by looking recursively in the tree for the gist file If the above approach works I need it the functionality and Im happy to work on a PR for it
