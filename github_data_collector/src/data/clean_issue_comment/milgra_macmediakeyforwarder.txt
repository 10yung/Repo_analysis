 This pull request stops nonmusic apps from changing the Touch Bar now playing state while music is playing as Mac Media Key Forwarder controls the music fixes To achieve this the undocumented MediaRemote framework is used The following sources were used to achieve this solution The WebKit source GitHub repos with the MediaRemoteh header Disassembling the MediaRemote private framework using Hopper and nm A lot of trial and error After listening to the kMRMediaRemoteNowPlayingApplicationIsPlayingDidChangeNotification event two crucial functions are called MRMediaRemoteSetNowPlayingApplicationOverrideEnabled This stops other applications from changing the now playing state in the Touch Bar MRMediaRemoteSetNowPlayingApplicationPlaybackStateForOrigin This updates the actual now playing state without the override method above this will only work once per session Alternative solutions that were investigated Calling MRMediaRemoteSendCommandToApp to simulate sending a play event MRMediaRemoteSendCommand sends it to the app that has focus the method signature seems to require a complex Protobuf object though Calling MRNowPlayingClientSetBundleIdentifier to set Music or Spotify to be the active app this requires a MRNowPlayingClientProtobuf object though Calling iTunes playpause twice to seize control back to the Music app This is not ideal as this results in a brief pause Simply calling iTunes playpause when media from another app starts to play This ensures the now playing state is correct but stops music playback If the MediaRemote framework could not be used the NPUNowPlayingControllerNowPlayingInfoDidChange notification could possibly be listened to with the right header file included Spotify is supported but there is an issue where the Touch Bar will not update from within Spotify when the play button is used even without Mac Media Key Forwarder installed This is beyond the scope of this application but could be fixed by Spotify or by creating a new tool from this code The bundle identifier was changed to the proper case for the Music app as string matching is used to check for it when using Apple Events the case doesnt seem to matter Can you please add Prioritize Browser to the dropdown currently the chrome browser keeps highjacking it regardless of what your app says so if it can be told not to hijack it when not prioritised that might fix the issue The playpause button updates correctly when only the Music app is being used If a YouTube video is played then paused in Chrome or Safari the Touch Bar will show a play icon even though the Music app is playing music The problem can be fixed in Chrome by disabling the the Hardware Media Key Handling chromeflagshardwaremediakeyhandling flag It does not appear to be possible to disable this in Safari Firefox is not affected It may be possible to keep an internal state based on the comappleiTunesplayerInfo event and update the player state based on the NPUNowPlayingControllerNowPlayingInfoDidChange event dispatched from the NowPlayingTouchUI process Play pause doesnt work when use play pause open Musicapp its still when I press next media or activate the Musicapp window manually My macOS version is Beta B amacmediakeyforwarder version is build When Im using YouTube for example if I pause the video and doubletap my AirPod it resumes YouTube video instead of resuming Spotify music However if I try to do the same manipulation with the keyboard playpause key it works just fine First off thanks for this amazing app Unfortuanelty after I just updated to MacMediaKeyForwwarder just got stuck not responding even after restartting and cleaning all app files related and reenabling the security preferences This seems to be the same issue that many other reported after an apple update After compiling the app from source the IDE traced the bug to the following line in code In applicationDidFinishLaunching img width altScreenshot at src Hope this helps unfortuanetly I dont have enough knowledge in CGTaps or Coca to fix this myself Your site is serving the download for this app over HTTP instead of HTTPS This is a security risk to your users Please acquire a HTTPS certificate for your site You can get one for free from Lets Encrypt Hey First of all thank you for this app It works really well and i really cant use the media keys on a mac without it anymore smile Just one quick question would it be possible to add the feature to run this application on the background I like a clean menu bar and never change the settings of this app to be honest Thank you System information OS Mojave Hardware MacBook Pro RAM GB MacMediaKeyForwarderSpindumptxt
