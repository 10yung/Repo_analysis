this bug Please add as many details as possible That helps us reproduce the issue on our computers Download the album folder you can use download as zip then extract or just download the files and put them in a folder yourself I dont know if the name of the folder will affect the bug but best to name it the same thing Import the album folder into the dopamine library Search for Colors of Life and see the album songs appear Search for the artist replus and notice the songs do not appear Searching for re and clicking the album does display the songs but I dont think the problem is the character as the other albums by replus dont have this problem Observed behavior Describe how Dopamine acts Dopamine shows the album as having songs and doesnt display the album name or any of the songs I made a YouTube video showing the problem occurring on my end In the video I show that doubleclicking on the album cover even when the songs are not showing up does still play the first song of the album meaning that Dopanime does know the songs are there Also worth noting I have had this problem with other albums in the past where songs wont show up depending on the search term I happened to catch the bug now and have some time to write this bug report I have been using Dopamine from Beta I believe so this bug has been happening at least since then Desired behavior Describe how Dopamine should act Dopamine should display the album as normal with the songs and album name populated Log file Add the relevant piece of the log file The Dopamine log file can be found in this directory appdata

to click on the seek bar multiple times to get it right I think it would be an improvement if you showed the seek time above the playing circle when it is being dragged so that we know where we are seeking to Also I think it would be nice to show the time in the same way above the mouse when it is hovering anywhere over the seek bar not only when the circle is being dragged With this we can click and skip exactly to where we want I have attached two screenshots as examples Thanks again for all of your work so far I happened to send some audio on Discord and saw they have the desired behavior As shown in the last screenshot the seek bar color is lighter up to where the cursor is and darker after it This would be a plus Im submitting a Check one of the following options with x DO

the playlist then sometimes briefly scrolls down to the bottom of the playlist for a split second then goes back to the playing song This doesnt effect playback at all its just a visual bug It doesnt happen on a normal playlist The playlist is a song favorites playlist Im submitting a Check one of the following options with x DO NOT log support requests here For support requests use this contact

volume was so low I checked the Dopamine volume level in the bottom right and it was set to The problem is that at the moment there is no way to tell the approximate Dopamine volume without changing it I propose removing the rightmost volume icon curve once the volume is below volume then the middle curve once below volume and the leftmost curve once at volume Im submitting a precode x Bug report
