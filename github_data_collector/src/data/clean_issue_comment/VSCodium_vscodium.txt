think the icon could use some improvement I wanted to explore the good metaphor work that jaredreich did for the current logo and expand it a bit Keeping to the theme of Codium tomentosum the algae and the color voted at the time on Also maybe it could use some more expanded branding like a logotype Make the whole thing a tad bit more modern Sorry I dont know how to change or add a proper label
