for persistently adding attributes to zoomed tables before computing a summary As it turns out the assumption of single key columns is rather deeply rooted in the code So far the function dmexamineconstraints works as it should but tests fail since helper functions have been adapted which now produce the wrong type for keycolumn infotibbles TBC closes Using zoomed table as start Other functions where this pattern makes sense change some of the function names and update naming vignette closes dmexamineconstraints should return a list in the column column Can we keep dmcheckconstraints as is because they throw an error If a function returns invisibly and throws an error it should be named check x checkcardinality but keep examinecardinality x checkifsubset inconsistent name maybe checksubset x checkkey which can be examined or learned for zoomed dm from cdm API to dm Take a cdm based demo from an older version document what needs to change to make it work with the new API For functions that return a data frame we need to check if the output column names make sense
