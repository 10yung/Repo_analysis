Hi im trying to set up glslViewer i did every passage on the terminal i have the last MacOS but the visual code terminal is showing me this while the glslViewer window doesnt change color even modifying the vec eventually sorry for my english MBPdiXXXTest XXX glslViewer colorfrag Error linking shader ERROR Compiled fragment shader was corrupt NOT FOUND I started using glslViewer for the purpose of installations utilizing CRT output when connected to Raspberry Pi I can see that my relatively simple shaders are getting slower over time approximately after day and no longer run real time It seems that the effect intensifies Applies to both Pi and Pi As a workaround I ask the technicians to restart it every day before the show but most likely I will introduce automatic restart script Darwin platform with glfw drivers Package glfw was not found in the pkgconfig search path Perhaps you should add the directory containing glfw pc to the PKGCONFIGPATH environment variable No package glfw found srcmaino usrbinclang Wall O stdc fpermissive arch x DPLATFORMOSX DDRIVERGLFW stdliblibc Isrc Iinclude ISystemLibraryFrameworksGLUIframework g c srcmaincpp o srcmaino Wnodeprecateddeclarations In file included from srcmaincpp srcglglh fatal error GLFWglfw h file not found include GLFWglfw h error generated make srcmaino Error how to fixed I wanted to make use of the builtin camera in glslViewer for a raymarching fragment shader The way I was doing things the camera acted strangely so I tried upgrading glslViewer because I saw a commit that changed some camera behavior since the version I using But now it doesnt work at all Things look OK when the shader starts but when I try to adjust the camera with the mouse the shader breaks and the cameraposition command gives me nannannan But even if this is fixed I feel like I dont fully understand how to use the camera I tried getting ray directions doing uviewMatrix vec sc xyz where sc is screen coordinates and this kinda seemed to work but the control seemed really funky so Im thinking maybe I dont actually know what the view matrix represents Im a noob Hi there Im having trouble compiling on fedora Ive made sure to follow the directions and install the dependencies Heres the error message Im getting Not sure whats going on since C isnt my strongest language This is problem of Viewer or code of shader Ubuntu glslViewer work well with examples but from differ shader show error linking shader As far as i understand there is no support for changing filtering when loading textures so I have a wavefront obj with materials and texture here is how tinyobjloader viewer parse it and shows Parsing time ms of vertices of normals of texcoords of materials of shapes material diffusetexname catdiffpng material diffusetexname Loaded texture examplesviewercatdiffpng w h comp shape materialid shape of triangles bmin bmax a here same model parsed by your viewer Loading examplesviewercatobj Total vertices Total colors Total normals Total texcoords Total materials Total shapes Shapes Add Material cat examplesviewercatdiffpng loaded as uniform sampler D ucatdiff uniform vec ucatdiffResolution defaultobject vertices colors normals uvs indices triang Compute tangents Reload D scene shaders shader load time s a issue seems related to texture addressing or some other fact can you take a look make srcwindowo g Wall O stdc fpermissive DPLATFORMLINUX Iusrlocalinclude Iusrincludelibdrm Isrc Iinclude g c srcwindowcpp o srcwindowo Wnodeprecateddeclarations srcwindowcpp In function void initGLglmivec bool bool srcwindowcpp error GLFALSE was not declared in this scope glfwWindowHintGLFWVISIBLE GLFALSE srcwindowcpp note suggested alternative GLFWFALSE glfwWindowHintGLFWVISIBLE GLFALSE GLFWFALSE srcwindowcpp error GLTRUE was not declared in this scope glfwWindowHintGLFWFLOATING GLTRUE srcwindowcpp note suggested alternative GLFWTRUE glfwWindowHintGLFWFLOATING GLTRUE GLFWTRUE srcwindowcpp In function void closeGL srcwindowcpp error GLTRUE was not declared in this scope glfwSetWindowShouldClosewindow GLTRUE srcwindowcpp note suggested alternative GLFWTRUE glfwSetWindowShouldClosewindow GLTRUE GLFWTRUE srcwindowcpp In function void setWindowSizeint int srcwindowcpp error glViewport was not declared in this scope glViewport floatgetWindowWidth floatgetWindowHeight srcwindowcpp note suggested alternative getViewport glViewport floatgetWindowWidth floatgetWindowHeight getViewport Makefile recipe for target srcwindowo failed make srcwindowo Error When attempting to run glslViewer on a Raspberry Pi B running Raspbian stretch it throws the following error glslViewer srcappcpp glmivec getScreenSize Assertion success failed Aborted At least one other user experienced this issue back in as reported here
