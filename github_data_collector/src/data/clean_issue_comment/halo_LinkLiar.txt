Is it possible to access LinkLiar with a script such as AppleScript I tried looking at it with the accessibility inspector program but I cant seem to get it to work Basically my use case is that I would like my MAC address to always be random unless Im at my university because for the WiFi to work there they require registration with a MAC address and Id rather not be reregistering my computer every time I connect What I would like to do is location based MAC address changing such as turning it to my manually defined address whenever Im on their network I can detect location based changes or SSID changes with Little Snitch Profiles and Id just like to make those changes using LinkLiar rather than having to manually click it and paste a MAC address in Does this app start spoofing my MAC address as soon as I restart my laptop Or do I have to start the app first sorry didnt know where else to post questions Example randomize MAC but make it always under Dell vendor
