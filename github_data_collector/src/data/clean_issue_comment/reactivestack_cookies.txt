Having explicity set up the path as when setting the cookie cookiessetname value path expires expires when going to mysitecompage then accepting cookies checking in the browser the cookie path is page instead of now users can disable cookie in browser setting In this case you can access to documentcookie but canot rewrite it for example documentcookie testcookie consolelogdocumentcookie empty string therefore private updateBrowserValues if thisHASDOCUMENTCOOKIE return thiscookies cookieparsedocumentcookie updateBrowserValues called on getAll always reset cookie to empty object Hi It seems when I set a cookie name to uppercase my example was like COOKIENAME Then if I logged out of my app and back in again React wouldnt see it until I refreshed the page I tried lowercasing it cookiename and it worked Riddle me this For eg can reactcookie trigger component rerender if the user clears the cookies in the browser
