Describe the bug There seems to be an issue with Autolayout behavior when the CardsViewController is presented modally using a modalPresentationStyle of types formSheet or actionSheet I havent tried it on iPhone but its really evident on iPads running iOS Since formSheet is the new automatic behavior Also worth noting if the device is rotated Autolayout will then rearrange the elements to another incorrect state that will remain until the controller is dismissed If the modal view controller is presented on fullScreen there is no issue whatsoever To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Create a CardsViewController Create and initialize multiple CardPartsViewControllers instances Load CardPartsViewControllers into the CardsViewController Present CardsViewController modally with a modal presentation style of formSheet or pageSheet Expected behavior The elements should be displayed in the same way as if they were presented in fullscreen Screenshots Fullscreen Presentation

my PR are working If a CardPart is created and then used in multiple calls to setupCardParts forState then upon first display the shared CardPart is not displayed I amended the example

project add a line to set the currentPage to any value other than and page only is displayed Expected behavior Content page displayed that corresponds to the page number set for currentPage property Screenshots NA Info please complete the following information All devices and OS versions Additional context NA The idea of a Theme is great but I need to override one of the properties cardsViewContentInsetTop and there doesnt seem to be a way to do that I see that youve added a cardCellMargins property to CardsViewController so that it can be overridden Do I need to fork this repository to tweak it to add the cardsViewContentInsetTop in the same way or is there a better solution to overriding this property Issue Link link ul li Add Carthage support Issue li ul Goals of this PR tada Carthage support has been added to CardParts Because Cocoapods is also supported and is responsible for generating the Xcode project and workspace I changed the gitignore to allow tracking of the Pod source code which allows Carthage to build the project when another app specifies CardParts as a dependency This creates some repo bloat but allows both dependency managers to coexist Additionally for Carthage to build the Xcode workspace needed to share the CardParts scheme CardPartsxcscheme This file is found in the Pods subfolders Summary of changes ul li Added Cartfile
