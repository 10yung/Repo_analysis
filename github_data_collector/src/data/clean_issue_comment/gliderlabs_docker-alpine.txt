mERROR unsatisfiable constraints m fontsdejavucore missing required by world fontsdejavucore I dont know if this is a bug but today I got a weird result that can be easily reproduced I created a container with capdropALL with the image alpine Soon after I accessed the container terminal with the command docker exec ti CONTAINERID binsh and I used a basic command ping wwwgooglecom I got the result ping permission denied are you root out of curiosity I tried ping wwwgooglecom yes or ping wwwgooglecom yes I received an absurd flood of the letter Y without stopping on my console I had to restart my machine to get out of the infinite loop I believe that if this has no connection to the alpine image or cannot be resolved I think the phrase are you root Should be removed then i realized i cant even add pip or pip I cant manage to have a working fail ban in nginx alpine and I cant figure out which way to look for Here is the relevant section of my Dockerfile RUN apk update apk add certbot certbotnginx rsyslog fail ban Hypothesis fail ban does not run because of a system initialization error Theres no fail ban in etcinitd so I believe fail banclient status when it says that it Failed to access socket path varrunfail banfail bansock Is fail ban running I tried to install openrc to start fail ban manually but I am getting an even more puzzling behavior though fail ban now appears in etcinitd usrsrcnginx rcservice fail ban status You are attempting to run an openrc service on a system which openrc did not boot You may be inside a chroot or you may have used another initialization system to boot this system In this situation you will get unpredictable results If you really want to do this issue the following command touch runopenrcsoftlevel I cant quite make sense of this message for fail ban appears in etcinitd IFF openrc runs in this container If openrc did not start this service who did I then tried the following rcupdate add fail ban rcservice fail ban restart WARNING fail ban is already starting Does that mean that something else tries to start fail ban not matter the presence of openrc Is fail ban visible in etcinitd merely a byproduct of the latter Hypothesis n fail ban does not start because some logs to parse do not exist From what I read here fail ban does not start when it cannot find the relevant log files for the different services I tried to remove etcfail banjaildalpinesshconf alongside etcfail banjailconf in my entrypointsh to add only my own jail parsing varlognginxaccesslog Some insights would help me figure out what I am doing conceiving wrongly
