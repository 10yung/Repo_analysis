Ubuntu cosmic and disco both give the same error when I run sudo gdebi Mutate deb Reading package lists Done Building dependency tree Reading state information Done Reading state information Done This package is uninstallable Dependency is not satisfiable fcitxlibsqt I cant seem to find an installation for fcitxlibsqt help iomari When I try to add the PPA sudo addaptrepository ppamutateppa I get error HTTP Error Not Found Cannot add PPA This PPA does not support bionic Same issue using package manager Perhaps the PPA needs to be updated Thanks I cannot compile Mutate on Ubuntu Bionic I have been able to compile on Ubuntu Xenial thanks to some hints in the issues here My new notebook has Bionic installed Id like to avoid reverting to Xenial I can see that there was a release of Mutate but the README still refers to a deb file which is nowhere to be found Here is the pertinent output from make all previous output was uneventfulsuccessful I suspect what Im looking at is another issue with the older libboost version library that Mutate requires I have installed libboostalldev which should be enough Help Thanks a lot for your efforts in supporting this great tool Editing configini sometimes stops Mutate from working for example if a new item was not correctly edited but saved though Feature Wish It would be great if Mutate would detect corrupt configitems and help recover from it For example by creating a backup configini when preference is called and restore that backup and notify the user when a corrupt ini is detected In the meantime where does Mutate log errors so one can more easily correct corrupted items in the configini manually it will result in not print any result in mutate i use this script usrbinpython encodingutf import sqlite conn sqlite connectdictdb c conncursor print test print commandcopy print icon print subtext test cexecuteSELECT FROM dict WHERE en happy print test print commandcopy print icon print subtext test and it only print one item can you help me I type something then I want to change keybord layout eg from english to russian i hit superspace and nothing happens Even PrtSc doesnt work when Mutate widget is active When running google search plugin it automatically inserts text from clipboard if it was copied with CTRLV However if I copy stuff from tmux it still uses the old value Im not sure which clipboard Mutate actually uses Additionally if I delete something in vim it will be used properly in Mutate however if I use yank command y it wont get copied Note that the other programs work fine and the text is copied to system clipboard regardless of what I do Im using this command for tmux bindkey t vicopy y copypipe tmux savebuffer xclip sel clipboard i I also tried primary clipboard but it doesnt work For the first workaround Id be fine with just running command and then using CtrlV to copy the last thing but Im not sure how to specify it in configini So when I press the desired hotkey I get prompt with youtube and then I have to enter what I want without Mutate automatically inserting the last thing in clipboard How do I do that Thanks Parameters for gnomesessionquit was incorrect Changed to poweroff as of and Tried installing both ways here is via the gdebi method sudo gdebi Mutate deb Reading package lists Done Building dependency tree Reading state information Done Reading state
