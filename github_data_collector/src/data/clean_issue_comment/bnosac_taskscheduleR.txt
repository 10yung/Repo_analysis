Hi Thanks for this useful package I have the following problem Sometimes it seems as Windows restarts unexpectedly to install software updates This might be ok but the problem is that it leaves running taskscheduleR scrips in a broken state Id like to schedule a script at startup to basically restore the state Hence Id need support for at startup in addition to the existing methods like on idle and on logon Also do you know what happens if I restart and dont log a user in Does this already trigger on logon or does on logon mean if I enter my credentials and literally log in Thanks Here is a link with the syntax Who is willing to take on the challenge of writing a nicer looking addin
