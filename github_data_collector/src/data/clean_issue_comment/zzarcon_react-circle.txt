The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

security fix PRs for this repo from the Security Alerts page details The library behaves quite oddly when progress is greater than I think that the charts progress line should cap at while the amount displayed should be the actual progress img width altScreen Shot at AM src progressColor lineargradient ED FF FC Itd be nice to have a loading mode where the circle just spins as a loading indicator Had a crack at added a render prop option as suggested and updated example I decided to exclude the svg element in this mode as the circle fills the svg dimensions and this defeats some of the customisation afforded because it leaves no space for other elements Circle circle progressCircle progressText svg widthresponsive size heightresponsive size viewBox text x y stylefontSize Mathround progress minstext text x y stylefontSize transformOrigin px px pxtransformrotate progress deg text text x y stylefontSize remainingtext circle progressCircle svg Circle Custom render function This change also allows other arbitrary svg elements to be added simply by including them inside Circle eg Circletext stylefontsizefontsize px x y CompletiontextCircle Custom elements When clicking the button in the example the button subsequently becomes disabled This PR updates the example to disable the child div elements rather than the parent wrapper I also reduced the padding added a margin to maintain consistent spacing when scrolling to the bottom and moved the main button to the top as it was not friendly for lower resolution displays such as my laptop where most of the controls would be hidden on load I found em perfect for fallbacks as its supported in all browsers and just works It actually depends on the spacing of the font so I added a prop fallback fallback zzarcon The current lineWidth is limited below as the radius is fixed and the viewBox with a fixed size These make the circle limited to be sort of thin Keep the fixed size and generate radius dynamicly by the proped lineWidth may free the limit I mean the circle can be able to be thicker enough Check this adapted file for example Since it an aggressive change Id ask if you think this is necessary Id like to make a PR if so Just ran into an issue with enlarging the fontsize and centering the percentagetext My standard csstricks dont work here Circle progresscurrentStateInPercent

would be cool to have some easy way to adjust this Thanks again for your hard work
