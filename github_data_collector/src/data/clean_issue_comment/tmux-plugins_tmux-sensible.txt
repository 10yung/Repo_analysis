I tried this plugin but it seems to break my prefix key which is backslash I have been using this prefix key for years I find it ideal on a UK keyboard and it doesnt conflict with anything I have now disabled this plugin because of this issue It must be because it does not escape by using another ie Repro tmux echo TERM screen tmux V tmux tmux showoption sv defaultterminal screen grep default tmuxconf tmux setoption s defaultterminal screen color tmux showoption sv defaultterminal screen color Not sure how to fix this in an easy way Hey I just found this Start windows and panes at not set g baseindex setw g panebaseindex Source Could this be made standard in this Id like to just patch that in Error message reads unknownoption defaultterminal Update the numbering when a window is killed Call me an outcast but I never got onboard with the CaCb prefix My prefix is backtick which I have been using without issues for over years Im not alone Ive met other developers who do the same although this binding is rare In case youre wondering it does not create issues with languages using backtick in code for the following reasons use of backtick is typically an antipattern that can be replaced with cleaner syntax ie perl use of backtick is very rare and my binding of pressing backtick twice to insert a literal backtick handles these rare cases just fine even in JS which embraced this abomination in ES This is rather low priority since I can easily modifycomment out that part of config but I just wanted to point this alternative out since tmuxsensible is supposed to be settings everyone can agree on Ca is lastwindow a is sendprefix This is consistent with screen bindings Ca Ca toggles to last window and Ca a sends the command character lastwindow is usually also needed more often so it makes sense to make it more accessible Fixes See Try eg bindkey T copymode C sendkeys X copypipeandcancel pbcopy I have the following in my tmuxconf to switch windows with alth and altl bind n Mh previouswindow bind n Ml nextwindow and sometimes with escapetime set to by tmuxsensible then h or l will be echoed in the terminal rather than switching windows Setting escapetime to seems to fix the problem without adding any noticeable delays when pressing esc elsewhere for example in Vim could this be made the default in tmuxsensible
