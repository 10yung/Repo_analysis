img width altscreenshot src will able to updatereinitialize the url database column with existing data Current scope implementation fails if one or more of the scope attribute values is nil One may want to use nullable values as scope parameters when using stringexactsasurl in combination with a softdelete solution such as In this case live records will have a nil value for the deletedat column but deleted records will have a specific value By including the deletedat column in the actsasurl scope one can ensure that url slugs for live records will be unique while also avoiding having deleted records polluting the available URL space Were using stringex in a Rails project and noticed that dollar signs come through with the actsasurl plugin and tourl string method if theyre multiples or not preceding numbers Two examples one with signs and one with a list of reserved URI characters First variations on the sign ruby itemtourl item itemtourl dollarsitem itemtourl item itemtourl item itemtourl dollarsitem itemtourl dollars item itemtourl dollarsitem itemtourl item itemtourl item Second with a list of reserved characters taken from the URI RFC ruby irb w each c puts a cc btourl ab aslashslashb ab anumbernumberb ab ab aatatb ab ab aandandb ab ab ab astarstarb aplusplusb ab ab aequalsequalsb Not sure if its intentional but it breaks some of our routes that have been constraining the parameter provided by actsasurl with AZaz which worked fine up until this point If its not a bug can you recommend a better constraint or the set of characters that are allowed through tourl Thanks As demonstrated in testhandlingduplicateurlswithlimits where the limit is given as but the resulting string is characters long Im happy to work on a fix to address this stringex leaves empty field for url if there is no name value provided In versions before there was id value for url field where name value was nil Is it posible to turn of conversation of symbols to words in url Like an example by default stringex is converting dot slash and etc Thank you I have a Company model with fields name and slug class Company ActiveRecordBase actsasurl name urlattribute slug end For new records the gem converts asian characters to phonetic letters fine Now Im just trying to do the same for all of the existing records in our database For example heres one existing record we want to fix the slug for prymain Companylastname Working prymain Companylastslug After running the initializeurls method I expect the slug to be updated with the phonetic letters but they dont change Heres the rake task that starts off the process Rake task that iterates through all of the Companies in the database and regenerates their slug values from their name attribute task regeneratecompanyslugs environment do Companyinitializeurls end Some translations could use inflection eg prosentti percent vs prosenttia percent but this should at least be better than no translations at all Premise We have a scenario where there might be records in database with the same title When saving the st one currently actsasurls loads records to see which number it should append to the end of the url slug Naturally this causes some issues with memory when there are lots of records Changes made This PR changes it so that only the url slugs are loaded into the memory rather than complete objects Few notes Im not really familiar with the codebase but all current tests seem to pass Issue is somewhat related but this does not solve the problem mentioned regarding fetching all records
