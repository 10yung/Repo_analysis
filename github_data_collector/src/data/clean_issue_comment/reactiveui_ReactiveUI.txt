didnt before You can bypass by implementing IViewFor in codebehind but the component itself ist kaput Ill investigate further and add details here as I find them Please note although we cant commit to any timeline priority will be given to those who are Contributors to the project If this is a question please ask on StackOverflow Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe A clear and concise description of what the problem is This is a request for XamarinForms Shell Support Describe the solution youd like A clear and concise description of what you want to happen ReactiveUI to support XamarinForms Shell as opposed to the current INavigation interface This will introduce an entirely new paragadim into ReactiveUI for navigation and make the current RoutingState obsolete in Shell applications The new Shell navigation will be specific to the XamarinForms platform Describe alternatives youve considered A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered None There is a perfectly convenient routing system in Xamarin Forms that ReactiveUI supports But it doesnt support Shell Currently you have to choose between XamarinForms Shell or ReactiveUI Routing The current ReactiveUI routing system will not support shell out of the box NOTE There is currently some work the XamarinForms team is doing to support MVVM with Shell Last I was told that work is being tracked here Describe suggestions on how to achieve the feature A clear description to how to achieve the feature An abstraction over the Shell to make it less static and more in line with MVVM patterns Not sure the specifics of what this looks like Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here The XamarinForms Shell approach is a Page Page approach ReactiveUI has been actively trying to move to the ViewModel based navigation These two concepts are not congruent with each other this doesnt mean they wont work together This simply means that we will have to work to address concerns in our approach to get the most value Describe the solution youd like I would like to be able to setup Interaction bindings in the same way that a standard binding or a command binding is setup The new binding would be named BindInteraction The setup would be very similar to a command binding and I would imagine it would look like the following thisBindInteractionViewModel vm vmMyInteraction input Do Something Currently the way to implement when an Interaction has changed and to get it setup feels a little clumsy when compared to the elegance of the existing bindings Describe alternatives youve considered A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered Today we created an extension method that is essentially a poor mans binding for interactions This is largely due to the fact that some of the bits needed to create a custom binding such as ReflectionRewrite example are not publicly available which is totally fine We created an extension method like this public static IDisposable BindTInput TOutputthis IObservableInteractionTInput TOutput interactionObservable FuncInteractionContextTInput TOutput Task handler var interactionDisposable new SerialDisposable return interactionObservable Wherex x null Dox interactionDisposableDisposable xRegisterHandlerhandler Finally interactionDisposableDispose Subscribe public static IDisposable BindTInput TOutput TDontCarethis IObservableInteractionTInput TOutput interactionObservable FuncInteractionContextTInput TOutput IObservableTDontCare handler var interactionDisposable new SerialDisposable return interactionObservable Wherex x null Dox interactionDisposableDisposable xRegisterHandlerhandler Finally interactionDisposableDispose Subscribe on the UI side of things we then setup the binding like this thisWhenAnyValuex xViewModelConfirmDelete Bind async input var result await thisDisplayAlertConfirm Delete Are you sure you want to delete this task Yes No inputSetOutputresult Describe suggestions on how to achieve the feature A clear description to how to achieve the feature I think it really would just need to be implemented similar to a BindCommand The examples above are really not as fault tolerant and expressive as a normal binding but I feel as if that should be achievable Please note although we cant commit to any timeline priority will be given to those who are Contributors to the project If this is a question please ask on StackOverflow Describe the bug A clear and concise description of what the bug is Recently CommandBindingTests in ReactiveUITestsWinforms seem to fail randomly When all tests are executed it tests wont pass When the failing test is executed in isolation it passes Steps To Reproduce Provide the steps to reproduce the behavior Build all Unit Tests in the ReactiveUI project Observe that some of the CommandBindingTests fail Run the failed test

only security updates if desired details Describe the bug When a view model is changed for a ViewModelViewHost it creates the old view again and only after that creates a new view which can cause brief flickering of views This happens in a WPF app on NET Core not sure about other frameworks ReactiveUI version is Steps To Reproduce Ive created a simple repo to reproduce the issue The view flickering is not actually visible there but if you debug the app in Visual Studio youll see the log output When switching the view from View to View the following log can be seen MainViewModel Switching the view View Creating the view View Creating the view Expected behavior The old view is not created again when switching to a new view Environment OS Windows Home Additional context The source of error is probably in the constructor of the ViewModelViewHost class var contractChanged updateViewModelSelect ViewContractObservableSwitch var viewModelChanged updateViewModelSelect ViewModel var vmAndContract contractChangedCombineLatestviewModelChanged contract vm new ViewModel vm Contract contract vmAndContractSubscribex ResolveViewForViewModelxViewModel xContract Ive debugged this code and x ResolveViewForViewModelxViewModel xContract is hit twice when switching the view model first time with the old view model hence creating the old view and the second time with the new view model I think this is becuase when a view model is changed the contractChanged is fired and then the viewModelChanged is fired which is why vmAndContract is fired twice
