Thanks for the great package Much of my research involves measuring skin temperatures of different body segments eg face hands chest etc and I havent found an elegant way to visualize those data in R yet I came across your package and thought it would be perfect for this particular application with some modifications I would be happy to help determine the coordinates of typical body segments if that was useful Expression atlas of human using gganatogram is really amazing Can you add some model organism such as fruit fly and mosquito Thanks for your excellent work Hi Great tool just what I was looking for and hoped someone would create A quick question do you have existing code for given a gene symbol getting expression data for that gene for all human or mouse tissues such that it can be quickly visualised on your body map Seems to me like the most common use case and if the code was included it would speed updateusage Best wishes Alistair This is my new favourite package thank you so much Is it possible to add eyes and ears Thank you again Add Thymus to the circulatory system Align the Aorta so it matches the rest of the circulatory system Your package is awesome It could be possible to have also a depiction of the human venous system to add along with the arteries Minor issue the descending aorta does not match with the circulatory system when plot together Thank you in advance Request for additional organism or organs Many people have contacted me asking to add their favorite organisms so I thought Id create a guiding thread How organisms were chosen When I first started working on gganatogram I realised that it would be impossible for me to draw the anatograms myself so I set out to use well annotated open source SVG files I remembered seeing some at the Expression Atlas and decided to use the ones here I then also found the cell SVG from the Protein Atlas Not all organisms in the Expression Atlas has an anatogram and most species anatograms are not as well annotated as human and mouse Unfortunately my drawing and anatomy skills are limited and gganatogram is a hobby project outside my day job so I wont be able to manually draw organismsorgans and add them How to add a tissue to an existing organism If your favourite organism is included in gganatogram but some tissues are missing how do you add it Edit SVG in inkscape The best way to add an organisms would be to download the SVG from the Expression Atlas edit the file and create a new path for your tissue and draw it in inkscape preferably avoid circles and such If the tissue is annotated similarly to the tissues in the SVG it should be easy for me to add the organisms Add coordinate points The easiest for me would be to receive the coordinates xy directly which I can then read in to R and add to the appropriate organism One way to to this which I manually did for some tissues for the human anatograms due to my incapability of handling circles in SVG was to plot the outline of the organisms and then plot points as outlining the new tissue I used DescToolss DrawEllipse which outputs the coordinates of an circleellipse Otherwise points that you can connect with a line works How to add a whole new organism As I mentioned above I have no way of drawing a whole new organism from scratch If you are an expert on a specific organisms and think adding it to gganatogram will greatly help you to save time I suggest you either point me to a highly annotated SVG file of said organism or you commit timecommission to draw it from scratch I have found a SVG that I want you to add If you have found an open source SVG that you want me to add make sure that the anatomy is correct and that the tissues are names properly If theres a group of paths the group name should be the tissue name I want to draw my favourite organism Great I would be happy to add it to gganatogram to help researchers in your field See the guidelines here to make them similar to the Expression Atlas SVGs In summary How to add a new organism And send the resulting well annotated SVG to me Im getting this error Error GeomPolypath was built with an incompatible version of ggproto Please reinstall the package that provides this extension gridarrangehgMalencol Error could not find function gridarrange This is my script devtoolsinstallgithubjespermaaggganatogram librarygganatogram librarydplyr devtoolsinstallgithubdkahleggmap devtoolsinstallgithubhadleyggplot installpackagesgridExtra librarygridExtra hgMale gganatogramdatahgMalekey fillOutlinea bddb organismhuman sexmale fillcolour themevoid gridarrangehgMalencol Maybe Im not installing the packages correctly
