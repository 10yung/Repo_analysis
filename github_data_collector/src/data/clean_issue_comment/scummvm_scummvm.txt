 Because the DS hardware supports RGBA textures but not ARGB textures adjust colormasksh accordingly at compile time Source libctru documentation This PR does two things It changes hasFeature setFeatureState and getFeatureState to explicitly reject unsupported features and fall back to the parent implementation for everything else This provides filtering support on the relevant platforms and fixes a regression in the SamsungTV port from commit ce The overrides of those functions are also moved into the OSystem subclass This is consistent with the Vita Switch and AndroidSDL backends and removes the need for a separate graphics manager subclass for Symbian and SamsungTV Mixer managers can now be used with nonSDL backends Implement a kind of font mapper which takes a list of font files font face name size slant and weight and finds the best matching face Fakes italic and bold if there it isnt available This commit adds support for TTC files which contains multiple faces used by CJK Windows fonts This moves code files out from the main scummvm project and into new projects Specifically it uses these new projects Audio Graphics Video Common Backend Gui Switch target Android to as it is required by Google Play Store Switch minimum Android to as it is the lowest supported version by NDK Switch to NDK r Removed MIPS and armeabi as they are no longer supported Renamed Android build names into official ones Originally from libretroscummvm Regarding the FluidSynth changes I got the new values from here To quote the forum post The FluidSynth reverb while not as good as the old LiveAudigy hardware reverbs which were quite good can still sound decent with the right settings I have no idea how to change this in ScummVM but I have found the following FluidSynth settings to sound much better Reverb Room Damp Width Level Chorus N Level Speed Depth This gives a much more spacious sound as opposed to the stuffy room that seems to be FluidSynths default I basically tested these settings with every game and it was indeed a huge improvement In addition the reverbWidth setting in ScummVM master is handled internally as an int This is a bug which means the value can never be adjusted correctly it should be a double like all the other parameters This PR adds support for the Red Comrades Red Comrades and Red Comrades Demo by SKIF The demo is fully supported The other games can run but are unplayable due to a lot of bugs The engine misses walking system implementation This is the main reason why the engine is bugged Im not sure if it should be merged in current state Looking forward to your suggestions
