I changed the database design the location of some items has been changed Now the data on the web page is invisible and an error is reported NO MODEL ASSOCIATED This will break things in weird and horrible ways Edit this asset now to assign it a model Help its urgent Is the installsh script is available for RHEL Server please complete the following information SnipeIT Version OS CentOS Web Server Apache PHP Version PHP cli SnipeIT version v build Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Hello This is my first post so sorry if i will some mistake Do you plan in future for manager Licence in SnipeIT something about license value scales This is what I need to determine how many times i have to splite one license I ask because i dont ever seen any software which can assign one license for example assets Every software which i saw works on natural number not float value and i think this is needed to resolve me problem with license split This example occurs with redhat licensing specifically subscription Subsryption RedHat says that you can have one subscription for one physical server but the same one subscription can have two virtual servers This is my problem for license management Exists some license for which i can ascribe for assets Do you have an idea how to solve this problem Or can you put it in the future for application development for better license management or maybe can you indicate if you have such a plan For solve this problem i need some field in creating License where i could write float value In this case when i write float value or split licence for parts i get ten seats in licence and software have to know that is still one license Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here Please confirm you have done the following before posting your bug report I have enabled debug mode irrelevant it is a functional issue x I have read checked the Common Issues page Describe the bug After you check out a license you return to the license screen not to the license view screen To Reproduce Go to Licenses Click on a License name Now you are in the View License screen and you can Checkout licenses After you checkout a license you are returned to the Licenses screen steps back you should return to the View License screen step back Expected behavior After a license checkout you should return to the View License screen so you can checkout another license to someone else Server please complete the following information SnipeIT Version v build g dca OS eg Ubuntu CentOS Docker

notifications work fine for licenses that are within the alerts threshold window for the expiration date However after the expiration date passes and the license is overdue email notifications are no longer generated Describe the solution youd like Generate emails notifications after license expiration and is overedue include overdue license expiration in the expiringalerts context Describe alternatives youve considered Homegrown script to generate the report based on the date Would really prefer to have this feature included with the current notifications Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here Expected Behavior or desired behavior if a feature request Desired behavior We would like the activitiesactions logged when changes are made

install or an upgrade Upgrade Version of SnipeIT youre running Version v build Version of PHP youre running PHP Version of MySQLMariaDB youre running MySQL What OS and web server youre running SnipeIT on DebianApache This is not an error report just a feature request No error related answers available Confirm whether the error is reproducible on the demo I was able to reproduce Include what youve done so far in the installation and if you got any error messages along the way No errors Indicate whether or not youve manually edited any data directly in the database No Server please complete the following information SnipeIT v build g dca Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Currently using the snipe api in python to search for all assets assigned to a user but the user has a non ascii character in their name The api call requires a string in python however I cannot search for the non ascii xc xa as no results are returned Describe the solution youd like To search for user in the hardware list via employee number or search with non ascii characters The ability to search for user with employee number is preferable as duplicate names might exist in the future and could cause further issues down the line Describe alternatives youve considered Searching for a different criteria but no such search returns the desired results Additional context Or additionally if snipe could have a concept of a user that left from LDAP and assets that need to be returned via a report that would be even better Please ask if more information would be required Server SnipeIT Version OS not relevant Web Server not relevant PHP Version not relevant Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Short answer yes Currently theres no way to prevent users from editing the same objects simultaneously which may lead to inconsistent database data If user U begins editing asset A nothing prevents user U from also editing A at the same time When that happens whichever user saves first will at best lose all their changes once the other user saves theirs and at worst the end result will be a mix of both U s and U s changes Describe the solution youd like This can be prevented if the objects are locked for editing for the user that first acquires it Some mechanism has to be implemented in the ORM that locks the object identifying the user that locked it and has some timeout or other solution to prevent indefinite locks should the user forget to save or cancel Other users attempting to edit the object will be checked against the current active lock and will see their requests denied Describe alternatives youve considered Additionally it may be important to consider checking the object data for changes since it was opened for editing and at the very least warn the user that the data he is seeing is not up to date Server Version OS Ubuntu via snipe dockerHub image Web Server Apache PHP Version Default in image Firstly thanks for a quality app I am running Snipe on a large Kubernetes cluster and there are various security restrictions I have to adhere to Executing a pod as the root user using kubernetes a securityContext runAsUser root is strongly discouraged Our internal SecOps team have audited the app and expressed concern that the startupsh requires root access There is a longrunning issue with kubernetes that means a root user inside a container is the node root user which is a possible escalation escape risk Describe the solution youd like For the docker version of snipe to run as a dedicated user rather than requiring root access You may have already explored and dismissed this possibility as nonviable Root access is fine during the dockerfile but once inside the container running as root is a risk Describe alternatives youve considered Ive tried to work around the problem by modifying startupsh and adding our layering our own dockerfile but this requires fairly extensive rework of the dockerfile startupsh script and will make upgrades painful
