Hi How can I change the code to force minimum number of files to be uploaded How can I add validation for minimum number of files Regards Vladimir I am stumped at the moment as to why I am unable to get the blueimpjQueryfileupload plugin to work with the desktop Safari browser v My QA tested with v MacOS El Capitan and Ive tested on v macOS Mojave Safari doesnt appear to be calling the fileupload function However the plugin works as expected in both Chrome and Firefox Heres the bare bones code Ive been using for testing Html input classupload typefile nameFileData idfileuploadremoveitems dataurlanalysisupload JS fileuploadremoveitemsfileupload dataType json start function e data consolelogstart fires in Chrome Firefox browsers but not Safari progress function e data consolelogprogress fires in Chrome Firefox browsers but not Safari done function e data consolelogdone In both Firefox Chrome the consolelog fires as expected But nothing happens at all in Safari I havent been able to find any related SO posts or bug reports in this repo that answer this question so Im now reaching out here Can anyone else replicate this issue Interestingly I am able to upload a file from the demo page using Safari but looking through the demo code thus far has not made it clear howwhy the simple above use case consistently fails with Safari Any help would be most welcome Thanks ahead of time I have also asked this question on SO This is an odd issue we observed in our project that is very specific It only occurs in the iPhone simulator for and with iOS Other phones on iOS works fine and phones with iOS and works too We have a ReactNative app with a WebView and it also seemed that it worked with the old WebView but not the newer WkWebView At the moment I am not sure if the problem existed in Safari or not but I think so But I dont think this matters too much for the question The failure is that after the user has selected a file for upload nothing happens no attempt at uploading the file in the background Since it is on an iPhone in an embedded web app it is fairly hard to debug Anyway we sortof identified the problem and a potential fix but the offending code is pretty complicated so it is hard to see whats really going on and what sideeffects a fix could result in The culprit in this specific case is that handleFileTreeEntry returnsresolves a single file object where the caller expects an array It begins or ends here onAddnull data datafiles is supposed to be an array in this function However that datafiles is set in add from a Promise that bubbles down from this chain getFileInputFiles getSingleFileInputFiles handleFileTreeEntries handleFileTreeEntry In handleFileTreeEntry we have this code javascript if entryisFile if entryfile Workaround for Chrome bug entryfilerelativePath path dfdresolveentryfile this may also be a problem else entryfilefunctionfile filerelativePath path dfdresolvefile THIS IS OUR PROBLEM errorHandler else if entryisDirectory Here on the marked lines it resolves to a single file while in other parts of the function it resolves to a list of files When we change the marked line to dfdresolve file it works in our test case So does anyone know why this inconsistency exists and what would break if one fixes it Hello I saw some issues with rotating images after uploading and realized that most are old issues I have the same problem I need to insert some code snippet or just the setting that exists in the script is enough I use the default script setting I honestly do not know what to do In the script example the image appears normal In my script the image is rotated Any suggestion I download the latest version of iOS I noticed the script is not working I can choose the image but after hitting start upload the app do not upload the image I connected my iPhone to MAC I noticed the following Javascript error displayed after choosing the image and before clicking start upload loadimageminjs

latest xampp the sound preview only works before the upload but not as soon as the file is on the server Video preview doesnt work anywhere either before upload or after that for me On both cases instead of the preview I get an empty tdspan classpreviewspantd what should I look at Is there any place I can see videosound preview working Image preview is working fine Hello When I use the Simple version of the uploader with just the Select files and progress bar it looks like nothing is happening when I upload a file I am using IE in its app mode rather than its desktop mode The complete

responseText status statusText error With the latest beta of iOS the plugin is not working for me at all even the Basic demo The photo picker does not register selections as you tap on photos If you tap hold on a thumbnail you get new options for Copy and Hide photo aug pm This completely basic fileinput demo does continue to work on Beta There seems to be a problem with the plugin and the Android browser version Tested the demo with the Android browser and it is not possible to upload images which are already on the phone but if you take a new picture it works Everything is fine in Chrome Anyone else experiencing the same It seems really weird that it works with a new picture but not old ones Not logical that there should be any difference I use firefox and when I am trying to upload more than files of approximately mb each the browser is crashing The same is working fine in Chrome In Opera the plugin always uploads one or two files less but does not crash Sometimes uploads files sometimes files Its weird
