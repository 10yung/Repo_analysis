 Issue Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration orgapachemavenpluginsmaventoolchainsplugin toolchain execution default phase validate Short description New install Maven update pomxml error happens Environment Operating system and version windows Java version Red version groupIdorgred groupId artifactIdred parentartifactId version version Help me Hi everyone I using Ant Media Server But record stream VoD file very large I want config record stream file about minutes per file Please help me config or implement it It would be nice if Red or its Pro version could support jsmpeg I think this can be doneachieved with a Red webapp Chinese CDN providers have video CDN services supporting jsmpeg and western CDN services have yet to follow or even take notice It should be fairly easy to implement and latencywise its comparable to WebRTC with much less complexity I have managed to modify securityPlugin from red plugins collection to filter broadcasters based on IP address However when I tested publishing using nanoStreams publishing app on iOS I managed to get past the security despite the logs showing it should have failedbeen rejected by the server This does not seem to happen with other RTMP publishing tools I tested Environment Operating system and version Ubuntu Linux LTS Java version openjdk version LTS OpenJDK Runtime Environment build LTS OpenJDK Bit Server VM build LTS mixed mode sharing Red version Expected behavior It should reject the publishers without any exception thrown in the logs Actual behavior nanoStream manages to publish on Red server despite being prohibited Affects latest Red Pro too Steps to reproduce Start Red with modified securityPlugin Add to list of allowed publisher IP Stream from other IP using nanoStream RTMP publisher The RTMP URL is now live Logs Issue Flash player is required for demos Short description Unable to launch demo without flashplayer Environment Operating system and version Windows Pro Java version latest Red version latest Expected behavior HTML not flash Actual behavior Flash is required to view demos Documentation for demos is also suspect but Flash Steps to reproduce Install Java set javahome install and run Red discover you cant access anything because of legacy software requirements and need to install flash try to enter an issue in GitHub Logs Place logs on pastebin or elsewhere and put links here uhm I dont know what logs you need NOTE Im not a programmer Im the guy who helps users get programs to run This looks promising but the open source project has an incredibly steep learning curve to get off the ground Feature request Short description As Flash has been almost completely removed from the browsers there is a need to be able to take control of and over rtmp protocol using other browser methods Browsers dont allow socket connections therefore a direct to RTMP communication from the browser is not possible Connecting to a red application directly using JavaScript could be done using WebSocket interface of the browser NetConnectionSharedObject wrappers could be created Stream could be accessed through httpflv hack or exposed through WebSocket too and decoded with FLVjs which already supports this tunneling method Environment x Operating system and version Any x Java version Any x Red version Future Expected behavior Using projects such as FLVjs we should be able to connect and play live streams From that project features HTTP FLV low latency live stream playback FLV over WebSocket live stream playback Using WebSocket connection one can emulate the NetConnection behavior of ActionScript There is this project that can already do RTMP WebSocket tunneling through FLVjs HTTP based live streaming through FLVjs HLS Dash What do you think I dont know if you have time or plan any work in this area what would be the steps needed to do this I think a WebSocket connection api with SharedObject plus FLVjs stream playback support over websocket are all that is needed to make red a jewel for the nonflash future Issue Red memory leak during live h video publish Short description We have two red instance running parallely Memory consumption on one instance is normal with streams However on second instance memory consumption is around with streams When we analysed the heap dump of second instance we found instances of class orgred codecIVideoStreamCodecFrameData We suspect that these are not garbage collected So it total these objects are consuming GB of heap Environment Operating system and version Ubuntu Java version java Red version v M Expected behavior Heap memory usage should be same on both the red instances Actual behavior Heap memory usage grows for sometime and contains stale zero size objects Steps to reproduce Stream more than RTMPS stream continuously Issue The red threads enter in infinite loop and consumes cpu Short description When RTMP client disconnects it is not able to clear the session buffer and while trying to do so it enters in infinite loop due to incorrect logic in RTMPProtocolDecoderjava decodebuffer Environment Operating system and version Ubuntu Java version java Red version Expected behavior Session should be disconnected and all resources released Actual behavior Session disconnects but enters in infinite loop Who can tell me Q Issue Short description I cant find these info Could you tell me how to get it Environment Operating system and versionMac Java versionopenjdk version Red version release Expected behavior get query string like paramsOne or user Actual behavior I cant find any info about query string like paramsOne or user Steps to reproduce use my custom ApplicationAdapter and registerStreamPublishSecurity public boolean isPublishAllowedIScope
