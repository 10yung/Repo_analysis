Hello there It has been a long time since I started working on this project I learned a lot and met great people At no time comes to think that people could use this API for commercial purposes since my goal was to build an API for other uses as personal bot assistant remote control for domestic stuff cool things in general And although sporadically I will continue with the development of the API in a personal and private way I will no longer update the API or give more support of it in Github at least for now Im looking for other projects to learn new things Regards mgp
