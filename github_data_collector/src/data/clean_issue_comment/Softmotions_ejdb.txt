 Where have gone C NET binding Previously there was Softmotionsejdbcsharp which was deprecated in favor of official ejdb C NET binding but I cant see it anywhere in repo nor official site I havent found any official announcements about its destiny node bindings use normal numbers for ids but it breaks when id is bigger than Suggested solution would be to use BigInt for all ids this change would bump required node version to x is Active LTS so this change shouldn t be a problem I tried to write my own python bindings Its the first time Ive neededwanted to write bindings from scratch smile using the precompiled ejdb and the headers after compiling the project from source but I havent been able to get this all working using cython or cffi I also started to try and add a new binding into the project and its build tools incase that was easier but my C IDE JetBrains CLion doesnt like the current project layout something about the include paths for static compilation include ejdb iowowiwkvh rubs it the wrong way So for now Im just going to put my polite request for python bindings into the issue tracker in the hopes someone else has the time to work it out or knows how and has the time to do it Binding for Chicken Scheme dialect
