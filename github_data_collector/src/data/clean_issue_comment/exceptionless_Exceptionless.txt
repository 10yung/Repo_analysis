elasticsearch version is and run in the same enviroment But it doesnot seems have problems Please let me know which other information you need and how I can obtain it Im trying to move away from an older version of selfhosted Exceptionless and I see that you are now using a dockercompose approach Thats fantastic However I cant get the setup to build on Windows without using Dockers underthecovers Linux VM If I use linuxcow instead the compilation of the csproj stuff fails Id rather not take the performance hit of running a VM on my VM that will run Docker containers so I tried Linux as the host OS instead I had to tweak the tag for the exceptionlesselasticsearch image in dockercomposeyml it specifies elasticsearch which does not exist and anything but elasticsearch throws errors during startup about failing to build indexes but I did get it to build and I did get it to run However when I configure an LDAP connection user registration fails with SystemDirectoryServices is not supported on this platform I realize thats a fair amount of random info but heres what Im getting at How do I build this on Windows using linuxcow Can I If not will LDAP login ever be supported on a Linux host OS No logs will be recorded every day at am Hello Is it possible to filter events via the client configuration based upon a specific tag I would like to not log any events that has a specific tag like we can do for the log level or the type Thanks look my docker compose log rootDWKUbuntuhomeduweninkExceptionless dockercompose up Building api Step FROM mcrmicrosoftcomdotnetcoresdk

goal idxparentr cb e eeb b b a e e net core IHostBuilder does not have IApplicationBuilder how can I register the service to the application x Serve the SPA app files from the Web project x Pass the version into the grunt build to show at the bottom of the UI x Make it so that doing dotnet publish will build the ClientApp and add the files to the output x Clean up some old dependencies like puppeteer x Single web docker image Get rid of UI docker image x Running dockercompose up build will build the backend and client apps into a single image Add flag for collector mode where we dont serve the UI and possibly dont serve other endpoints besides just the collector ones Add support for HTTPS If pfx file exists then load it and enable HTTPS redirection using new aspnetcore middleware Add getting started documentation saying that for dev you need to run npm start before running the app AspNetCore Angular support doesnt work with Angular x Add vscode tasks for updating the docker images and for running the ClientApp serve task that watches for changes Dynamically serve the appconfig from the API to set things like BaseURL and ExceptionlessApiKey
