 I am using macOS Mojave with MATLABR b Is there a way I can use a different gcc version than the Xcode one I have trained an myself cascade model using authors pcamat But i think it is unreasonable how can i generate myself pcamat Hello sorry if its lame issue but when I try to compile or make I got an error using mex Error in cascadecompile line evalmexcmd Error in compile line cascadecompileoptverb I really dont know what to do to get the demo working i would love id you can help me After getting compile the files the demo run provides this output shown below demo input image press any key to continue continuing car model visualization press any key to continue continuing Error using resize Requested x x GB array exceeds maximum array size preference Creation of arrays greater than this limit may take a long time and cause MATLAB to become unresponsive See array size limit or preference panel for more information Error in featpyramid line scaled resizeim sc i Error in imgdetect line pyra featpyramidinput model Error in demotest line dets boxes imgdetectim model Error in demo line test jpg model Hi everyone I successfully trained a model on my own dataset but when try to uses cascade detection I got an error about pca score files How can i generate socres for my dataset to use in cascade detection The following link is not available anymore did you move the project somewhere else I encountered the error Can you please help me out The line was in Error in featpyramid line scaled resizeim sc i I encountered an error when learning from my own data I think it relates to the parallel computing part Error using parallelfunction line All workers aborted during execution of the parfor loop Error in trainposlatent line parfor k thisbatchsize Error in train line poslatentt iter model pos fgoverlap numfp Error in pascaltrain line modelsi trainmodelsi sposi negsmall false false Error in pascal line model pascaltraincls n note The client lost connection to worker This might be due to network problems or the interactive communicating job might have errored I am using ubuntu with matlab b I did check the log file but didnt figure it out whats the cause Any ideas Thanks Im getting the error matlabvocdpmgdetectfconvssemetacc fatal error boostpreprocessorrepeathpp file not found include externalboostpreprocessorrepeathpp I see the file is there so I am curious if there is something in the setup on the Mac that I am missing
