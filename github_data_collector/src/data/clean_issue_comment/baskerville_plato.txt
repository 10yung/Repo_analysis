Ive noticed when I define words in a pdf they are often just one Levenshtein away from a dictionary entry eg the pluralization of credence credences Fuzzy search is a great solution for this but the fuzzy option does not stay enabled after it has been used Given that a Levenshtein distance of is fairly conservative and will only rarely result in a false positive I propose to make an configurable option to have fuzzy search on by default I wonder what has higher probability getting a false positive from the dictionary or users searching for words that are just one Levenshtein away Plurals definitely seem to be common Im not sure if this is a good idea in practice however First of all that you for your reader It is much cleaner and faster than internal Kobos one It should become the standard one hands down I was wondering is there any chance of adding FB support It is rather simple XML format with no DRM And quite popular in among Cyrillic readers Could it become possible in one of upcoming versions Many thanks in advance Enabling together Invert Colors and Make Bitonal glitches only one half is bitonal and the other half has its colors inverted Taking a screenshot of it wont show the behaviour you can see it in this video Hi Just a feature description I would like to see one day Koreader uses an interesting way to sync progress across devices I guess it would be great for plato And the selfhostable server Koreader host their own server for users without any sysadmin knowledge Once again thanks for your great job Hi One great feature Koreader has is the ability to access OPDS libraries do you plan to add such a feature Thank for your work once again Beforehand thank you for a great software Compiles clean installs clean smooth My favorite reader on the kobo glo HD Applications are also great Sketch is very useful and works better than an equivalent on my iphone Was wondering do you plan on adding new applications A reversi for instance Could try to make one myself even if Id have to translate my c knowledge to rust which requires some time It would be great to have thumbnail previews in the book list as in nickel I guess it is a reduced version of the first page a big Thank you to baskerville for plato and other great contributions to free software Thanks again I would like to know if you are going to support translations anytime soon Not a big deal to have the ui in english but it would be great
