After upgrading an app to Expo react reactnative ScrollableTabView causes the app crash reactnativescrollabletabview Error Maximum update depth exceeded This can happen when a component repeatedly calls setState inside componentWillUpdate or componentDidUpdate React limits the number of nested updates to prevent infinite loops

ViewPagerAndroid is not used and causes an error in Expo Hello let the user specify the font size for the text component in the tab Thanks js Default allowFontScalingtrue DefaultTabBar allowFontScalingfalse ScrollableTabBar allowFontScalingfalse AndroidX reactnativeviewpager Thanks for reporting a issue In order to be able to help out I need you to provide a reproduction repository That means you should provide a reachable repository which reproduces the issue youre experiencing This will greatly improve the chance for you to get the bug fixed and me to be able to find it x I have searched existing issues x I am using the latest scrollable tab view version Describe your issue in detail This isnt an issue sotosay but more of a start of a discussion around using on iOS as well as Android instead of ScrollView Im unaware as to if theres been a reason historically for not using this and if so then please close this or perhaps theres just not been the time and its on the list of things to do Im aware that this project has only been using reactnativecommunitys ViewPager since v and previously ViewPagerAndroid was used explaining the OS split but if were able to use ViewPager on both that could bring benefits to the project Itd be great to discuss this Steps to Reproduce Required Let us know how to reproduce the issue Include a code sample or issue will be closed As this isnt an issue as such there are no replication steps However if its decided to move forward with this Im happy to bring my patch file into a fork of this repo and open a PR for review Expected Behavior Write what you thought would happen That both platforms use ViewPager now it isnt only for Android Actual Behavior Write what happened Include screenshots if needed iOS still uses ScrollView and Android keeps all the fun Fix I solved build error due to version problem Now the Example is working well and I will try to create additional example in the future Fix broken URL of demo section
