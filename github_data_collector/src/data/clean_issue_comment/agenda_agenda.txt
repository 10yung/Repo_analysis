repeat interval I have a job that ran twice I do not understand why I check in the DB and the job only appears once this is his repeat interval nextRunAt ISODate T Z repeatInterval In the log I see that the job run in these times T Z info executeJob params id T Z info executeJob params id this is the only job that behavior like this please help This PR is related to We cannot solve one problem and create another Job processing is called from processJobResult so calling it directly in runOrRetry is unnecessary Its necessary because without jobProcessing after each run of a job jobs in the jobQueue might not be able to run on time jobProcessing isnt always called within processJobResult check the first line of the function My fix to the issue unhandledRejection is to revert the code to the old version of Agenda We should not pop job in runOrRertry function because it makes returnNextConcurrencyFreeJob pointless the conconrrent free jobs will never be used The reason that runOrRetry is an internal function in jobProcessing is because it wants to use the job in the lexical scope Will add examples later This PR contains the following updates Package Type Update Change
