is it possible to output the qr code as an svg file Ive been using this software in a project for a year now Your software is high quality I cant release the version I am using because I made many Lexidor specific assumptions However I like this package so much that I decided to port it a second time and give back to you Hacklang HHVM data arg seems to be string Can i pass an Uint Array That would bypass this line TypeScript Declaration File correction so it is used const qr QRCode qrcodedefaultthisqrVersion thiserrorCorrectionLevel Some issues with the code To avoid a passbyreference warning in php in the function addData the casestatement should be something like this the new as a separate call case QRMODENUMBER d new QRNumberdata thisaddDataImpld break case QRMODEALPHANUM d new QRAlphaNumdata thisaddDataImpld break case QRMODE BITBYTE d new QR BitBytedata thisaddDataImpld break case QRMODEKANJI d new QRKanjidata thisaddDataImpld break When coding a string like I got an error PHP Fatal error code length overflow in qrcodephp on line I find the very weird and the very small I use this as a call qr QRCodegetMinimumQRCodemyexampleurlQRERRORCORRECTLEVELH Is this a bug Hello Id like to request that you add support for importing this library using native ES modules like so js import qrcode from I would benefit from this when experimenting with QR codes locally without a build process I would have created a pull request but I am not sure how to feature detect and export the library Theoretically all you need to do is to add export default but in browsers where ES native modules are not supported yet this would have caused an error to be thrown At the same time export cannot be stated conditionally so feature detection for native ES modules and then export doesnt seem to be possible I know you are not using a build process so I am not going to suggest you create two variants one with ES module support and one without because this is not a pressing issue at all can always just use script and find what I need on windowqrcode but I am interested if you have any thoughts on how this could be achieved without introducing a build process php echo qrcodetoHtml echo qrcodetoSvg According to the typings from qrcodedts I should be able to do the following since the export is an instance of the QRCodeFactory interface which has the call signature typeNumber TypeNumber errorCorrectionLevel ErrorCorrectionLevel QRCode typescript import as qrGenerator from qrcodegenerator function myFunc const qr qrGenerator H qraddDataHello world qrmake However the typescript compiler returns Error Cannot call a namespace qrGenerator Alternatively using qrcode like this compiles without a hitch typescript import as qrGenerator from qrcodegenerator function myFunc const qr qrcode H qraddDataHello world qrmake But it throws a runtime error Uncaught ReferenceError qrcode is not defined Added a parameter for function renderTo dContext to render the qrcode to designated position in canvas context instead of the left top corner renderTo dContextcontext CanvasRenderingContext D cellSize number position x number y number void
