markjjo Please edit and publish markjjo For you to edit It looks like retention labels are misused as sensitivity labels in this example This is very confusing and I assume it has to do with the current limitations of DLP policies for sensitivity labels Retention labels shouldnt be used to classify content based on sensitivty as shown in this example Document Details Do not edit this section

PowerShell Module Browser PSMB I really heavlly rely on this web service to find Microsoft PowerShell modules But I noticed the MSCommerce module has not been searchable on PSMB Could you add the MSCommerce module to the module lists If it is not intentionally listed could you tell me the reason Thanks This documentation is worded such where it seems end users should be able to see messages classified as Phishing and only high confidence Phishing are held in administrative quarantine Support has advised that currently both Phishing and High Confidence Phishing are held in administrative

GitHub Login MSFTTracyP Microsoft Alias tracyp In the Using a label as a condition in a DLP policy section the Retention Label example uses Confidential as a label name since this word is more typically associated with Sensitivity labels I would like to suggest that a different example be used to decrease the chance for confusion Retention and Sensitivity are very different but related concepts and we need to keep them separated Document Details Do not edit this section It is required for docsmicrosoftcom GitHub issue linking ID b ac da c f ba efae b b b Version Independent ID cdcee

newer but I cant perform any of these steps Below I will point out the issues I see If we can lets clear this up as a recent rash of new malware is aiming for this specific vector to gain persistent data access I have tried these instructions using the old and new admin center layout The problems are not related to that Specifically this section Steps for finding signs of this attack Security and Compliance does not exist in my tenant I have a Security option and a Compliance option under Admin centers in my left bar on the page Microsoft admin center If I click compliance or security I do not have a Search and Investigation optionchoice I also dont understand you use of the word node That word should be removed However if I click the Security option then choose More Options then I will see a Office security and compliance center In that Center I have an optionchoice for Search but still no Search and Investigation Under Search when I expand it I see an option for Audit log search Please bold Audit log search in your statement as that is the complete name You just have Audit log in bold and not the word search You do not create a search You are searching Please remove that word First you leave the default options Activities to Show results for all activities Next you leave the Users field blank so it will search for all users You may want to point out they should adjust the date as by default it goes back days Click the Search button now we see results on right You state to filter it OK Which fields am I filtering on First step is I have to click the Filter button to see the fields come up Then where do I put your filter parameters I would assume in Activity Item or Detail Also put in quotes what you want me to type do you want add in there Are the parameters you put correct I approved a new app and did a search for those two settings but the results were blank How do you Examine the extended properties I assume you mean click and entry and the details window opens from the right Then expand the More Information section to look for that field Finally you state at the top this should be looked at weekly How about creating a New alert policy Also if we are to check it weekly probably need good instructions so that we can Document Details Do not edit this section It is required for docsmicrosoftcom GitHub issue linking ID d a b a a e d Version
