When I am using flip transition on iPhone Plus its fluctuates while flipping In certain circumstances the main view becomes detached from the window after a transition If I try to update the parent viewcontroller due to orientation changes for example When I come back it appears and then immediately disappears after viewDidAppear Occasionally the same is true for viewcontroller I move towards The viewcontroller appears then immediately disappears after transition Any thoughts It would be great to have all this transitions as CustomSegues can not drag back like ios is it because of storyboard nimation are just simple CABasicAnimations This is related to The ADTransitionView within ADTransitionController was laying out using the view s frame not its bounds on iOS this was causing the transition view to be positioned points below the top of the view if the navigation bar is hidden I have the following configuration UIViewController placed in UINavigationController which is placed in UITabBarController My view is added as subview to the view of UIViewController and has constraints to fill the space between navigation bar and tab bar Everything works if I do not use transitions ADTransitionController does not work When I activate ADTransitionController the animation itself works fine but when its completed I find that my view has been resized the new height is smaller by points the height of Tab bar It looks like ADTransitionController is responsible for the resizing of my view but I cannot understand the reason and find where it happens Could you help me Thanks in advance
