While trying to build the docker image on an arm system numpy and scipy both failed because they were unable to find the Cython module Im not sure if this is a peculiarity of arm builds or if it would apply to other architectures but in order to get it to build I had to add cython to the Dockerfile see my changes here Not even sure if I went about fixing that appropriately since Im still relatively new to Docker but in case its helpful for others building the image I figured Id open an issue Im a new enginerI did not use the two language mix programingwhat program tools for this project how to start the server Hello Im starting a find server in my linux computer but im getting a very bad accuracy Is there any different setup I need to make for find server to work properly Here my docker run command docker run p p v homeUSERFINDDATAdata e MQTTADMINgerson e MQTTPASSabc e MQTTSERVERlocalhost e MQTTEXTERNAL e MQTTPORT name find server d t schollzfind Im using find documentation from Same as and The usual solution to this something like A Dockerfile for each server ai main and dockercomposeyml would make development and deployment easier Instead of rebuilding the whole system via docker every development interation we would only build the parts that have been modified Hey guys so there is no where in the code where i can tweak the tracking intervals can somebody guide me to where i can tweak that to have an almost real time tracking Im not sure what your binary needs but if you know using multi stage docker builds will help to make the docker image very small If you tell me im glad to help My setup consists of currently two WiFi passive scanners and some devices that do active scanning For my laptop this means that I have an entry archclub which I set using find cliscanner and another wifi c f c Is there any intent to have kind of an aliasing system where two names can designate the same device It might also enable me to assign an alias to passively tracked devices which only get their MAC address as identifier now I was using the JSON from the documentation in a test apparently it contained a trailing comma which is disallowed in JSON and some trailing white space Installed the FIND server from source on a raspberry pi running raspbian buster following the instructions on the official document here When running the test suite the analysis fails Output from AI server is rm rf pycache rm rf srcpycache rm rf venv export FLASKAPPserverpy export FLASKDEBUG cd src flask run debugger port Serving Flask app serverpy lazy loading Environment production WARNING Do not use the development server in a production environment Use a production WSGI server instead Debug mode on Running on Press CTRLC to quit Restarting with stat Debugger is active Debugger PIN usrlocallibpython distpackagessklearnensembleweightboostingpy DeprecationWarning numpycoreumathtests is an internal NumPy module and should not be imported It will be removed in a future NumPy release from numpycoreumathtests import inner d usrlocallibpython distpackagessklearnensembleweightboostingpy DeprecationWarning numpycoreumathtests is an internal NumPy module and should not be imported It will be removed in a future NumPy release from numpycoreumathtests import inner d serverclassify DEBUG loading rootgosrcgithubcomschollzfind servermaindatazxo qZZbfind ai Jul POST classify HTTP serverclassify DEBUG loading rootgosrcgithubcomschollzfind servermaindatazxo qZZbfind ai Output from main data storage server is INFO PID servergo Run Running on INFO PID servergo func POST datajustsave ms ERROR PID analysisgo AnalyzeSensorData unable to analyze could not find rootgosrcgithubcomschollzfind servermaindatazxo qZZbfind ai INFO PID servergo func POST datajustsave ms ERROR PID analysisgo AnalyzeSensorData unable to analyze could not find rootgosrcgithubcomschollzfind servermaindatazxo qZZbfind ai I have check at the path given and there is no find ai file present there is only an sqlite db file This is the second time I have tried to reinstall the thing from scratch and I encounter the same issue Docker installation hanged for a couple of hours so decided to install it from source
