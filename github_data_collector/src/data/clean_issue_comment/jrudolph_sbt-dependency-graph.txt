 coursier provides an option to print a reversed tree of dependencies your package being the leaves It could be nice to provide this kind of option for tasks like dependencyBrowseTree In its current form sbt dependencyList outputs even the current project module in the list of dependencies which is not really a dependency but a reference to itself Is it possible to exclude this Fixes I already tried sbt module compiledependencyTree or sbt module compiledependencyTree but it still runs every project anyway I would like to generate the dependencies tree of all projects as a file how can I do that Im trying to get around a problem with our dependency tree being truncated as part of a CI task that doesnt have an interactive terminal so uses the character default and is truncating dependency versions This can be replicated pretty easily from the command line stty cols sbt dependencyTree grep jsr info comfasterxmljacksondatatypejacksondatatypejsr Unfortunately the terminal width also affects the output to file which I dont think is intentional stty cols sbt dependencyTreetoFile dependenciestxt info Wrote dependencyTree to dependenciestxt success Total time s completed Aug grep jsr dependenciestxt comfasterxmljacksondatatypejacksondatatypejsr This is an PR adding support to avoid truncating trees in environments without tty and resolves issue simply jline creates an UnsupportedTerminal in environments that do not have a tty but it has a column size of In my projects I often have a very dense graph which just doesnt fit into a x canvas and also this makes the graph a bit more responsive I think itd be a very useful option to filter out all libraryDependencies and just show all the sbt subprojectsmodules Original issue filed at This plugin seems to use sbts internal APIs which are no longer exposed in x series This issue is to fix the same dependencyBrowseGraph info HTML graph written to filehomeddrdsservisiontargetgraphhtml info Opening in browser error javalangUnsupportedOperationException The BROWSE action is not supported on the current platform More info Using SBT x Java KDE Neon HInt In order to open a browser the xdgopen command can be used
