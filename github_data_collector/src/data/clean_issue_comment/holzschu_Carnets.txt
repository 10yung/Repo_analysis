Is there an undo If not it would be a useful editing addition What are the steps to install and enable an nbextension eg code prettify I tried jupyter nbextension but that gave command nbextension not found Is Carnets able to access the microphone to record audio and play it back and the camera for photos and video If so are there examples Once opening a notebook in preview mode cant return to the notebook view I installed your wonderful app last week and discovered when I issue path commands from a notebook I get another user s iCloud path In pwd Out privatevarmobileLibraryMobile DocumentsiCloudAsheKubeCarnetsDocumentswelcome What is going on The notebook is still being saved to my iCloud account Is there a security issue here This is more a question than an issue I was wondering if it is feasible for Carnets to implement Jupyeterlab as opposed to Jupyter and if so what additional capabilities would result This is not a request as there are undoubtedly many more important enhancements that people would like to see but Jupyterlab with its extensibility seems to be the new standard Support the IOS share sheet so that cell content could be sent to other apps and vice versa ie also accept input from other apps to be added as cell content This would make interoperating with editors and apps like Pythonista more seamless than cutpaste How does one access the on screen keyboard to use shortcuts eg selecting multiple cells when in command mode Could you add Scipy to the app I cannot get the installation to function Hello It would be fun to have pyttsx or any other usefull way for TTS Thanks
