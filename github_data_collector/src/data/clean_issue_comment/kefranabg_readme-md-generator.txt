 Capture d e cran a Hi As said in I added functionalty to add funding url Right now it only use URL without type field but if You want I can implement it too Secondly I wasnt sure how this URL should look like in ReadME thats why Im open to potential new requirements Regards Mikolaj User should be able to choose among a list of different README templates These templates would use the same project infos or part of them and display them in a different way Fix Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe When author asked Ive had author with a comma the result was broken Describe the solution youd like If I provide two author separated with a comme it must create lines Describe alternatives youve considered comma semicolon no preference but precise it in the question maybe great project btw you da best For old guys like me that still develop with Maven it would be great to generate the READMEmd from a pomxml instead of a packagejson file New command line option x bash readme x The pomxml must contain some informations such as xml project nameMy Great Projectname descriptionSome useful descriptiondescription url contributors contributor nameBobname contributor contributors licenses license nameMITname license licenses issueManagement url issueManagement project Split readmemdgenerator into multiple packages ang manage them with yarn workspaces Each question would be a plugin that you can easily register You should publish a thin wrapper package named createmarkdownmd with a small bin script Due to the create convention it would qualify as a proper initializer package This would allow usage via npm init readmemd or yarn create readmemd without prior installation Id even go further and name it createreadmemd for a totally awesome yarn create readmemd
