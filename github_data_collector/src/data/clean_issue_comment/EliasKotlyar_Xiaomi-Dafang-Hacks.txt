does not seem to work This also fixes an error in varloglighttpdcgistderrlog when auto night mode is enabled the error is cat cant open systemsdcardconfigautonightconf No such file or directory If anyone has suggestions on what these settings do Id love to add them to the file I just received x Xiaofang S turns out T L I tried to scan the QR codes on the box and at bottom of the camera Both of them have MAC address and model number For example in my hands Xiaofang S T L MAC starts with C model number D C Original Xiaofang MAC starts with CE model number C C And I tried the QR codes from the other T L thread Xiaofang S T L MAC starts with CE model number Y C Xiaofang S T L MAC starts with DC model number D C Should we build a model number database so people can use the model number to

again for other people Hi EliasKotlyar First of all nice work thank you very much for sharing it with all of us Is there any way to rotate or the image I know there is a flip option but it would be interesting also to being able to rotate or In case it is not possible is it very hard to implement it May you consider implement it please Regards Hello Just finished installing the hack on a Wyze V I can access the web gui And video is working But video is lagging badly like seconds I played with video size video format framerate and bitrate Nothing seems to give enough to reduce lagging Any tips Regards Yves Hi Ive configured Zoneminder Ive added the Xiaomipm file and the controls show on screen but when clicking on it the log registers the following error zmcontrol ERR Error check failed Cant connect to certificate verify failed zmcontrolpl Thank you in advance Im trying the advanced install on the original Xiaomi Dafang MB I already installed Uboot bootloader or so does it shows when I boot the firmwaremod it shows UBoot SPL gba eeb Dec but when I format the SDcard on ext format with my ubuntu machine I cant write anything on it Ive chmodded the SD card to in order to be able to write files but then the camera doesnt boots In fact Ive noticed it makes the original boot because the camera starts moving and connects to the last Wifi AP I configured with the official firmware and not to the Wifi AP Ive configured in the wpasupplicant file but I dont know if this is even possible if I flashed the UBoot successfully how can I check it anyways I dont know if theres some fixing needed with permissionsownership Also Ive noticed that uEnv files are different from the standard firmware mod because the paths are different advanced install rootdevmmcblk p firmwaremodrootdevmtdblock Anyway the firmwaremod requires the uEnvtxt at root but the advanced install shows uEnvdafang txt at root What is the path should I use I consider myself tech savvy and the instructions are pretty straightforward but I cant figure it out to work At last the uEnv files are showing some IP addresses which I find unacceptable in an open firmware like this I recently tried to connect to a other samba server for footage storage br So I edited the motion config file and then rebooted Weird enough the camera took a unusal long time to reboot and then did not connect to the samba share The samba share is accessible form my Fedora desktop and macBook without any problems br Next I started playing around with fstab and cifs which does not work at all So after sometime I played around with smbclient Evertime I did something with the smbclient I got this error br paramscOpenConfFile Unable to open configuration file usrsambaconfigsmbconfNo such file or directory Cant load usrsambaconfigsmbconf run testparm to debug it loadclientcodepage filename usrsambalibcodepagescodepage does not exist loadunicodemap filename usrsambalibcodepagesunicodemap does not exist loadunicodemap filename usrsambalibcodepagesunicodemapISO does not exist Is this normal or did the smbconf go missing Ive installed the hack in my dafang and all is working well I cant view the recorded file in the sd via http or ftp The only mode to view the file was by the removed sd in my pc Was present a semplification mode in the hack to view the file via remote I have Xiaomi DaFang and it has very good night vision via Xiaomi app But when I see over RTSP with firmware is just a big black noise I tried everything IRLED IRCUT onoff etc but I cant get good night quality What am I doing wrong
