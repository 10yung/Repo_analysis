 Logcat Hello It seems the main class of this library is extending from androidxcardviewwidgetCardView class Therefore its not an actual toolbar and cannot be used in coordinatorlayout alongside with scroll or recycler views I had to do abnormal usage of paddingTop in xml of those views in order to prevent toolbar overlap Im using the Nestedscrollview How can I apply that library If someone knows how to listen to ListView scroll please contribute to this project Ive used all possible scroll listeners and no one workedwas effective For those who are wondering why supporting ListView is necessary since RecyclerView is already supported remember that its used in PreferenceFragment
