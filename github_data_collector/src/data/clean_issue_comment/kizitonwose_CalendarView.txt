 When I scroll through the calendar sometimes the month header cells as squashed multiple of them into a single day The number of squashed cells varies The interval of this bug varies as well My CalendarView setup XAML comkizitonwosecalendarviewCalendarView androidididunitAttendancePlanCalendarHeader androidlayoutwidthmatchparent androidlayoutheightwrapcontent androidbackgroundcolorbackgroundwhite appcvdayViewResourcelayoutcalendarweekday appcvmonthHeaderResourcelayoutcalendarheader appcvinDateStylenone appcvoutDateStylenone appcvmaxRowCount appcvhasBoundariestrue appcvorientationhorizontal appcvscrollModecontinuous Month header binder class MonthViewContainerview View ViewContainerview val legendLayout viewlegendLayout calendarViewmonthHeaderBinder object MonthHeaderFooterBinderMonthViewContainer override fun createview View MonthViewContainerview override fun bindcontainer MonthViewContainer month CalendarMonth Setup each header day text if we have not done that already if containerlegendLayouttag null containerlegendLayouttag monthyearMonth val locale LocalegetDefault containerlegendLayoutchildrenmap it as TextView forEachIndexed index tv tvtext daysOfWeek index getDisplayNameTextStyleSHORT localetoUpperCaselocale monthyearMonth NOTE Not the entire header all week days is visible Not sure if thats important Pretty much the idea is to have a calendar that has a fixed dayWidth and doesnt care whether or week days are visible EDIT Fixed by changing few attributes as follows appcvinDateStylefirstMonth appcvoutDateStyleendOfRow Also dates were not matching localized names until I changed the following attributes as well appcvhasBoundariesfalse No idea why any of it worked TBH I thought setting hasBoundaries to true in combination with settings both in and out date styles to none is reasonable since there will be no in and out dates And you dont want any in and out dates when doing a continuous horizontal scroll right Is there any way scroll progress could be added to the monthScrollListener callback I want to animate the month text TextView I have in my header based on the scroll progress paged mode I add some helper classes to support JalaliHijriShamsi calendar which used in IranAfghanistan Furthermore I provide an example to show developers who want to implement Jalali calendar in their apps how it would be used Moreover CalendarView tests are updated to cover Jalali calendar You can Read more about JalaliHijri calendar link is also added to ReadMe I added the CalendarView in a ConstraintLayout which I set as the view in a DialogFragment When the dialog is shown you see the calendar but then the calendar flashes Additionally if you scroll to the next month that month also flashes After the initial flash upon loading it is not seen again until a new instance of the dialog is created The CalendarView has its width and height set to wrapcontent and the width is constrained to a start and end guideline widgets to act as margin The flash also occurs if you instead just add layoutmargin attributes Ive recently added the Chucker library to my app and got this build error Execution failed for task appmergeDebugJavaResource A failure occurred while executing comandroidbuildgradleinternaltasksWorkersActionFacade More than one file was found with OS independent path METAINFlibraryreleasekotlinmodule It turns out that both CalendarView and Chucker are creating the same METAINFlibraryreleasekotlinmodule file Captura de Pantalla a les Ive opened an issue on Chucker with more details about the error and some solutions While there is a way to fix this it would be nice that to fix the issue on the library itself which would avoid having every user apply the same fix Three styles from the librarys sample project Google Calendar appAirbnb appFlight Schedule app Google Calendar app app schedule app
