I did you the docker image Hi first of all thanks for your work and time to create a simple application for managing mails and newsletter I have got a question on campaigns and sending mails on a scheduled time If I create a new campaign and configure date and time it is not saved when clicking on the continue button After klicking continue again the campaign is save as draft If I edit this campaign the schedule is not set If I do configure it again I can tell schedule and it is set to status schedule But it will never be executed There is some note under schedule that is always the same Scheduled Tue Jan AM is that okay I scheduled it on another time today but this note would not tell that its schedule correct Do I am something wrong or does the application need more planning time in the future I am only waiting minutes for executing tasks in the future If I can assist you in any way please tell me Thanks Hello Is there a way to send via api an mail to a list with a predefined template and given params I have a template with multiple placeholder message ticketLink title incidentid and i wish to automate email sending in a external script which will consume the api with theses params listNameOrID templateNameOrID params title incident on dhcp message there is an incident linkTicket incidentid Can i achieve this with the last alpha First off thank you so much for open sourcing this tool Is the list subscription status currently used for anything It seems to be for double optin but it looks like it isnt used yet Ive set up my mailing list with double optin by only adding a list to a subscriber after they confirm but thats a bit annoying because theres no subscription management page before I added users to the list so I cant use the builtin UI to let users wipe their data before they confirm Hi In a test campaign I can set in From address field B cassine becassineexamplecom If I do that the received email shows From UTF qBC A cassine becassineexamplecom myhostexamplecom So I get in From the username weirdly written on the accent part and the host which did not need to be written here Therefore I can also set in From address field Becassine becassineexamplecom If I do that without accent the received email shows From Becassine becassineexamplecom And it is correct Can you fix it Thanks HLFH Currently only the subscribers API is documented while there are many more handlers to document The docs are published at and the source is at Will you use Postfix for handling bounces tailing and parsing its log just like cuttlefish does or implementing a full golang smtp server with gosmtp
