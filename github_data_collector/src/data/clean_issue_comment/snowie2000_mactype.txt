Aside from Internet Explorer Internet Explorer Internet Explorer and Microsoft Office FrontPage the only browser I can think of where its possible to use GDI rendering is Firefox ESR bit But as the user browses the Internet that browser eventually deceives the user Firefox ESR bit does not always use GDI rendering even with hacks Highlighted the portions where Firefox ESR bit is not using GDI rendering Is there a way to make a modern browser actually always use GDI rendering Proof CMDER is able to disable ClearType The same ini is able to exclude pixel fonts in Windows A technically and

original font So is still true that there is no way to get MacType to work with Electron apps on Windows I am using one of the selections that has DirectWrite support turned on Clean Sharp but my Electronbased apps still look terrible on Windows I hate DirectWrite rendering while GDI rendering is perfect The reason this test is the most important aspect of the rendering engine is that it tests the gammacorrectness of the renderer If it fails the test then the gamma is incorrect meaning the antialiasing in the rendered text is unsmooth I was able to find a configuration that passes the test in GDI Gamma set to was correctly applied to the renderer and it passed just like standard GDI does However in DirectWrite the test fails Of course that means unsmooth text and I cant possibly unsee that major flaw DirectWrite was always broken like that and its such a dealbreaker that I dont the recent versions of Firefox and Chrome because the text looks horrible And the weird thing is if I adjust the MacType rendering settings it does affect the DirectWrite rendering in a weird way if I reduce gamma DirectWrite reduces gamma as well but it still looks very different from GDI and its obviously incorrect All I wanted is to permanently delete DirectWrite from Microsoft Windows and have everything display in GDI The mactype latest beta vertion does not render the font in Microsoft
