Hi Team I was trying to use Minicap in our project Iam able to run the Minicap successfully and my device rendered in the browser But iam unable to perform any action in the device Also i read document saying Minitouch is required to control devices Now please guide me how i should merge both minicap and minitouch together add product model device and transportId parse result return Hi sorccu this is a separate PR just for converting the Gruntfile from coffeescript to javascript Hi sorccu I saw that your grunt execmocha was failing so I thought I would help by fixing it This just moves the mocha call to the packagejson Hi sorccu I have tried a different method whereby I have converted the coffeescript files to javascript using grunt I have removed the coffeescript dependencies from the project and have replaced coffeelint with jshint How does this one look to you Hi sorccu I started on the conversion of the coffeescript files into javascript I dont know if every conversion is valid but I am open to helping out as much as I can This can be easily done by adding g option to the installation command see Googles documentation BTW I use TypeScript a lot and I would like to request for TypeScript support XD I set up a adbkit environment on my local PC there are three devices in my adb connect Actually B Y T LX and localhost are one device When I run adb s B Y T LX bugreport hellozip the command run successfully But when I run adb s localhost bugreport hellozip error occurred Failed to get bugreportz version bugreportz v returned code If the device does not run Android or above try adb bugreport instead If I adb shell into localhost bugreport can runs successfully So maybe there is any str or other params were added in adbkit commands I read adb source code and find where the error occurs Java if status bugzversionempty Dbugreportz v results statusd stdouts stderrs status bugzoutputcstr bugzversioncstr if argc Device does not support bugreportz if called as adb bugreport just falls out to the flatfile version fprintfstderr Failed to get bugreportz version which is only available on devices running Android or later nTrying a plaintext bug report instead n return SendShellCommandbugreport false But if user explicitly asked for a zipped bug report fails instead otherwise calling bugreport would generate a lot of output the user might not be prepared to handle fprintfstderr Failed to get bugreportz version bugreportz v returned s code d n If the device does not run Android or above try adb bugreport instead n bugzoutputcstr status return status status js if none of the server is started this starts a adb server on port const client adbcreateClient port this fails to connect as it attempts to reach port and only is started await clientconnecthostip
