I installed goto recently on WSL It didnt work from the first try So I installed it myself in a different directory where I put most of my global scripts But when I investigated the goto script I realized that it checks if you have a bashrc file but also checks if you have zshrc However if it finds bashrc it adds the the sourcing script to it and ignore zshrc I have tested the script you guys used to decide which file to use and here is the output DESKTOPC TQ G testingStuff if f bashrc then then echo bashrc exists then fi bashrc exists DESKTOPC TQ G testingStuff if f zshrc then echo zshrc exists fi zshrc exists DESKTOPC TQ G testingStuff if f bashrc then echo bashrc exists elif f zshrc then echo zshrc exists fi bashrc exists I think the correct behavior in this case is to add it to zshrc since IF zsh is used it usually ignores bashrc and uses its own zshrc BREAKING CHANGE The default config file has moved to XDGCONFIGHOMEgoto If the XDGCONFIGHOME variable is configured that should be used as the default storage location commonly config This has become the newer standard location for dotfiles and config files for Linux applications to try keeping the home path cleaner Still allowing an override is good but the default should be changed to be more compliant with the Linux standard I can install goto without having any problems via brew but it wont start brew install goto usrlocalCellargoto files KB built in seconds If I try starting it goto zsh command not found goto With MacOs Apple changed the default shell on MacOS to zsh Maybe thats the problem I tried solving this issue by doing this without success OS MacOS Shell zsh default shell goto Version newest version I get via brew install goto never had such a problem with any brew package bug frog
