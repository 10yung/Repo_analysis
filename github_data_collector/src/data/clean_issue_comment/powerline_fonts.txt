JetBrains has just released a new opensource font called JetBrains Mono I was asked in a powerline issue to report this here Im running Ubuntu with regolith After apt install fontspowerline a lot of fonts didnt show up so I had to install manually from the repository but even after that the pause symbol in the spotify segment would not load so I ended up manually declaring it Hi Community Objective I would like to introduce one line copy and paste way like nvm install script for those nonwindow users As the original section requires multiple lines to copy and paste Here are my idea and a simple sh script Hope this idea can save time for developers when they are setting up a new environment How do u think powerlinefonts console curl o sh nvm console curl o bash I downloaded the whole repo as a zip and opened the ttf files in Font Bookapp The install prompt appears but after clicking Install Font no fonts called Anonymous Pro for Powerline or Anonymice Powerline are listed anywhere and the font called Anonymous Pro is missing the additional glyphs that would probably be helpful if one has no font manager or so The fonts are in the public domain Thank you for your work Hi I used Fedoras package manager DNF to install powerlinefonts but the fonts dont appear in my fonts list Any idea what could be causing this See for reference
