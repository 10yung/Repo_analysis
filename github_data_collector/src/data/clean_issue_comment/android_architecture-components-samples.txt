 Hi is it safe to observe a LiveData instance stored in ViewModel directly from a View This is what im doing its working but i dont know if iam missing some implications of doing this BindingAdapterstateLive fun T AsyncLayoutsetStateLivestateLive LiveDataResourceT stateLiveapply val observer ObserverResourceT Observer it itapply if isLoading state AsyncLayoutStateLOADING returnObserver state if success AsyncLayoutStateSUCCESS else AsyncLayoutStateERROR observeForeverobserver onDestroyView stateLiveremoveObserverobserver questionWhy replaceremove instead of addhide inside FragmentNavigatorthank you OK so the main problem here is that using the sample code all fragments are created to ON RESUME State so this means if I have fragments with networking on behind or with another stuff the calls are going to be made the databinding is going to do their works etc any workaround for this problem Or is this a Feature of Android Navigation Component webview layout always recreates when navigating back In an activity if I perform an operation like kotlin val subMenu navigationViewmenufindItemRidmonitoredappssubMenu subMenuclear for subMenuaddgroupId index namesetChecked getIsCheckedname then after selecting an item from the navigation view does not respect androidcheckableBehaviorsingle ie The item checked programatically in the above code remains checked even when choosing a different item from the navigation view The result is that after selecting some item there are total two items checked in the navigation view I have tried navigation adventure demo it looks good and it is intuitive however It has come to my attention that after performing a stress test on the navigation buttons it bugs the screen whitens out leaderboard Use DaggerApplication DaggerAppCompatActivity DaggerFragment inject and remove AppInjectorkt Injectable Hi I work fine in sample But when I click fast between tabs onCreateView is not trigger in fragment Will get empty view Any solution Under the new AndroidX Navigation framework When jumping from Fragment A to Fragment B and back to A the onActivityCreate will be called again for Fragment A If the viewModel is not created every time in onActivityCreate then the liveData in viewModel will observe again and notifies more than one Observer Although for current sample this is fine I think it is better that the observe should be in Fragment onCreate
