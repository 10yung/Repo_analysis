I tried to run tectonic on this file tex documentclassarticle begindocument enddocument and I got this error note this is a BETA release ask questions and report bugs at Running TeX Rerunning TeX because exampleaux changed Running xdvipdfmx error cannot open examplexdv I thought there was an issue and it took me a while to realize I was getting that error only because there were no pages of output Props to my colleague jjpilat for finding this When generating the following document using tectonic C v prints while v prints tex documentclassarticle begindocument huge bf the year enddocument I would expect the same output with either version Anyone know where I can start looking for what changed I imagine this is one of the embedded dependencies not necessarily the Rust portions of the codebase This is motivated by the fact I get output like the following in the LaTeX Compiler log window in VSCode Writing UsersalexDocumentsA filename with spacestex bytes and only UsersalexDocumentsA gets highlighted as a filename In any case the general practice is to enclose filenames in console output as abc I believe This would solve the issue I dont know if it covers all cases but the notehighlighted fn second parameter seems to be responsible for this sort of printing The enclosing of filenames in backticks is probably best done at callsite however using a helper function While Im writing this a bonus would be commaseparating the number of bytes eg bytes or better yet MB also kB and B of course All for readability of course since this is nitpicking Tectonic used to use hyper but in it was replaced by reqwest This PR allow using curl as an alternative to reqwest One reason to use curl instead of reqwest is that the number of dependencies is smaller vs reducing the compilation time min vs min of cpu itme and size of the binary MB vs MB Another reason is that curl have builtin support for proxy although I havent test it which would solves The curl crate will build libcurl if one is not installed in the build system and static link it so this does not increase the native dependencies This also adds a mock download backend allowing to build tectonic without download support which can be interest to assert that tectonic cannot make network connections This is mostly a notetoself Noticed in the process of putting out The AppImage script deletes and overwrites a GitHub Release for the release tag We only want this behavior in the continuous deployment scenario Useful artifacts like static binaries arent added to the GitHub Release when a release is built or stored anywhere This is also true for the CD scenario I think I can fix the CD scenario by having the master push phase delete the existing GitHub continuous release and forcepushing the continuous tag Then the different Travis invocations can try to create the new release there must be a way to succeedifalreadyexists and upload their artifacts That way real releases and the CD scenario can use the same nearly the same procedures to create and distribute artifacts It would be nice to cargo publish as part of a release tag but we need a way to do a manual testrun to make sure that itll work dryrun I think I should grab the uploadsh script and customize it since as I recall its not doing any super deep magic I think we can use GitHub Releases to manage our artifacts with the above changes but it would be cool to be able to store artifacts for pull request builds too Azure As revealed in crlf tectonic Potentially fixed with an analogy to crlf tectonic

test suite for this CC crlf burrbull Mrmaxmeier Hello I have the following installation macOS Catalina Tectonic via MacPorts When I run tectonic I get the following output tectonic testtex note this is a BETA release ask questions and report bugs at Running TeX Rerunning TeX because testaux changed tectonic NSAutoreleasePool release This pool has already been released do not drain it double release Running xdvipdfmx Writing testpdf bytes Skipped writing intermediate files use keepintermediates to keep them I am able this reproduce it with this simple document documentclassarticle begindocument Test enddocument There are existing issues and about this message which were closed on August According to rekka says that the issue was fixed with e c be ec c d b a but the issue doesnt appear to be resolved This is my first time using Tectonic and Ive only used it with macOS Catalina so I dont know if this issue is back because of Catalina or not Running tectonic c minimal doesnt hide the message either tectonic c minimal testtex tectonic NSAutoreleasePool release This pool has already been released do not drain it double release This isnt a big problem because the pdfs it generates are still fine Its just an annoying message to keep seeing though This switches to plain output if stdout is not a tty In forum the following is suggested Copy the package files into the directory containing your document This is the simplest answer in a certain sense If a certain file is missing from Tectonic s bundle you can just put a copy of it next to your main document file If the package you need involves multiple support files it is generally fine to just put them all next to your input file in the same way This starts getting messy at a certain point but it s a simple and effective solution in a lot of cases However the file provided by CTAN are in the dtx and ins format which can be extracted by running latex Running tectonic on them does not seem to work making it impossible to get the sty files Currently installation on Windows is completely undocumented It is necessary to study the Appveyor scripts yaml if targetenv msvc USERPROFILE vcpkg vcpkg install
