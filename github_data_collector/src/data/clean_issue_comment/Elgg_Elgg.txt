 replace with responses or exceptions probably when the url contains arrays in query params The Spam Login Filter plugin is a must have on of all sites at least in my opinion Unfortunately theres no official release of the plugin for Elgg available on the community site The version on github might work or might not But having such an important plugin only on github is not at all userfriendly expecially with unexperienced users in mind Its surely not necessary to add many if any additional plugins to core But I think the Spam Login Filter plugin should be considered definitely Package zendframeworkzendloader is abandoned you should avoid using it Use laminaslaminasloader instead Package zendframeworkzendmail is abandoned you should avoid using it Use laminaslaminasmail instead Package zendframeworkzendmime is abandoned you should avoid using it Use laminaslaminasmime instead Package zendframeworkzendstdlib is abandoned you should avoid using it Use laminaslaminasstdlib instead Package zendframeworkzendvalidator is abandoned you should avoid using it Use laminaslaminasvalidator instead
