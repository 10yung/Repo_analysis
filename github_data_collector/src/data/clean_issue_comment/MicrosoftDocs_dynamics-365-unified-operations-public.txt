Operation I guess you may select a different product eg Windows then add contract when you are at Support plan Then cancel out Then go to LCS and perhaps you could see the contract because it has now

Technology GitHub Login TJVass Microsoft Alias tjvass Hi there what I am missing in the documentation is what parts of a package actually needs to be checked in This is defined for rd party packages in the docs but it is missing for source package or Im too blind to find it For myself it is quite clear what I need Alongside with the gitignoretfignore I have written there is no problem for me personally However I find it would be good to have a description on what to check in within the docs explicitly including exceptions like binary dependencies rd party net DLLs in use by your package for example Best regards Torben Nehmer Document Details Do not edit this section It is required for docsmicrosoftcom GitHub issue linking ID e d a b c a Version Independent ID db c c d be a ca Content
