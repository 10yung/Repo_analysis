 save data savetxt I just wanted to say thanks for this awesome game Since I discovered it long ago I never stopped playing it My current game was created years ago Sun Sep GMT and my swarm has infested only new worlds so far I dont ascend as fast as possible Currently I am working on having the Overmind IIIs generate enough Overmind IIs and right now I have e meat I hope this gives a good picture on how much time I put into this Phillipp Played the game for hours just fine as soon as I close the tab and reopen it a couple of minutes later the page will work for a few seconds before freezing up and ramping up CPU usage If I stop looking at the tab for a bit it kinda works for another couple of seconds before freezing up again On Chrome on Linux Debian and also Ubuntu after starting a new game and playing it for minutes swarmsimgithubio becomes unresponsive several times in a minute the game pauses for seconds not updating the display and not reacting to mouse clicks The CPU usage goes up to Its so unresponsive that its imposible to enjoy the gameplay It works fine in Firefox on the same system Just submitted a purchase for crystals and now I own crystals Maybe this is on purpose but I figured it was worth pointing out After updating from iOS to the app locks after about seconds and interaction in the browser is about fps I cleared website data including storage as well as killed Safari but the freezing happens the next time I open swarmsim the list is very long lategame This will make it more readable Updating this list causes lots of lag late game since meat math doesnt scale well Hiding some of the list doesnt solve this early units still get slightly slower with each new gen but it removes one dimension of scaling Nounotselected would have no change This is just for the sidebar with a unit selected Im thinking of a drop down in the middle of the list like Om Om More Queen Drone Meat Options menu can disable this change of course It should probably be on by default but we need to make it obvious how to turn it off Most of these ideas exist already as debugging tools wed only need to unlock them say at achievements There are many reasons not to do this for example once we do this we cant really add new content for players past the end of the game today OM I think thats okay no such content planned anyway In any case make the decision while planning the next release First step pick specific achievements to implement Im stuck on e Overmind VIs and still have ascension to go for the ascension achievement This game definitely needs more meat generating tiers Even if its just Overmind VII Overmind VIII etc
