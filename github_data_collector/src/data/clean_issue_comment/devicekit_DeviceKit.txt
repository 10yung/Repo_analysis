Could you add bool vars such as hasTapticEngine and hasHapticFeedback Thank you i created Pull request for this isSimulator for Apple TV Fixes When using SwiftPM and doing I want to have swift file generated on any template change and I find it very useful so I share it Just install fswatch using brew brew install fswatch and launch watchsh The commit allow to compile with SwiftPM and if necessary I can make a PR just for this one The second one add models dumped from apple web site There is some double when using identifier so I put the PR as WIP I do not know what to do Merge into one Find a way to make some alias with template generations My very dirty dump script is available here Selfexplanatory An iOS iPadOS WatchOS could contain a cellular module It would be great to have an option of identifying the device in question as either WiFi only or the one having a Cellular capability Eg DevicewirelessCapabilities WiFi Cellular We use squish and rebase anyway to merge PRs into master so this doesnt matter Realizing this would be tricky to implement but very useful some software can only run on more modern hardware Im specifically thinking of CPU power not a specific camera or hardware feature It would be great to be able to call a function swift if DevicecurrentisEqualToOrNewerThaniPhoneX do something that needs CPU power else do something less CPU intensive I realize the function name is a mouthfulan alternate name would be fine Use Xcode for building and running tests on Travis CI
