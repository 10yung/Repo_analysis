With mntutilposExt you are providing the D standard coordinates for a electrode placement system I am trying to calculate the positions myself and reading the code in this toolbox I wonder where the following angles in are coming from Were they computed using a different function Or are these factors somehow obvious from the rules of the placement system and I just dont understand it Furthermore what coordinate system is this It seems to be spherical with ea being the azimuthal angle and eb being the polar angle but I cannot make sense of their conversion to xyz with the abr xyz function because for spherical coordinates the conversion would rather look like x r sinpolar cosazimuthal y r sinpolar sinazimuthal z r cospolar A brief explanation would be appreciated I have read the article by oostenveld as a reference Selection inversion using not is faulty returns ALL classes if classes are given as a vector of indices and not as strings With the default value for LegendPos Matlab version R b returns this error Using an integer to specify the legend location is not supported Specify the legend location with respect to the axes using the Location parameter Is this a Matlab version issue If mnt has no field box then the second output argument is not produced However the function gridplot always expects this second output in line This leads to an error if field box does not exist fix fastICA call when using epoched data with N icacomponents N channels I am using BCI competition III data set II for P speller data How can i use this toolbox for SubjectATrainmat file which is available online added functions for labstreaming layer lsl online toolbox support for feedback In order to facilitate using BBCI toolbox for offline analysis Im sharing the script I use to convert data recorded at our lab using other frameworks to convenient BBCI data format saved in mat extension the current scripts convert files created by the following software packages BCI OpenVibe the files you need to use procMARA moved to a new website this information should be included into the MARA environment Unify the usage of the functions proccspAuto or the new proccsp procspoc proccspoc procfastICA procssd procpca such that their input and output is consistent
