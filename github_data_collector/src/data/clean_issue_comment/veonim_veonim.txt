OS Linux generic Ubuntu SMP Thu Nov UTC x x x GNULinux Neovim version NVIM v ge bd Appimage Veonim version veonim AppImage Im encountering issues implementing extmultigrid properly in my own GUI and decided to steal code see how Veonim handled it only to discover that running call nvimopenwin vtrue width height focusable vtrue external vtrue seems to break Veonim the newlyopened window is not displayed and the cursor looks it stayed in the previous window even though it actually moved to the new window Running call nvimwinclose vfalse seems to be enough to go back to a working state I guess its probably just an issue with the selected grid not being drawn I cant figure out how to paste from the Windows clipboard The and registers are empty kbdCtrlkbdkbdvkbd and kbdShiftkbdkbdInskbd dont paste from the clipboard in insert mode Hello guys when i execute command bro wse o ldfiles instead of showing in full window with first list on top it show a split window with last list like in picture below Screenshot btw i use version in arch linux I tried several Vietnamese engines but none of them works this is a video video Im using a Brazilian keyboard on a ptBR location With these configurations and are dead keys and as such the combination a for instance should produce but only the letter a is inserted No dead key is being handled at all OS Linux Solus OS distribution Veonim version AppImage currently in wat we have serversupportremotets and uisupportremotets the ui shows supportremotets and supportremotets we should show more of the paths until the nameplates are unique Regardless of where directoryfolder I execute veonim it always looks for files on then I need to put the whole file path starting from home dir to actually open it Im running Veonim on Linux Debian Buster npm See and my previous issues It seems sometimes Veonim cant talk to the locally installed git program to get git status information Ive noticed this issue happening on MacOS with prepackaged git vs git from brew Not sure what is going on maybe we should vendor the git binary with Veonim If there is a way I would look into this if I had time but fzf would help enable all fuzzy needs and be super fast since ripgrep is already being used FD could be used for folder navigation or all of the searching I think this would help knockout the MRU requirement as there are ways to extend fzf yourself including existing vim packages that have MRU with fzf As you must know Oni is also a GUI for NeoVim Im having trouble choosing between Oni and veonim Could you please elaborate on what makes this project unique Thanks in advance
