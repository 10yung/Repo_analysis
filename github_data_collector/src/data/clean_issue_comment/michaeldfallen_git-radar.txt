If there is a stash the stash symbol for the gitradar display overlaps the first character of my command Heres an example where Ive typed OOO into the command line you can see how it overlaps the first O My PS line in bashrc is PS PS gitradar bash fetch If I add a trailing space to PS like PS PS gitradar bash fetch but then in any nongit repos there are two spaces after the the in my prompt which I find annoying typing ls when inside a git repo testradarbasesh testradarbasesh source not found testshowremotestatus testradarbasesh eval showremotestatus not found ASSERT testradarbasesh eval showremotestatus not found ASSERT testradarbasesh eval showremotestatus not found ASSERT testradarbasesh eval showremotestatus not found testradarbasesh eval showremotestatus not found testradarbasesh eval showremotestatus not found testradarbasesh eval showremotestatus not found Ran test FAILED failures testdirectoriessh testdirectoriessh source not found testgitrootinrepo testdirectoriessh eval gitroot not found ASSERTexpectedtmpgitradar but was testgitrootnotinrepo testdirectoriessh eval timenow not found testdirectoriessh eval gitroot not found testdotgitlocationnotinrepo testdirectoriessh eval timenow not found testdirectoriessh eval dotgit not found When inside a non git repo ls tmpgitradartest tmpgitradartest testradarbasesh not found tmpgitradartest tmpgitradartest testdirectoriessh not found tmpgitradartest tmpgitradartest testcommitssh not found tmpgitradartest tmpgitradartest testbranchessh not found tmpgitradartest tmpgitradartest testfilessh not found tmpgitradartest tmpgitradartest teststatussh not found tmpgitradartest tmpgitradartest teststashsh not found tmpgitradartest tmpgitradartest testcolorssh not found tmpgitradartest tmpgitradartest testformatconfigsh not found configerrYagkx Discord Crashes gitprompttestsnew gitprompttestsremote sshWwKuXpcjm IE Tempf e e c bcac d fe This adds a tmux option allowing for gitradar to be used in a tmux status prompt In a repository with a git folder that is MB big its takes around seconds to run gitradar bash which is too slow especially when constantly opening new terminal sessions Is there any way to speed up the command or is this a limitation that cant cant be optimized Thanks This is a somewhat odd message and I cannot really get the ins and outs of why this is happening melaptop mkdir radartest melaptop cd radartest melaptopradartest touch Makefile melaptopradartest Makefile bash homemecodeforksgitradarMakefile Permission denied melaptopradartest ls ld homemecodeforksgitradarMakefile rwrwr me me jun homemecodeforksgitradarMakefile melaptop Notice that I dont prefix the Makefile with Makefile and of course the Makefile is not executable no exec bit and no shebang not the Makefile in the test directory and neither the Makefile in gitradar I needed to make this change in order for gitradar to look normal using fish Perhaps it is because I am new to fish as in I just started trying to use it about a half hour ago but I cant seem to get gitradar to work with it I added this line to my fishpromptfish file fish echo n gitradar fish fetch and I get this Everything looks as it should except for gitradar and the fact that I dont actually want a full path listed in my prompt but I will ignore that for now until I figure out how to shorten it in fish Not sure what has gone wrong here I came across typechanged the other day in my git status It occurs when for example you change a file from being a regular file to a symlink Not sure if you want this in I am using TC in the terminal to show this I would also like a check on the greps in the lines that I added I understand that everything inside of the square brackets can be matched but I am unsure what letters I would also need with this Now you can add a prefix andor suffix to your gitradar prompt that will only show if you are in a git repo Note The PROMPTFORMAT line was changed to remove the leading space in the string With it in if you define a prefix a space will still be there even if the user may not want it So it can be overridden by the user with one of the new variables but by default the prefix still adds that space anyways I have a strange issue with the not upstream indicator For some reason its taking up more space than it should and is shifting the rest of the characters in the line across It doesnt look that bad in the screenshot but it actually causes issues occasionally where the cursor will be offset with the character its modifying which is confusing and annoying If I manage to trigger it again Ill update this issue with a screenshot Im running gitradar master branch ac e in bash on Ubuntu with export PS PS gitradar bash fetch Need any other info
