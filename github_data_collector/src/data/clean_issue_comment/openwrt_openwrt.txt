Update bison to Release notes Note for future release notes mention that YYPRINT macro is declared deprecated but apparently still works for now I found one possible use of that in scriptsconfigzconftabcshipped That might be modernized at some point but as the file is synced with the one from upstream Linux it might get fixed there Tested in compiling for ipq xR This is only a cosmetic correction as the driver works as expected However the error message confuses users about a missing reset definition On a deferd init we don t see the following error message now ar usbphy usbphy phy reset is missing Signedoffby Johann Neuhauser johannitneuhauserde fixed switch configuration fixed status LED reorganized partitions This commit fixes an issue where linkage with libpcap fails when targeting ramips with glibc It has been reported at Note that this also requires the commit e f c b d ea be should anyone want to cherrypick this commit into the openwrt or other branch In some situations you need to set the compress param without an algorithm Compression will be turned off but the packet framing for compression will still be enabled allowing a different setting to be pushed later As it is not possible to have options with optional values at the moment Ive introduced a pseudo value framesonly which will be removed in the init script If anyone has a cleanerbetter solution please let me know CZNIC confirmed to me that the latest revision CZ NIC are being shipped with a newer UBoot version which relies on the existence of bootscr The particular version deployed seems to be this one To make matters worse the address of the firmware environment in devmtd seems to have changed as well This is an attempt to support the new version by adding the necessary boot script similar to clearfogbootscript to medkit sysupgrade images Some UBoot version logic is added to keep the old behaviour for the old devices If somebody with a CZ NIC version can build medkit sysupgrade images with this and report back it would be highly appreciated I guess those commits can also be rebased onto the branch if the tester prefers Arduino Yun is a microcontroller development board based on Atmel ATmega u and Atheros AR Specifications MCU ATmega U SoC AR RAM DDR MB Flash SPI NOR MB WiFi GHz SoC internal Ethernet x Mbps USB x MicroSD x SDHC Notes Stock firmware is based on OpenWrt AA The MCU can be programmed with avrdude linuxgpio Installation Update UBoot environment variables to adapt to new partition scheme Youll need to access serial console via YunSerialTerminal setenv bootcmd run addboard run addtty run addparts run addrootfs bootm x f bootm x fea setenv mtdparts spi kubootro kubootenv kfirmware knvram kartro saveenv Boot into stock firmware normally and perform sysupgrade with sysupgrade image sysupgrade n F tmpsysupgradebin Add missing call to free for variable filebuffer Add missing calls to fclose for variables fd and fdout See Full changelog Update curl to version also fixes CVE Signedoffby Jan Pavlinec janpavlinecniccz
