Feature request could you set it up so that it converts local video to ascii and then sends the ascii to the client thus greatly reducing bandwidth instead of sending video and processing it locally I was able to ssh into each other and connect to the localhost and that worked but at the cost of sound This little fix solve the compilation error on some Ubuntu installations by providing the correct OpenCV headers gcc I usr local include opencv I usr local include Isrc inc O Wall DPAUSEALSA src videoc c o objs videoo bin sh I usr local include opencv There is no such file or directory src videoc fatal error cvh There is no such file or directory include cvh compilation aborted make Makefile objs videoo Error The brew instructions need updating shell brew tap homebrewscience Error homebrewscience was deprecated This tap is now empty as all its formulae were migrated gcc Isrcinc O Wall DPAUSECOREAUDIO pkgconfig cflags opencv srcvideoc c o objsvideoo In file included from srcvideoc In file included from usrlocalCellaropencv includeopencvcvh In file included from usrlocalCellaropencv includeopencv corecorech usrlocalCellaropencv includeopencv coretypesch warning implicit declaration of function cvRound is invalid in C Wimplicitfunctiondeclaration iptx cvRoundpointx srcvideoc error unknown type name CvCapture static CvCapture cvcap srcvideoc warning implicit declaration of function cvReleaseCapture is invalid in C Wimplicitfunctiondeclaration cvReleaseCapture cvcap srcvideoc warning implicit declaration of function cvCaptureFromCAM is invalid in C Wimplicitfunctiondeclaration cvcap cvCaptureFromCAM srcvideoc warning implicit declaration of function cvQueryFrame is invalid in C Wimplicitfunctiondeclaration colorimg cvQueryFramecvcap warnings and error generated make objsvideoo Error make gcc Isrcinc O Wall DPAUSECOREAUDIO pkgconfig cflags opencv srcaudioc c o objsaudioo srcaudioc fatal error portaudioh file not found include portaudioh error generated make objsaudioo Error Hi I believe I have installed portaudio properly why does this show every time I can see portaudioh in my usrlocalinclude what should I do Many thanks I have looked at a few source files for your current software I have noticed that some checks for return codes are missing Would you like to add more error handling for return values from functions like the following fopen PaUtilDumpHighSpeedLog malloc p psendpass pthreadcreate startvideo You can connect to your own computer and have someone else connect to it and it will try and display both video feeds You can also connect multiple computers this way Audio is being kinda buggy but this potentially means super easy conference calls with a bit of testing this bug could almost be called a feature Running Ubuntu Cheese and other webcam tools open my camera fine but p pvc does not do anything When I launch p pvc one of my CPU cores jumps to and stays there until the program is terminated It shows User defined signal upon termination Using e does nothing May be a useful compression library
