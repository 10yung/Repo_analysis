Merge rendering gui Maksim can you review this merge Everything looks okay to me but the clickdragging the mouse in SceneWidget looks really weird its not rotating around an axis like Im expecting more like gimbal lock or something Im worried that I missed something but if thats expected behavior just merge it Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend Minimum example python Numpy Open D PyTorch all share the same memory a npones b o dTensorfromnumpya c torchutilsdlpackfromdlpackbtodlpack See srcUnitTestPythontestcorepy for usage examples Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend Adds the following for the tensorflow reducesubarrays op GPU implementation Unit test Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend I get a TypeError cant pickle open dopen dgeometryPointCloud objects when I try to parallelize a for loop to multiple query the KDTree I have tried joblib and numba and both give me same error my code is basically def myfunci k idx pcdtreesearchknnvector dpcdpoints i return idx results Parallelnjobsnumcores verbose delayed myfuncifor i in mylist Is there an alternate fast method for multiple querying the KD Tree Thanks Some cameras are flipped in the zaxis when the boundingbox center of the scene is not visible ie center is behind the camera This situation could happen when you are in an indoor scene for instance and looking at the walls instead of towards the center of the room The fix is simple basically adding a absolute value to the result of the dot product projection to the front vector Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend Im using the new Azure Kinect and can get interesting results but open d uses the Azure Kinect is just used as an images recorder Is it possible to use the IMU to get more precises results It could be used also with the DR realsense with IMU Do you have any projects about using IMU data Hi i still have a question In your demo printOptimizing PoseGraph option GlobalOptimizationOption maxcorrespondencedistance maxcorrespondencedistancefine edgeprunethreshold referencenode globaloptimizationposegraph GlobalOptimizationLevenbergMarquardt GlobalOptimizationConvergenceCriteria option And graph is defined as posegraphnodesappendPoseGraphNodenplinalginvodometry posegraphedgesappendPoseGraphEdgesourceid targetid transformationicp informationicp uncertain False It seems that the whole optimization process requires no point clouds as input I can hardly understand it Could you please explain it i am a new learner for this area Hi all I have several point clouds of the same environment and each of them have more or less height Instead of loading everything at the same time I am loading each cloud at a time and register it against the previous loaded one and then show the result in a nonblocking visualizer When I am trying to move the camera to place it in the center of each new point cloud and in a topview like birds eye view I have problems setting the view to keep at the same height meaning if the new point cloud has more height than the previous one the camera zoom shouldnt move Right now I am trying to do it like this EigenVector d minBound cloudGetMinBound EigenVector d maxBound cloudGetMaxBound open dvisualizationViewParameters viewParams viewParamsboundingboxmin minBound viewParamsboundingboxmax maxBound viewParamslookat minBound maxBound viewParamsfieldofview viewParamszoom viewParamsup viewParamsfront visualiserGetViewControlConvertFromViewParametersviewParams while the view is moving to keep it to the center of the xy coords of the new cloud the zoom keeps changing all the time Is there any way of keeping the same Z position in the viewer Keeping a global variable for it or recomputing it every time doesnt matter I cannot find anything indicating or explaining how to do it Thanks for the help From the documenation for VoxelGridcarvedepthmap The point is not carved if none of the boundary points of the voxel projects to a valid image location However the implementation does carve voxels when no points project into the image The question is which behavior is desired Im in favor of doing what the documentation says and not carving voxels if they do not project into the image If other agree with that I can fix the function to adhere to that contract Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend
