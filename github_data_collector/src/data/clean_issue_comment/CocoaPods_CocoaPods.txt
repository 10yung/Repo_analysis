slather Ruby has introduced a few deprecations which result in quite a lot of warnings being logged when running CocoaPods These fall into two broad categories Usage of URIescape which is deprecated and should be replaced with CGIescape Implicit conversion of a hash to keyword arguments which should be replaced with an explicit conversion using the double splat operator Theres really quite a lot of these warnings so it would be nice if we could fix this for Ruby users x Ive read and understood the CONTRIBUTING guidelines and have done my best effort to follow Report Im running into an issue in trying to take over the name of an existing pod Coordinator I reached out to the original owner to delete the pod so I could use it instead but now neither of us are able to modify ownership What did you do The original owner deleted all versions of the existing pod I ran pod trunk push Coordinatorpodspec to push the new podspec but got the following error You my email are not allowed to push new versions for this pod The owners of this pod are original owner email In response the original owner ran pod trunk addowner Coordinator my email but received the following error No pod found with the specified name As a last resort I tried to claim the pod but then got this error Unknown Pod Coordinator Now neither of us can modify ownership for Coordinator What did you expect to happen I expected that if all versions of Coordinator were deleted from the public specs repo I would be able to create a new pod with the same name I expected that an additional owner could be added to a pod as long as CocoaPods has the original owner information stored What happened instead The original owner now cant add me as an owner since the pod cant be found and I cant create a new pod because ownership is still attributed to the original owner CocoaPods Environment Stack CocoaPods Ruby ruby p revision universalx darwin RubyGems Host Mac OS X B Xcode C Git git version Apple Git Ruby lib dir
