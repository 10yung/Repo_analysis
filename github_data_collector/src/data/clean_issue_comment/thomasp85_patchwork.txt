Hi there My project team and I have found this package much more useful and intuitive than cowplot so thank you Weve been using patchwork to combine multiple plots into one figure Our largest figure is a x grid where each plot is a combined x plot so theres actually a total of ggplot objects We were hoping to use the plotlayouttaglevel new feature to skip labeling our subplots but the skipped subplots also skip the associated label letters Here is a simplified example r librarytidyverse librarypatchwork p ggplotmtcars geompointaesmpg disp ggtitleMain plot p ggplotmtcars geomboxplotaesgear

for a simpler solution through patchwork r librarytidyverse librarypatchwork p ggplotmtcars geompointaesmpg disp ggtitleMain plot p ggplotmtcars geomboxplotaesgear disp group gear ggtitleMain plot h

out how to get the collected guide on the bottom of the plot by finding issue It might be worth it to add more explicit docs in the package proper Also bonus typo fix Documents on the whole are excellent really a pleasure to read through them Hi Thomas If you use plotannotation to annotate some plots and then wrap them into a patchwork the annotations are dropped Here is an example p ggplotmtcars geompointaesmpg disp plotannotationcaption I am plot p p ggplotmtcars geomboxplotaesgear disp group gear plotannotationtitle PLOT caption I am plot p wrapplotsp p Is this a bug in wrapplots or am I missing something Wouldnt a keepannotations parameter be usefuldoable Dan Im getting an error when I try to use patchwork on a faceted ggplot with a manuallyplaced legend ie themelegendposition Heres a reprex r libraryggplot librarypatchwork p ggplotmtcars aesmpg disp col asfactorgear geompoint facetwrap cyl themelegendposition c plot by itself p r plot within patchwork p p Error in FUNX i subscript out of bounds wrapplotsp p Error in FUNX i subscript out of bounds supCreated on by the reprex package v sup It works fine when I remove the facetwrap or the themelegendposition line Something about both of them together seems to cause an issue Is there a way to center titles created with plotannotation I expected this to have one title centered on the panel and one centered across the whole plot but the hjust parameter did not seem to be active for plotannotation Perhaps I should be using different syntax Related to and libraryggplot

is not an issue but is there anyway patchwork could insert a zoomin figure in a larger figure On the current master branch legend justification for fixed aspect ratio plots is broken r libraryggplot
