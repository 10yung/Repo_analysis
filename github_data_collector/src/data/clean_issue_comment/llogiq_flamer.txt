I no longer use Rust that much but the flame crate is still being used quite heavily often alongside flamer Since its hard for me to make releases would you be interested in taking over development maintenance When I put a flame attribute inside of a module it gives me an error file not found for module modulename It gives me the same error randomly when I apply it to the mod item in its parent module It would be great to have a way of marking all pub fn of modules structs marked for flaming using one single command Currently I add cfgattrfeatureflameit flame to all pub fn of major modules and structs manually I was first curious if it was possible to easily modify things to use the full paths of items modulefnname instead of fnname but asking on rustinternals that may be impossible So I guess perhaps an alternate scheme would be to allow an argument to the attribute specifying a name rust flamemodulefnname fn fnname I think that would be a really useful feature especially if it wasnt applied recursively perhaps deserving a different attribute The current unstable version breaks too often for my taste and the above crates are likely the way forward Eg flameloops to insert measurements for all loops or flameblocks to measure all blocks with at least statements or statements expression Eg flame fn outer fn inner gets no flame for now Theres currently exactly read zero documentation I should really write up some
