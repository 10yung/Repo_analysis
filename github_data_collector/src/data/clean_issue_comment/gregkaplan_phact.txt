Implicit expansion was introduced in Matlab R b You can read about it here This can lead to problems as MATLABAutoDiff that this toolbox is sitting on top of does not support implicit expansion yet It will be address in the future but in the mean time one can follow the suggestion given here We proceeded to adapt the new feature it is just syntactically nicer since you do not have to use bsxfun so some of the example files might not work with matlab release prior to R b Example files were check to run without a problem with R b but codes will be reviewed to double check Pontus Rendahl pointed out that schursolver is wrong for discrete time The flag for continuousdiscrete time remains from earlier but it is not intended for the current toolbox and is probably wrong I will decide whether I will correct it or take it out but in the mean time the solver should not be used for discrete time models
