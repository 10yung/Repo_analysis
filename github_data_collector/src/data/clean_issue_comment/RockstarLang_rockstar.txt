Need I say more Hoping this is the best place to ask Im trying to run Satriani from the command line I followed the steps in the read me When I pass node rockstar inputrock I get the following error throw err Error Cannot find module readlinesync at FunctionModuleresolveFilename modulejs at FunctionModuleload modulejs at Modulerequire modulejs at require internalmodulejs at Objectanonymous homemattDocumentsrockstarsatrianirockstarjs at Modulecompile modulejs at ObjectModuleextensionsjs modulejs at Moduleload modulejs at tryModuleLoad modulejs at FunctionModuleload modulejs Im aware readlinesync is a module of npm so I made sure I had it installed and updated and I do not sure how to progress this I couldnt see any kind of data collection like lists or array could we possibly get those added to rockstar I recently created a Java Package that could make Java read more like Rockstar using objects I am unsure if this counts as a contribution eg TommyisNothing whileTommyisntEve IbuildTommy up again IscreamTommy more at uses the Newton Euler Convergence Transformation to approximate to any precision a float can handle Doesnt use letbe syntax because I wanted it to work at If this were treated the same as the Id be tempted to make it this song In Rockstar we have these marvellous functions that take parameters just like this scale takes X Y and Z give back X times Y plus Z say scale taking and output However it is not possible to define a function that accepts zero parameters In this proposal I recommend a syntax for this Currently theres no much need for them but hopefully in the future we can use them more extensively The proposal is simple in the method declaration we declare takes nothing or other alias for null value like nowhere or nobody in the method call we simply leave the taking part off Technically the function name behaves like if it was a variable if there is a function defined with that name we can call the function otherwise we need to access the variable The function names should have priority over the variables An example Let the sequence be next takes nothing parameterless method declaration Build the sequence up give back the sequence say next output the hunter says elephants say next plus the hunter output elephants say next of output say next minus next output Currently Im working on an OOP extension proposal and this feature is necessary for the accessors at least it would ease the way to write them So in the future functions will be able to access more than the global variables and there will be much more parameterless getter functions than at this moment The regular expression for a single quote followed by a lowercase s and one or more whitespace characters should be s s W is a non word character ie anything but alphanumerics underscore and a few others How about adding a package system in rockstar So we can implement the array feature like one in python Write program in C for list operations and use rockstar functions to do the operations For example First there would be some syntax to import the package We need packagename as customidentifier Create an instance of what we imported with normal assignment operation newidentifier is customidentifier or newidentifier is customidentifier taking initialsparameters Now operate on the instance newidentifier taking operationname and operands For lists it would look something like We need peace as the saviour the winter is the saviour the winter taking append and okay This code initializes the the winter as a list with okay All the other operations can be done similarly This can be implemented in the interpreter I made I seem to have written a rockstar quine probably the first one that doesnt use arrays To be honest roskstar is not my first programming language or the one Im most familiar with so I wanted some more experienced programmers to check it and have some fun before adding it to Rosetta The minimalistic version should be almost readable the idiomatic adds some poetic numeral literals and a workaround for a misleading joke I guess the trailing spaces and comments handling could lead to some problems I had some trouble with uppercase It seems expected behavior and replaced an IfElse inside a function with two Ifs to make it work on both rocky and the website probably related to Feel free to add it to the examples Sorry for all the edits hope this didnt cause too much trouble
