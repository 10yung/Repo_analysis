Why is it that after downloading the project the schematic diagram shows the memory size but it is blank when opened with Altium Designer Thank you ever so much Im already success put all components on the TX RX board just like yours and flash the firmware via USB DFU RX looks working fine the stats led first get blink and into dim when press user button it typed out the debug messages So far look nice But TX I think it had some issues the stats led always breath and never stop also RX did not received data from the TX I tried press user button over secs into test mode but the led just go out also didnt receive any data I dont know whats wrong about Im doing all components look got nice soldering and works good pls help me huge thx Does it have a sleep modeOr it always working at normal mode that will cost a lot of electricity Have you test the current when TX is working I have a thought to build a lowpower consumption TX terminal with STM L series and lowpower Bluetooth module So I want to use this with keyboard maestro to activate a series of actions My question is if it sends the command as a hardware key press or software input Ive always needed something like this there was no tech or sensor or signal that would detect when someone walked into rooms Can you keep these plugged in so they are on at all times Im going to try one in my bedroom when i walk in hopefully i can run a script that will turn on a wemo light Then turn it off when i walk out If it works this would be AMAZING Very very cool project That is all Well done
