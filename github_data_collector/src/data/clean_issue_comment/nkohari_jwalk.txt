Hi Thanks for this tool Id love to be able to pipe data to it eg cat filejson jwalk Thanks in advance Gunar Added a ll command to inspect the schema of the specified node It also gives a preview of the value each child holds For strings only the first characters are shown so the screen wont be messed up when dealing with extremely long strings Added the ability to specify an attribution name with the inspect command This also includes the makefile work from pull request I will leave both open for now but if this is acceptable you can just merge this one There are two commits one simple curl example then in the second using the API which took me a second to figure out myself I hope the second isnt too much noise
