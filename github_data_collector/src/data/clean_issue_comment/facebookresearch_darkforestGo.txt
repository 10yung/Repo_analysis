establishing expected behaviors for project contributors This PR was crafted with love by Facebooks Open Source Team When I try to write a script for runcmds I find g and genmove can only run once then the program will exit Other commands dont have this problem In cnnPlayerV Frameworklua line g or genmove will return the winratebetween and and in line winrate is read as quit thus always return true and exit When I delete the winrate in line it seems worked fine Hi Trying to run darkforest in mctsonly mode no dcnn th cnnPlayerMCTSV lua cpuonly timelimit Pattern file modelsplayoutmodelbin
