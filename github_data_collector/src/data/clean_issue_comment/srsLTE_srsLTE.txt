Hi everyoneI am using USRP B for srsLTE how ever both EPC and eNB seems to be working fine constant red LED on Tx constant Green on Rx of RF still am unable to detect any signal on my mobile could anyone pls suggest any solutionnprb is set as pls help outthanks Software Radio Systems EPC Reading configuration file homeesb configsrslteepcconf HSS Initialized MME S Initialized MME GTPC

works for me which I would like to share with others Apologies for sharing on the issues list but this is where most people will look for solutions Admins feel free to close unless others repeat this sequence and have issues I will be happy to assist resolving Setup My system is an Intel i T CPU GB RAM GB SSD I am running Ubuntu in a dual boot configuration The setup described below follows from a fresh installation of the OS as I wanted a reproducible setup from a clean install Having worked on this for days I have got the time for the sequence of erase old OS install new OS build system get srsLTE running down to a minute seconds process Im sure this time could be improved This setup was created by following and then adjusting the steps from the following two links Setup steps Start with the LimeSDR mini not plugged into the PC Install Ubuntu bit desktop OS Wait for the OS to advise of updates install these and reboot Open a terminal shell Enter the following commands one at a time sudo addaptrepository y ppapothoswareframework sudo addaptrepository y ppapothoswaresupport sudo addaptrepository y ppamyriadrfdrivers sudo aptget update sudo aptget install pothosall y sudo aptget install pythonpothos y sudo aptget install python pothos y sudo aptget install pothospythondev y sudo aptget install soapysdrtools y sudo aptget install pythonsoapysdr pythonnumpy y sudo aptget install python soapysdr python numpy y sudo aptget install soapysdrmoduleremote soapysdrserver y sudo apt remove limesdr moduleaudio y sudo apt install soapysdrmoduleall y sudo addaptrepository y ppamyriadrfdrivers sudo aptget update sudo aptget install limesuite liblimesuitedev limesuiteudev limesuiteimages y sudo aptget install soapysdr soapysdrmodulelms y Now plug your LimeSDR mini into a USB port and run the command SoapySDRUtil probe In the output displayed confirm the SDR is detected and that it is on a USB port If not try another USB port Now enter the following commands one at a time sudo aptget install libsoapysdrdev cmake libfftw dev libmbedtlsdev libboostprogramoptionsdev libconfigdev libsctpdev git buildessential y git clone cd srsLTE mkdir build cd build cmake make sudo make install sudo ldconfig sudo srslteinstallconfigssh user That completes the installation Before running the code I edited the enb config file to get the transmission on a frequency band that is used by my phone in Europe In the file configsrslteenbconf change the rf section to say rf dlearfcn txgain rxgain devicename soapy deviceargs rxantLNAHtxantBAND Now open up two terminal windows In one run the command sudo srsepc In the other run sudo srsenb In the output of the above you should see the SDR is detected The final output should be calibration completed and in my case a single WARNING L message From this point I have confirmed on a spectrum analyser that the enb is transmitting I have yet to confirm cell information detection by an actual mobile phone but those are next steps followed by full connectivity with a test SIM SDR configuration The configuration of the LimeSDR mini used in the tests above can been seen below SoapySDRUtil probe resulting output Soapy SDR the SDR

getting any LTE signal on my phone even though SRS enb and epc are both running on pc can anyone pls let know where am going wrong kindly help out thanks With the last set of fixes I have VoLTE registration succeeding Dedicated Bearers seem to be the last hurdle for VoLTE calls Since there is already some support in UE would it be possible to get them on the ENB roadmap Before filing an issue search for solutions here srsLTE users mailing list Issue Description As soon as I connect with my sysmocom custom SIMusing an iPhone SE srsenb establishes a connection Instead it throws the error getnpucch Invalid parameters After minutes srsenb just stopscrashes I used the current master branch tagrelease Setup Details Specify details of the test setup This would help us reproduce the problem reliably The setup is as follows Running srsenb over Ettus Research B driver UHD HEAD g c c OS Ubuntu LTS UE is an iPhone SE with a programmable SIM from sysmocom I use ipforwarding and nat to connect the connected phone to the internet Expected Behavior What you expect to happen No getnpucch Invalid parameters exception in the console Actual Behaviour What happens instead eg error message Spamming getnpucch Invalid parameters in the terminal I run srsenb from and srsenb stopscrashes after minutes of spamming Steps to reproduce the problem Tell us how to reproduce this issue eg RF setup application config files Configs I added the SIM entry of my sysmocom SIM in userdbcsv I changed the in the mme section of enbconf and epcconf the values of mcc to and the value of mnc to I also changed the value of dlearfcn in enbconf to Steps start sudo srsepc start sudo srsenb switch phone either onoff or turn flight mode onoff so your phone looks for a network as soon as the phone connects to the enb the terminal throws getnpucch Invalid parameters multiple times Additional Information Any additional information configuration or data that might be necessary to reproduce the issue To verify I didnt do anything wrong I used the tagrelease to check if it works It works fine there with no getnpucch Invalid parameters exception thrown The outputs of the terminal log as well as pcap are attached Outputszip The PR includes the rrc and nas standalone decoder for fuzzing the decoder libs Before filing an issue search for solutions here srsLTE users mailing list Issue Description When configuring srsenb with the DL EARFCN a B EARFCN the console message shows Setting frequency DL Mhz UL Mhz The DL frequency is correct but the UL frequency is incorrect as it should be Mhz I am able to see the DL transmission on Mhz but no other device can sees the transmission as a valid ENB carrier Does the latest release of srsenb support ENB transmission in LTE band and has
