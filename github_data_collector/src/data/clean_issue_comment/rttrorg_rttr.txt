 I have two separate files in static library any kind of project will do Lets call the files acpp with class A and bcpp with class B Each has one occurrence of RTTRREGISTRATION Code in maincpp does not depend on B directly in any way except rttrtypeBget call Since there are no hard dependencies linker is throwing bobj away from linking All static objects from bcpp file are gone and RTTRREGISTRATION is never called For a moment I assumed rttr dealt with this problem in a way Im now aware of yet As it turns out this is yet to be solved Because of this linker behavior engines tends to have one huge file referencing known types or dummy function from files containing them It does not even have to be called as long as linker sees reference Do you by any chance have solution to this problem Is it possible to reflect the contained key and value types of associative and sequential containers given only the rttrtype of the container I dont see a way of doing that apart from gettemplatearguments but I think that it is a nogo since the positions of key and value types depend on the underlying container type Edit My goal is to recursively visit an rttrtype and find specific kinds of metadata I am trying to use RTTR to add reflection to existing OpenGL drawing commands I am on Windows VS This is in my entry file above main include GLglewh include GLFWglfw h include

in those projects Is there a reason for the missing link Ive also submitted a PR that disables Benchmarks Unit Tests and Examples if the user disables BUILDRTTRDYNAMIC you might want to take a look
