 Describe the problem youd like to see solved or task youd like to see made easier It would be nice to have all icons being fixedwidth by default to achieve better layouts in certain scenarios As far as I know this is currently not possible Is this in relation to an existing part of angularfontawesome or something new FontAwesomeModule What is thing that we can do when building this feature that will guarantee that it is awesome Provide configuration options for the FontAwesomeModule Maybe by implementing a forRoot method which receives a configuration This could also include default icon style so that it could be omitted in faicon Why would other angularfontawesome users care about this I believe this would make the work of other layout designersprogrammers easier On a scale of sometime in the future to absolutely right now how soon would you recommend we make this feature Ive just found out that when I build my universal app all the svg code for the icons ends up in my serverjs which Im sure cant be good for performance as its s of lines of unnecessary code They are not in the client side build so how do I prevent them ending up server build Addresses Describe the

Feature request checklist x This is a single feature ie not a rewrite of all of Font Awesome x The title starts with Feature request and is followed by a clear feature name Ex Feature request moar cowbell x I have searched for existing issues and to the best of my knowledge this is not a duplicate I have successfully set up fortawesomeangularfontawesome alpha with angular and loaded some icons The new alpha version looks solid That said my specs are failing now with the error below This is presumably because my app loads the font library in AppModule but my YsMainMenuComponent spec knows nothing about AppModule It would be very helpful if the readme here provided some guidance on injecting a FaFontLibrary into an angular spec correctly YsMainMenuComponent should have linktohome Failed

leftMoon is Material Design Icon Which has proper alignment What happened What are you seeing How did you arrive here What did you expect How would you like this to work instead I want it centre aligned inside button by default Reproducible test case Describe any details about the test case that we need to know like whatever you do dont click the red button Question Now that the global icon library has been deprecated in is there a recommended way as to how to set up an icon library in storybook Storybook stories have no moduleAngular constructor I was previously doing something like this in my storybookconfigjs file js import library from fortawesomefontawesomesvgcore import IMPORTEDICONS from appicons libraryaddIMPORTEDICONS Related Issue There is use case when an action is performed on clicking on icon eg close icon it would nice to hover effect on icon for this case I want to display an icon stack on my page so this is what I have fastack faicon icon fal lock faicon faicon icon fal ban faicon fastack However this renders completely empty If I remove the fastack wrapper the icons render My implementation as I understand it is completely inline with the

way to apply inset gradients on icons Is this in relation to an existing part of angularfontawesome or something new This is new for angularfontawesome but not for FontAwesome as described here What is thing that we can do when building this feature that will guarantee that it is awesome Make it easy to use Why would other angularfontawesome users care about this Because gradients are beautiful On a scale of sometime in the future to absolutely right now how soon would you recommend we make this feature This feature was easy to implement with the oldest version Thank you for your precious work
