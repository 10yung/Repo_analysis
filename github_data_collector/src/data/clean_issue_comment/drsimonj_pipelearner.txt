Current version of purrr results in following error being thrown r crossd is deprecated please use crossdf instead In general a user will want to predict values and scoreevaluated their fit after learning all models via learn The exact functions to do this are many However pipeable functions could be written that takes the tibble coming from learn as well as a function that will take the relevant columns eg test target and fit and output the predicted values It will then be the responsibility of the user to create a function that accepts these arguments eg pl learn plpredicttesthat FUN functiontest target fit etc to produce vectors of fitted values plscoretestrsqr FUN functiontest target testhat etc Currently predictpipelearner assumes that the output of predict on each fit will return a single vector of values However this isnt always the case For example default settings on predictrpart when a classification tree is run will return a data frame of predicted probabilities Currently predictpipelearner applies default predict to each fit However sometimes this needs to be adjusted For example changing predict to produce probabilities or classes
