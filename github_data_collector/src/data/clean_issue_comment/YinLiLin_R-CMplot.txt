Dear LiLinYin Thanks so much for your R package CMplot But when I use this package to draw an SNP density map I found that the color of this map can not be changed the color is always darkgreen yellow and red this code colcdarkgreen yellow red The map change nothing when i change these colors I thought that maybe the codecol have some problem So I tell you this problem at here and hope you can modify this problem Thanks again Yours Jiazi Zhang Hello Lilin I performed a density plot using genetic distances but window size is expressed in Mb it is possible to change windows units Thanks in advance Maximiliano Hello Lilin I recently started to use CMplot Its a great package Im trying to make a circular manhattan plot I cant add legend name traits for each circle If I write cirlegendTRUE nothing happens My entire code is colnamescmplot cSNP name Chr Position Z A Z B Z C CMplotcmplot plottype ccolcgrey grey dpi thresholdc e cirlegend Tchrdencolcdarkgreenyellowred signalcolcred cirlegend chrlabelspasteChrc best Maximiliano Hello YinLiLin Thank you very much for this function I have two questions concerning the highlighting of SNPs Is it possible to add names to certain SNPs without changing their colour Of course I could manually write the chromosome colour to the highlightcol vector but is their a way to do this automatically without having to look up the chromosome colour of each SNP first Id like to plot traits with multracks in separate axes and labelhighlight the lead SNPs of each trait ie I need separate highlight vectors for each trait Is that possible Thank you Hi Thank you for providing this excellent tool I got an error in repeating adding gene name can you please give me a favor SNPs pig K pig K nrowpig K genes pasteGENE lengthSNPs sep setseed CMplotpig K c plottypemLOG TRUEcolcgrey grey highlightSNPs highlightcolcredbluegreenhighlightcex highlightpchc highlighttextgenes highlighttextcolcredbluegreenthreshold nrowpig Kthresholdlty amplifyFALSEfilejpgmemodpi fileoutputTRUEverboseTRUEwidth height Error in CMplotpig K c plottype m LOG TRUE col cgrey unused arguments highlighttext genes highlighttextcol cred blue green Thank you very much Best Yiming Hi It would be great if you could add in a function to make stratified QQ plots For instance stratified by bins of infoscore eg and minor allele frequency eg These are great diagnostic tools to review which the best filtering settings are for the data Best Sander Hello I want to change current default unit Mb to Kb but I dont know which parameter I should change Hope your replyThanks Hi YinLiLin I would like to draw a Manhattan Plot to illustrate the distribution of Fst for each chromosome so the range of yaxis should be set from to when I set the ylim as I got this However I wanted to add some scales in this axis so I added some codes behind the plotting code as below axis atseq And I got this How can I fix this issue thanks in advance Best Regards Yong Jian Hi Lilin Hope you are doing good I made nice plots thanks for the package But I am confused about how to provide the space to label each circle I have attached an example file where each circle is labeled as a b c d Example Picture Could you please help me out Kind regards Manjusst
