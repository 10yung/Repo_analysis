I dont think much description is needed here to describe what I saw nonetheless this is what happened git clone Cloning into minix remote Enumerating objects done remote Total delta reused delta packreused Receiving objects MiB KiBs done Resolving deltas done fatal cannot create directory at externalmitxorglibxcbutilaux Invalid argument warning Clone succeeded but checkout failed You can inspect what was checked out with git status and retry the checkout with git checkout f HEAD Happens at all the tries I did today After clone I see only below folders not sure about the rest bin buildsh common crypto dist distrib docs etc external LICENSE Makefile Makefileinc Git status shows rest of them are deleted deleted minixincludeddekitinterrupth deleted minixincludeddekitlockh deleted minixincludeddekitmemoryh deleted minixincludeddekitminixMakefile deleted minixincludeddekitminixmsgqueueh deleted minixincludeddekitminixpcih deleted minixincludeddekitpanich deleted minixincludeddekitpcih deleted minixincludeddekitpgtabh deleted minixincludeddekitprintfh deleted minixincludeddekitresourcesh deleted minixincludeddekitsemaphoreh deleted minixincludeddekitthreadh deleted minixincludeddekittimerh deleted minixincludeddekittypesh deleted minixincludeddekitusbh deleted minixincludelibh deleted minixincludelibddeMakefile deleted minixincludelibddeusbserverh deleted minixincludelibutilh deleted minixincludeminixMakefile deleted minixincludeminixacpih deleted minixincludeminixaudiofwh deleted minixincludeminixbdevh deleted minixincludeminixbitmaph deleted minixincludeminixblockdriverh deleted minixincludeminixblockdrivermth deleted minixincludeminixboardh deleted minixincludeminixbpfh deleted minixincludeminixbtraceh deleted minixincludeminixcallnrh deleted minixincludeminixchardriverh Cross compile failure with Debian The attached static cast corrects the issue and allows Minix to compile successfully miket lsbrelease a No LSB modules are available Distributor ID Debian Description Debian GNULinux buster Release Codename buster Best regards Mike Is there any instructions or docs for crosscompile minix The wiki of crosscompile seems like for the minix or above Minix is a great project I wonder if it is still maintainedWill minix be released later These changes add bounds checks to prevent potential memory corruption issues and information leaks in several places compile libc error compile libcwsetuppico build libclibca build libclibcpica build libclibcso create libcCcat make execgencat failed No such file or directory Error code Stop make stopped in usrsrcliblibc Error code Stop make stopped in usrsrcliblibc Error code Stop make stopped in usrsrclib Error code Stop make stopped in usrsrclib Error code Stop make stopped in usrsrc Error code Stop make stopped in usrsrc how to slove this error Hi I am reading the part of IMPLEMENTATION OF PROCESSES IN MINIX Andrew Tanenbaum third edition and there they mention that all src code is under usrsrc directory I cant find that directory on your repository Any suggestion Steps to reproduce git clone gitkernelubuntucomckingstressng cd stressng CCclang gmake clean CCclang gmake fasttestall leave this to configure build and run Eventually it will crash the kernel Im sorry if this isnt the right place to post this issue but I wanted to bring up this issue as I dont have permissions to edit the corresponding wiki page The download page should be using https links for a urls that use downloadminix org instead of regular http links Also if possible the downloads should maybe start using SHA in addition to MD hashes for additional security This is stemming from this google group discussion about download file security The roadmap shows that someone had been working on Multicore support but I cant find any details about the progress Is there a fork someone can point to or perhaps some threads about the issuesattempts to do so Id love to see where this stands and possibly help it along
