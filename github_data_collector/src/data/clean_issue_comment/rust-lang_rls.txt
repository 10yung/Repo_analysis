See the test case at On line when invoking a function that is supplied by a blanket trait implementation there is no autocomplete although go to definition does work Environment Linux X RHEL VSCode version RLS extension version Rust version rustc e Able to reproduce same behavior with Vim If this is a bug that depends on this bug OR are there any workarounds with the current RLS implementation I was recently experimenting with Kakoune using the kaklsp plugin When I tried to go to references it would only bring up an empty buffer I reported the bug to the plugin but the maintainer says its likely something on the RLS side Does the current version of rls support the Code Folding part of the LSP protocol Removes few old crates from the tree and makes progress towards fixing for good by reducing amount of crates depending on crossbeamutils similar to i dont know if this is a duplicate or so but i tried to search for something similar but didnt find anything The Problem When hovering or just autocompletion it dosnt show something like unwraporelse but something like unwrapor but when i change pub fn unwraporelseF FnOnce Tself f Frust source code to something like pub fn unwraporelseF Stringself f F removing the FnOnce T it magicly shows autocompletion and hover info i know for sure that it is not happening on all generics but only on those who include FnOnce and from what i could test is when defining the function in the same file it needs to get info from it just works Using VSCode Rust rls rustlangrust toolchain nightly project compiled in stable but shouldnt affect rls autocompletion compiled in different terminal OS Linux Mint config rustclientupdateOnStartup true rustunstablefeatures true rustclientchannel nightly usage reproduction rust fn main let Someunwrap autocompletion will only show unwrapor unwrapnone unwrapordefault Howdy Im getting a strange error on OpenBSD I manually built rustup and get this error when rls runs Process rls stderr finished error Unable parse configuration Provided host x unknownopenbsd couldnt be converted to partial triple When I try to cargo install rls from my distros cargo since I get the same error with rustc from rustup I get nothing printed but it returns to stderr ie the program exits as failed with no output I like how I can get type information about the variable under cursor with hover information especially when the type is complicated As an additional information could RLS also retrieve the bytesize of the variable under cursor I believe this information is supposed to be known statically and to be directly dependent on the type so it would not be too complicated Or am I missing something I understand that only the size of data stored on the stack can be retrieved this way but this is fine Hello Im a maintainer of ycmd This issue could very well be a problem on ycmds side but I need your help to figure this out Ycmd issue in question is To explain what is going on ycmd enables rls by installing the entire rust toolchain and rls rustsrc and rustanalysis into ycmdthirdpartyrls However it turned out that this doesnt really work Specifically rls even when run from ycmdthirdpartyrlsbinrls cant find things like VecT to complete Additional info The command line for starting rls is literally pathtoycmdthirdpartyrlsbinrls The point of installing all components to a thirdparty directory is to allow users to simply execute installpy rustcompleter and be done Finally I have two questions Where is ycmd going wrong How can we resolve the issue and keep installing everything into thirdparty Do we have the same problem with the rustanalysis component and were just unaware of it The loadlines method and loadspan methods were returning incorrect regions loadlines was return one line less and loadspan was returning one character less Now that loadlines returns the correct number of lines I updated loadline to use it RLS is stuck in the building or buildscriptbuild phase There is not generated output save for this error any time I save a file Error AM Request textDocumentformatting failed Message Reformat failed to complete successfully Code I tried activate the log file and its always zero bytes nothing is written there How can I debug this issue
