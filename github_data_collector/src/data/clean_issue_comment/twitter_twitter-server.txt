 Problem I would like to update our projects at work to Scala but twitterserver is one of the missing dependencies and this made me sad In order to not be sad anymore I want to do the update myself Solution After adding the version to the build I ran into a couple of compileerrors I mostly replaced mutableMutableList with mutableArrayBuffer and used toSeq and toList where needed to make the code compatible with and There were a few failing tests with main causes The usage of mapValues on a Map produces a lazy collection prior to and a MapView in The latter is serialized incorrectly by Jackson which can be fixed by a call to toMap after mapValues I only found one occurrence in the whole project so I opted for the local fix instead of a more general solution Several tests rely on the ordering of HashMaps in the testcode This is already documented as a bad idea and because of the scala collection rework in some tests started to fail only for In these cases I wrote an assertion which first deserializes the json string using Jackson and compares what Jackson produces This seems to work I tried to keep the changes minimal without really changing the semantic and style of the code for example I would not use mutable collections so freely but I kept it as is I also only refactored the tests that failed instead of the whole test suite I hope this helps Cheers Felix
