Swipe the card on ios and then frozen Does anyone else have this problem Hi everybody first I want to thank you for great plugin Will try to describe my problem I have implemented your plugin and everything works as it should But theres one bug occurring while you are already swiping View If during swiping your app goes to background for example somebody calls you or just for testing hit home button during swipe after returning to app View will stuck somewhere in process off swiping and now its position is calculated as starting for next swiping What is wrong View should return to its starting position before app went to background I attached picture with censored content but just look at cards This is position they have after resuming app mdcbug Bye Inspired by PR which is commits behind modocachemaster and suggestions from vikmeup Is there a way to prevent the MDCSwipeToChooseViews from being removed from their superview after a swipe I would like to keep the views since the user can navigate backwards through the cards in my app Thanks in advance This allows the swipe gestureanimation to work with views that are affected by Autolayout constraints Hi First let me thank you for this projet Second Ive to admit that Im a beginner in iOS dev so please forgive me if Ive forget something obvious After set up my BridgingHeaderh file in my project and declare it in the build settings I got a compilation error xcode Any idea Please replace this file for swift project for enable manually like dislike animation in proper way Major bug have been solved theses last months including autolayout related It could be a good thing to update the cocoapod version or to update the doc with the corresponding pod spec pod MDCSwipeToChoose git Nice job using this lib in already projects Hi I would like to adjust the view based on the view infront of it Basically using the thresholdRatio I want to grow the back view to the size of the front view as you pan I am able to move it in X or Y but cant seem to crack the logic Inputs frontViewframe backViewframe thresholdRatio
