SONAR introduced the concept of small changesets to allow the Quality Gate to ignore certain failing conditions where only a small number of lines had changed This is useful for some scenarios where changes to a single line in code that already contained technical debt would not be feasible to make without large refactoring which would prevent making small changes quickly However this allows technical debt to creep into a codebase over time such as new lines not having any tests to cover them or code smells being introduced as part of minor changes This change introduces a new property to the UI of sonarsmallchangesetmaxlines set at a Global level and allowed to be overridden per project Any changeset that changes less than this number of lines will continue to have certain metrics excluded from Quality Gate checks but any change that changes more than this number of lines will have all their metrics checked To retain backwardscompatibility with the current changeset filtering the default value treats and changeset with less than lines as a small changeset Setting this value to would effectivley force all changesets to have all metrics checked so require all changes to fix any issues that exist on the lines being changed and not to introduce any new issues Please review our contribution guidelines And please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines x Please explain your motives to contribute this change what problem you are trying to fix what improvement you are trying to make x Use the following formatting style SonarSourcesonardevelopertoolset x Provide a unit test for any code you changed x If there is a JIRA ticket available please make your commits and pull request start with the ticket ID SONARXXXX
