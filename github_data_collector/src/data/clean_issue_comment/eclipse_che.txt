 Is your enhancement related to a problem Please describe A clear and concise description of what the problem is Ex Im always frustrated when Im currently trying to run Che on IBM Kubernetes Service IKS When you authenticate against the cluster IKS gives you the following command to run export KUBECONFIGUsersjohncollierbluemixpluginscontainerserviceclusterssomeclusterkubeconfigyml When that command is run your current terminal session will then be configured against that cluster An entry under kubeconfig is not created however when you configure the cluster When I go to run chectl serverstart platformk s installeroperator domaindomain the command fails with the following error johnsmbp johncollier chectl serverstart platformk s installeroperator domaindomain Verify Kubernetes API Failed to connect to Kubernetes API serviceaccounts is forbidden User s Looking for an already existing Che instance Eclipse Che logs will be available in varfolders ts xvrx bb t jpb c gnTchectllogs Error Failed to connect to Kubernetes API serviceaccounts is forbidden User systemanonymous cannot list resource serviceaccounts in API group in the namespace default This is because Che doesnt see the exported Kube config in KUBECONFIG and is trying to install into a different cluster whose context has long since expired Describe the solution youd like A clear and concise description of what you want to happen It would be nice if Chectl supported scenarios where the kube config was exported under the KUBECONFIG environment variable This would allow Chectl to work against Kubernetes platforms like IKS that only provide the user with a Kube config file to export in their terminal It would also be nice as it could also mean users wouldnt have to reconfigure their default Kubernetes context if they wanted to quickly install Che on another cluster Describe alternatives youve considered Manually creating the kube config entry in kubeconfig works but its a hassle and the certificates for the config expire every or so hours so I have redo that step whenever I reconfigure against the cluster Manually installing the Che operator from operatorhub works fine too What should be considered to be done Currently the release job of chepluginbroker only builds and pushes dockerimages It would be nice if it also would push git tag otherwise it should be done manually after each release PS it might be possible only if CentOS CI could provide release script token that can be used for pushing to GitHub Links Additional Context Ask Radim about token we can use here Describe the bug We used to have docswar deployed with Che Server It allows the user to see the documentation that is actual for the Deployed version of Che For some reasons docsche is not available anymore Screenshot Che version if workspace is running version can be obtained with helpabout menu latest x nightly other please specify Steps to reproduce Deploy Che Open Dashboard Click Docs link that is located in the footer of Workspaces page Expected behavior Local Docs site is opened Runtime kubernetes include output of kubectl version Openshift include output of oc version x minikube include output of minikube version and kubectl version x minishift include output of minishift version and oc version dockerdesktop K S include output of docker version and kubectl version other please specify Installation method x chectl please specify the options of chectl tool x cheoperator version of cheoperator minishiftaddon I dont know Environment x my computer Windows x Linux macOS Cloud Amazon Azure GCE other please specify other please specify What does this PR do fixes IdecloseAllNotifications method which was not functional replacing the logic with use of NotificationCenter instead adds a new method IdewaitDialogShell into the Ide class which allows handling of the fullscreen notification overlays adds runTaskWithDialogShell method into the common class which handles tasks that dont have an exit code toast displayed after theyre executed namely webserver containing devfiles adds a new Python Django devfile test fixes some small typos What issues does this PR fix or reference tracking issue for What does this PR do Fixes to update testNG to more actual version What issues does this PR fix or reference Describe the bug I was no able to open workspace with a direct like this img width alt src img width alt src img width alt src Che version if workspace is running version can be obtained with helpabout menu latest x nightly other please specify Steps to reproduce Create a workspace Open a direct link in a separate tab of the browser The workspace is not loaded correctly Expected behavior Workspace loaded correctly Runtime kubernetes include output of

context Add any other context about the problem here Check job on Cent OS infra Is your enhancement related to a problem Please describe A clear and concise description of what the problem is Ex Im always frustrated when As reported by bryantson it appears that the k s plugin in CRW and thus Che requires the yaml extension too Describe the solution youd like A clear and concise description of what you want to happen It seems we need to append this line into this plugins metayaml so that the kubernetes plugin will ALSO load the yaml plugin on startup We should do the same in upstream for Che plugin registry too Describe alternatives youve considered A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the enhancement here To make it easier for us to help you please include as much useful information as possible Useful Links Documentation Contributing Eclipse Che has public chat on Mattermost Before opening a new issue please search existing issues Describe the bug create a project ie cloning and run gradlew in a terminal when using ephemeral on cheopenshiftio it will run out of disk space very quickly with no warning and after that the workspaceUI is just dead Only way out afaicis was to kill the workspace meaning I would have lost my changes Che version if workspace is running version can be obtained with helpabout menu latest nightly x other cheopenshiftio che should not freeze or if it will freeze on out of disk should protect user from taking up the disk space
