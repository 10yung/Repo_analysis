An attempt at resizing the menu when the terminal is resized It seems to be a bit jittery some resizes work some do not It works when first being resized storing the width of the menu Every time it is resized we will attempt to set the original width which will either shrink the menu if the terminal is too small to display it or if the terminal is enlarged it will attempt to display the menu at its original width Needs And is based on top off so can be rebased when that is merged to reduce the diff SplitItem radio works well php use PhpSchool CliMenu Builder SplitItemBuilder use PhpSchool CliMenu CliMenu use PhpSchool CliMenu Builder CliMenuBuilder requireonceDIR vendorautoloadphp menu new CliMenuBuilder setTitleHeader addSplitItemfunction SplitItemBuilder b use itemCallable baddRadioItemItem A function addRadioItemItem B function addRadioItemItem C function build menuopen But its not possible to have multiple groups of RadioItem within the same menu level menu new

function addRadioItemItem C function build menuopen Peek Similarly I want to be able to group nonRadioItem items together Im thinking a nonstyled container item that can take any number of MenuItemInterface items It has the following API addItem addItems setItems removeItem If it contains no items the parent CliMenu displays nothing it is only a container of items and has no styling of its own nor does it affect the UI If it has items it behaves as if those items were defined inline with the parent menu Example menu new CliMenuBuilder addStaticItemHeader addGroupfunction CliMenuBuilder b baddRadioItemItem A function addRadioItemItem B function addRadioItemItem C function addLineBreak addStaticItemHeader addGroupfunction CliMenuBuilder b baddRadioItemItem A function addRadioItemItem B function addRadioItemItem C function build menuopen This would look identical to the GIF above If no items are defined menu new CliMenuBuilder addStaticItemHeader addGroupfunction CliMenuBuilder b baddRadioItemItem A function addRadioItemItem B function addRadioItemItem C function addLineBreak addStaticItemHeader addGroupfunction CliMenuBuilder b build menuopen then it acts as if the group isnt defined at all This will help group RadioItems in a vertical manner without needing to use SplitItem and allow grouping other item types for nonMenu work In addition I would suggest changing RadioItemgetSelectAction to use this group feature to disable other items within the same group vs using SplitItem If the radio item does not belong to a group behave as it already does and toggle off other radio items within the same CliMenu object edit Thinking about this for initial PR it would be good to keep it simple and not give this class any styling at all Simply a container nothing else but I could see it expending to keeping its own copy of styles and applying them to any children items So this would basically end up being a submenu thats visible on the current menu without needing to select an item to view the children items within Currently all items are on the same vertical level Example Title Static Item Item Item Item Item Static Item Item Item Item Item Static Item Item Item Item Exit Using line breaks makes it a little easier to separate elements Example Title Static Item Item Item Item Item Static Item Item Item Item Item Static Item Item Item Item Exit This works fine but could be better What do you think about an itemIndent vlaue in the MenuStyle that is applied only to SelectItem RadioItem and CheckableItem Example Title Static Item Item Item Item Item Static Item Item Item Item Item Static Item Item Item Item Exit The indentation helps visually separate what is an actionable item and what is mostly text description Peek Let me know if this is something that would be interesting Ive got it implemented but needs some testing for the StringUtilwordwrap function that calculates terminal width and breaks up lines Seems like the naming of items is a bit weird Im new to the project so maybe I simply need to become acquainted a bit more to understand I will be talking specifically about these items Static Item Seems a Text name would be more accurate Nonselectable just displays whatever is defined and prints a new line Ascii Art Item Block Im trying to map these names out to more common elements in HTML or otherwise The current name seems far too restrictive for what it can actually be used for These two are pretty simple but theyre more structure type elements I feel having everything named Item can be confusing to a developer Sub Menu Item Why not rename this to simply Menu Item This makes it clear that a menu is completely made up of menus Instead of CliMenuBuilderaddSubMenu it seems clearer when it is called CliMenuBuilderaddMenu While Im on the subject CliMenuBuilder should be renamed MenuBuilder The whole project is CLIbased calling it a CliMenuBuilder adds confusion Split Item This one is the toughest to wrap your mind around You have both a SplitItemBuilder and SplitItem Why not make it so SplitItem creates a horizontalstyle menu Any items added are displayed on a horizontal line vs vertical Right now youve blacklisted the following AsciiArtItem LineBreakItem SplitItem But making it so SplitItem is simply a direction directive display the contained items horizontally vs vertically thered be no reason you couldnt add any other type of item that the normal CliMenu can contain LineBreakItem could be made to repeat vertically vs horizontally I think that SplitItems responsibilities should also be split up or a new element type created to allow creating new sidebyside blocks The way the menu works is very much in a vertical manner Awesome Vertical Menu Item Item Item Go Back Exit This makes sense CLI tools go up and down When you add a SplitItem it changes it to be completely horizontal Awesome Horizontal Menu Sub Item Go Back Exit So instead of having an eitheror horizontalvertical you can actually start defining blocks of menus Awesome Mixed Menu Section Section Section Item Item Item Go Back Exit Ive not tried implementing this last feature but reading through your Terminal and SplitItem classes it seems youve got at least most of the groundwork down Youd basically create sidebyside blocks that contain vertical elements Thoughts Hello Im trying to set up the width of an

total width of the terminal but in my case the maximum width of the terminal always returns zero for some reason the getWidth function can not get the actual width of the terminal I suggest setting a

trying to use your cli which is very nice tool but Im having a problem When Im pasting a text it is being reduced For example if I paste CSLAD the cli return CSLAD The weird thing is that if I press space the last character appears Can anyone help me with this issue Allow each menu item to have custom bgfg colours Allow each menu item to have their own custom markerextra Add a position argument to all Items to center them or put them on the right Allow userdefined width for each cell of a SplitItem number of cols or Add a width to LineBreakItems number of cols or just to make things a bit more easy I prefer LineBreakItem than StaticItemstrrepeat Markdown or something else support for boldunderline italic isnt supported much unfortunatly and oftens turn out dimmed instead Method to disablemodify default controls arrows and such not everyone wants Space to work as Enter Add an easy way to select a specific item from a menu currently having to use the correct index from getItems Add disable and enable methods to SelectableTrait See
