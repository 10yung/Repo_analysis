I am using BLKFlexibleHeightBar in my application which supports all device orientations in iPhone X When I go from portrait to landscape mode I want to adjust bar height want to make smaller Apparently I am not able to change the height after initialization I am able to change everything x y width but the height Any help Hi Thanks you for great library I need use it in a child of tabberController but it not work as expect It seem the SquareCashStyleBehaviorDefiner did not add to top of child view You can see my attack to know more information screen shot at Thanks you When I scroll webview it shows like this simulator screen shot default Any ideas how to solve this GitHub changed the way Markdown headings are parsed so this change fixes it See bryant readmesfix for more information Tackles bryant readmesfix bryankeller Any thoughts to support carthage dependency management So we have UITableView which is used in our app and FacebookStyleBarBehaviorDefiner perfectly matches our requirements but we have one issue Our UITableView is aable to load more stuff pagination While we load new page contentOffset changes and BLKFlexibleHeightBar is presented out of nothing which creates this weird behavior Looks like this code is responsible for whats happening objc voidscrollViewDidScrollUIScrollView scrollView ifselfisCurrentlySnapping CGFloat deltaYOffset scrollViewcontentOffsety selfpreviousYOffset CGFloat deltaProgress deltaYOffset selfflexibleHeightBarmaximumBarHeightselfflexibleHeightBarminimumBarHeight selfflexibleHeightBarprogress selfpreviousProgress deltaProgress selfflexibleHeightBar setNeedsLayout So when I log what values do I have there Ive noticed that at some point deltaYOffset is negative when it shouldnt while Im scrolling to the bottom Ive changed this so I always get positive number there but then I wasnt able to scroll to the top to see the bar again Any ideas how to solve this I have a UITabBarController with view controllers embedded in NavigationViewControllers Can I use this in a view controller embedded in a NavigationController inside a TAbBarController So its no need to use delegate splitter Also adds new example scene to demonstrate scene assembly in storyboard With proposed delegate property in BLKFlexibleHeightBarBehaviorDefiner anyone can easily create delegate chains Eg when a UITableView sets its delegate to an instance of BLKFlexibleHeightBarBehaviorDefiner but also wants another object to act as the UITableViewDelegate you can write something like this myBarbehaviorDefinerdelegate anotherObject selftableViewdelegate idUITableViewDelegatemyBarbehaviorDefiner
