Ive fixed implementation of QuickSort New implementation ensures On log n complexity for case when array contains duplicates Old realisation provided quadratic time for such cases Ive added tests to check QuickSort with different cases with duplicates with different array sized already sorted array Hello Ive found some issues in LinkedList implementation Ive added this in LinkedListswift func remove counter added for deleting first element func insert return added for inserting to non valid index Also Ive added two new tests LinkedTestswift func testAddLinkAtIndex fix trie search can not finds all possible words issue nt of This crash can be reproduced by creating a new LinkedList adding a value and then immediately removing it The crash occurs because headnext is nil Additionally I moved the index check before the initialization of current as it doesnt need to use it I can change the ternary operator to an ifstatement if you think its more readable
