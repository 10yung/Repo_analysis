 Bug Reports Based on this document I tried npm install but seems that there is a problem with the dependencies To let npminstall work i had to change in packagejson this line rolluppluginmultientry githubarshawrolluppluginmultientrydist that is moved and no longer supported to this rolluppluginmultientry and also change his reference into rollupconfigjs const multiEntry requirerolluppluginmultientry Feature Requests The validRange option perfectly works for dates But there is nothing like that for timecells Yes Im aware of minTime option but it is kinda static parameter I think it will be very useful if validRange option works for timecells in timeGridDay view For example I want valid time only greater than now moment ie I dont want the cells with time lesser than now be activeselectableclickable Reported in Using the example from the docs renderSkeleton does not get called Information about bug Version Framework Vue also reproducible on Vanilla version Codepen Reproduction steps Initialise a minimal fullcalendar as documented Add some events Define a custom eventTimeFormat with omitZeroMinute false Expected behaviour Events previously displayed as p event name turn into p event name Actual behavior Events are displayed as MMDDYYYY event name Why am i expecting my described behaviour None of the above properties are required You may provide an assortment of these properties and the browser will do the best job it can to produce a string with all this information I expect to be able to set omitZeroMinute without redefining all the other possible dateformatting properties I want to preserve all locale settings loaded previously but I want to make sure that no matter what the locale is it never omits zeros Edit Since you are using IntlDateTimeFormat nowadays i should mention some affected browsers Safari on macOS Chrome on macOS Firefox on macOS Firefox on Windows Browserstack Didnt find any browser where it works as expected Feature Requests Request for a single callback when an event is dragged and dropped over another event just like eventDrop Issue with eventOverlap is it emits continuous events when an events is dragged over another event which is great for disabling the overlap based on some condition But there is no way to get a single callback like event drop when an event is dropped over another I want to show a confirmation popover based on data present in both events eventDrop does not have information on which event is dropped on which event ReactVueAngularetc Angular Hi In my use case and in any example I found column width is not the same everywhere Ex For a calendar of px with columns first are at px and last one at px Why column width is not px for the In my particular use case I have a dayGridWeek overlaped by my own component and so the columns are not matched Thank you for your great job here Hi Im trying to use the trial version of the scheduler addon I added the libraries from the file fullcalendarscheduler zip to the project with the Script Tags method but when i try to use it with mootoolscore JS it gives an error in the browser console like this jserror As you can see the schedular library tries to use to mootoolscore js library I tried it with the given verticalresourceviewhtml example It works good without the mootoolscore js but when i add the mootoolscore library it gives an error like on the picture Is there a solutions for this problem thanks The fact that the json event source caches the events leads to the following when an json call fails that already cached events are shown This can be ok in one case and bad even dangerous in another depending on the desired implementation A general solution of this specific problem and a nice option to have would be to implement an explicit Clear cache method that can be called on event source failure if desired It would be good if the method has a parameter that defines if calendar rerender should happen after the cache is cleared Also some granularity would be also nice like optionally defining a period for which the cache to be cleared In general opening the cache access would be great for flexibility Apart from cleaning the cache a way to inject data in the cache would be also nice This would allow preloading the cache for json sources which would spare an ajax call on page load I use fullcalender to show events in the resourceTimelineWeek I show the start time and the end time When the eventTextColor is not white and the event duration is very small it will show the end time ouside the border of the event You can see this in the next codepen example I need the black eventTextColor because i show some events on a white foreground example I have a setup where the user can select which resources to show in calendar dynamically This works well and out of the box for the resource view but in monthweekday views nothing changes it even breaks the eventLimit on resources change but that is a different story that I cant reproduce for now So in short there is filterResourcesWithEvents but what about filterEventsWithResources
