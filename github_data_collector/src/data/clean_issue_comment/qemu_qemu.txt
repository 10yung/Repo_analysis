 Thats what i need Thanks Found this information was needed when using my scanner as it kept incrementing the hostport with every sleepwake cycle knocking it off my running VM Hello Ive implemented a simple SP like timer peripheral compatible with Broadcoms BCM x BCM specification and is a singletimer version of the actual SP without support for oneshot mode It doesnt have support for freerunning counter and other nonSP features though
