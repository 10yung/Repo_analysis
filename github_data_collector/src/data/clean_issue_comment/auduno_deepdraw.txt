Is there some method to support other frameworks like Tensorflow Pytorch Hi Have you tried running DeepDraw with other net architectures For example Ive been able to run it with the ResNet targeting the Softmax layer but Im not getting useful visualizations Any suggestion on how to modify the octaves parameters Thank you
