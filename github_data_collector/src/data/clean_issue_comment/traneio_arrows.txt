Hello Im running into this issue not sure if Im doing something wrong or not scala import ivyiotranearrowsstdlib import arrowsstdlib import scalaconcurrent import scalaconcurrentExecutionContextImplicitsglobal import scalaconcurrentduration AwaitresultFuturesequenceListFuturefirstCompletedOfListFuturesuccessful DurationInf List TasksequenceListTaskfirstCompletedOfListTaskasyncFuturesuccessful run javalangClassCastException javabase LjavalangObject cannot be cast to LscalaconcurrentFuture arrowsstdlibArrowImplSequencerunSyncArrowImplscala arrowsstdlibArrowRunapplyArrowRunscala arrowsstdlibArrowrunArrowscala Is there any plans of providing backend Current stdlib lacks of some useful features I know of how you feel of having Cats as dependency but providing catseffect integration in a different subproject would be cool Consider that cool libraries like Monix FS Http s Doobie and others now have catseffect integration and would be usable with your Task implementation if those type class instances are provided You also get tests for free via catseffectlaws so it would be a win at least for that
