spinjs file at all Heres the structure of gems folder Screenshot from But old version does have spinjs file Screenshot from Thats why in my project I have such error couldnt find file spinjs with type applicationjavascript docs say require mozillapdfjs require jquery require jqueryujs require turbolinks However this did not work by digging through the gem I had to do require pdfjsjs require jquery require jqueryujs require turbolinks Also I have come across issues post requiring this Uncaught ReferenceError require is not defined I believe this gem needs built with the prebuilt pdfjsdist Gem metadata methods have changed Local builds of railsasset gems were failing with an error NoMethodError undefined method abbreviate for GemIndexer x f f The abbreviate and sanitize methods were moved to the GemSpecification class in version Ive adjusted the worker code to handle the class correctly with the current version However I couldnt get this to work without updating the Ruby version or make it work with newer versions than because I dont have time to track down all the potential issues I see this PR as a minor bugfix but the whole thing should be updated to a more recent Ruby version I do not know if this will also fix the pathString issue described in because I was unable to reproduce that issue locally but I think it is a distinct possibility Hello Id like to invite you
