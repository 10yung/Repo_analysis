Is your feature request related to a problem or area of OpenRefine Please describe It could be useful to have a a menu and a GREL function to remove diacritics in strings Ex cole ecole Opening a pull request to make it easier to draft this policy here Members of the steering committee are requested to take note of a conflict of interest policy when joining We should write one perhaps in this repository alongside with GOVERNANCEmd As part of the onboarding process to CS S we have created advisory and steering committees The GOVERNANCEmd document in this repository should reflect that Describe the bug Sometimes when I hit Export to QuickStatements it just throws an empty window without any text to copy to QuickStatements If I go back look again at the schema without editing it change views a couple of times then try to export again this time it seems to work Sorry cant be more precise but its happened several times to me today Possibly related to on at least some of the occasions it is possible I had restarted OpenRefine gone to an existing project with an existing schema To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Go to Click on Scroll down to See error Current Results What results occured or were shown Expected behavior A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen or to show Screenshots If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem Desktop please complete the following information OS Windows release Browser Version Chrome JRE or JDK Version JRE OpenRefine please complete the following information Version OpenRefine rc Datasets If you are allowed and are OK with making your data public it would be awesome if you can include or attach the data causing the issue or a URL pointing to where the data is If you are concerned about keeping your data private ping us on our mailing list Additional context Add any other context about the problem here rc Windows Chrome After running reconciliation if I choose new match then search for match put in a specific Qnumber to search for then select it the old match is discarded but the new match isnt added and the row goes into the reconciliation none facet We will need to support both x and x versions of OpenRefine in the future and be able to handle Documentation Security Patches and perhaps using GitHubs Security Policy doc as I mentioned in PR now closed with granular semantic versions majorminorpatch wetneb had suggested previously in that PR that we should probably do the following Given our current workflows we are basically not able to release fixes for any previous version We would need to use branches for the major versions we want to support on the long term Thats definitely something we can consider Each security patch would be merged in all supported major release branches to create the corresponding versions That would probably mean using more granular release numbers such as Verify that our chosen documentation system has support for Semantic Versioning Decide on supported versions and branching Verify that GitHubs Security Policy doc works on those supported branches I created an Age column based on date columns using the greldiff function with unit years I was able to create both Text and Numeric facets on this new Age column I am not sure what its Type was Where dates were missing in either of the date columns the age column cells showed up as blank which was good Made some fixes in some cells certain datesages were wrong and I blanked out age in those cells In this step I have to treat the value as text If I try to blank out the cell changing type to Numeric I get an error When I restarted server the next day I was not able to create a numeric facet anymore on the Age column It says no numeric value present I am guessing it has to do with the blanked out cells now set as Text type So now each time I restart server to use the numeric facet I transform all cells in Age using toNumber Which then doesnt allow me to edit and blank out cells with mistakes This seems to have been reported before as I am using the linux beta build Please add a new common transform called Clean Html to OpenRefine GREL Command htmlTextparseHtmlvalue Since Version beta the preview screen after submitting a SQLStatement to load data from my local installed PSQLdatabase runs into an infinite loop Using Version everything works fine Unfortunately in the terminal windows there are no errors displayed during this error Running OpenRefine on Ubuntu
