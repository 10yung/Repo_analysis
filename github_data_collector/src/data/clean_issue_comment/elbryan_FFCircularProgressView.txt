Please can you do a new cocoapods release The latest pod version isnt in sync with the latest code in the repo Add a flag called hideCompletionIcon that skips the drawing of the check mark upon completion Adds a flag for using a play icon instead of download icon I would like an option to use this control in indeterminate mode A ring spins around but does not actually show progress This could be our UIActivityIndicator replacement MBProgressHUD support both determinate and indeterminate modes which is nice Food for thought using FFCircularProgressView makes table view slow on ipad we show about instances of FFCircularProgressView and scrolling is slow any ideas how to speed up Hi having an upload arrow would be a nice addition Ren i did this but its not clean at all
