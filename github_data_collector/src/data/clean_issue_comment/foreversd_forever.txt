I am trying to run my Typescript app with command forever start v c tsnode srcindexts and it was say running but when I run forever list it was nothing my app running not list can I know why do I make something wrong command I am trying to run foreverjs via the Windows command prompt and I get the following output npm i g forever myprojectforever start indexjs Log output C Program is not recognized as an internal or external command operable program or batch file I think its something to do with the PATH that forever is using for the node binary but I dont know how to fix it Link to my question on Stack Overflow When I run the command sudo npm install forever g I get this error log npm ERR Linux aws npm ERR argv usrbinnode usrbinnpm install forever global npm ERR node v npm ERR npm v npm ERR

react process but forever daemon is killed from time to time clearing all the forever processes Node Version forever Version System info arch x platform win type WindowsNT That PR adds support for exitOnFail or x parameter node nodemodulesbinforever minUptime spinSleepTime m x somescriptjs When you run the forever script with that param like in the example and the somescriptjs fails times the forever script will exit from the process with code This might be a feature idea if it doesnt already exist Iwas wondering if there is any way to setup forever to send an alert via email when a chosen process has STOPPED for example due to an error preventing the code from running I recently had this problem of a missing module which caused the process to stop and not be able to restart due to a module dependency that had somehow changed i have install forever successfully but not able to run it SOODEEA NLEUFSMC MINGW cSMCsmcadconnect npm install forever global C Users SOODEEA AppData Roaming

startbotservice file should be executed one minute after booting The startbotservice says ExecStartbinbash usrlocalbinstartbot The startbot script looks as following after several tries su alarm c cd projectfolderanotherfolder forever start indexjs The first attempt was cd homealarmprojectfolderanotherfolder forever start indexjs The second would probably be enough but I tried some different stuff When I run the script via command line alarmalarm usrlocalbinstartbot everything works as expected However when I reboot the raspberry pi with an arch linux distro need this for bit OS no forever process is running When I check what happend with the service I type alarmalarm systemctl status startbotservice This says that all worked fine and the service terminated with code SUCCEED Also the output says startbotservice starts the startbot script Loaded loaded etcsystemdsystemstartbotservice static vendor preset disabled Active inactive dead since Fri CEST s ago Process ExecStartbinbash usrlocalbinstartbot codeexited status SUCCESS Main PID codeexited status SUCCESS Aug alarm systemd Started starts the startbot script Aug alarm su to alarm root on none Aug alarm su pamunixsul session

alarm bash info Forever processing file indexjs Aug alarm su pamunixsul session session closed for user alarm Aug alarm systemd startbotservice Succeeded Then when I type forever list it just says no process is running and the server is also not running So its no problem just with forever list as often mentioned in other Issues here also when trying the script as root like rootalarm alarm binbash usrlocalbinstartbot Everything thing works just fine and as expected only when executing the scipt after reboot via systemd wont work I am using node js script to start and stop I am able to start server successfullyWhen I try to stop it then it is hanging and no time out for it to come out of it After running stop command when I see the forever list my server is shown as STOPPED data asNZ UsersTestnvmversionsnodev binnode userserverjs UsersTestLibraryLogstestforeverlog STOPPED And then I have to run the command again to stop the server Is there a way to timeout this stop
