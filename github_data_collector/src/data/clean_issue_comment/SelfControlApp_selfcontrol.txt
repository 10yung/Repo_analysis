I ran into the same issue as after happily using Self Control on several different devices The only things that were different than usual were that I set the time to Day and the lid was down when the time passed After the day had more than fully elapsed Self Control was Off and had no window visible but the websites were still inaccessible I tried all the steps listed fully uninstalled Self Control killed the Self Control process that was running and double checked the etchosts file to make sure that the addresses had been removed Still couldnt access those sites Rebooting solved the issue so the blocks must have been stored in a temporary file somewhere as the poster indicated or in memory I dont feel like pulling apart the Self Control app to figure out why this happened but it might be worth investigating as a few of my friends have run into the same issue and been mystified as to why This will allow us to test our new blacklist without having to wait minutes Could this be fixed theoretically by using a timer that is not local maybe an internet based time Or having an internal timer that isnt based on the computers time settings Potential fix for issue mentioned here Culprit unsatisfiable constraints causing nondeterministic behaviour as AppKit attempts to resolve conflicting restraints Fix set constraints on bordered scroll view rather than table view img width altScreen Shot at PM src Ive noticed this primarily with sites that are run from the same companynetwork For example if I block Facebookcom WhatsApp doesnt work Has anyone else experienced this Is this anyway around this Right now I have no idea how to use the whitelist function and still keep the Spotify and Dropbox apps running Would be nice If you could select apps to block not to block Some of my blocks are circumvented in Firefox with DNS over HTTPS turned on Strangely enough one of these blocks theguardiancom which was previously circumvented now isnt after putting the full url into the blacklist Whats going on here Is this something thats fixable When a block is running and trying to add a new site the message Error Attempting to add host to block but no block appears to be in progress is displayed Occurred when running a long block attempting to uninstall and reinstalling Fixed bug where a user could easily use this control path to cause SelfControl to remove existing block session giving easy backdoor So I wanted to start writing a script to start a block according to my schedule So I looked up how to start a block in the terminal and I found that if you run this command in the terminal sudo ApplicationsSelfControlappContentsMacOSorgeyebeamSelfControl id u whoami install it will start a block But my problem is I mistakenly ran this command twice while the block was active then suddenly it cleared my current block You can see this here This is a major problem for me because now my brain knows a way to get out of the block If I ever need to go onto YouTube or something I find myself just clearing the block Can this be fixed
