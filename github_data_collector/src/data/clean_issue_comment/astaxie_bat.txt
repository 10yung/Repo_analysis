The current bat help message says ITEM Can be any of Query string keyvalue Header keyvalue Post data keyvalue File upload keypathfile I was trying to send a JSON number and thought that it was not possible until I read the readme for bat and found that it was possible using the keyvalue syntax It would be great to see that syntax documented in the help message Ive tried go build ldflags extldflags fnoPIC static buildmode pie tags osusergo netgo staticbuild and go build ldflags extldflags fPIC static buildmode pie tags osusergo netgo staticbuild Both get issues with trying to link usrlocalgopkgtoollinuxamd link running gcc failed exit status usrbinld usrlibgccx linuxgnu x linuxgnulibpthreadapthreadcreateo relocation RX against rodatastr can not be used when making a shared object recompile with fPIC usrlibgccx linuxgnu x linuxgnulibpthreada error adding symbols Bad value collect error ld returned exit status I dont want a shared object I want a selfcontained static binary that I can use in a Docker container FROM scratch Every exported function in a program should have a doc comment The first sentence should be a summary that starts with the name being declared From effective go PR generated by CodeLingo Install here to drive Continuous Higher Standards I need to post JSON containing Lucene queries that tends to contain colons Eg qcmtitlefoo That did not work though bat tries to parse it as a header and then complains about the equal sign There is an issue open for this I dont much like this solution I think the function is too compliated as is But I could not come up with anything simpler and Ive been using this for a week now Reading bat attempts to parse stdin as JSON and when it succeeds the body content may be different to what was originally submitted For example if that content has been previously used to calculate a signature such as HMACSHA then the signature may no longer be valid In practice when POSTing a file and adding its HMAC as a header bat effectively appends x a and its possible that the final output JSON may be altered I havent yet checked this but it could have different keyobject order or changed keys as JSON allows repeated keys within objects I can understand if this is intended behaviour but it took a surprisingly long time to realise this was the case and track it down Id propose that PoLA should apply for content from stdin and it not be altered or at least only if the jsontrue flag has been specified One of my main use cases for curl is to check if https is setup correctly Having a flag to show certificate information would be very useful Example from curl SSL connection using TLSv ECDHEECDSAAES GCMSHA ALPN server accepted to use http Server certificate subject CUS STCalifornia LMountain View OGoogle Inc CNgooglecom start date Jan GMT expire date Apr GMT subjectAltName host googlecom matched certs googlecom issuer CUS OGoogle Inc CNGoogle Internet Authority G SSL certificate verify ok Also having curl resolve functionality would be super handy Thanks for creating a nice tool
