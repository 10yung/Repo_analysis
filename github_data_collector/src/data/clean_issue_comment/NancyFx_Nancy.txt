Nuget has version but there is no tag this version Is last commit in xWork Branch equivalent to version Prerequisites X I have written a descriptive issue title X I have verified that I am running the latest version of Nancy X I have verified if the problem exist in both DEBUG and RELEASE mode X I have searched open and closed issues to ensure it has not already been reported and look similar but are not related Description As mentioned in the thread compiling Razor views takes time With the latest package from Nuget I found that launching the compiler for the first view takes seconds and each additional view needs around ms to compile This is an issue for a Nancy server in an application that users launch and expect to work with as quickly as possible I understand that with the current Nancy architecture Razor views need to be compiled after each start of an application To ensure that a desktop application starts as quickly as possible I came up with a workaround that involves calling GetOrCompileView by reflection and a IViewCache implementation which writes the compiled assemblies to disk and loads them on subsequent starts Rather hacky to say the least What I would like Get some feedback if there is a more straightforward way to avoid repeated view compilation If there is none have better support in the Nancy framework for caching compiled Razor views Steps to Reproduce Create project with NancyHostingSelfNancyHost and RazorViewEngine with a route returning a Razor view Start application Open page in browser takes several seconds to respond System

that without replacing the full serializer first Im trying to emulate an api that do something stupid so I need to do the same stupid thing All numeric values except float from their api are converted
