 The following also allow code exec in PHP passthru procopen popen backticks cmd I came across this endpoint in the wild it was called by a Swagger UI to render the documentation for an API Can we add this to one of the lists I didnt want to open a PR as I dont know which file maybe more than would be best Maybe DiscoveryWebContentquickhitstxt or FuzzingfuzzBo oMtxt The latter one already has apiswaggeruihtml swaggeruihtml swaggerjson etc which are related Hi How about to create wordlist in DiscoveryWebContentCMS with unique endpoints of most popular CMSs to fingerprint usage of them It should contain nonsecurityimpact endpoints than usually should not be hidden such as common static file paths etc in the reason of most accurate fingerprinting Lots of apps have requirements for passwords to be complex and contain upper lowercase special character and to be at least chars long So brute forcing any of them with passwords that wont satisfy those requirements is pointless until we are targeting old account with unchanged passwords in apps that didnt require users to change them So I thought it would be a good idea to create a list of complex passwords for that purpose at least that could be done by searching those passwords inside present common lists the best option will be to search leaked DBs for complex passwords since they wont appear in most top list because they probably are less common than million others Ive got this cloned onto my system and the directory takes up M of which M is the git directory This seems excessive Might it be worthwhile to run garbage collection and pruning to reduce this down a bit Or is there a valid reason to keep it all that Im missing Maybe run something like what is suggested here Many of the XSS payload files are not directly consumable by fuzzing applications such as Burp Intruder I think it would be great if there were seperate fuzzing files to the discussion files For example Marios XSS file is AWESOME and so advanced that its akin to magic but it takes a bit of work to use within tools How best to help you guys with this
