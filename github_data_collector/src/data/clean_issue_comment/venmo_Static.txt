There are a number of issues from a couple years ago plus PRs ready for review that havent been looked at in awhile Just wondering if this library is still being actively maintained None Hi I am looking for of these things A way to set detailText inside selection Another library with the amazing simplicity but not just for static tables ypyearSelectedsubscribeonNext year in selfsettingsyear year Set Value Here disposedby selfdisposeBag Rowtext Change Year detailText year selection selfpresentyp animated true accessory disclosureIndicator Access to the the row data including the context dictionnary within this handler can be useful Hello I am using a Row with UISwitch as seen in the example project here However when scrolling down the table and then up again the switch loses its on state Tested straight from example project p aligncenterimg src width height p Is this due to cell reusing How can I preserve switch state on scroll Thanks EDIT This is the way Im using it Am I doing something wrong var value Bool false Rowtext UISwitch accessory switchTogglevalue selfvalue unowned self newValue in selfvalue newValue How do i implement a search bar Not sure it this was intentional but the the old sections were not being passed to the refreshTableSections method preventing the incremental updating behaviour that appears to already be implemented Also note that I made the sections argument of the refreshTableSections method nonnull because the property on the data source is also nonnull This answers the question mentioned here As reported in I decided to make small PR with possibility to quickly access two methods of UITableViewDelegate tableView willDisplayHeaderView forSection tableView willDisplayFooterView forSection The reason we need to have the simplest possibility to access those method is that UIKit somehow overrides header view appearance for UITableViewHeaderFooterVIew and those two methods can be used for configuring headerfooter correctly The solution here is to provide two closures dataSourcewillDisplayHeader UIView Int Void dataSourcewillDisplayFooter UIView Int Void I wish we could have better architecture for that than just a properties with closures but this solution fulfills two most important requirements provides expected feature dont introduce any breaking change into Static Hello Thanks again for sharing this Im trying to present a view controller with a Popover style when the user touches the DetailButton inside a cell The thing is i havent found yet a solution to get the sourceRect or the accessoryView itself swift accessory DetailButton unowned self in let detailButton Thats what i need let vc UIViewController vcmodalPresentationStyle Popover vcpreferredContentSize CGSizewidth height vcpopoverPresentationControllersourceView detailButton vcpopoverPresentationControllersourceRect detailButtonbounds vcpopoverPresentationControllerpermittedArrowDirections Any vcpopoverPresentationControllerdelegate self selfpresentViewControllervc animated true completion nil Anyone have a solution to this since we dont have any arguments in the Selection closure Thanks
