 Added framework and test schemes for each supported platform Made the schemes Shared for Carthage support Deintegrated CocoaPods Added the Kiwi dependency as a git submodule Bumped the pod version Raised the minimum deployment version to to support bitcode It is a special implementation in some kind Many people try to make tons of code in swift in super fast network json parsing DI etc I cant find any appropriate implementation of state machine for objectivec This one is the best Or even only one I would like to help Installing version with Pod TKStateMachineh and TKStateMachinem are different from what I see in Github and dotDescription property is not available Hello please merge my commit for support events with same name Added dynamic framework targets for OS X and iOS Shared and added schemes to repository Resolves Is there any interest in adding Carthage support At a glance it seems like it should be compatible with TransitionKits current use of CocoaPods since its used only for test targets rather than being a dependency As far as I can tell the changes necessary would be to add a framework target and a shared scheme Thanks for the great tool Just a simple addition that allows the addition of events using notation Example from the README file inboxStateMachine addEventWithNotationDeletedUnDeleteRead Which adds an event named UnDelete for transitions from the Deleted state to the Read state I found this useful and more visual in my opinion The user can comma separate the source states inboxStateMachine addEventWithNotationReadDeletedMark as UnreadRead Added a few tests to accomodate the new changes Hope everything is up to standard Cheers Hisham This PR implements a possible solution for the requirement described in The external interface of TKEvent changed slightly destinationState destinationStates so existing code might break We appreciate your feedback Overview This PR addresses the changes suggested in this issue to release a new version of the pod that included the latest commits In particular this PR bumps the existing version to Testing The cocoapods version used was as opposed to used in the previous version v was released here and the PR containing the change on TKState merged here Are you planning on releasing v with the latest changes added Thanks
