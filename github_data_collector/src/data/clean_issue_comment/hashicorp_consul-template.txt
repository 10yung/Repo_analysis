Hello Notification enabled for hashicorpconsultemplate about release see joined file but nothing received github comhashicorpconsultemplatereleases hashicorpterraform notifications about releases works whats wrong with hashicorpconsultemplate Regards This PR aims to introduce a new configuration value allowing custom block query timeout I would appreciate feedback on this as Im not sure if I have covered all the necessary bases Closes When working on consultemplate I find myself switching between log levels quite a bit and having to keep editing scripts or commands If it supported an environment variable for setting the loglevel it would make this much easier The cli argument should override the environment variables My initial proposed variable name is CONSULTTEMPLATELOGLEVEL though that is a bit long this will compute the sha hash function and output the hex version of it tests and doc updated how to use liquide bladibla sha Hex this will output cf c bcabb c e c dd b e a bd d a e b b d b This can be handy when for instance computing the amount of services to spawn depending on some numeral characteristics contained in consul and default values Add support for Consul namespaces following the same pattern as for Vault namespaces Depends on code in consuls master branch unreleased So wont build unless you update the modules dependencies to the correct master commit Once the upstream code is released the module dependencies will be updated and added to this PR How about adding some string functions such as hasPrefix hasSuffix regexpMatch EDIT Oh I see theres regexpMatch which should cover all other cases But maybe its still worth to add these simple ones as most programming languages have them without regexes Consul Template version consultemplate v cf d cfg tpl working liquid define somejson ds metadata localipv end id executeTemplate somejson parseJSON index index idds metadata localipv consultemplate dry once templatecfg tpl works as expected returning Configuration fails consultemplate dry once templatecfg tpl fails with ERR cli cfg tpl execute template executing at index idds metadata error calling index index of untyped nil cfg tpl liquid id file instancedatajson parseJSON index index idds metadata localipv instancedatajson same as somejson template above json ds metadata localipv Configuration fails consultemplate dry once templatecfg tpl fails with ERR cli cfg tpl execute template executing at index idds metadata error calling index index of untyped nil cfg tpl liquid define filejson file instancedatajson end id executeTemplate filejson parseJSON index index idds metadata localipv instancedatajson As above Expected behavior Should have gotten same output regardless of source of JSON Actual behavior Ability to access JSONparsed map structure is dependent upon source of JSON This is a proof of concept PR that includes the helper functions from the Sprig library Because there are some name conflicts the sprig functions are renamed function sprig in cases where there is an existing consultemplate function Consul is growing namespaces like Vault already has This is a placeholder for adding support for it to consultemplate Ill edit it with more details once I have them
