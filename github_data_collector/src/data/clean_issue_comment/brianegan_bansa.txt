 This is awesome Wondering if this is still maintained It would be a shame if not Theres no other redux implementation in java as good as this Hello thank you for introducing Redux to Android world Im using bansa with Anvil and I think they are a very good match But I noticed one thing if we call BaseStoredispatch from multiple thread its possible to get inconsistent state within one dispatch cycle since we cant pass the new state to Anvilrender We could only use BaseStoregetState in each view I noticed that you use locks in this line and getState But they both lock on different objects synchronizedthis locks on Middleware instance while public synchronized S getState locks on BaseStore instance But I think although we use locks there is still a chance for inconsistent state since dispatch and getState will not be called in one block Do you think we should only call dispatch in one thread Maybe using a single background thread to do it Ill be grateful to hear your thoughts about this Thank you very much Follow the advice in the readme and update the docs to include a more stepbystep guide
