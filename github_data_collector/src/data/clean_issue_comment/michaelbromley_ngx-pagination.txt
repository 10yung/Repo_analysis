I am using ngxpagination I want to hide the Ellipsis and only show the limited pagesbut I didnt any propertiescss styling for this Do we have such option with ngxpaginationAny Suggestions will be helpful Hi Im suggest adding disabled attributeInput disabled boolean for disabling component when data received from server serverside paging Can you add this functionality in your component Right now I can use css property pointerevents none but i think that disabled is a more elegant solution Thanks Angular version ngxpagination version Description of issue Default component PaginationControlsComponent does not export the paginationApi Expected result Default component PaginationControlsComponent should in my opinion also export the paginationApi In my case I dont want to bother with the implementation of the whole pagination structure so I just edited the styles of the default component Now Im not sure if theres any way to actually get access to the API which would be great in case Id want to change something based on the pagination state Actual result Im currently left with only one option which is to style my entire pagination from scratch Of course I can create a PR to fix the issue Also this should not be a breaking change at all Let me know if this is something youre happy with Thanks Angular version ngxpagination version Description of issue Multiple controls in same page not working properly Steps to reproduce Try adding one more item in itself Expected result Controls shall work independantly Actual result Demo if possible edit this StackBlitz
