Currently the public API has too many public or open methods which makes it difficult to understand the surface of the API and what should be commonly used Making most of those methods internal or private would reduce the surface of the API so that the library would be easier to use Since some people may need a specific API they should submit an issue to make the access modifiers less restrictive for their task Focal points DayViewController DayView Add docs Thanks for helping CalendarKit Before you submit your issue please make sure to check the following boxes by putting an x in

certian date but if I do this it causes some odd behavior When I swipe right or left on the calendarkit view after calling moveto in viewDidLoad the calendar jumps forwardbackward two days instead of one For example swiping backwards would move me to November th if the date i jump to is November th I tried putting the method in viewDidAppear but if I do that the calendar loads and then awkwardly

Contribution Guidelines x Ive searched for existing GitHub issues Issue Description Id like to start with saying that this library is awesome to work with so thank you very much for making my life much easier My issue is actually more like a feature request Im solely using the day view and Id like to show all the things Ive done throughout the day Some things can take hours other only a couple of minutes Adding events to the day view that lasts longer than about minutes shows up just fine but any less than that and itll be so small that it will barely show up and wont show up at all if something only lasts a minute I know about the timeline verticalDiff variable but having to change it to also be able to see events that last a minute will make the rest of the day enormous which isnt something I want Therefore my suggestion would it be possible to extend the hours that have very small events in it so perhaps increasing the verticalDiff drastically only in that timeslot but keep the same verticalDiff for hour intervals that have longer events in them Ive attached a screenshot of what I was thinking below Result I am trying to achieve calendar
