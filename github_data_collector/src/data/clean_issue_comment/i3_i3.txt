I launch a floating window which has its position set it opens in my external monitor Expected Behavior I expect the floating window to open in the current workspace Reproduction Instructions I have situations in which the position of a floating window is set and the problem occurs in both of them while I have no problem with floating windows which are free to open in the default center position st situation floating window position set by i forwindow titleqalc floating enable move position resize set If I dont set the position forwindow titleqalc floating enable resize set the qalc window opens in the correct workspace nd situation floating window position set through yad geometry flag I created this clumsy and ugly hack to get info on my backlight level when I adjust it bindsym XF MonBrightnessUp exec nostartupid xbacklight inc xbacklight get xargs printf f n yad textinfo sticky nobuttons undecorated timeout geometry x Same behaviour in both cases when I am in a workspace on the external monitor things work as expected But when I am in a workspace on my primary monitor laptop screen the floating window still opens in the visible workspace of the external monitor and the focus is thus now on that workspace Environment Please include your exact i version Note that we only support the latest major release and the current development version If you are using an older

pressing Altj focus left the window above the current window is focused i crashes completely sending the user back to the login screen when a layout placeholder window is clicked and floating on that window is set to useron or autoon The placeholder window also does not float when floating is on those settings Expected Behavior Describe the desired behavior you expect after mitigation of the issue eg The window left next to the current window should be focused i should not crash and the placeholder window probably should float Im unsure if this is how you are supposed to make floating placeholder windows Reproduction Instructions Please provide detailed instructions on how the bug can be reproduced Eg Open three windows in a V A H B C layout on a new workspace append the following layout to the current workspace vimts sw et border pixel currentborderwidth floating autoon crashes useron autoon no crash useroff autooff geometry height width x y name Click me to crash percent still crashes if this field is absent swallows class this doesnt matter as long as it doesnt match a new window type con Click on the placeholder window Observe crash to login screen Environment

submitting a Please check one of the following options with x pre Bug x Feature Request Documentation Request Other Please describe in detail pre Current Behavior There is no generic way of running commands for a window opened through exec unless you have apriori knowledge of the specific application class instance This is a very frequent request on our support reddit so I think we can think about solutions to improve this in core i Desired Behavior We already support startup notifications so we could do something like exec tracestartup foo pathhtofoo In combination with some new command criterion users could have something like forwindow startuptracefoo floating enable in their config and this would now be independent of the actual application Note that this only works for applications implementing startup notifications and thus we should also throw an error if the flag is used in combination with nostartupid of course this still does not guarantee that it will work so we need to clearly document the expectation here CC stapelberg orestisfl What do you think Output of i moreversion pre i version pre Im submitting a Please check one of the following options with x

triggers i to send WORKSPACEchange focus event but focus from the users perspective stays unchanged Expected Behavior i doesnt send misleading WORKSPACEchange focus events when focus from the users perspective stays unchanged Reproduction Instructions Easily observable by using i msg Open two terminals in same workspace In one terminal subscribe to WORKSPACE events prei msg m t subscribe workspace pre In second terminal send the move command prei msg move container to workspace somenamepre Observe the output from the only terminal that stayed on the current workspace If workspace somename already existed there will be WORKSPACE event focus event indicating that the focus has changed from current workspace to somename workspace but it hasnt If workspace somename didnt exist there will be WORKSPACE events one claiming that workspace somename is being createdwhich it is and again a focus event claiming that focus has changed from current workspace to newly created somename workspace but it hasnt Environment Output of i moreversion pre i version pre Im submitting a pre Bug x Feature Request Documentation Request Other Please describe in detail pre Current Behavior At the moment there is no way to get current binding mode from i This is an issue for initialization of a status bar Yes it can be workaround by subscribing to MODE event and waiting for mode changeor forcing MODE event by sending the request to change binding mode but this is not a proper solution Desired Behavior There are two clean ways to resolve the issue Add support for new IPC request for example GETCURRENTBINDINGMODE Expend GETBINDINGMODES to also provides info about current binding mode either as a string or an index for the already provided list of all available binding modes
