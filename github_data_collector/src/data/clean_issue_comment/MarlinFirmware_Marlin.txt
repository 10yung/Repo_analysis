Error When the machine finish the heating It read the file very quickly the stepper even didnt start to move the print job had finished I used computer to log the communication I found what ever send to the printer It replied OK immediately I supposed It should reply bussing When I operate It manually It works properly I dont know what happened I have tried to use a another slicer software but It doesnt work So I suspect the problem is about the firmware and looking for help here By the way the printer just been assembly and havent work before Its a Kossel and the version of firmware is Bug Description My Auto Level feature is not working it homes then nothing happens I suspect perhaps it has to do something with speed during leveling but i am really uncertain My next idea is to start with a new configuration and make modifications one by one for variables i am certain about My Configurations Steps to Reproduce Select Auto Level in LCD Expected behavior What you expect to happen Point Bilinear Leveling Procedure Actual behavior What actually happens Auto Home then no further movement There may be a problem with one of the versions of platformios frameworkarduinoststm I ran into a failure of a macro so I created PR to fix it After that I ran into some other strange compile issues so I deleted the platformio packages frameworkarduinoststm directory and did a clean compile All the problems were gone after that Now I see lots of PRs failing a test as a result of a macro problem on a STM board Could they be related Adding first shield to AGCM I Hope to put my hands on it as soon as MrAlvin will be ready and to finally test a real system MrAlvin if you have some time please validate pinout NB current SAMD framework has an issue with usb serial and Marlin will forget some chars when send to host Fix has been already merged into new adafruit framework but PlatformIO has not been updated yet Hi Im struggeling the whole day already to get the SKR PRO v working again I had a certain version of this repo with my configs Just wanted to change a Value on STEPSPERUNIT and compile and put it on the printer Now Im not able to connect anymore and when the Board is powered via my powersupply Windows is not able to recognize the board Serial Port is set to so it should tell Marlin to use the USB Port Can someone upload a marlin project with firmwarebin config etc that is working for him with USB Port I just want to know if my board is somehow bricked or not Any one else facing issues getting the SKR Pro to run Dear all Bug Description I checked out the latest revision of the bugfix x branch ab and noticed that the steppers wont move on my SKR Pro board Instead of moving the steppers some high frequency noice and then the printer halts My Configurations SKR Pro v TMC for all steppers CoreXY kinematics configzip Steps to Reproduce Update firmware Auto home printer Expected behavior Printer homes Actual behavior Stepper motors make high frequency noice and the printer halts Additional Information The bug was introduced when merging ad cee I traced the bug down to the file MarlinsrcHALHALSTM timersh define STEPTIMER STM F has no TIM TIM or TIM When I change this line to define STEPTIMER as it was before the printer works fine I didnt create a PR because I didnt know if this issue has to be fixed in that file or in the pinsh for the SKR Pro Based on the comment of that line fixing this bug for me might break other printers Many slim configurations left the motion menu completely empty This puts the single most commonly needed item e step calibration present for most configurations With mesh bed leveling manual probing is implied and functions need to be included Hi As stated in the PR title it fixes Regards Orel
