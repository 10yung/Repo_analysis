 Hashing Hard Version Description Given a hash table of size NN we can define a hash function Suppose that the linear probing is used to solve collisions we can easily obtain the status of the hash table with a given sequence of input numbers However now you are asked to solve the reversed problem reconstruct the input sequence from the given status of the hash table Whenever there are multiple choices the smallest number is always taken Input Each input file contains one test case For each test case the first line contains a positive integer N which is the size of the hash table The next line contains N integers separated by a space A negative integer represents an empty cell in the hash table It is guaranteed that all the nonnegative integers are distinct in the table Output For each test case print a line that contains the input sequence with the numbers separated by a space Notice that there must be no extra space at the end of each line
