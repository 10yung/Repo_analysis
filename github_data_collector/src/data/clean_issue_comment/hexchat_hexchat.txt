can open cant run as normal user i am root using su to get to normal Currently Marker messages Marker line reset manually Marker line never set and maybe some others are displayed in the Foreground color set in Settings Preferences Interface Colors which makes them blend with what people say in the channel To avoid that it would be useful to have a separate Text Event for those messages HexChat Select Settings Preferences Interface Colors and click on any color Select color dialogue appears Click on the eyedropper button the mouse pointer changes to an eyedropper but it looks broken in half making it difficult to select a color A picture demonstrating the issue Capture HexChat Windows Home Hitting kbdCtrlkbdkbdfkbd opens the Find dialogue where the user can type some text and move forward to the next occurrence of the text with kbdEnterkbd in case the input field is in focus It would be useful to also have a quick shortcut for moving backwards to the previous occurrence perhaps kbdShiftkbdkbdEnterkbd or kbdCtrlkbdkbdEnterkbd would do HexChat Im using the Windows bit Installer version of HexChat from under Windows Home The problem is pressing Esc only closes certain HexChat windows For example some windows where Esc works Select a Plugin or Script to load HexChat Load Plugin or Script Character Chart Window Character Chart About HexChat Help About Some ones where it doesnt Network List HexChat HexChat Network List Preferences HexChat Settings Preferences Edit Events Settings Text Events Suppose the user is a channel op Show icons for user modes Preferences Interface User list is unchecked and Show user mode icon in nick box Preferences Interface Input box is checked What happens now the nickname is the nick box has no prefix at all What I think should happen the nickname in the nick box should be prefixed with a just like it is in the user list Also Show user mode icon in nick box should probably be renamed to just Show user mode in nick box HexChat Hi can you update the windows app as well and does it have x version as well i am not sure if i should install the exe over the windows app Untested but the formatted yaml appears to match what is expected If you disable Automatically reconnect to servers on disconnect in advanced settings then the Auto reconnect delay option in the same menu is greyedout and cannot be changed The problem is that the Auto reconnect delay netreconnectdelay is still active and used by Hexchat even after a restart As a consequence if the server disconnects the client the client automatically tries to autoreconnect after the amount of seconds set in this parameter Cycling to next server in Steps to reproduce Disable Automatically reconnect to servers on disconnect in Settings Options Chatting Advanced Remember the value you see in the greyedout field Auto reconnect delay To be sure that no other setting in the networks settings affects the problem edit a network entry and Enable Connect to selected server only Disable Connect to this network automatically Remove all servers except one from the list of servers Restart Hexchat to be sure that all settings take effect Connect to the server Make sure that the server disconnects you when you connect For example ask an admin to temporarily bann you for h Actual results Hexchat automatically reconnects after the amount of time set in Auto reconnect delay netreconnectdelay Expected results If Automatically reconnect to servers on disconnect is disabled then Hexchat should not care about the value in Auto reconnect delay and never autoreconnect Additional information The autoreconnects dont happen if the user disconnects discon It only happens if the server disconnects Workaround If you are affected by this problem you can use for example the set netreconnectdelay command set the delay to h Note that settings the parameter to does not disable the autoreconnect It only sets the delay to seconds With server tab hidden hexchat seems to treat whatever channel is currently selected say at time of reconnect otherwise the first ordered one as the server tab and this results in the channels autojoin not firing Also just obviously if I have the server tab disabled I probably only want Disconnected Reconnected Connected An option might be to change unconnected networks channel labels to say orange or add an asterisk indicator or something Thanks for all the hard work to date xoxo
