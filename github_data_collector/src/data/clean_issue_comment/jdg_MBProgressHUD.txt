I set animation MBProgressHUDAnimationZoomIn but it works when disappearingrather than appearing The progress indicator is not centered when the HUD control is shown in iOS original The HUD usually apart from showing progress is also used to block user interaction while an operation is in progress However how the graceTime is handled currently its not possible to block the interaction during this grace period The implementatio keeps the HUDs root view alpha at until the view is actually being shown thus the implicit behaviour of iOS where views with alpha pass through touches is in effect Since the content of the HUD is in subviews backgroundView bezelView etc and those views are seperatelly faded in there really is no need for setting the root view alpha to Removing the three lines that manipulate the root views alpha seems to not break any existing behaviour but enables proper input blocking in all cases Hi With this PR I fixed several behavior bugs and added a test for these cases They are If you try to hide a hud without animation the alpha value for the backgroundView will be equal to while it must be equal to If you have a hud with an animation type set to MBProgressHUDAnimationZoomIn and you hide this hud animatedly trying to show it nonanimated will end up in having a transform applied to the hub as a result of animated hide which is undesirable behavior A popup should not fill the whole width of the screen Thanks img width altdefault src img width altdefault src I think that progressTintColor set should be progressTintColor setStroke at drawRect function Getting error on Ad Hoc export Failed to verify bitcode in MBProgressHUDframework error Platform iOS is not supported Any ideas Ive tried turning bitcode on and off Hi I want to add shadow to bezelViewbut i cant get correct frame of the bezelView
