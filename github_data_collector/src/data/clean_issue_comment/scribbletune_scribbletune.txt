I think the isNote function need to update as it cant recognise C Edim chords I would suggest any note start with lower case letter to recognise as Note and take full chord mapping from tonal library Hi Just to note that as well as CDNJS html script src script src There is UNPKG based on npm publish html script src script src Has the maintainer of Tonejs missed some npm publishs Ta Nick Hi walmik Im loving Scribbletune thank you Ive being trying to set a lower volume for a clip for example a kickwavbased one relative to other clips What are valid volume numbers please I tried as in decibels And would you accept a pull request for jsdoc comments added to the ClipParams interface Perhaps in a separate ts file imported into typingsdts not sure ifhow that works I know youve started documenting some properties of clip here I wonder if it would be appropriate to document nearer the code Thanks Nick Follows on from Add JSDoc Sample and Reproduction Live Code Live Demo see console errors Steps to Reproduce Hit play Suggested solution Can we make Tune a clip option like synth Corrupting and stepping on global objects is bad news Errors Without hacking the tone module into the window object Tone not defined With the window global hack Cannot read property input of undefined Hi when I try the code you have provided in this section I get TypeError fswriteFile is not a function in nodemodulesscribbletunesrcmidijs return fswriteFilefileName bytes binary callback function createFileFromNotesnotes For context I am running your code in a React app Set up with createreactapp Im not sure if that would affect anything The JSBin link does download the file Thanks for creating this awesome library btw Also this is the first I have seenheard of the ability to write Midi inbrowser feeling hopeful Create a pull request template to formalize new changes being introduced to Scribbletune Use this as reference At the very least it should have some basic guidelines such as add tests for new code changes It should also make a mention that Scribbletune works in the browser via Tonejs as well as in the terminal hence a new code change needs to be such that it ll work in both the places If it cannot then that should be mentioned with some reasoning so that we can plan for its creation in a subsequent code change Previously every tone was the duration length for the clip even if the note was subdivided This change pulls out the computation of note length into common code which is then used by the browserClip and by the normal clip when generating midi The stringbased API for specifying rhythm and timing of notes is awesome but the maximum unit of time being a quarternote makes complex rhythms difficult to construct I suggest adding additional characters and structures for note lengths greater than notes
