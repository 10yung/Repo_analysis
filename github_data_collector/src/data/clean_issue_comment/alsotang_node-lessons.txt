Breaking changes Nodejs v has reached its end of life so we no longer support it Its v or later We recommend Nodejs We now use ES in the browser code too If youre using Browserify or Webpack to package code for Internet Explorer you will also have to use Babel The prebuilt nodemodulessuperagentjs is still ES compatible end returns undefined instead of the request If you need the request object after calling end and you probably dont save it in a variable and call requestend Consider not using end at all and migrating to promises by calling then instead In Node responses with unknown MIME type are buffered by default To get old behavior if you use custom unbuffered parsers add bufferfalse to requests or set superagentbuffer yourMimeType false Invalid uses of pipe throw Minor changes Throw if reqabortend is called Throw if using unsupported mix of send and field Reject end promise on all error events Kornel Lesin ski Set httpsservername from the Host header Kornel Lesi ski
