Added a check to your JamfProDetectSelfServicePoliciesWithoutIconssh script to check if the Policy ID List download was blank and if so try again without validating the SSL cert and notify the script user as such This disableappleiclouddataprivacydiagnostictouchidsiriactivationlockandscreentimepopups seems to no longer work with latest Mojave update only profile route seems to work now It appears not all items that are supposed to be deleted from the Users ddcl record are I run this is on Macs before upgrading to PrimaryNTDomain AppleMetaRecordName are both still present in the Record after the script finishes No errors Running usrbindscl delete manually reports not errors but also does not remove the items When I run the script it tried to rename the home director to usernameold at this point the script comes back and gives error operation not permitted The home directory is still there but the account gets deleted I would like to be able to use this script as I have a client who has over macs to domain Thank you First off thanks for sharing this script I hit a minor issue and found a simple fix TLDR systemprofiler could use a timeout parameter specified or else it can timeout after seconds When I ran this script I received this error systemprofiler Terminating usrsbinsystemprofiler nospawn xml SPApplicationsDataType detailLevel full because it did not respond systemprofiler Nonzero termination status from usrsbinsystemprofiler nospawn xml SPApplicationsDataType detailLevel full termination status I added timeout to the variable defined on Line so that systemprofiler does not hit its default second timeout parameter hooray for man pages and it runs without issue for my old Mac Pro Thanks again for sharing Was just testing the script and it appears that this will download all policies including those created by Jamf Remote Is it possible to update the script such that it only includes those policies listed in the Computer Policies area Looking at the output XML I cant tell any unique information other than the title containing a colon but this results in colon in the actual output xml filename The root problem here appears that despite these policies being triggered by Jamf Remote the policy is listed as enabled enabledtrueenabled Not sure what the best solution is here to address this added APFS support for filevault encryptioncheckextensionattribute runs file system personality check to determine which encryption status checks to run wrapped all existing CoreStorage checks in elif when the filesystem is not APFS removed extraneous checks for osversmajor since the script will never run on the various CoreStorage checks if its not macOS set all encryption reports to a shared variable fvCheck which is echod as a single result at the end of the script consolidated the various standalone if statements into shared ifelifelse blocks to prevent the script from checking values more often than necessary moved all CoreStorage resource files to a shared workingDir path simplifies path creation and deletion converted README to Markdown This change would avoid the need to maintain a separate checkapfsencryptionextensionattribute but Ive left it in place in this PR pending approval of the merge Added Support of WiFi interface and easy way to add it to Jamf Pro using Script parameters Feel free to modify or close the PR I wont be disappointed Thank you for your work provided these scripts Previously you were checking only for csrutil status However it is possible now that SIP has been reset reenabled using the csrutil clear command but that the computer has not been restarted In that situation the status will still show SIP as disabled but if you check NVRAM you will see that there is no entry for csractiveconfig This would indicate that SIP is set to be enabled after a restart This is relatively new with
