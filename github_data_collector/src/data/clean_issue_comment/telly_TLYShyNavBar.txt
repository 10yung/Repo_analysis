I inserted a UIScrollView with UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth into the ExtensionView Everything works satisfactorily Unfortunately I have a distance between UINavigationBar and ExtensionView which only moves away after scrolling How can I remove this distance after a spin screen shot at I am getting Failed to Render and update auto layout status for MYViewController Library not loaded rpathTLYShyNavBarframeworkTLYShyNavBar please help me By using xcode ios device the navigationBar is not hiding when scrolling up The navigationBar is always shown When scrolling up fast the navigationBar is sometime jumping it goes down away from the top and comes back However by using xcode ios device its working It is also working fine with xcode with ios and scroll up navigationBar hides scroll down navigationBar expands Is there a workaround or a fix for ios device using a build from xcode For example Im scrolling through a table view the navBar is fully contracted and I click on an item Now Im viewing the detail view When I click back to navigate back to the scroll view the nav bar should still be in the contracted state If it isnt then the whole table view is shifted down to accommodate the expansion and the item isnt even in the same place that it was when it started I used to be able to keep track of this state and force it myself but that seems to no longer work due to either ios or some change in the repo Hi Just updated to Xcode and iOS and it seems the fade behavior no longer works in TLYShyViewControllerm function updateSubviewsAlpha The alpha property has no effect on the subviews to which it is applied Any tip any workaround Thanks I was experiencing an issue on iOS where there was a gap above the scroll view before the navigation bar The solution for me was the following code It seems that in addition to the content inset TLY was adding iOS was then adding another inset which can be seen in the new variable adjustedContentInset This was my solution if availableiOS selftableViewcontentInsetAdjustmentBehavior UIScrollViewContentInsetAdjustmentNever Related to The standard status bar is pixels The navigation bar extends pixels up so it is overlapped by the status bar When there is a larger than pixel status bar eg a phone call is in progress or GPS is active the center needs to shift up pixels to avoid this dead space being visible above the usual nav bar if statusBarHeight statusBarHeight Thanks for the great job When I test the expand and contract action there some times the expand not work well sorry I didt capture the screen for a video but i found there maybe a problem at the complete block when it check contracting it may not match actual action so I do a fix it work well all the time nameNSInvalidArgumentException reason UIViewController tlyswizzledViewWillAppear unrecognized selector sent to instance x e callStackSymbols CoreFoundation x d aff libobjcAdylib x cc objcexceptionthrow CoreFoundation x d ef Smark x c d ASPECTSAREBEINGCALLED CoreFoundation x d ed CoreFoundation x c ad c CFforwardingprep Smark x aebc c UIViewControllerShyNavBar tlyswizzledViewWillAppear UIKit x feb bf UIKit x feb UIKit x ff e UIKit x fea e UIKit x fea UIKit x fea f UIKit x fea UIKit x fe f b UIKit x ff Smark x cae AppDelegate applicationdidFinishLaunchingWithOptions UIKit x ff d UIKit x UIKit x f e UIKit x d UIKit x c FrontBoardServices x b FrontBoardServices x b f FrontBoardServices x b aa CoreFoundation x d c CoreFoundation x d d c CoreFoundation x d a CoreFoundation x c da CFRunLoopRunSpecific UIKit x ff UIKit x ff UIApplicationMain Smark x cd main libdylddylib x c c I commented out the code can run self tlyswizzledViewWillAppearanimated
