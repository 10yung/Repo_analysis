We would like to send messages that come into our pages messenger inbox to our slack Would it be hard to support this Zapier also supports this but wed have to pay month for it which is a bit much for the few messages we recieve trough facebook This is an initial attempt at getting notifications from our backend into the system which we plan to expand with additional events and actions over time This could probably be more generally expanded but Sheets integration was the requested functionality as requested in As mentioned in an IMAP hive for processing emails would be great to have Should we add Beehive to Its already quite popular but adding it there could make it even more visible muesli I assume that Beehives creator would be the best person to open a PR there Store arbitrary keyvalue strings in a Redis server I wanted to fiddle with facebook bee and before I could even try it out I got an error Its related to the deprecated post API I am in no hurry to fix anything and this doesnt impact me but it would be nice for it to work It doesnt appear to be possible to reverseproxy Beehive to be served from a subdirectory Beehive seems to be absolutely adamant that its going to request assets from assetsexampletxt instead of beehiveassetsexampletxt despite me using canonicalurl Ive tried both canonicalurl and canonicalurl and neither have had any effect Im reverseproxying with nginx nginx location beehive proxypass Full command line for Beehive srvbeehivebeehive bind config srvbeehivebeehiveconf canonicalurl This appears to be related to Actions in beehiveconf are referenced by ID which makes sense given that they dont really have a pretty name associated with them Bees however do have pretty names so they are referenced by said names I have a pretty extensive list of Bees and this is going to sound so firstworldproblem and Id like to refactor how Ive named them Since they are referenced by name in the config refactoring Bee naming involves changing every location where the old name is used and given shell commands thats not entirely difficult just error prone and tedious Example Bee Name RSSHackADay Class rssbee Description HackADay RSS Options Name url Value Name skipfirst Value Associated Chain Name RSSHackaday Discord Description Hackaday discord Event Bee RSSHackADay referenced by name Name newitem Options null Filters Actions aecd c ee b c d c b d More just thinking out loud than a serious bug report request for an enhancement but I thought Id bring it up and see what you think It would be nice to have a throttling mechanism in order to be able to chain a high volume rss feed to Twitter making sure that there is only one random tweet sent per hour Otherwise one could get blocked quite fast Or does such a mechanism exist and i am just blind
