 Purpose Make it possible to use python by changing the things that throw errors in python Testing Tested running with python on OSX Feature to add variable values as command line argument was already there Now it supports os environments as well as a concept of configfile has been introduced The Readme states you need Python The countdown clock shows that it will be EOL a little over months from now Hi there I just tried to run this tool today with env aws I kept getting this exception in a few different spots File cspy line in module main File cspy line in main from modules import awsaudit File Userscoltonleesecssuitemodulesawsauditpy line in module accountname getaccountalias or getaccountid File Userscoltonleesecssuitemodulesawsauditpy line in getaccountalias accountdetails jsonloadsstraccountdetails File SystemLibraryFrameworksPythonframeworkVersions libpython jsoninitpy line in loads return defaultdecoderdecodes File SystemLibraryFrameworksPythonframeworkVersions libpython jsondecoderpy line in decode obj end selfrawdecodes idxws end File SystemLibraryFrameworksPythonframeworkVersions libpython jsondecoderpy line in rawdecode raise ValueErrorNo JSON object could be decoded ValueError No JSON object could be decoded I fixed it by changing the command subprocesscheckoutput aws sts getcalleridentity shellTrue to subprocesscheckoutput aws sts getcalleridentity output json shellTrue I can submit a PR if you want but dont know if this is widely applicable thanks Hello I am trying to implement this tool and I was wondering if there was a way to get the output as XML rather than JSON or just as the log file Thanks Add support to AWS profiles to simplify multiple account auditing Next err occurs during script run because of wildcard in source definition Traceback most recent call last File cspy line in module main File cspy line in main azureauditazureaudit File Usersusercssuitemodulesazureauditpy line in azureaudit rdppublic File Usersusercssuitemodulesazureauditpy line in rdppublic accesstype port direction protocol source linesplit ValueError need more than values to unpack Actual line contains next string Allow Inbound Tcp which can be actually spited od Allow Inbound Tcp rule set lines looks like this Allow Inbound Tcp Allow Inbound Tcp Allow Inbound Tcp Allow Inbound Tcp Allow Inbound Udp Implements a query filter on StackStatus to ignore CloudFormation stacks that have DELETECOMPLETE as StackStatus This will reduce the executing time significantly on some AWS accounts Reason Performing an audit on an AWS account with a big amount of deleted CloudFormation stacks takes very long The checks that are modified by this change do not make sense on deleted stacks These checks are Check Cloud Formation stacks are using SNS Check stacks have a policy When running an Azure Audit I receive the following error Checking if any network group allows public access to RDP Traceback most recent call last File cspy line in module main File cspy line in main azureauditazureaudit File homejbensoncssuitemodulesazureauditpy line in azureaudit rdppublic File homejbensoncssuitemodulesazureauditpy line in rdppublic jres value The network group s does not allow public RDP access networkgroup UnboundLocalError local variable jres referenced before assignment I did run the assessment on my AWS account noncontainer mode and in results I can see check numbers as null as given below checkno null level null region someregion value somevalue score Scored type type I am expecting CIS check numbers here
