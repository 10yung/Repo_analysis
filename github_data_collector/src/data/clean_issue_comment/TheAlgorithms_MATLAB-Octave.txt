This repo needs more algorithms If you see any missing algorithms kindly contribute Hackotberfest participants are welcome I will list some of the algorithms that are up for grabs However please check if the algorithm is already in our repo before you begin working Feel free to help me add more items to the list If you have any questions ask away Some Guidelines Please create pull request per algorithm for ease of review Please do not plagiarise Implementations must be your own If you have used help from some article say Wikipedia give credit in your script in a comment Give a brief explanationlinks of what your script does Give helpful comments where you deem necessary Dont add comments where its trivial such as x y z adds two numbers or is unnecessary Use proper variable names and filename If you are working on prime check please use a proper file name such as primecheckm rather than primecm Incase your algorithm required multiple files create a subdirectory for example the kmeans algorithm requires two files so we have a subdirectory for it Try not to add unnecessary files This repo is for educational purposes Please keep that in mind when you are working on a contribution to this repo Following this coding style guideline is recommended for all PRs Sorting Algorithms x Merge sort Radix sort Quick sort x Bubble sort Bucket sort Searching Algorithms x Linear Search x Binary Search Quick Search Jump Search Math x Factorial x Fibonacci series x Prime factors x Prime check Softmax x Jaccard Similarity Greatest Common Divisor Euclidean Distance Hamming Distance Find LCM Find HCF Sum of arithmetic series Sum of geometric series Machine Learning NOTE Please try to use standard datasets for these problems that are freely available and perhaps popular such as the iris dataset Or datasets that are already inbuilt in MatlabOctave Linear Regression Logistic Regression Gradient Descent DBScan K nearest neighbors K medoid clustering Fuzzy Cmeans Single Layer Perceptron RBF NN
