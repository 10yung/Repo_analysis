days ago crouton has become nearly unusable Chrome now runs terribly on crouton and has visual artifacts on launch Minecraft now runs at a consistent fps no matter what settings I use It is most likely a memory issue since whenever I go into task manager I am usually at about memory usage and cpu usage just my using the minecraft menu because everything now takes loads of memory I am quite certain that this is caused by the update since my friend is also experiencing this problem If known describe the steps to reproduce the issue Crouton helps me a lot but I wanna help more Chinese know
