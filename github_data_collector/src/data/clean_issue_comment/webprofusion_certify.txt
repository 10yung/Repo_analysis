In order to ease up DANETLSA implementations it would be nice to be able to keep the private key We have a number of servers behind a load balancer to pass the HTTPFile challenge we would like to use a shared network location This way whichever server is hit the file will be present However when using a network drive either directly or mapped get the following error The website root path for sitename could not be determined Request cannot continue Ideally this setting would support network locations maybe with credential support as well Hello Please add the NameSilocom API to Certify I noticed that you already have namecheap which is a service I used to use until I found a better one Thank you Error Ip address in IIS binding reset after request certificate Best I can tell contentlength header needs to be passed along with the request to have Microsoft Teams Incoming Webhooks work correctly Trying to have a channel update anytime a certificate renewal succeeds or fails I am using your CLI CSV upload feature to add a big list of domains Is there any way to set the Website Root Directory What about the certificate store I want to have them added to WebHosting instead of Personal Today if you have a certificate for acom bcom acom and apiacom and you need different authorization configurations for acom and bcom for example you may create two configurations matching acom and bcom for example However that wont match apiacom and thus Certify the Web will try to use http method It would be nice if either acom matched all levels or if there was syntax for matching all levels maybe It seems that currently Certify The Web does not support properly transcripts that are used in PowerShell scripts postrequest at least as the resulting log files look like this Please implement a way to change the size of the generated private key Minimum length should default to but allow up to which is the max size allowed at this time by schannel Greetings SQL Server requires KeySpec to be enabled in the CSR in order for the cert to be properly recognized A recently generated cert did no have this set The cert is not recognizable in the SQL Configuration Manager Environment Server R SQL Server Certify Cert Settings Single domain No IIS Website Challenge type DNS Cloudflare DNS API Deployment Certificate Store Only CSR Signing Algorithm ECDSA using P and SHA Thanks
