BrokenPipe message Broken pipe libcoreresultrs note Run with RUSTBACKTRACE for a backtrace Recent pandoc has removed or changed certain arguments and will fail with the current manner in which pandoc is invoked Which then causes a panic in libcoreresultrs and fail Fixup the arguments so it works with at least pandoc as shipped by Fedora This will presumably break with the earlier versions of pandoc Hi thanks a lot for your work on that Unfortunately it seems severely outdated as of now would it be possible to support edition of the book Thanks again In order to work with latest rustonomicon sources and trpl nd edition I altered some things in the project Some changes are cosmetic others are necessary like working with a newer pandoc version Dockerized the application for easy access and execution I am trying to build the second edition of the book I have copied over the source files from trplsecondeditionsrc in the TRPL source code repository on Github

Running targetreleasecompiletrpl Reading bookthread main panicked at called Resultunwrap on an Err value Error repr Os code message No such file or directory libcoreresul trs note Run with

Resultunwrap on an Err value Error repr Os code message No such file or directory libcoreresul trs note Run with RUSTBACKTRACE for a backtrace and I get the same error Did anybody else try to do the same It would be awesome to have this automatically run every so often and it should be pretty easy to set this up with a CI tools and since its open source it should be free no I updated the sources I see no obvious errors Could you put them on your website nav floatleft position fixed top px left px bottom px width px overflow auto style When reading the book on a Kobo Aura One monospace fonts are displayed like regular fonts therefore the code looks unaligned The checkmarks that should display on the tables in the first chapters do not show up I managed to fix the first problem by editing the ePub file using calibre changing the font from monospace to DejaVu Sans Mono and embedding the font using the font management tool Also I removed the size restriction on the CSS file that stated that the pre element needed to have fonts that were em Perhaps these fixes can be integrated into the book sources somewhat Hello First of all thank you for your fantastic work Its incredibly valuable to have the The Rust Programming Language ebook in one file My suggestion is to put the NOMICON links at the bottom of your page and the TRPL links at the top of your page Frankly The Rustonomicon ebook is not as useful and even if it is your page is called trplebook so one would expect to see TRPL first Every time I visit your page I misclick because of that
