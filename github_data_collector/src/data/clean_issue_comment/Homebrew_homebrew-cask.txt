upgrade installer script executable stagedpathBackblaze InstallerappContentsMacOSbzinstallmate args upgrade bzdiy sudo true else installer manual Backblaze Installerapp uninstallpostflight do bzpkg LibraryBackblazebzpkg systemcommand binmv args bzpkg DirhomeTrash sudo true if Direxist bzpkg end end which did work perfectly but was deemed too much of a hack Justification Some casks would benefit from having a separate upgrade procedure from install For example in this case brew cask upgrade backblaze results in a reset of the previous backup state triggering a whole new lengthy backup from scratch Yet the app binary explicitly supplies an upgrade argument which could be utilised for a much smoother upgrade procedure Another example which vitorgalvao cited here is lulu which removes the user configuration on uninstall making upgrades through Homebrew a pain Example use case Usage could look something like this rb installer manual Backblaze Installerapp upgrade do systemcommand stagedpathBackblaze InstallerappContentsMacOSbzinstallmate args upgrade bzdiy sudo true end Although we would also need something like rb upgrade trash LibraryBackblazebzpkg After making all changes
