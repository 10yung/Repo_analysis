Hi all Couldnt ask on slack as the link on the README is dead When I used the inapp example code I got traces to a local running appdash instance Im now trying to connect to a already running appdash instance and not getting traces I think Im setting up the tracer wrong Any help my appgo tracer appdashtracerNewTracerappdashNewRemoteCollectorappdashserviceconsul edit Saw an example using chunked collector Tried that it did not work either Still not seeing traces appDashAddr is the same as above appdashserviceconsul my appgo collector appdashNewRemoteCollectorappDashAddr chunkedCollector appdashNewChunkedCollectorcollector tracer appdashtracerNewTracerchunkedCollector nd edit updated to the following Still no traces No logs either logger logNewosStdout appdash logLshortfilelogLtime collector appdashNewRemoteCollectorappDashAddr chunkedCollector appdashNewChunkedCollectorcollector tracer appdashtracerNewTracerWithOptionschunkedCollector appdashtracerOptions Verbose true Logger logger end edits I can hit appdashserviceconsul and it comes up But no traces to be found The separately running appdash instance looks like separate server running appdash func main var minEvictAge timeDuration var port int flagDurationVar minEvictAge minevictage timeMinute set the amount of time the tracer will hold onto traces flagIntVar port port the port on which the for app dash tracer will run flagParse memStore appdashNewMemoryStore store appdashRecentStore MinEvictAge minEvictAge DeleteStore memStore appDashURLString fmtSprintf port appDashURL err urlParseappDashURLString if err nil logFatalerr tapp err traceappNewnil appDashURL if err nil logFatalerr tappStore store tappQueryer memStore logPrintfstarting on d port logFatalhttpListenAndServefmtSprintfd port tapp The go link to install does not appear to work sourcegraphcomsourcegraphappdash Error repo sourcegraphappdash not found The slack channel link also appears to be dead Appdash support opentracing API so I can use opentracing client work with appdash like Go JavaScript Java Python ObjectiveC C opentracing client The traceappNew function seems to indicate it supports being mounted to a subpath but I havent been able to make it work Ive tried passing in a gorilla mux subrouter and tried wrapping the App in httpStripPrefix but in both cases images and links on the home page are absolute see roothtml so they dont work Also Im curious why the other templates use the BaseURL template var to construct absolute URLs for everything instead of just using relative URLs When used with HTTPS Appdash currently appears to be insecure because it does subrequests to HTTP static resources The issue seems to come from a single resource that should probably be renamed into fontsgoogleapiscomcssfamilyOpenSans like other used static resources If a span takes microseconds instead of milliseconds to complete the UI is simply unable to render them and the profile view shows all values as screen shot at pm When looking at a trace tracesid the graph only shows two spans the root and one child Clicking on the child loads a new page that shows the child and its child There is no way to view the entire traces graph at once Screenshot with example attached x scrot Anywhere where keyvalue pairs of spans are displayed theyre being ordered randomly When the slider reads XY hours ago the query that is sent to the server is really X Y hours ago So for example when the slider is set to hours ago the data that is reported is from to hours ago
