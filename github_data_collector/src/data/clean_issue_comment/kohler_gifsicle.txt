When processing a gif with gifsicle Id like to be able to remove the transparency and replace it with a solid background color Can a flag be added to do this If this is already possible then can the documentation be improved to describe this use case Thanks Just for fun I compiled it with wasm and built a React interface over it is there any interest in having the wasm fork be part of the repo I found it fun to make and I would be willing to clean up the code up and maintain it Theres a demo Im just wondering if its worth the time At the time of writing this the Web Worker version isnt pushed but will be soon It would be nice to have an option for scaling images in respect to just the smallest side And also it would be very nice to have the option to skip pictures that already are larger or smaller than what youre scaling to Example Agif x px Bgif x px Cgif x px gifsicle batch resizesmallside enlargeonly i gif Would resize A to x B to x and skip C shrinkonly would of course instead only affect C and resize to x Id use this because of Google photos it only automatically backups images with a smallest side of pixels or larger and I have a humongous amount of animated gifs Id like to backup but many of them are too small and theres hundreds if not thousands of gifs with different resolutions in various folders Hi I am working on a service that resizes gifs with gifsicle Through my tests gifsicle works great so far but I have this particular image that is giving me problem Normally when I resize it with gifsicle there is no error and I can visually validate it is correctly resizing the image and the animation is working fine on my ubuntu machine But when I try to check the same file on macos it is very weird that it is slow and animation stops after a while I dont know this is related to gifsicle but if I test the original file not resized with gifsicle animation works without any problem So I wondered and tried to play with the result file and saw that one of the giftools is giving error like GIFLIB error Image EOF detected before image complete I think error comes directly from libgif I am using latest released version of gifsicle Here is the command that I am executing to generate the problem rootefd c e uappssite gifsicle resize x o originalgif gif rgb v gif rgb Image at x gif rgb Image at x gif rgb Image at x GIFLIB error Image EOF detected before image complete I am attaching the problem gif file Can you help me to understand what is wrong with the resizing operation or there is nothing wrong with it Thanks originalgif original This should solve I am confused how exactly to go about enable multithreaded support configure help mentions an option to disable threads but does not mention how to turn it on Just using regular configure make install and trying j seems to still only use thread which makes me thing its not actually enabled Also configure enablethreads doesnt seem to do anything either Ive tried gifsicle on a sample of images and it is working amazing Its fast transforms images that other libs cant handle and the results are compatible with webP conversion Theres however one feature Im missing which is resizing to specified dimensions both width and height while preserving aspect ratio As far as I can tell existing modes produce images that either preserve aspect ratio and dont exceed the dimensions satisfying at least one width or height of them OR break aspect ratio and fit the dimensions exactly Basically what Im looking for is gifsicle to fill the missing pixels to match the dimensions Heres an example with a blue fill Is this something that could be easily added Make rightclicking on a window go to the previous frame for symmetrys sake man gifview Leftclicking on a window goes to the next frame rightclicking on a window deletes that window Rather cruel How about instead Leftclicking on a window goes to the next frame Rightclicking on a window goes to the previous frame mplayer has a handy fs option so should gifview xli has a handy zoom option so should gifview
