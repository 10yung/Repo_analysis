 Returning the exception that was intercepted allows the library users to inspect the exception a little bit more so they dont have to rely on just the expected type and can compare as an example the error message Would you prefer to have this new signature as a new function for compat issues maybe The PR I made makes it possible you only need to launch sbt with the environment variable set scala SCALANATIVEVERSION M sbt The title says it all I created the issue to get notified Fixes The main issues were that scala reflection isnt available in dotty so I had to replace Platformscala with something that does fairly rudimentary Java reflection I should probably make it work for nested objects too Also the EnableReflectiveInstantiation annotation on AbstractTestSuite caused runtime exception Looks like it can be safely removed in were not targeting ScalaJS on Dotty yet Feedback would be welcome It would be amazing to make minitest the first Scala testing framework in the galaxy that works with Scala Im trying to use minitest on a project that is crosscompiled with dotty Im using minitest using withDottyCompat so it picks up the artifact I am getting the following compilation error at runtime error javalangNoSuchMethodError minitestapiSourceLocationfromContextLminitestapiSourceLocation error at scalapblensesSimpleTestinitanonfun SimpleTestscala error at minitestSimpleTestSuiteanonfuntest SimpleTestSuitescala error at minitestapiTestSpecanonfunsync TestSpecscala error at minitestapiTestSpecapplyTestSpecscala error at minitestapiPropertiesanonfuniterator Propertiesscala error at minitestapiTestSpecapplyTestSpecscala error at minitestrunnerTaskloop Taskscala error at minitestrunnerTaskanonfunexecute Taskscala
