Im seeing this weird issue where formatting is not working Here is the link to the codesandbox example Steps to reproduce Open the link and click on the button below the input Input is filled with a value but is not formatted And the weird thing is if I first manually input some value and then click on the button everything works I dont know if Im doing anything wrong PS Thanks a lot for this library Im using React Hooks react I need to get the length of the enter value and compare it with the mask size when both are equal the seek button is activated I tried to use props pipe but it issues useState overrun error I found it very strange Then I tried using props ref not getting the result I would like In addition to having more code So I came to use onChange for example typescript const maskany d d d d d d d d const maskCountnumber masklength const disabled setDisabled useStatebooleantrue const verify eReactChangeEventHTMLInputElement const value etarget setDisabledvaluelength maskCount return MaskedInput maskmask guidefalse placeholder onChangeverify button type button disabled disabled Search button but there is a bug in this example passing the character cannot be deleted Example Entry Exit when trying to delete the sequence stops at infinitely This happens when there is setDisabled in the verify function Removing it returns to normal I did the same text in another library like reactinputmask and there is no such problem Can anyone help me get the original input value before applying the mask I use the component on multiple form Vuejs and want to have a global config not to repeat it every time but cant find a way in the doc On other Vuejs Component Ive already did it with extends like bellow but here its not working script langts import MaskedInput from vuetextmask import Vue Component Prop from vuepropertydecorator Component extends MaskedInput export default class AppInputmasked extends Vue Propdefault true guide boolean Propdefault true keepCharPositions boolean Propdefault false showMask boolean Propdefault placeholderChar string script Any idea to set global default configuration When deleting the entire value of a field at once eg cmdbackspace onChange is not called This is most likely due to value being an empty string so when the text is deleted the new value is also an empty string resulting in not raising a change event Changing defaultValue to value worked for me but it fails the unit tests This is just meant as a way to illustrate the problem and hint at a solution I would appreciate if someone could look into this Addresses issue When the entire value is deleted at once eg with cmd backspace or selecting the value and hitting backspace onChange is not called Can I receive unmasked values using with any form libs Can I revive unmasked values using with any form libs As of today with Angular if you enable ivy in tsconfigappjson the application will not build There is such an error ERROR in There is no format with import statements in Dgitsnereussafetyportalnodemodulesangular textmask entrypoint With Angular the Ivy will be the default rendering engine thus the textmask will not work with it when entering in decimals with the create number mask cant enter in then then expected
