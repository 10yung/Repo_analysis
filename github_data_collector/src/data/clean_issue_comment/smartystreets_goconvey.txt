There is a vulnerability in the momentsjs library used by goconvey which was confirmed here Risk assessment CVSS AVNACLPRNUINSUCNINAH High This can be fixed by updating the library to a newer version Hello I would like to know if there is an option to disable concurrency in goconvey The title says it all I couldnt find any documentation on the theming but the home page says you can use custom and thirdparty themes Convey panics upon test failure whereas it should report it without panicking What might be wrong here or panic is its normal behavior go version go windowsamd Conveysample test run t func So ShouldEqual some file paths truncated crdstestgo Line Expected Actual Should be equal goroutine running infraTestRdsfunc rdstestgo x githubcomjtoldsglsContextManagerSetValuesfunc x vendorgithubcomjtoldsglscontextgo x d githubcomjtoldsglsEnsureGoroutineIdfunc vendorgithubcomjtoldsglsgidgo x githubcomjtoldsglsm x xc vendorgithubcomjtoldsglsstacktagsgo x githubcomjtoldsglsgithubcomjtoldsglsmarkS x xc vendorgithubcomjtoldsglsstacktagsgo x c githubcomjtoldsglsaddStackTag vendorgithubcomjtoldsglsstacktagsgo githubcomjtoldsglsEnsureGoroutineId xc a githubcomjtoldsglsgidgo xe githubcomjtoldsglsContextManagerSetValues xc b xc a xc c vendorgithubcomjtoldsglscontextgo x scinfratestingTestRds xc aa rdstestgo xae testingtRunner xc aa x dee go srctestingtestinggo xd created by testingTRun go srctestingtestinggo x Adds StackMode as an optional parameter to Convey in the same way that FailureMode is implemented StackMode can be Error default print stack only on errors or Fail print stack for failure and errors Fixes Make stacktrace on error optional Hi We use Convey a lot and sometimes need to to table driven tests I did a TDD workshop recently and we looked at NUnit and pytest which both have nice syntax support for test tables In go the for loop works ok but is not quite so elegant and often times weve had problems with this especially in large Convey based tests with nested sections I wrote down a few ideas and started a proofofconcept creating ConveyMany as an addon function around Convey My work so far is here Inspiration and reflect tricks borrowed from Ginkgo Table extension One main problem I have is the failure mode when a test fails it prints out a stack trace as well as the failure report and I cant see why Normally we dont get a stack trace for failures with standard Convey Another issue is that when a failure occurs we dont know which test case failed so a way to add this to the report is needed Additionally I wondered if you would consider a feature request and help me to integrate this idea properly into goconvey Using the standard library one is able to filterrun a specific sub tests by passing a pattern to the go test command eg go test runmyregexpattern Adopting a table driven test style with Convey example when a test fails one cannot run that specific test in isolation without commenting out test cases you are not interested in This is not practical if your test table is huge Ideally I shouldnt need to touch the structure of my tests to run them in isolation I saw but its not useful for a table driven style Thoughts I had the same problem with after a simple code review I figured out that using a temp dir to store the resources may be a solution Here is my quick and dirty fix But herere few things should be noticed Another dependency was added to copy assets directory Code for clean temp dir was not implemented yet Tested in OSXUbuntu platform Ideally a ShouldExit assertion could be supported that would function like the following Sofunc ExitingFunctionCall ShouldExit Similar to how ShouldPanic and ShouldPanicWith currently work from a user perspective Asserting for exit codes could be an additional feature as well Sofunc ExitingFunctionCall ShouldExitWith
