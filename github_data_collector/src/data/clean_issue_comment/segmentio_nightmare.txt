Hey there I am trying to do the following js const Nightmare requirenightmare const nightmare Nightmare show false let url let source await nightmaregotourl waitsource evaluate documentquerySelectorsourcesrc end consolelogsource however it just returns null all the time I even tried setting show to true for the Nightmare Instance and setting the wait to ms and then tried to open the DevTools manually inside the Electron Window and it works in there But after the Seconds the Window closes and it still returns null How can I fix this Edit Output when running with Debug Flag nightmare queueing action goto for s nightmare queueing action wait ms nightmare queueing action evaluate ms nightmare running ms nightmare electron child process exited with code success s Working on updating the DefinitelyTyped definitions for this and ran into trouble with the return not matching the documented signature Similar to except their fix is not working for me I also tried npm cache clean force still to no avail uname a Linux hyperion generic Ubuntu SMP Thu Nov UTC x x x GNULinux node version v npm version The code Im running is straight from the example js const Nightmare requirenightmare const nightmare Nightmare show true nightmare goto typesearchforminputhomepage github nightmare clicksearchbuttonhomepage waitr aresulta evaluate documentquerySelectorr aresultahref end thenconsolelog catcherror consoleerrorSearch failed error My packagejson json dependencies nightmare Id copy the output of what Ive run but there simply is none The command node indexjs instantly finishes with no output and no error code echo returns Here is my code snippet const SGLink nightmare goto jsonProducts i styleId waititem evaluate documentquerySelectoriteminnerHTML end thenresponse const cheerioloadresponse consolelogaattrhref return aattrhref catcherr consolelogerr consolelogSGLink shoeresellLinksstadiumGoods SGLink This snippet is within a for loop that searches this website for every styleID and grabs the link to the first product However this process itself takes about seconds to just grab one link Is there any way of making this faster The snippet works fine outside of the loop when it runs once but once insert it within the loop its not able to grab any links for some reason Here is my error code Error Nothing responds to goto at

edge case issue When I leave nightmarejs program running for several hours it would eventually stop working As my program is running I log out which steps its on Eventually after several hours progress stops I would then kill the program and try to start it again but same thing happens The program gets stuck on running the nightmarejs module The only solution Ive found was to restart my computer after which the program seems to run fine again for another few hours Does any one have any suggestions on what I should do or look into to find out what might be wrong Or what I can do narrow down the logs so I can share it with the community I tried adding DEBUGnightmare and I got the outputs but it seems to continually try to start submitting to queue again but theres no message about whats failing or any error messages MBP macOS Catalina nightmare node Ive also ran this on my ubuntu server and the same thing happens SyntaxError Invalid regular expression datauserid d Invalid group Theyre part of the current JS spec and supported in both Chrome and Node I may have to look into Puppeteer until theyre supported in Nightmare Consider this a feature request Hi I would like to test whether a specific alert is triggered after clicking a button I know I can catch alert events with onpage but this will catch it even if it is called before clicking the button or if it is triggered because of another interaction in other words it will catch no matter when the alert appears I was wondering how I could achieve that with nightmare I thought a workaroud could be using a boolean variable and set it to true once the button has been clicked and then when catching the event check if such variable had been set to true However I dont think this is a good solution it would be great if I could integrate it in a flow something like clickthebutton waitalertraised clickotherbutton waitotheralertraised I hope I explained myself good enough Thanks in advance ERROR Warning in
