It seems SwiftCheck has been introduced since v and it is affecting end users to always pull its unnecessary repository via Swift Package Manager bash cd myprojectusingrunes swift build Updating Fetching gitgithubcomtypeliftSwiftCheckgit I have tried both Xcode Swift and Xcode Beta Swift but result was the same Its probably due to Swift Package Manager still not able to handle test dependencies nicely I think there needs some workaround eg What do you think Itd be nice to add some Jazzy docs to this project and host them using github pages We should do that as a part of the release process see Id like to be able to automate the release of this lib so that we dont forget to do things like add tags release to CocoaPods etc We should script this A single example for each operator would do a lot
