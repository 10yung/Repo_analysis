Chapter Overthinking R code block It would be nice to explicitly state that the true model to generate the simulated data by simtraintest is based on the default rhoc argument When I ran the code block it seemed like magic to me that the parameter model ie two predictors was the implicit true model That is I recommend a footnote or something that the rho argument for simtraintest is what describes the model that generates the simulated data I am trying to install package using following call installgithubrmcelreathrethinkingrefExperimental This is causing the following error Warning

The LKJ density is not equal to but proportional to this function of the determinant for quick reference see The formula is missing a normalizing constant discussed on pages in LKJs paper Note that this issue is distinct from the issue with the logging of the scaled density highlighted in which looks like a duplicate of The documentation for dbeta is no longer in the help file Porting plp to cover the ulam class is not straightforward I would like to leave this request here to see if anyone would like to contribute some code Hi Richard I cannot find the Boxesmodelgenderrda and Boxesmodelagerda files that you mention on page of the latest version th Sept of the nd Edition of the Statistical Rethinking book Theyre not in the data folder of the Experimental branch nor the Master branch Please could you push these files to the Experimental branch so that I can access them Many thanks for your help Ross
