I noticed old issues about performance concerns and in profiling my own application I also observed significant time spent within squel particularly when creating lots of queries While there are a few places that are unoptimized all of the ObjectgetOwnPropertyNames can really bog stuff down the biggest culprit that I personally noticed was using JSONparse and JSONstringify to clone the configs in the base builder constructor This was taking much longer than actually fetching my queries from the databasecache So in this PR Ive refactored the default options to be a function returning an object instead of an object and the dialectspecific classes override this with the appropriate options Stylistically its definitely a bit uglier than just having an option but Ive found it to be a x speedup so its worth it to me Feel free to suggest other ways of eliminating the costly parsing and stringification as well Bumps knex from to details summaryChangelogsummary Sourced from knexs changelog

than relying on parent to exist Cloning will not give the parameter but will rather populate parent after the fact How do I produce this query SELECT john wick When you use mybtis in Java mapping a class as a result map Can I get the result value from an object for a particular field in the squel I have functions which require a squel object I have however written the SQL string myself without using this library Is there a way to insert the raw SQL string statement into a squel object If a table has a trigger in sql server then execute update with OUTPUT will cause it to fail The error message is RequestError The target table tablename of the DML statement cannot have any enabled triggers if the statement contains an OUTPUT clause without INTO clause More information on this problem and the workaround here Does anyone have a solution Hi cant figure out why I cant make a simple query let a squelselect separator n fromdboPerson p fieldcountdistinct ppersonId leftjoindboOrganizationDetail od odOrganizationUniqueID pOrganizationUniqueID toString Output SELECT countdistinct ppersonId FROM dboPerson p LEFT JOIN dboOrganizationDetail od ON odOrganizationUniqueID pOrganizationUniqueID Error RequestError Incorrect syntax near I see that the problem is under sign but why it formed like this Could I somehow avoid these cross quotes After sql is genereted code inside if optionsnumberedParameters replaces all optionsparameterCharacter occurrences with named parameters even if optionsparameterCharacter is inside a string literal To reproduce this bug you can use the following code javascript const squel requiresqueluseFlavourpostgres let q squelupdate tabletable seta consolelogqtoString Expected UPDATE table SET a Got UPDATE table SET a Only after minimizing when I try to do squelselectfrom I get an error that squelselectfrom is undefined When not minimized the code works fine Has anyone successfully minimized the code
