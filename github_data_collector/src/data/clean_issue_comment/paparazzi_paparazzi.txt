Made requested changes I run a check of the C codebase with cppcheck as part of one of my Universitys course projects Below the relevant errors that cppcheck found Each set of similar errors is

hope to be of help reporting this errors I made a cleaned installation of Paparazzi I have a parrot bebop and I tried to use videortpstream for the video streaming I used RTPviewer for visualization and ffmpeg There are many missing packets I do not understand why Furthermore even if I stop all the processes SERVER GCS and data link the bebop keeps me sending data I do not think this a nice behaviour After merging the latest master into the tu delft course code Ive noticed that the Bebop front camera image is a lot darker than before I suspect this has to do with I have not found the cause yet as that PR made a lot of changes to the front camera The default values are way too dark for flights inside the cyberzoo Ive tried increasing the color gains or exposure value but ran into some other issues low framerates or even loss of video I will play around with this a bit more but any hints on what has changed or how to fix this would be most welcome In many rotorcraft flight plans the flare block is structured the following way block nameflare exception condNavDetectGround derouteHolding point exception condnavisinflight deroutelanded callonce funNavStartDetectGround stay climbnavdescendvspeed vmodeclimb wpTD block It seems that the flair is often derouted to holding point this causes the airframe to fall out of the sky This has been noticed when flying the course orangeavoidcyberzoo Bebop aircraft However also when using different custom airframes based on a default bebop with optitrack with different flight plans a modified version of rotorcraftbasic this happens It has only been tested with bebop airframes For course orangeavoidcyberzoo It happens very often except when the takeoff is performed very smoothly by limiting the amount of throttle used It does not happen if THRESHOLDGROUNDDETECT is set tot a very high value ms is possibly related Adds the rlobstacleavoidance module This module is a proofofconcept for a new method for obstacle detection and avoidance on quadrotors One that does not require the addition of any sensors but relies solely on measurements from the accelerometer and rotor controllers The detection of obstacles is based on the principle that the airflow around a quadrotor changes when the quadrotor is flying near a surface A wellknown example of this is the ground effect an increase in lift force close to a ground surface Similarly a change in dynamics occurs when a quadrotor is flying close to a wall or ceiling The proposed method uses a reinforcement learning controller to detect obstacles based on these measurements and take action to lead the quadrotor back to safety Note This is an initial proofofconcept limited to the detection of obstacles underneath a quadrotor Documentation can be found here TOOFARFROMHOME with RC disco NO HOME too far throttle off works microjet simulator seems works HOME mode throttle disco after boot in sim and failsafethrottle after GPSERROR This is an upgrade for the UBlox driver and also some cleanup of the RTCM support Outcome Have still produced Parrot minidrone support in PPRZ master Steps x get minidrones to compile First in memset the issue Must haves x Get best Firmware x Test with parrot app x Mambo and Swing in Cyberzoo and film it x Add Busybox kernel modules fro USB port Add PWM output of Mambo usable Gripper Cannon and whatnot Fix sonar fully Add link to Firmware to use Remove the Debug items Add doxygen tags Run Astyle on code Adjust Wikipages to reflect current state Optional tasks Make better airframe for Swing so it can transition Upload to TU Channel Test Fly outside Maybe Add rolling spider to pprz conf Testfly Roling spider Since we can use USB but then bottom cam not defeats the purpose a bit So PWM port will be misuset for bits out and perferably in
