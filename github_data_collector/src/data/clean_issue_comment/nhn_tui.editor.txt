browser type OS and so on Mac OS Safari Current Behavior Write steps to reproduce the current behaviour in detail You can add sample code CodePen or jsfiddle links In Safari when you add checkbox Task in WYSIWYG mode when you move the cursor to the checkbox the pointer is not changed to hand icon But in Chrome it will changed to hand icon when point to the checkbox Expected Behavior Same as Chrome that show hand icon when mouse over checkbox Write a description for future action Version Development Environment Windows and Mac Chrome Firefox and edge Current Behavior When a user puts a mark tag in the markdown tab it shows the text highlight correctly on the preview but when the tab is switched to the wysiwyg the highlight disappears The tag is no longer on the text when you go back to the markdown tab Expected Behavior The mark tag stays in place like html tags or is a special type like italic and bold Description If after a Line there is a br and after that some other text the getMarkdown function add an extra br To Reproduce Go to Switch mode to WYSIWYG Add a Line with toolbar button Press enter Add some text Switch mode to Markdown Switch mode to WYSIWYG Repeat from how many times you want Version hey nhn A quick question about some funny behavior Im finding that when I copy paste content and maybe sometimes when Ive been typing a lot its not possible to scroll to the very top or sometimes bottom of the editor I usually need to start over refreshing the page or move the cursor blindly to the bottom to add a bunch more newlines Do you know why this might be happening and how to prevent it Thank you
