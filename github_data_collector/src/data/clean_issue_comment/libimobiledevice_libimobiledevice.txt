I ve been trying to install a profile onto iPhone but not exactly sure which api to use I m using the iMobileDevice variant of libimobiledevice but most functionality is same I ve tried Installationproxy misagent and now trying to figure out services to do it but no luck any ideas Im using Ubuntu I was able to install ioswebkitdebugproxy and libimobiledevice without issues When running ideviceid l I get an error ideviceid symbol lookup error ideviceid undefined symbol idevicedevicelistextendedfree Ill the share the logs of the steps I took sudo aptget install autoconf automake libusbdev libusb dev libplistdev libplistdev usbmuxd libtool libimobiledevicedev libssldev ioswebkitdebugproxy libplist libusbmuxd libimobiledevice sudo aptget install libimobiledeviceutils Im encountering this bug where a packet capture utility says it has Not Enough Data which seems to occur in this library Any ideas On Ubuntu with a device running iOS Traceback most recent call last

mainIDeviceError Error in libimobiledevice Not Enough Data Trying to do a full backup of my iPad Mini via Linux Mint I used this command idevicebackup backup mediakennyX MINTBACKUPiPadBackup It moves through the file list fairly quickly and I can see the file system and assets built on my target side but it doesnt seem to finish I let it run the first time for hours and the behavior is consistent Not sure if it matters but the target device is an SD card mounted on my laptop Selection New to GitHub so be gentle Pretty simple situation I downloaded the zip of this project and as per the instructions ran autogensh The output included following seems to indicate that things go as expected until the end at which point it dies because openssl cant be found Seeing as openssl is a pretty important component the install ends up being unusable I know that Apple has been monkeying around with sslrelated components of late which means that my first suspicion is that something changed in Catalina that causes autogen to fail Thoughts Suggestions Commiseration Thanks Aaron glibtoolize putting auxiliary files in glibtoolize linking file ltmainsh glibtoolize putting macros in

consistency of all components of python development environment yes checking for openssl no configure error OpenSSL support explicitly requested but OpenSSL could not be found Hi Ive been trying to compile libimobiledevice and run into this when running make idevicec error conversion to incomplete type if usbmuxdsetsockettypeenum usbmuxdsockettypevalue idevicec In function idevicegetsockettype If I change it to the idevicesockettype function I get another error saying I have undefined references for the following functions usbmuxdgetsockettype usbmuxdsetsockettype usbmuxdgettcpendpoint usbmuxdsettcpendpoint I built usbmuxd and its installed so Im not sure why it cant find the references Add passwordfromenv option to idevicebackup so that the backup password can be obtained from an environment variable and not from a commandline parameter This should be slightly more secure in that the password wont end up in the shells command history okay so it started with error code i have an macbook pro and am using an adaptor from USB C to USB AB so i figured this may give me the error code i opened the Activity Monitor and searched for usbd and Force Quit it then i went back to the Terminal and did ideviceinfo again and now i am on Error Code havent seen any other articles on this Error Codes i am not a programmer or anything myself so i have no clue what to do now Help Gnome file manager complained Invalid Apple File Control Received when copying files to apps There seems to be a patch can address this issue is it possible to merge it into upstream IOS Device iPhone plus Software Version r gd f ff latest git build Patch Only works of the time When it doesnt It prints a single question mark character idevicedebug d run comyaddayadda Ran it several times successes failures But the app does not launch When it works it works without printing anything It does not matter if the screen is off or on Also does not matter if the app was already launched When it fails to launch it will wake the device
