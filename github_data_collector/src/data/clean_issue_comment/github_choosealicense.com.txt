choosealicencecom note the second c in licence that redirects to choosealicensecom has the certificate for githubcom which brings up a warning screen First I really love this page One way it can be improved is to include some yesnoundefined checkboxes along the top of the table When you eg check the box above Same License it brings all same licenses to the top grays out all other licenses If you check several boxes only those licenses with ALL checked conditions are highlighted Below those partially grayed out or something are licenses that partially match the checkboxes in decreasing number of matches And below that too is the remaining licenses totally grayed out That would make this page awesome to use Thanks hope this helps please mention requirements before running bootstrap on my Fedora i had to install sudo dnf install zlib rubydevel zlibdevel thanks Add Free Art License Related Issue In order to make your data more reusable please generate the file shown in the title FSF License Metadata API is defined in the following site It is a convenient data format that can be reused That data format can associate the license identifiers with the catalog name and tags For example licenses apsl fileName of choosealicensecomlicensesapsl txt name Apple Public Source License identifiers spdx APSL OSI Apple Public Source License FSF FSFapsl tags libre FSF information patentuse choosealicense information Please have a look at the data I made for a trial From this json data and the similarity of the license text you can deduce the characteristics of the unknown license For example SPDX ODCby is not included in choosealicense but it can be inferred that it has characteristics similar to SPDX ODbl Please look at the attached figure licenseodcbyODbl Hello Thank you for making this website It is such a great resource The only thing that I feel is missing is some information on the compliance requirements It is really really difficult to find information on what is required of you when using or modifying a particular open source project For example what is required of you if you choose to use some code from a project which uses GPLv I recently learned that you MUST offer to mail a physical CD of the source code to anyone who requests it It is only in GPLv that you can offer the source code over the internet I also wonder about what the compliance requirements are of more permissive licenses like MIT Is it enough to include a copy of the license in the source code or do you need to mention somewhere publicly that you are using these projects in order to give public attribution It would be really helpful to know this information for each of the different licenses that are available As a new user of the site it would be very helpful if there was a way to limit the list of licenses in the appendix based on license attributes permissionsconditionslimitations so that its easier to compare all of the licenses that fit a users criteria For example if I wanted to see only licenses that had both the disclosesource condition AND NOT the trademarkuse limitation it would be great if there was a way to check a couple boxes and view only the licenses that fit that search I can see that this site is meant to simplify the process of choosing a license by keeping things very streamlined which I really have appreciated I also am not familiar enough with the framework for this site to know whether this feature is feasible otherwise I would go ahead and start working on it We should have a test that each license text in licenses is the same as the plain text license in the SPDX collection to automate the requirement described at The text of the license should match the corresponding text found in spdxlicenselistdata If there are errors there please fix them in spdxlicenselistXML from which the plain text version is generated so as to minimize license text variation and make it easier for choosealicensecom to eventually consume license texts directly from SPDX The test could clone spdxlicenselistdata and compare each license we have cataloged in this project Many existing licenses would probably have to be marked as expected failures due to bugs in SPDX output and discrepancies in how this project has cataloged some licenses But we should address upfront for any new license cataloged here and continue to chip away at the existing inconsistencies I would totally use this license for all of my projects if it was recognized by GitHub It is OSI approved and provides a patent grant similar equivilent to the Apache license It is the best of what the MIT and Apache licenses have to offer This license should not be confused with the whole Facebook React license debacle In that case Facebook licensed React under the classic BSD Clause license but included a patent grant in a seperate PATENTS file which had a termination clause written in a rather problematic manner A Github code search reveals a lot of hits but Im sceptical that they are all for this license I would also be interested to see how many projects use the BSD Clause license in addition to a seperate patent grant in a PATENTS file as these are the projects that would benefit the most from this license choosealicenseorg has HSTS due to It would be great to go all the way and preload HSTS Steps would be x Serve an HSTS header with a value of StrictTransportSecurity maxage includeSubDomains preload Make sure choosealicenseorg can be accessed from curlgolang this times out from HQ Submit to parkr could you help me find where the HSTS header served by choosealicenseorg is configured
