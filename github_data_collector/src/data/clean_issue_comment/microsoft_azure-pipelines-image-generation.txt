Looking at the specs of windowslatest image it contains the following Selenium Web Drivers Chrome Gecko IE Would it be possible to support Edge since that is the standard for windows I have a Driver test that relies on Edge using CI Azure Pipeline Thanks Here is the error I get in my CI ERROR The process MicrosoftEdgeexe not found Software Updates Week curl x appledarwin libcurl SecureTransport zlib Bundler version fastlane azurecli Go NVM Installed node versions v v v macOS toolcache Python macOS toolcache Ruby Google Chrome Android Emulator My team would like to use Azure Devops to build our iOS project We have a custom configuration script written in ruby which generates some config files build rd party dependencies download translate files etc When we execute it in local everything is fine but if we use Azure Devops Agent for build we got strange errors For example empty generated file but no error message on console or random build error when building one of the dependencies we use carthage for dependency management First we used Microsoft hosted agents than we created a self hosted agent but no success I tried to execute the config script on that computer which holds the self hosted agent and I got a success build just like in every other teammates computer The agent version is and as far as I know this is the latest version at that moment We started to debug our configuration script but we cant find any related issue After that I looked what is inside the agent If I understand correctly the tasks are written in js and there is a node module shelljs which translates the tasks to bash script The version of this module is which is very old This module is a dependency of vsotasklib which version is which is deprecated Im afraid this version contains bugs and maybe this cause that strange errors Can someone give me some information about this PLEASE USE THIS REPO FOR REQUESTS RELATED TO THE WINDOWS CONTAINER IMAGE The other images have moved to Tool

under but fail under This may potentially enable some CIs to pass again I am unable to use the AzManagedServiceIdentity with PowerShell because it requires AzAccounts This has recently stopped working so I imagine theres a new version of AzManagedServiceIdentity which requires version of AzAccounts The latest version available in hosted agents seem to be The same seems to have happened in the past with version Heres the error message I get upon issuing the following commands InstallModule AzManagedServiceIdentity Force ImportModule AzManagedServiceIdentity This module requires AzAccounts version An earlier version of AzAccounts is imported in the current PowerShell session Please open a new session before importing this module This error could indicate that multiple incompatible versions of the Azure PowerShell cmdlets are installed on your system Please see for troubleshooting information Visual Studio has some nasty bugs related to codegen causing our environment to completely break The last one we can work around but the first are completely broken with no workarounds There should be an option to revert to prior VS versions if major bugs like this occur Tool

The bug is that our project is based on Net Core I tried running the same command for testing ie C Program Files dotnet dotnetexe test D a s proj BusinessTests BusinessTestscsproj pCollectCoveragetrue

that the dotnet publish task for another project based on Net Core works fine on both agents We are using the dotnet task in the pipeline v Expected behavior It should run fine on both agents LinuxWindows since both have Net Core Actual behavior A description with steps to reproduce the issue Create a testing project targeting Net Core with some sample unit tests Try running the CI
