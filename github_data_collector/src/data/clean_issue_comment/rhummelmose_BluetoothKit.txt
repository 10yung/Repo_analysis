Is this library suitable for modbus protocol communication with iOS devices and some meter devices thanks it is very nice bug it do not for swift can you adapt it Its now also possible to simply pause a BKPeripheral instance keeping the info about all the connected BKCentrals Its now possible to look for multiple BKCharacteristic associated with a BKService Delegate methods have been updated accordingly I have installed the latest update of the code but I am facing a serious problem when I try to connect on iOS devices Every time I receive a message that says Please turn on Bluetooth to connect to the device I have traced the code and it seems that the CBCentralManager state is always poweredOff I tested BLE connection on the same iOS device with other apps and it works fine Sometimes it just needed to turn off then turn on the Bluetooth from settings to be able to connect Other apps works after turning off then on the Airplane mode But neither works with my app and its Bluetooth kit code Any solution please The code in BKPeerswift sendData is as follows after a task is added to the sendDataTasks array if sendDataTaskscount processSendDataTasks This processes the tasks if theres exactly task in that array Unfortunately when you have multiple peers andor youre sending a several data tasks the array will grow past and the processSendDataTasks is never called The code should be if sendDataTaskscount processSendDataTasks Ill follow this with a PR to address it Thanks Eric I just came across this typo or what seems to be a typo Just FYI Youre passing the oldCause as the newCause and vise versa Hi I tested BluetoothKit background scanning and I could not make it work The issue I have encountered is that scanContinuouslyWithChangeHandler actually scans for default seconds pauses for inBetweenDelay of seconds and starts again Scanning and pause interval are implemented using timers that do not work in background with phone locked Infoplist has correct keys since after changes I have made it worked as expected In BKScannerswift I have cloned scanWithDuration function with different name and did not initialised durationTimer Then I used new function whenwhere needed several other changes had to be made to original code However I appreciate all help since BluetoothKit is very good library and I didnt had to write all the code myself I am using the BLE CC module to interact with my arduino device For testing I connected the TxD pin and RxD pin directly for that I can get the same data when I send data in iOS App Like this First I used the Example of this repository After I modified the UUID of service and characteristic I successfully scanned my BLE device But when I send multiple data it only received one And then I created a simple project It has a button for sending data a textfield for what to send and a textview for displaying the received data The code is like this swift IBAction func onSendBtnClicked sender Any let data Data inputTextFieldtextdatausing StringEncodingutf centralsendDatadata toRemotePeer remotePeripheral data remotePeripheral error in guard error nil else printFailed sending to remotePeripheral return printSent to remotePeripheral func remotePeer remotePeer BKRemotePeer didSendArbitraryData data Data printRecieved Stringdata data encoding StringEncodingutf error receivedTextViewtext receivedTextViewtext Stringdata data encoding StringEncodingutf I filled the TextField with gghh after multiple clicking on sendBtn what it returned like this Previously I used a objectivec library SerialGATTh SerialGATTm which can receive the data at real time when I tap the button I am using pod BluetoothKit Im getting a CoreBluetooth warning CoreBluetooth WARNING The delegate for CBPeripheral x ede identifier F DCBDE B F C name iPhone state connected does not implement peripheraldidModifyServices Looks like it just needs an implementation in the BKCBPeripheralDelegateProxy
