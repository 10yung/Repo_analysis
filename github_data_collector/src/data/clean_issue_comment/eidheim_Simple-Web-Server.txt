Does SwS support multipart data transfer Or how I can use rdparty lib to do this in SwS Currently successive calls to Responsesend may queue data to be sent twice For example the following will send foofoofoobarbarbaz when it should only send foobarbaz c response foo responsesend response bar responsesend response baz responsesend This pull request fixes the issue by taking a snapshot of the buffer before sending it It also contains a unit test that fails with the old code but passes with the new No other unit tests are broken by this code Hi How can avoid the SSL Pinning in this Fool the domain name using hosts file where the server runs warning C boostasiobasicsocketProtocolcancel By default this function always fails with operationnotsupported when used on Windows XP Windows Server or earlier Consult documentation for details test C lib simplewebserver clienthttphpp It would be very useful if the HttpClientrequest function would return an awaitable type for use in coroutines See the Naked Coroutines talk by Gor Nishanov The library can use standalone ASIO and Boost ASIO Because ASIO has a new incarnation in the C standard itself The Networking TS AND a compatibility layer the Networking TS should be the sole target in future versions This should make SimpleWebServer more portable and I believe removes ALL external dependencies We get an error in Serverconst stdstring certfile const stdstring privatekeyfile const stdstring verifyfilestdstring ServerBaseHTTPSServerBase contextboostasiosslcontexttlsv contextusecertificatechainfilecertfile contextuseprivatekeyfileprivatekeyfile boostasiosslcontextpem ifverifyfilesize contextloadverifyfileverifyfile contextsetverifymodeboostasiosslverifypeer boostasiosslverifyfailifnopeercert boostasiosslverifyclientonce setsessionidcontexttrue we get four error function boostasiosslcontextcontextconst boostasiosslcontext declared implicitly cannot be referenced it is a deleted function serverhttpshpp class boostasiosslcontext has no member tlsv serverhttpshpp tlsv is not a member of boostasiosslcontext serverhttpshpp tlsv undeclared identifier serverhttpshpp I find a problem when I use serverhttphppold version in http qq response is a sharedptrHttpServer Response type In this way response can send data to the client However qq qq When I let Res equal to responseresponse can not send data to the client Why I cant pass a sharedptrHttpServer Response to another
