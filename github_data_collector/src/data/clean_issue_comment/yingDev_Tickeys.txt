It would be better if it automatically start when it turn on Hello Ive been enjoying this app for like year but after update to mac catalina sounds no longer bump out Keep up the nice work Thank you I appreciate for using this app I love this But Id like to want the function which when we type a key continual sound effects arises If we delete some characters we hold down a button but a single sound arises only Is this possible Thank you Tickeys This app listed as preventing sleep on activity monitor and i think this should be fixed Hi I am using Tickeys version on OSX High Sierra version The program works well in general but when I type in iTermapp I get no sound I have tried each Audio Fx but none of them work in iTerm They all do work in all other kinds of apps for example Chrome Atom Thunderbird Is this a known issue And if so will it be fixed Thanks in advance ps mac
