Hi Ive tried renaming the source directory name to src Installing the produced package will install the package in sitepackagessrc and sure enough importing it requires import src rather than import packagename Example vs Sample Hello According to this thread and that commit it seems to me that with setuptools the keywords argument of setup expects a string containing a commaseparated list however the setuppy example in the PyPA sample project uses a string containing a spaceseparated list keywordssample setuptools development Am I somehow mistaken Besides if commaseparated list is indeed the correct thing to use it seems to me that it would be desirable to make it so that each item has spaces trimmed on both sides so as to allow readable values such as sample setuptools development as opposed to samplesetuptoolsdevelopment However the setuptools docs seem rather vague in this department keywords listcomma listcomma dangling list or string of commaseparated values Thanks Provide an appveyoryml file Asking cause it give me trouble with python with long description as markdown A setupcfg is cleaner is easy to parse and does not require running any Python code Its usage should be showcased It would be nice to publish this project at as it changes preferably automatically on merge when things change Hi everyone I recently released a new Python Library check here I followed the tutorial to allow PIP install and created the setuppy I dont know if it is right I have inside the github page a folder named verticamlpython I want that in the execution of pip install verticamlpython it goes to and copy paste the folder in the user sitepackages folder and that is all If someone can help me I would be really grateful Best Badr Cf Itd probably be better to encourage people to keep initpy minimal
