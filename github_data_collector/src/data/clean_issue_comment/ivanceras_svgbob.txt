Can I revert an svg fileconverted by svgbob back to the original ascii text Id like to create something like svgbob to generate tikzpgf output suitable for inclusion in LaTeX documents but havent learned rust yet Does svgbob have an internal representation that then gets rendered as SVG such that all Id need to replace would be the renderer Or is the input text parsed directly to SVG Everywhere except the drawing lines and characters Normally there is no gap between adjacent and eg but if the two are vertically aligned there is a gap ab ab also when simply vertically align the two is treated as a character Normally one CJK character equal two english character width the following will be closed If the line contains escape qutoe the CJK character seems need english character spaces to get the shape closed I am using svgbob Sometime a char is treated as diagram char when it was intended to be word char Example coedit singleperson Is rendered as The hyphen after o is treated as a horizontal line Example some remark some text some remark some text Is rendered as The open bracket between lines is rendered as a diagram which the close bracket is still rendered as text Context Im building my blog on netlify Netlify have no support of Rust yet Blog example Compared the ugly looking diagram to my local version For sure I will try to persuade netlify to support rust so i can cargo install or at least let me use my own docker image for build Else i can migrate from netlify to something else As an hack i just extracted the svg from the diagram That being said increasing the reach by supporting Node env seems an ok concern for me If not please close the issue Ideas Solution svgbob on npm as childprocess i can create a module that package binary with target x unknownlinuxmusl and launch child process Question are you interesting of supporting it once created added in the readme what about the licence can I redistribute binary Solution svgbob on npm as webassembly Given rust awesome of webassembly maybe it is possible to build svgbob as webassembly Question have someone tried it if I try can this become official that will allow client side parsing of markdown with svgbob and thus increase adoption like mermaid which is build in gitlab markdown Please add release tags for your releases in the repository It is not possible to package this application without proper release tags The shapes are all cramped together in one big path and it is not possible for further styling This is requirement for issue Raising this out of this thread to not digress too much Should svgbob allow the ability to style nodes It would be nice to be able to do it so that diagrams can be represented in text and still support colour The ascii version of the diagram is not very readable with styling information included in each node ivanceras gave an example of using single letters to represent colour but I foresee potential use cases for additional styling Ive copied a bit of the post and edited it to see what it may look like Alice a Bob bc Apple a Ball b Legend a color red b color blue c opacity Also what about people wanting to style lines Maybe we leave that as a separate topic
