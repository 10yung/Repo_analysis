Fill the gaps when segment is too long for the choosen speed This fixes issue I would like to control an RGBWW lamp with WLED In the wikis FAQ it says pins RGBCT RGB white channels is supported However when trying to use it by defining WLEDUSEANALOGLEDS WLEDUSE CH and apparently also WLEDUSEH it does not work Apart from a few typos like the define WLEDUSE CH having to be define WLEDUSE CHLED and two instances of it saying colorW instead of color it is still not able to control the second white channel When looking though the code it seems that the frontend doesnt support channels after all but even when connecting it to home assistant via the wled integration the second white channel is unused The pin stays at V Is this just a mistake in the FAQ and channels are not supported or am I doing something wrong Thanks Hi Aircookie The b is performing very well here Very smooth I had an idea because Ive now added some LEDs to my youngest desk and as some features are not controllable through the IKEA remote Ive given him he has to have the WLED app installed This in itself is not a problem everybody can just download it but it is a problem that he and others can add our lights to their app and create chaos for us if they have access to our Wifi of course Thus I would very much like to have a password protection or the like built in to the code so that you have to give the password in the app to be allowed to add it This will eliminate the problem of him and others making funny effects with the other wleds in the house My thought was that you could set the password during the initial setup and then to be able to add it to the app you would have to enter the password as well Hi guys I installed Wled NodeMcu and led strips on my house Set up automations in HA to work together as in DR Zzsss repo There are issues approx minutes strip the long one is turning off without any command from HA Tried linking this to a specific effect but couldnt find a reason automation is turning the led show off at and in the morning I have few leds in random colors lighten up continuously The scheme is The picture for nd issue Please advise where to start debugging and how HW issue SW issue Thank you for your help Hi Ive been working on a usermod to add Lifx support to WLED I think its working prettywell but its probably not quite ready yet for a pull request If its not too cheeky could you give it a onceover and see if you have any views There are fairly extensive notes at the top of wled about its capabilities and requirements Two particular points of interest ie areas where it might be dubious To allow WLED to control individual LEDs I added a new FXMODEUSERMOD which does nothing but stop WLED from doing any LEDsetting itself Is there a better way For Lifx purposes I divide the strip into eight or zones Lifx requires multiples of eight I believe I think this has no overlap with your segments concept and should indeed be implemented separately as it currently is but frankly I am not certain Views greatly appreciated I have a Feature Request I think would be useful some randomization like a Roll the Dice button and have different and selectable things be randomized I Drew and attached a Mockup Mock up of what it could look like Since it is so difficult to make up ones mind on which effect colors to use It would be great to be able to enable randomness on Primary Color Secondary Color Tertiary Color Effect Palette Speed Intensity My WiFi is quite ordinary n WPA PSK AES protected network with Netgear r router with the SSID of Name Surnamev Im not sure if the ampersand or underscore could make any difference With version everything is working perfectly but beta of new version just fails to connect and fallbacks to AP mode Is there any debugginglogging I can do to help you resolve the issue For now I just downgraded to the older version which still works just fine but I can just update yet again to make any further tests if required Already tried clearing entire EEPROM no success Fixes the WS Color Order Ive flash with WLED b ESP Mfullbin WLED ESP mfullbin Everything works until it connect to my wifi I get this message sd rd

passing an additional duration argument This way the coloreffect was displayed the specified amount of time and after that the previous state was restored This would be a nice feature to have on WLED as well I use this for notifications to eg blink a strip for seconds Greets recliq
