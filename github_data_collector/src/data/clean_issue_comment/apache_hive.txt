 e schema upgrade scripts ChangeId I ff d fb cd e cb ba ccf d e upgrade scripts ChangeId Ie caccfcd f d a c f c cc f e b f Ugly things are yet to come Will also do some method signature changes later my spark HivePreparedStatementsetString handles backslash escaping incorrectly So using setString with strings ending with backslash xxxxx lead to syntax error Parquetavro use Avro which support avro logicaltype but hive use avro So that hive just use primitive types to read avro In avro decimal can be transformed to fix and date can transformed to int logicaltype date hive can read these two type with primitive types fix and int But timestamp will be transformed to long logicaltypetimestampmicros If user create a table with column timestamp hive will report error that long can not cast to timestamp So I create a PR to let hive can read long as timestamp
