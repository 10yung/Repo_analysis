corresponding input variable to a dataframe upon file upload completion which allows the user to user the corresponding input variable as the eventExpr to shinyobserveEvent for observing a file upload As for shinyFilesshinyFilesButton the corresponding input variable is updated every time the shinyFiles button is clicked or a file is uploaded As such to achieve the same function one has to add a shinyreq call to check if the corresponding input variable is empty Reprex runApplist ui shinyUI fluidPage shinyFilesButtonfile Load Dataset Please select a dataset FALSE textOutputtxt server

mimic shinyfileInput behaviour How to set the progress bar in shinyFileChoose when i upload the data Hi I am working with shinyDirButton and shinyDirChoose to allow selection of a folder starting from a specific default folder specified throgh defaultPath and defaultRoot The problem is that when I then invoke parseDirPath to get the selected folder name apparently the defaultPath value is ignored In practice the returned path is defaultRootnameoffolder while if I get the expected functionality right it should be defaultRootdefaultPathnameoffolder Below you can find an example not really reprex because it is related to my paths libraryshiny libraryshinyFiles ui volumes cmain homelb shinyUIfluidPage titlePanelExample shinyDirButtonsavedir Save folder Save folder server

printdirinfo shinyAppui ui server server If I run the example I correctly get a list of folders starting from my homelbtmp although I see main on the top instead than tmp or maintmp However if I now select the buttami subfolder and click on select the path returned by dirinfo parseDirPathvolumes inputsavedir is homelbbuttami while I would expect it to be homelbtmpbuttami Am I missing somethingmisunderstanding the functionality here Hi I see that a lot of new features are being built into shinyFiles lately and thats great thanks for your hard work I have come across a problem that occurs when a shinyFilesButton shinyDirButton shinySaveButton is placed inside a shinymodalDialog The shinyFiles Dialog pops up and works except that you cannot browsechange the root folder selection The dropdown menu shows up for a half second sometimes if you keep clicking on the rootFolder selection input but no chance to change the folder Here is an example based on shinyFilesExample Note how the folder selection works for the buttons in the main page but not the modal dialog libraryshiny libraryshinyFiles libraryfs server shinyServerfunctioninput output session volumes cHome fspathhome R

some other packages but I cannot make it work again by installing older versions of shinyFiles from github so maybe its a problem with other packages Have that problem on both Windows and Linux R

promises tools httpuv compiler htmltools tibble It would be useful if entering the first few letters of a file or directory name would select the correct icon similar to Finder macOS of File Explorer Windows By default the file picker forces the UI to use large icons and sorts by name Our users like using lists and want to sort by creation date Could we add an input option to specify these filters prior to opening Any idea how do I use the shinyFilesButton and shinyFileChoose functions in flexdashboard I used it as it is with Shiny UI and Server functions but then its a bit limited to pass variables out of it Will be nice to know if anyone tried this already Hello First thank you for this great package It was really useful to me in building a graphical user interface inside my own package On user asked me if it was possible to add ability to type the file path in the shinyFiles file access to gain time It might be on good improvement of the existing file access engine Have a nice day Sylvain
