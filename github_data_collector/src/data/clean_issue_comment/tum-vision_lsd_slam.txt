For this purpose I have installed lsdslam and ran examples successfully Now my question is is it possible to calculate actual distance of each point of an image from its depth map that is generated

per the paper I am using an RGB camera Orbbec Astra and a FLIR E and they have been calibrated intrinsic and extrinsic The process to create a corresponding thermal map is simple For a keyframe consider a pixel get its D coordinates in the RGB camera frame using the inverse depth map Using the extrinsic parameters get the point in the thermal camera frame and reproject the point into the thermal image using its intrinsic matrix The value of the image will give us the thermal value of the pixel of the image Now I have been looking into the LSD SLAMcore code and used Doxygen as well to understand it better However Im unable to determine where and how do I start making changes to the code to get this thing working Any help would really be appreciated as I have a deadline for the same in a month Thanks
