out which video sequence Im getting from the VideoReader In other words is it possible to know which video file is read and which frames in the video files are read I have a model that uses another feature of the video and I need to know what exactly happened to the video so that I can load the correct feature Thank you in advance Why we need this PR It adds new feature GPU TorchPythonFunction What happened in this PR What solution was applied Almost no work was needed as current TorchPythonFunction was able to handle gpu data The only thing needed was proper synchronization Affected

examples operator documentation JIRA TASK NA Im currently using NVIDIA Dali nightly built for Python Im working with video and Im keen to try out data augmentation on video frames such as Random Scaling Apply scale the aspect ratio to heightwidth a sequence of video frames where aspect ratio is chosen randomly from eg for frames in entire sequence Random Crop Apply random crop for cropsize w h for video frames at random point but still within the original frame size Random Horizontal Flip Apply Flip randomly with probability eg I noted that those operations are supported already for Image But how about for input videos from opsVideoReader It would be nice if I can do some sort of video pipeline definition selfvideoreader opsVideoReader selfvideoscale opsRandomlyScaleVideo input NFCHW or NFHWC selfvideorandomcrop opsRandomlyCropVideo input NFCHW or NFHWC selfvideohorizontalcrop opsRandomlyFlip input NFCHW or NFHWC Issue I tried using the available operations in NVIDIA DALI opsFlip opsRandomResizedCrop with randomaspectratio But it seems those operations only support image input HWC The program I run output an error complaining mismatch for shape and only expect outputlayout HWC Questions So my questions are Can I used the available operations for video Please do point me out if I can use those operations for video frames with NFCHW or NFHWC input I notice some operations only support Image HWC If do how do I specify to the operations that Im inputing video frames not single image uses the custom readwriteseek libav API that allows providing custom accessing function This function opens the required file on demand The previously accessed file is closed automatically it is faster than calling avformatopeninput after each file reopen add test to check if DALI can
