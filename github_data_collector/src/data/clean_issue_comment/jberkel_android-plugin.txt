I have seen that there is some integration only with the Os X keyring perhaps using a library can help a lot Using Scala sbt to write seamlessly integrated OSX Apps has a section explaining the use of the Netbeans keyring module cited from the site It consists of two parts A platformindependent API and implementations of this API for all major operating systems Currently there are implementations for OSX Windows KDE Gnome SPI and a fallback using a Java keystore We start by adding all of that to our buildsbt libraryDependencies Seq orgnetbeansapi orgnetbeansmoduleskeyring RELEASE orgnetbeansmodules orgnetbeansmoduleskeyringimpl RELEASE resolvers netbeans at Usage is straightforward once you know that the keyring only stores char arrays private val keyName doctivity def readToken KeyringreadkeyName match case null None case chars SomecharsmkString def storeTokentoken String KeyringsavekeyName tokentoCharArray access token for doctivity def deleteToken KeyringdeletekeyName For crossplatform projects like desktopAndroidiOS it is real pain to force users to install Android SDK they will never use Maybe just switching the check in determineAndroidSdkPath from error to warning would do Seeing warning people will be aware that if they try to compile anything they get unexpected result Because of how androidplugin interprets provided dependencies it is harder to create projects depending on macro packages but not including those packages If package A is declared to be provided dependency it marks all its dependencies as provided no matter if they are included by any other package as dependency Thus if provided macro package is included it makes scalalibrary and all its dependencies provided I think a lot better solution would be to mark as provided only those packages that are explicitly marked as provided or implicitly marked as provided and not required by any other explicitly notprovided package btw I asked on scalaonandroid weeks ago and no one replied if this is indended behaviour or bug on my side so I decided to open issue for it Hi On command sbt androidpackagedebug I get an error error MyApp androidaaptgenerate javaioIOException Cannot run program C dev adtbundle sdk platformtools aapt CreateProcess error The system cannot find the file specified I use Android SDK x and indeed appropriate aapt is in sdkHome sdk buildtools aaptexe not in sdkHome sdk platformtools aaptexe Cheers GT Just tried SNAPSHOT and everything seems to work except the preloading feature After running sbt preloaddevice the contents of systemetcpermissionsscalalibrary xml were as follows permissionslibrary namescalalibrary filesystemframeworkscalalibrary jar permissions After manually changing this file to this basically adding quotes permissions library namescalalibrary filesystemframeworkscalalibrary jar permissions everything works as expected and I no longer get INSTALLFAILEDMISSINGSHAREDLIBRARY during install phase Great plugin by the way having Scala preloaded really speeds up development Also posted here I tried to implement the renamemanifestpackage option for aapt Issue It looks fine to me the option is really appended to the aapt call I verified it However the generated Android app does not have the changed package name I dont know what the problem could be Perhaps someone else has a clue Hi Im trying to create two versions of my android app That means that I have to have two different package names in the AndroidManifest file An easy solution to this problem would be to use aapt renamemanifestpackage as described here I think aaptGenerateTask in AndroidBasescala would have to be changed to support this package name parameter There was update of distribution sbt package to on ArchLinux so I tried compiling my project using sbtandroid with it It was unable to resolve dependencies info Resolving orgscalasbtsbtandroid warn module not found orgscalasbtsbtandroid warn typesafeivyreleases tried warn warn sbtpluginreleases tried warn warn local tried warn homeginiewiczivy localorgscalasbtsbtandroidscala sbt ivysivyxml warn public tried warn warn warn UNRESOLVED DEPENDENCIES warn warn orgscalasbtsbtandroid not found warn warn warn Note Some unresolved dependencies have extra attributes Check that these dependencies exist with the requested attributes warn orgscalasbtsbtandroid sbtVersion scalaVersion warn See the mailing list for more I set up a project and ran this command in the top level alongside the project directory and a few errors printed in the command line error Not a valid key genidea error genidea noclassifiers error I have no doubts that Im doing something wrong could anyone clue me in to what that might be
