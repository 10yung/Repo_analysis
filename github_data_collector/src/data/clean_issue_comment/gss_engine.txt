Theres no documentation on your website I understand that the project is dead but you probably should shut down the website open issues last commit was a year ago and gridstylesheetsorg has a new owner Hello I really liked the project and it looks pretty promising I was wondering if it is possible that I can take the result of a parsed layout cuz i want to use that for canvas games to maintain the layout ie ball centerx basket centerx ball bottom basket bottom can I use something like GSSEnginegetPropertiesByIdball Yet another oddity Ive come across regarding inline gss vs external gss This following code if window width testdiv backgroundcolorblue else testdiv backgroundcolorgreen testdiv size does not work at all when inside a gss file that is linked by the main html page Not even the else triggers However if applied inline in the head section of the page it works I can verify that this problem only arises with properties such as window width and scrolltop When using other properties such as div width for the condition Im having no issues Anyone know the reason behind this It feels as if the external gss file cant access properties such as window width and scrolltop but that cant be the case since Im able to use them in other sections of my code It appears position fixed doesnt work in GSS as it did in regular CSS Ive made a header that I need to be at the top of the window always and it makes full use of GSS to center buttons logo etc Is there any property I can use that would take into account the scroll position of the viewport Load this with log and note query width has a value of span idspannerspan input idquery typetext value style typetextgss h spannerquery inwindow query width require style When I use the code below thing get a width of content width thing width width But when I reference content directly thing gets a width of as expected content width thing width content width What am I missing Why doesnt the first code work Would it be possible to support the before and after pseudo elements I would expect the code below to show a red rectangle in the center of the screen but the pseudo element is not positionedstyled content width height center window center contentbefore content backgroundcolor red width content width height content height It is my understanding that GSS does not support this syntax sass selector myBGC f backgroundcolor myBGC anotherselector backgroundcolor selector backgroundcolor I was unable to make this snippet work with any variation of variable declaration type of color syntax used ie blue fff rgb Is binding to backgroundcolor and other colorrelated items supported Or is that something I would have to handle myself manually or by using another CSSJS framework is there build documentation I didnt see any on the README around the dirtree or at the website what I tried git clone git checkout v grunt clean grunt build Grunt produced a byte file instead of a KB one indeed there was nothing of note inside I tried some other things like grunt browserify and grunt uglify and still couldnt produce anything log grunt build Running browserifyspec browserify task Bundle specjsspecsjs created Running uglifyengine uglify task File distgssminjs created Original bytes Minified bytes Running usebannerdist usebanner task gruntbanner completed successfully Done without errors
