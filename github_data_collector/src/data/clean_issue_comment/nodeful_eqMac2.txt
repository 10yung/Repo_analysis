Invitation for confirmation of findings Available via build and test only at this time For Christmas I replaced a perfectly good pair of computer speakers with a more perfectly good pair except for an irritating but hifi booming bass tone Went in search of a simple equalizer app and found Audio Hijack Pro level more than I was looking for Boom D Bought it Worked great but was concerned wrongly it seems about need to access the mic at full volume and unfortunately necessary copy protection eqMac Free open source Saw this and since I had been wanting to learn about Xcode and Objective C and Git and GitHub decided to clone and build it Several hours pass Got it built and it worked fine for a while After a few minutes the output would start to degrade and after about minutes output would cease Found that release v also failed and this was a reported issue Decided to try and narrow down where the failure was happening Under Xcode it is possible to set breakpoints but this would crash the program in a kind of Heisenbug effect Even setting a breakpoint in code not being executed would disrupt the output with or clicks producing the same effect as letting it run for minutes I added numerous printf statements which appear on the Xcode console to instrument the program I couldn t tell exactly what was wrong let alone how to fix it but it seemed to be a buffering problem with the ring buffer In my searches I had noticed a project from nine years ago related to CAPlayThrough on which eqMac is based which states Look A version of CAPlayThrough that works for the most part Standard disclaimers apply etc Ive cobbled together improvements to CARingBuffercpp and CARingBufferh that were based on an older version of CARingBuffer that I found in an older version of the CoreAudio SDK Thanks Pacifist There were many bugs in that class which caused havoc in the CAPlayThrough sample especially when mixing devices that have varying sample rates and drifting clocks Please if you find bugs try and fix them yourself and contribute back to this repo for the benefit of others I dont have time to respond to bug reports On a hunch I replaced these two modules in eqMac with the liscio versions and this seems to have fixed all the staticsync issues Wake from sleep issues may also be fixed In addition I looked at the install problems reported under Catalina and made changes to installdriversh and uninstalldriversh to copy the driver to LibraryExtensions instead of SystemLibraryExtensions I don t have Catalina to test but reading the comments seem to point to this or not It seems LE is preferred over SLE in general This will also work for older macOSs These simple shell scripts can be run from the command line This will also reveal any error messages Examine and modify as needed cd to dir containing scripts in eqMac app sudo installdriversh calls uninstalldriversh then installs driver sudo uninstalldriversh uninstalls all eqMac drivers Building Xcode is available from the App Store as a free multi GB download Install CocoaPods see READMEmd Make a directory to store the project using the command line and cd there git clone into this directory cd eqMac pod install Start Xcode Finder Double click eqMac xcworkspace other ways exist Xcode Click on project in Project Navigator set Signing Capabilities and Build Settings below Xcode R see Product menu App will start OK on Signing Capabilities Build Settings can be a world of hurt You can set up Personal Team using your Apple ID under XcodePreferencesAccounts to allow install on a local machine Under Signing Capabilities I used Automatically manage signing Checked Team your name here Personal Team Signing Certificate Development Under Build Settings Signing section Code Signing Identity Mac Developer Code Signing Style Automatic Development Team your name here Personal Team Provisioning Profile Automatic Also permission to use the eqMac Microphone needs to be given Also make sure the mic and output volumes are not zeroed or muted Do this often Also various macOS permissions may be involved Also these settings can interact with each other Bottom line eqMac has been up and running for days without apparent problems and am totally satisfied with this solution Anyone with a Mac should be able to build a working version All credit to the great work of Romans Kisils and Christopher Liscio Hello Before you create an issue please read the following message My name is Roman and Im the only developer of this app I will NOT contribute any more code to this repository ever again This repository is mostly for sharing the knowledge I gained during development At the moment I dedicate all my time to a startup and working on a new and very modern update to eqMac This new update will be completely rewritten from scratch and have many more new features and will be massively more stable at least thatt the plan I plan to release the new version in Q of Thank you for your patience and giving eqMac a go If you need help with eqMac please join our Slack Group Thats your best bet at getting some help from me or the community GitHub is only for sourcecode related issues Still would like to report a bug or suggest a feature I can implement in the next version Please make sure you search through the Open and Closed Issues people have already submitted This eliviates the posibility of people creating duplicate issues Hi anyone could explain the detailed workflow of this app The description says it uses CAPlayThrough and soundFlower driver As far as I can imagine eqMac does below things it gets the system audio output stream from the soundFlower driver output the output from soundflower is then captured as an input stream in CAPlayThrough the CAPlaythrough sends the stream to a selected output device Is this workflow currently implemented in eqMac I have tried multiple solutions and none have worked Ive allowed anything Im running macOS Catalina beta Please help with this Ive tried multiple things manual kext installation brew cask install eqmac I get a popup when I open EQMac saying it needs a driver update I do as follows but have to quit it As soon as I change from internal speakers to headphones on eqMac volume raises to Very inconvenient Got dead ears nodeful If you need help with eqMac please join our Slack Group Per issue submission guidelines Inactive Link Thats your best bet at getting some help from me or the community GitHub is only for sourcecode related issues Cracking issues are in many cases a non issue IMHO They are a user settings user guide documentation issue However there is a real issue in that the format selection for eqMac within the Audio MIDI Setup utility only has frequency ie Hz selection This is fine if your output device like the macbook pro speakers matches the bit depth ie bit and type ie Integer If you use an external audio device that doesnt match the frequency and depth viola cracking My output device only has or bit not so this is a problem Maybe theres a way to add bitdepths like and for compatibilities sake Also not sure if type IntegerFloat would make a difference but worth checking out image image image Im not an audiodriver developer but I am a fullstack developer professionally and produceraudio engineer in my spare time so this is an interesting intersection of domains for me If anyone gets any ideas or leads on this please tag me or reach out Umlauts arent fully supported in eqmac See screenshot screenshot Driver installation Fails on Catalina Any News on this Hi is it possible to only activate eq settings when external speakers or headphones are connected and chosen as audio output Also disabling after returning to builtin mac speakers automatically
