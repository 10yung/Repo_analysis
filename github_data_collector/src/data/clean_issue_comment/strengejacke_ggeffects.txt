I tried to use ggemmeans on a mira object from the mice package According to this documentation of the ggeffects package all models supported by emmeans should work However in my particular case it did not libraryggeffects libraryemmeans librarymice librarycarData librarytidyverse Here I am fitting a logistic regression model and use the emmenas package to calculate predicted marginal means fit

a problem with plm now See here I was wondering if it would be possible to add an optional argument that plots the distribution of the moderator variable in an interaction term in plotmodel The interflex package provides an elegant implementation of this Example Fit model m glm totsce c sex c code negc data efc family poisson Plot moderator plotmodel m type pred terms cnegc c code

whether you could get your wonderful package to work with rmamv and rma objects I just recently came across yesterday your sjstats and this package so wondering how difficult it would be to do this for the metafor package a package for metaanalysis In a metaanalysis we often have a lot of categories so it would be good to know marginal effects but currently this is not possible at least easily with metafor Anyway many thanks for these cool packages Thanks Shinichi
