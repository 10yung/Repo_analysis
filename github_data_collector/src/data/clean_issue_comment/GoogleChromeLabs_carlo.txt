Quick fix to add to Carlo a pdf viewer feature Thanks to create this project The idea of carlo is very interesting However when I install the example project and bundle it its package size is so large more than I expected Can someone explain this I tired to build a pretty simple demo with pkg but it failed to run on macOS Do I need to do something more It failed with following issue Google Chrome cannot read and write to its data directory snapshotcarlodesktopnodemodulescarloliblocaldataprofilestable This is my packagejson json name carlodesktop version main indexjs license MIT bin carlodesktop indexjs pkg scripts js assets src dependencies canvas carlo devDependencies pkg const launchOptions width height executablePath ApplicationsGoogle ChromeappContentsMacOSGoogle Chrome const startTime new DategetTime const app await carlolaunchlaunchOptions const launchTime new DategetTime startTime This takes s to launch const launchOptions width height const startTime new DategetTime const app await carlolaunchlaunchOptions const launchTime new DategetTime startTime This takes s to launch As this line of code carlo now would exit the process when failed to find the chrome Why carlo make this decision I packed my app into a single executable used pkg but since this behavour user could only see the app launch failed and exit immediately should we just throw an error instead of exit the process to allow the developer do something for this case First of all thanks for releasing this Really has the potential for making it easier to build desktop applications without the full bloat of frameworks like electron I have used carlo in a number of projects and am really impressed That being said there seems to be many critical issues open with no response Is carlo gonna be unmaintained and if not then what are the updates and fixes planned by the team Although the error says The environment variable CHROMEPATH must be set to executable of a build of Chromium version or later CHROMEPATH is never added to installations This page with an input tag crashes carlo when tries to open a file picker Im runnin on ubuntu HTML html body h Hello Worldh label foravatarChoose a filelabel input typefile idfileinput namefileinput acceptimagepng imagejpeg body html Files with spaces in the name dont work from inside folders exposed with serveFolder demo app Error in the browser console indexhtml GET netERRNAMENOTRESOLVED The following snippet reproduce the error js const carlo requirecarlo async Launch the browser const app await carlolaunch removing the following args solves the issue with createWindow args loadextensioninvalidextension disableextensionsexceptinvalidextension Terminate Nodejs process on app window closing apponexit processexit this script should open two windows one is the carlo window the other is an extra chrome window with the args provided which are obviously wrong the application fails to create this window but does not throw any exception await appcreateWindow
