Getting vimdeck requires getting rmagick installed and thats not straightforward in Arch Youll get the wellknown found partial imagemagick installation error MagicWandh not found I finally found this site which provided me the workaround export PKGCONFIGPATHusrlibimagemagick pkgconfig gem install vimdeck Leaving this here in case you want to incorporate it in the README In hands on type of presentation i end running a lot of code generally after showing a piece of code Could we have a comment on top of these snippets which gives user to run the command in the comment I would love to help here Hi this slide XYZ foo bar baz oof renders as foo bar baz oof Is this a known issue As far as I know RedCarpet supports nested lists correctly which is why Im submitting the issue here bash root c d cdc slides vimdeck SLIDESmd DEPRECATION requiring RMagick is deprecated Use rmagick instead Would be nice not to see this anymore Hi there this is amazing grin Is there any way to export this to PDF Cheers Raphael bow I noticed that the syntax highlighting fails with very peculiar languages that is languages that need to be at the start of the line For example I wanted to include a git commit file wrapped around the gitcommit and tags and because vimdeck indents the content of the slides the syntax highlighting fails I have no idea how to solve this though sorry I have to issue a few more commands than are at the top of scriptvim to remove things like colorcolumn and the status bar I also need to issue nonumber twice not sure why Would you consider allowing an additional file to to included passed via a command line arg or if you think its generic enough we could add it to scriptvim for everyone Im currently doing the below bufdo set nocursorline bufdo set colorcolumn bufdo set nu bufdo set nu set laststatus buffer I think colorcolumn is an optional feature so it would need wrapping in an existscolorcolumn Thoughts
