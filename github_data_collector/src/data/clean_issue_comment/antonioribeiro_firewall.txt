 requires license key now Hi antonioribeiro I was trying to figure out why there were frequent database calls to put the firewall list in memory even though the config cacheexpiretime was set to minutes and it turns out as of Laravel that value is now seconds to fall in line with other libraries and PSRs Just giving you notice to update your config comments Thanks again for providing this package URL used for updating GeoIP database doesnt work Think that maybe subdomain is removed because nameservers dont point to valid records EDIT Found out that this is probably the reason Apparently Im getting a lot of these errors because the code Firewallphp is relying on HTTPXFORWARDEDFOR which can contain multiple addresses separated by commas In v with Laravel on only the firewalllist and firewallupdategeoip exists the rest is missing I have been using this firewall package for a while Thank you Today for the first time I had a use case where I needed to assign a url to redirectnonwhitelistedto in my firewall config After doing so I noticed the redirect was not working for nonwhitelisted users It returned the http response code defined in the responseswhitelist config value but was completely ignoring the redirectnonwhitelistedto config value I investigated further and noticed a refactor at commit b b which appears to have removed the condition to check the value of redirectnonwhitelistedto I refactored the Whitelist filter function a little bit to fix this Is it also possible to temporarily block an ip address Wordfence does for example block access to ip address for too many login requests for x hrs or days Can this be done with this Laravel Firewall Package Would be cool if I could add notes to the database entry why this ip was blocked whitelisted or some indication who this IP belongs to Seems that there is no way for clear the cached ip list For example FirewalllistCacheClear that clear the entire cache and Firewallblacklistip clearlistcache false that refresh cache when save model What do youall think
