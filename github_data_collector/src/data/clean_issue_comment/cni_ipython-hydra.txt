Hi there Im writting a small nodejs proxy that allows to have multiple IPython notebook server virtually listening on the same port the routing is made thanks to URLs prefixes I was wondering if it was interesting you as for example when most ports are blocked it is easier to have all user through one port Im startig to develop it it here It works but is not really userfriendly right now Ill probably release under one of IPython repo Im not sure of how well it behaves under high load
