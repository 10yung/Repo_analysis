 Provide a detailed description of the behavior youd like to see What is the motivation use case for changing the behavior Hi Syomus Thanks for creating the amazing project Im the creator of OpenUPM a public upm registry with automatic build pipelines that publish new package bundle based on valid git tags You can read the announcement to get the basic idea so far it hosts packages as of December Ive added ProceduralToolkit to the platform however since the packagejson was newly added this year not included in any GitHub releases git tags yet the service can not generate a working bundle Would you please create a new release v The build pipeline will notice it and generate a bundle in a short time mins If this looks interesting for you you can consider adding the badge to README Heres an example project BR Favo MeshDraftToMeshref Mesh mesh could be fully replaced with MeshDraftToMeshMesh mesh There is no use to use any ref here and it just makes code more ineffective and unintuitive It might be possible to replicate the uvmap from the Unitys capsule Create the following methods and appropriate overloads for DebugE GizmosE and GLE WireCircleSectorXYVector position float radius WireCircleSectorXYVector position Quaternion rotation float radius WireCircleSectorXZVector position float radius WireCircleSectorXZVector position Quaternion rotation float radius WireCircleSectorYZVector position float radius WireCircleSectorYZVector position Quaternion rotation float radius Create the following methods and appropriate overloads for DebugE GizmosE and GLE WirePolygonListVector WirePolygonXYListVector WirePolygonXZListVector WirePolygonYZListVector Create the following methods and appropriate overloads for DebugE GizmosE and GLE WirePolylineListVector WirePolylineXYListVector WirePolylineXZListVector WirePolylineYZListVector Add missing Geometry algorithms Distance Distance tests Closest point Closest point tests Intersection Intersection tests Add missing Geometry algorithms Distance Distance tests Closest point Closest point tests Intersection Intersection tests Add missing Geometry algorithms Distance Distance tests Closest point Closest point tests Intersection Intersection tests Add missing Geometry algorithms Distance Distance tests Closest point Closest point tests Intersection Intersection tests
