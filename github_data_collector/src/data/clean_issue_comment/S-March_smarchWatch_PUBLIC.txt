Hi Ive created a new version of the watch but with touchscreen Ive also changed the housing to be printed on my resin printer for a nice look I noticed that this project is missing a lot to actually make it work it has the basic BLE and some display routines but even backlight code is missing My version implements the display code a bit faster adds touch support and has the code for the LIS DH i c chip Also created time display and a menu I struggled a lot maybe we can help each other a bit more since a lot of people are interested in this watch It is far from finished too I mainly have a lot of issues debugging it The tasks seem to stop and I cant get the accelerometer and touch working at the same time Also a real RTC is missing and the sleep is broken atm But take a look Im working on changing the altium files to add the touch connector and fix some issues this one has for ex missing vref for debug and the vibrate motor ohm is not needed or it wont work Danny I was populating the PCB and after referencing the completed PCB image on github I found that I was missing L R and the pin set that the LCD screen snaps into These also arent on the Bill of sale which leads me to believe I may just be missing something If someone could please provide the part numbers that would be much appreciated Thanks for this This project is a perfect base to start my own project also rolling around my head for years I cant seem to find the code in the project to get and display the actual time the RTC There are functions to draw hourminute hands but they are not used SMarch Is there a more uptodate code that you could share where it gets and keeps time The LIS DH code and interrupt is also missing Also it would be great to get the font image file as a starting point In the end I will rewrite most of the project anyway I guess Ive finally managed to build the project In simple steps I did the following Downloaded the SDK Installed SmartSnippetsStudio found here scroll down for your platform Followed the getting started guide found here When I could build the example project I tried building SMarch projects I did this by copying the files from this repository the project folder called smarchWatch into my SDK basically with the same search path as in this repository Example MyLocallyInstalledSDKprojectsdkappsbleprofilessmarchWatch This did not however build properly from the start SMarch had to remove the SDK from his repository since Dialoge Semiconductors demanded this The twist is that he had altered some SDK files in order to build his project I did some detective work and this is my solution Find a fork where not all SDK files are removed Copy the following files qspiw q h platformdevicesh and partitiondefh They are all found under the folder sdkbspadaptersinclude and sdkbspmemoryinclude Placereplace the above files in your local SDK SMarch Could you please provide these files mentioned above in your repository I think this could help other makers trying to replicate your project In Schematic file I noticed that displays WR pin hast any connections on board and display driver uses the bit SPI for transfering data between display and MCU In ST V datasheet Ive found that WR pin uses for selecting what would be transfered command or data So Why do you use the bit SPI for display communication and where you find information about the displays interface Ive created this issue because have a similar display but havent got any succesful results because trying to use bit SPI with selecting data and comannd with toggling the WR pin Thanks for answer Would you be able to export the design files from Altium in some other format Id like to play around with adapting it for the capacitative touch variant of the display but I dont have an Altium license Id be looking for something I could import into one of the free or hobbyistlevel PCB design softwares such as KiCAD EasyEDA Eagle etc I looked up the Digikey prices for the BOM parts I know these can change over time but I added them to the BOMxlsx file Worthwhile I think to give people an idea of the cost to build Enclosed BOMxlsx I create another design of housing not tested on HW use with caution SMarch could you put a few copies of the stencil files in a single document Let s say the stencil can be x mm big Could you put like copies on the mm side and copies on the mm side so there are a total of copies in a single x mm stencil This will cut the costs a lot Congratulation SMarch on this awesome project Ive looked at the very inspiring blog that you wrote and the repository but I wasnt able to see how you transfer the software to the watch Through the charger interface you only provide VBUS Is this done via BT Is the SUOTA capability available upon first boot so the device is discoverable via BLE and programmable from the start Many thanks again for the awesome write up
