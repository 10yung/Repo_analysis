For what Im making with this the popup lasts too long I searched the ProgressHUDm and h but I couldnt find anything Is there a way When run on iPad that in split screen is still put the pop up in the middle of total iPad s screen not the split screen size Itd be great to be able to set timeout to dismiss the hud Im saying it as an improvement Hi I was wondering if you could supply x images in ProgressHUDbundle since my app is going to support iPhone and would prefer if you have x images Cheers
