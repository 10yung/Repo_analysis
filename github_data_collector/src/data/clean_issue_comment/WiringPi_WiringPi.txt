add options for cross compiling What I did As I needed to work on this work a bit kernel where proccpuinfo was not filled I changed the function to use procdevicetree I could test it on the RPI cm compute module in bits and bits I am not sure about The old way part WinStar displays WEH ALPP N WS has multiple char tables and init options for it Hello I think it would be great to use Internal oscillator as well as PLLD source MHz for GPCLK when frequency selection allows it I also provided a MASH option not enabled yet for some future release Regards At moment theres no way to free a LCD handle Hi I found a tiny bug in preventing the update of the sample rate in function myDigitalWrite data instead of data The SPS definition was missing too Finally I think it would be cleaner to have the gain definitions in ads h consistent with the ADS datasheet Check it out Roudy ChangeId I f ad c da f a fdce f d d f Origin Signedoffby Philippe Coval philippecovalosgsamsungcom use cmake to gen the Makefile support cmake to gen the Makefile support build deb package remove all the makefile Signedoffby sndnvaps sndnvapsgmailcom
