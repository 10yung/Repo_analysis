Hi I am having the same issue as this one Is it possible that it happens because I am using Ubuntu and GNOME Terminal Thank you After install I got dark username in shell but on PC its blue and looks nice But PS equal So because the th color in the palette is Base which is the same as the background so now in a lot of my log outputs or test results and so on that color is used The issue is that I can change that color in the palette but then my vim background color is that same color because of the fact that when you do backgrounddark in VIM it seems to use that th color in the palette Any ideas on how I can handle both cases
