writeregister x x writeregister x x writeregister x x writeregister x x writeregister x x e writeregister x x writeregister x x How can I solve this Hello Anyone tried fakenect on Windows Specifically to playback a recorded session We normally work on Mac or Linux where preloading works well Since Windows doesnt have LDPRELOAD type of stuff it seems we need DLL injection for libfakenectdll or some such While such DLL builds successfully was anyone successful using it in their application More info on DLL Injection Hello to everyone I have a problem I have two RPI one RPI and other RPI All my tests were using Raspbian Ubuntu and DietPi I have a Kinect Xbox When i connect de Kinect to my PC and i run freenectcamtest i get MBs thats works great When i do the same test in my RPI i get MBs such slower than my PC When i saw that i bought a RPI but after my freenectcamtest i got MBs What is wrong Why i have this poor speeds I have a powerful supply with V A so there isnt problem with these Any help Thank you I was working with the depth data from the python wrapper found the returned values to be way off It sort of contradicts those Microsoft claims of cm accuracy by a lot not your average SNR In the python wrappers there is a file that converts the depth data into a pretty format While investigating I found Neither imadr nor myself saw the logic behind this and found it odd I dug deeper into the depth format and I believe I found the answer What I understand about the basic architecture of Kinect Primesense tech that its not just a sensor array in fact there is a marvel SoCMarvell AP that runs a multitude of algorithms to simply development like skeltal skeletonization facial recognition etc Skeletonization if initiated the SoC would perform a looped process of identificationclassifying and annotate predict each pixel with the PlayerID The high bits of the bit value give you the measured distance in millimeters The first three bits code for the player that the device has identified but this is only activated if skeleton tracking is enabled If you dont enable skeleton tracking the three bits are set to zero I tried to shift by instead of in the wrapper and the values made much more sense after My first thought was I would fix the python wrapperexamples however this would need to be done across all the wrappers and sort of hacky Im not interested in learning AS thanks Im not sure if there are plans to implement skeleton tracking or not either way the raw depth need to be shifted by at the driver core lib level and pass in the correct format Ushort to wrappers the depth information and maybe implement a getPlayerID function that returns the correct bits wont be useful till the tracking is actually enabled marcan JoshBlake thoughts Im happy to fixPR if you agree Are there other areas of the package that this change would break that I should be aware of Hi everyone Im trying to install the package Freenectlaunch for the Kinect Sensor on my Qbot e And after I git clone to my src directory and catkinmake it shows processing catkin package freenectcamera addsubdirectoryfreenectstackfreenectcamera Checking for module libfreenect No package libfreenect found CMake Error at usrsharecmake ModulesFindPkgConfigcmake message A required package was not found Call Stack most recent call first usrsharecmake

Invoking make cmakecheckbuildsystem failed Then I followed the libfreenect installation intruction but it still cannot find libfreenect I git clone it to my catkinwssrc and build it I guess this is
