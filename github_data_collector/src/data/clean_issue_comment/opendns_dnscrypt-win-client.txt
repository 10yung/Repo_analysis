Its looking for a log net reference that doesnt exist and for Code bin Release Coredll Since this project doesnt have a Readmemd I dont really know what I need to do to build it other than clicking Build in VS and praying for the best The executable version has become very obsolete exploitable It is vulnerable to multiple malcode injection something new for us who are followers Hello Need some help with running the service Ive build the solution in VisualStudio Update under x windows In debug mode all three projectsscriptinterfacecode will compile But no luck with starting the service In release mode I checked only the service to build in build configuration manager because two other projects would cause errors like Severity Code Description Project File Line Suppression State Error The command if Release Release CALL signtool sign t n OpenDNS d OpenDNS DNSCrypt C Users USER Downloads dnscryptwinclientmaster Interface obj x Release OpenDNSInterfaceexe exited with code OpenDNSInterface so I checked only the service project to compile and the output would say that it compiled successfully Skipped Rebuild All Project Code Configuration Release x Project not selected to build for this solution configuration Skipped Rebuild All Project OpenDNSInterface Configuration Release x Project not selected to build for this solution configuration Rebuild All started Project OpenDNSCryptService Configuration Release x OpenDNSCryptService C Users USER Downloads dnscryptwinclientmaster Service bin x Release OpenDNSCryptServiceexe Rebuild All succeeded failed skipped then in command prompt under Administrator I cd to c Users USER Downloads dnscryptwinclientmaster Service bin x Release and run installutil OpenDNSCryptServiceexe the installation log says that everything is

Users USER Downloads dnscryptwinclientmaster Service bin x Release OpenDNSCryptServiceInstallLog Now I go to windows services and see that the service is installed but status is stopped If I start it it says Windows could not start the OpenDNSCrypt service on Local Computer Error Access is denied Then I go to properties of the service Log On tab and check the Local System Account radiobutton Apply Start again the service and I see another error The OpenDnsCrypt service on Local Computer started and then stopped Some services stop automatically if they are not in use by another services or programs What am I doing wrong PS also I needed to install log net package via NuGet as it had errors referring to lack of this package PS dnscryptproxyexe from the dnscryptwinclientmaster Interface bin Debug runs okay But I still would prefer to run your program as service Any ideas I want to use unbound to coordinate with dnscrypt but failed The system showed that port is occupied Its not strictly required but its useful metadata and part of the recommended license template text see and Hello Thank you for DNSCrypt I have noticed over the years that there never seems to be any update is this usual Also DNSCrypt fails red icon several times per day on my computer which is running Windows x I have tried running DNSCrypt with and without TCP enabled and that does not seem to make any difference I also have used it with free and paid VPN services and DNSCrypt still fails with them as well Sometime the green icon turns red for a few seconds and sometimes for a minute and a half or more when this happens is my internet traffic trackable even though my VPN which uses openvpn is still working Is there any way to automatically suspend all internet traffic when DNSCrypt fails red and reconnect when it is green again Thanks again NS win bits I have been using DNSCrypt v for many months without a problem but now it could not workand pop up a windowOpenDNSCrypt has encountered an error and will now closeif I click the buttonit will be closed please tell me how to repair it On the main page for Windows DNSCryt page there isnt a readme file describing what to do to omg wrong app sorry im new to github Hi there I am hoping someone can help me with DNSCrypt Windows GUI I have been using DNSCrypt v over TCP for many months without a problem and strangely now it keeps connecting and then disconnecting ie going from protected to unprotected Things you should know Running W P No changes have been made to the router or software firewall Tried disabling Norton IS FW Rebooted the router Disabled the firewall on the router Rebooted PC Uninstalled DNSCrypt and removed all config then reinstalled Strangely I have no problem if I connect via VPN From the log file attached you will see the SendTcpNetworkPacket EXCEPTION which I believe is the culprit That being said I have no idea why I am getting the error or how to fix it Please help log Many thanks Matt
