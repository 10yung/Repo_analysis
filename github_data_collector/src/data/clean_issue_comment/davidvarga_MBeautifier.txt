Hi as im using MBeautifycreateShortcuteditorpage in my script i dont have a new shortcut created in my preference keyboard shortcut Could someone explain me what did i miss Or maybe it doesnt work As there are thoughts about rewriting the whole project I would like to add some feature requests This way they can be already discussed and if desired they can be integrated from the very beginning of the new project Alternatively of course they can be implemented in the existing version Given a folder structure with many MATLAB files in it it would be nice to have a function that applies the format inplace for each file I think it would help the developers a lot to have such a batch formatting tool The main application here however is continuous integration In such a scenario all files can be formatted and differences can be easily detected This feature should include a way to exclude certain files or directories from formatting I have some first code lying around if desired I can make it available Related but maybe a different issue It would be nice if the script considered a given settings file in the project root for project specific settings Maybe the settings can be overwritten by another settings file in a subdirectory In summary the recursive formatting function mentioned above scans for a settings file in the current directory in a toplevel directory and finally in the MBeautifier settings directory First of all thank you for this project Until yesterday I was not aware that such a formatter exists and spent some time formatting things manually This project really makes things easier Problem The issues and already mention that it would be very nice to run the script without the MATLAB editor dependence For automated tasks precommit hooks CI this is crucial as there might not be the possibility to run a GUI For a large number of files this may be beneficial for the performance Apparently the only dependency is the smart indentation function which must be replaced The replacement could also deal with indentation issues such as Approach Write a MATLAB function that can replace MATLABs smart indent function As announced in I played around and ended up with a simple indentation code which I would like to share for what it is worth Approach Implement the same thing in Java as the project is about to be rewritten May I ask what the status of the Java version is I use this as part of a precommit git hook and also sometimes in large batches of files so it would be nice to have the option of passing in a filename and have the formatter run without opening the editor for performance reasons A couple of possibilities for the calling syntax An optional parameter MBeautifyformatFilesomeFilem someFilem UseEditor false An optional positional argument MBeautifyformatFilesomeFilem someFilem noeditor A new method MBeautifyformatFileSilentlysomeFilem someFilem You can write keyword blocks with or without parentheses if true end vs if true end A nice feature would be to control whether or not to add parentheses to these expressions and also independently set this for each possible keyword that supports this if elseif switch case while for etc Hi thanks for addressing my last issue Since this is so actively maintained I thought you may be interested in another issue that is however not as critical Ill explain it on MWEs if a end is kept as it is by the tool However if a end is turned into if a end I think these cases should behave identically I personally prefer the former behavior because it does allow one liners However I can also understand if one liners are eliminated in this case however the a expression should also put in a separate line Anyways thanks again And its not an important issue because it does not break the code after all I assume that in the case of a condition it is better to align to condition on previous line I think this code if a b a b a b end better than generated by MBeautifier if a b a b a b end So this is true for while too I have a hundred files and I want beautify each of them without opening window in editor files on each file If possible it would be great if the method formatFiles could work silently This feature will be implemented when the full backend implementation is moved to Java
