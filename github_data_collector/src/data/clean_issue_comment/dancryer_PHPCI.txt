wheezy PHP Version MySQL Version na PR I would like to ask if there is any way to change admin credentials after the installation is done The reason I need this is this docker image which seems to be the only one working It does not support any credentials settings and looking through code I did not find any phpciinstall command where I could change credentials The image seems to use phpciupdate for installation and this command provides no way to choose credentials as far as I found The author of image is not responding so I decided to ask you Since I did not find any IRC or other way to ask you I am submitting an issue Contribution Type new feature This pull request affects the following areas x FrontEnd x Builder Build Plugins In raising this pull request I confirm the following please

that this submission will be valuable to others I have created or updated the relevant documentation for this change on the PHPCI Wiki Do the PHPCI tests pass Detailed description of change When working with GIT webhooks every commit of every contributor triggers a build in PHPCI As I have very time consuming acceptance tests with Codeception and my contributors are pushing a lot of stuff PHPCI is always very busy For me there is no need to run all tests for every commit on every branch Important for me is my master branch and my release candidate branches where I put all branches of my contributors together to see if it works So Ive added a textarea with the name observedbranches to the project configuration page Before a build is triggered via webhook by WebhookControllercreateBuild I check if the requestet branch is in the projects branch observation by getting the text from observedbranches and exploding it by PHPEOL After that Ill check if the branch name submitted by the webhook is in my exploded array If not I will not create the build If the project option observedbranches is empty all incoming branch names are triggering a build creation as it is now You may also use the sign as a wildcard for branch names when configuring the observedbranches option as I use this for my RC branches For example a configuration like master rc would accept a build creation via webhook for the master branch and all branch names starting with rc Maybe this can be helpful to others branchobservation branchobservationwebhookignored
