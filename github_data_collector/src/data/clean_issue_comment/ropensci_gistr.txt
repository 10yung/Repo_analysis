 lots of gists in my account that dont need to be there blockbuilderorg is a very nice online gist editor primarily built for d js blocks but it could easily be used as an online gist editor for anything Would it be worthwhile to add a function to open a gist in blockbuilder On gistcreate with large files at least MB or larger the one I found this on github api returns a Method not allowed and html error body But the same file I can paste into browser to create a gist And same file uploaded to make a gist using an npm cli tool works fine too but they use git not the http api so not a fair comparison Weird maybe its something going on with httr
