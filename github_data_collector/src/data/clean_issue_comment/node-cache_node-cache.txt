Hi Im using nodecache v on node v and setting my NodeCache instances to not delete automatically expired entries Also I added an event handler associated to expired event however the refreshExpiredCache callback function is getting executed twice in rapid fire just a few milliseconds apart from each other const domainDataCache new NodeCache stdTTL entries will live for hours before eviction checkperiod checks every min for expired entries deleteOnExpire false useClones true errorOnMissing false handles the cache expiration event old data is not evicted automatically function refreshExpiredCachecacheType oldDomainCacheMap loggerinfoCache cacheType has expired it currently has oldDomainCacheMapsize entries retrieveFromStoragecacheType thennewDomainCacheMap loggerinfoReplacing expired cache cacheType with a new map containing newDomainCacheMapsize entries setAllcacheType newDomainCacheMap catcherror loggererrorError Could not refresh expired cacheType JSONstringifyerror ObjectgetOwnPropertyNameserror event handlers domainDataCacheonexpired refreshExpiredCache At this point Im not clear if Im using wrong settings or if this is a bug in the library Please advice When using the module with high values for ttl and checkperiod the cpu consumption increases a lot I use the module as follows const day day in ms const mtImageCache new NodeCache stdTTL day checkperiod day useClones false After using lower values like const mtImageCache new NodeCache stdTTL checkperiod useClones false the consumption comes back to a normal level Version Node x So it looks like the default stdTTL and maxKeys are both set to unlimited Wouldnt this cause memory problems for those that dont read the docs or forget to set these values Id like to propose setting these defaults to stdTTL maxKeys unless theres another way to handle perceived memory leak when not setting these values This error has cropped up recently I have not modified this code in some time Looks related to some internal package URLonParseComplete internalurljs no clue what is going on If I stringify my object it seems to work no problem working code thistokenCachesettoken jsonstringifyobject ttl nonworking code thistokenCachesettoken object ttl packagejson nodecache Stack Trace Cannot set property flags of undefined TypeError Cannot set property flags of undefined at URLonParseComplete internalurljs at URLset as href internalurljs at clone nodemodulescloneclonejs at clone nodemodulescloneclonejs at clone nodemodulescloneclonejs at NodeCachemoduleexportsNodeCachewrap nodemodulesnodecachelibnodecachejs It would be nice to have a documentation with internal version switch coffescript is just overhead and makes the compiled app bloated harder to debug larger in size inconsistent with the es
