Hi First thank for your amazing work on Shifty I love it I use it everyday nothing to complain about really Ive configured Shifty to disable night shift and true tone when starting Photoshop That way Im sure my screen calibration will not be affected But one last thing can break my screen calibration which is monitor brightness Ive found this CLI solution The precision is awesome to get perfect calibration I was able to set the brightness to which is impossible with the keyboard or the slider But there is some down sides to this solution MacOS settings Automatically adjust brightness have to be disabled its not automatic can forget to do it and break calibration using CLI is not accessible to everyone So I was thinking about how Shifty disable true tone for an application It could be use to set a specific brightness per application programmatically I hope you like the idea Cheers I have disabled night shift for the TV app but its still kicking in when playing a video fullscreen on a secondary display If I move the mouse to make the controls appear then night shift suddenly disables but then kicks in again as soon as the controls fade Doesnt seem to be a problem when Im not using

such option Triggered after a certain time or even and maybe Im overthinking it linked to the new Screen Time feature What do you think Edit Just like in Android with the Digital Wellbeing system app By the way love this app Thanks for doing it Im available for testing if you need some Originally posted by r dixx in I dont know why but especially after the computer wakes up from sleep Shifty may stop responding because of high CPU usage From a sample it seems to be stuck responding to accessibility events which seems to be fired non stop I really have no clue Itd be great to be able to optionally hide the menu bar icon out of the box and not rely on thirdparty menu bar managers I use Parsec which when connected to another machine spawns a Parsec Game Window Im unable to disable night shift on just the Parsec Game Window and the logs say Could not obtain bundle identifier of current application whenever I try to click the option moused over in the screenshot Disabling for the regular Parsec window works fine but that doesnt also disable night shift on the actual game window and my games look much better without night shift on Please let me know if theres any other information youd like Screen Shot at pm It would be nice if Shifty would also change the Terminal profile when unsetting Dark Mode This would only require a check box two input fields for the theme names and some AppleScript Please see for details Hi there Im curious if its possible to use Shifty to disable Night Shift if a certain app is running at all rather than just when its in focus Thanks for your great work it is really handy Its great to toggle Shifty by using custom shortcuts but an Alfred workflow can make it more visually straightforward Im not a programmer its hard to make this happen If you are an Alfred user as well please help For specific features please check this workflow on Packalorg for Amphetamine Mac App Store it can toggle onoff and toggle on for a certain period
