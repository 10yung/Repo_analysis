Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Using guard pages has a tradeoff of taking up more unmanaged memory pages which could be a potential concern in high traffic scenarios Describe the solution youd like Would be nice if there was an option to skip use guard pages when creating LockedBuffers Can obviously keep using them by default but allow the user to pass in an option to avoid them Whether this is exposed as part of the Enclave related usage should be considered but could probably be handled separately if needed Describe alternatives youve considered Considered using Enclave but in the expected trafficusage patterns cached keys multiple concurrent users it would likely lead to more unmanaged memory usage Additional context NA
