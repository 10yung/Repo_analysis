Hello I would like to collaborate with the Spanish translation is it done For months now I have problem using Stellar with Carthage I have to ways to solve the problems by manually building Stellar framework after changing stuff in Xcode project or by adding sources to my project But as for now the last option does not work because the code imported using Carthage is not the last one on GitHub So there is definitely something wrong with Carthage Hello As is the examples do not support Xcode Can they be updated to support Xcode and at least Swift With this exception is thrown on very basic animation swift myViewmakeAlpha durationaDuration autoreverses repeatCountsomeRepetitions completion Some statements myViewremoveFromSuperview animate Lets say its a find of flash I tried other animation like makeSizeor makeColor but same behavior This flash portion of code is called several times on a sequence basis On the first call everything is fine The exception is raises on the second call Between these two calls of flash there is an animation using CATransaction On the completion block of this animation the second call of flash is then made Swift CATransactionbegin CATransactionsetCompletionBlock call to flash animations CATransactioncommit This error came after I decided to use CATransaction to use its completion block Hi Interesting library Latest release here is while on pods you can only find Any reason to keep it that way Could you update it there too So we dont need to point this specific branch Thank you H Using makeAlpha of generates the Unsupport this animation type btw Unsupport is not word Do not support this animation type is better Reverting back to fixed the issue by using the following in the Podfile pod Stellar git commit b eb ce af a fa cb I want to use Stellar with my project but I have this Value of type UIView has no member error in my very first attempt to use Stellar on an UIView I use Carthage to install Stellar the same way as other libraries Its like Stellar is not installed Installation using Stellar is OK and the usual Carthage installation has been followed Then I used the direct inclusion of Sourcesdirectory and everything is fine I have clean project This is a weird behavior Any idea Is there special configuration for Carthage command Still awesome animation library Loving it the more I use it Feature request Would be nice if I could call cancelAllAnimations on a UIView and itll stop all ongoing and planned animations What are your thought about this Oftentimes I need to also animate affine scale However this one is not supported by stellar I wrote the following set of extensions to make it uniform with Stellars syntax What are your thoughts Do you see any systemic issue struct CABasicAnimatedView let view UIView let animation CABasicAnimation extension UIView func makeAffineUniformScalefrom from CGFloat to CGFloat CABasicAnimatedView let animation CABasicAnimationkeyPath KeyPathsTransformscale let animatedView CABasicAnimatedViewview self animation animation animatedViewanimationfromValue from animatedViewanimationtoValue to return animatedView extension CABasicAnimatedView func durationduration NSTimeInterval CABasicAnimatedView selfanimationduration duration return self func timingFunctiontimingFunction CAMediaTimingFunction CABasicAnimatedView selfanimationtimingFunction timingFunction return self func animate CATransactionbegin selfviewlayeraddAnimationselfanimation forKey nil CATransactioncommit selfviewtransform CGAffineTransformMakeUniformScaleselfanimationtoValue as CGFloat func CGAffineTransformMakeUniformScalescale CGFloat CGAffineTransform return CGAffineTransformMakeScalescale scale just run any example from demo and click multiple times animation breaks
