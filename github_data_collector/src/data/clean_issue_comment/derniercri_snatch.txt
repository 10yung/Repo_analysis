Compared to I guess hyper dropped openssl dependency and made it a pure rust library I wonder when snatch will move on to hyper and give an option to decide whether to use openssl OpenSSL can potentially introduce security issue This will give users an option to use pure Rust binary Add sanity check for download byte size On file creation the file name may exceed the length the OS file system allows In this case the program currently hard panics could this be changed Hi I like this tool very cool It would be nice if snatch could provide a alternate progress bar like the a option in tool axel Because I will use snatch t or t to download big stuff and the screen cannot fit all that many separated progress bars Thanks It would be nice to know total download speed as well as size of already downloaded content I got a file from someone to download a file from his dropbox account Its not easy to extract the exact link so I go the link that I was handed with Firefox click on Download combobox Direct download option then Im prompted to sign up but I click on the small link that says no thanks take me to the download and then Firefox starts downloading Then I go to Firefoxs download manager locate the download right click Copy download link Then I go to the terminal and I get this error from snatch snatch url Waiting a response from the remote server OK ERROR Cannot get the content length of the remote content from the server Ive also tried to Pause or Cancel the download before I launch this command but the result is the same and yes firefox allows me to pause and resume the download and Firefox shows me the amount of bytes left so no issue with the ContentLength header from the server I guess I tried to do a thread count of and then a thread count of and to the naked eye for a small file it seemed indistinguishable What is the optimal thread count I love snatch but I have few notes regarding CLI Remove u why not just snatch Optional f why not deduce filename from URL Support for multiple URLs something like snatch I think we should add a force or true flag to the CLI in order to allow integration of snatch into automated task like installation scripts
