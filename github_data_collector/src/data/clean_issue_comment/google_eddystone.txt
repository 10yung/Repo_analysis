huawei mate pro system version android EMUI google play service version Can anyone help me out about Beacon configured as Eddystone EID is not even detected by Beacon Tool Appi am Using Beacon Tool App on Android device It may be an easy doubt Doubt is in the file of EIDcomputation in EddystoneEID in point Secure key exchange EID configuration What does key pair means Public and Private key of beacon Where do they comegenerated from These keys are also used in Computing the identity key In Registering an EID beacon with the resolver It is said The resolver then follows the same procedure to compute the identity key from its own private key and the beacons public key The public private key of beacon and resolver is changed compare to clients computing Can you please clarify all this thing What is the difference between Using ETLM Frame and Using EID Frame with TLM frame to encrypt the TLM frames data and which one is better Is the latter one possible ie using EID frame to secure TLM frames data I have been trying to use Google Beacon Platforms Nearby Notification using multiple web urls and multiple app intents At first I used to receive the last modified or added notification but after few tries I am getting randomized notifications ie either web urls notification or app intent notification whenever I turn on the Bluetooth in my device Is there a valid reason like if is there fixed duration for a particular notification for this or is it the beacons fault Targeting rule is set to default for all entries Could anyone help me with this Thank You in advance i have this
