When I make a symbol with a text field that has auto sizing then add text that adds extra lines update layout doesnt take those extra lines into account Am I doing something wrong or does fluid not support dynamically entered text Use case I have a group full of groups layers they all base their Y position as of the previous sibling I now want to demo a version where some of those groups layers are hidden I dont want to delete them and I dont want to change the layer order as its so brittle Possible approaches Allow constraints to ignore groups layers when theyre hidden Allow a setting pergroup or perlayer that can toggle it to Ignore when layout is updated Allow a setting to add a keyword to grouplayer names to have them ignored Lets say you have group contining other groups The second group contains anything just to be there The first group is pinned to previous sibling top px left and contains a square mask x px and a second visible square x px As long as the small square or any other visible item is inside the mask everything is fine The first group is positioned right next to the first group Now move the small square px outsinde to the left of the mask On update the group will now be moved about that amount of pixels to the left overlapping the first group which I do not understand Id understand if it would be orientated at the part outside the mask therfore goning more to the right Same is happening when the small square is going topwards out of the mask When you have no pinning activated the group wil move to top left endlessly with every update bildschirmfoto um Every time you hit update layout it adds the previous value on top of an existing one and therefore destroys the whole layout If you define a relationship between a textlayer and its background for instance to model consistent padding for a button I define a left and right margin of px Every time you hit update layout px gets added to the already existing px and so on img width altscreen shot at pm src This error unfortunately makes the whole plugin unusable Hi Im having this issue since Im using Fluid thats a ling time I want to give a rectangle which works as a background or container a height of of the group When the group becomes larger it works The rectangle adapts to the increasing size of the group When the group becomes smaller it doesnt do anything But when I decrease the rectangle to a smaller size than the group it works See attached gif A fix of that would be so nice Thank you aug Hi thanks for this plugin can you please add support for comma in the pinning value actually support point Thanks Thanks for fluid it help me a lot Is it possible to fix the toolbar to the sketch side menu panelleft or right So I dont need to call it out every time Thanks Hey Matt one future request from me It would be cool if we can toggle artboard size for more than artboard at a time This feature will boost a lot of peoples workflowproductivity and will make the Fluid plugin even more awesome Would increase codebase agility ability to response to Sketch updates and encourage oss contributions Currently we can create constraints and preview them swell as export images from it This is great for the design process but what is sad is that these properties cannot be exported or viewed like from It would be great to combine what he has done interns of filling that gap between a design and developer but show constraint values utom
