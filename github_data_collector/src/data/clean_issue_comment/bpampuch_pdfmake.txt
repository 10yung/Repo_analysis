defaultStyle font Times fontSize lineHeight This displays the svg properly in the playground but it doesnt display properly when I use it in my nodejs application Hi guys Before asking here I tried to scan the docs even with custom search but havent found details about absolute and relative positioning Actually I found these properties floating on the web reason Im even more confused about their usage and existence Saw them in the examples too but there are no comments or any sort of hint about their nature Right now I applied relativePosition to an image as background so I can put text above it but I get the same effect with absolutePosition which makes me wonder what is the actual difference between the two are they relative to what Would really appreciate your help on understanding the above Thanks Hello I had the chance to test pdfmake methods in iOS Safari and here is what Ive found pdfMakecreatePdfdocDefinitiondownload In desktop FireFox it does exactly what is says triggers

great if one of the list types had checkboxes open squares or even customizable typesfrom an image I only found information regarding how to create dash line afaict its not possible to create a double

return multi sizes spaces Something like With last version of pdfmake webpack print this warning when compiling WARNING We noticed youre using the useBuiltIns option without declaring a corejs version Currently we assume version x when no version is passed Since this default version will likely change in future versions of Babel we recommend explicitly setting the corejs version you are using via
