As you know the order in which fields are laid out in a class is the order they will be shown in an Inspector Since the attribute is not available in Unity the only way to prevent code formatting reordering these fields is to wrap them all in a region Will NoReorder be supported at some point in the future This can get quite confusing as method will never be called The warning is issued for and but not for implicit bool operator Event functions Awake etc should be not public by default as they are invoked by Unity and there is very little reason to invoke them yourselves An inspection and quick fix should be created to let the user know and easily fix this fix RIDER Packages added via Package Manager are compiled by the Unity editor and cached in LibraryScriptAssemblies together with their pdb file These assemblies are referenced in the generated C project files as binary references Unity does not create the xml documentation files so there is no Quick Doc tooltip support for types or type members defined in packages Eg UnityEntitiesIComponentData has a lot of XML documentation in the source but because there is no xml file generated this documentation is not used Rider cannot get the information from the source files because it doesnt really know about the source files We do show the in Unity Explorer but theyre not part of a project The best we can do is navigate to the file based on pdb information But there is no semantic parsing and caching applied to these files Ideally Unity will generate xml files when resolving packages In this case Quick Doc tooltips will Just Worktm But this wouldnt help in earlier versions of Unity Can Rider get this information Use the source information from the pdb to locate types and members and loadcache the XML documentation from those files Would this be too slow to do on demand would a caching step be required Build the xml files from source whenever the cached dll changes There could be problems with inactive preprocessor branches Unity appears to follow a standard URL scheme for API documentation for their own packages Rider should navigate to this documentation with F help If a type or type member is defined in a package then the API URL is going to be This is only true for packages that begin comunity packagename can be discovered by looking at the project name for packages in the Packages folder or added as asmdef projects Or by looking at the location of the source file for the declaration We should be able to get the source location because packages are compiled by Unity from source with debug information and added as references If the package is in LibraryPackageCachepackagenamefullpackageversion then we can parse out the package name We might also have this information as part of what we display in the Packages node of Unity Explorer pacakgeversion is the majorminor of the full version Eg preview will have a version of namespace and typename are obvious typemembername is the name of an anchor on the doc page This is constructed as the fully qualified type member name ie namespace type type member parameter types Fields have no parameter types Methods appear to be written as fully qualified then all punctuation is replaced by such as parentheses commas and angle brackets for generics This can lead to double underscores Parameter types are fully qualified and primitive types such as int are written as SystemInt Eg The API docs for UnityRenderingLODGroupExtensionsLODParamsGetHashCodeLODGroupExtensionsLODParams obj in the comunityrenderinghybrid package are at Also UnityRenderingInstancedRenderMeshBatchGroupAddBatchFrozenRenderSceneTag Int Int NativeArrayArchetypeChunk NativeArrayInt Int Int Boolean EditorRenderData Some types are not fully qualified In the example above NativeArrayT and ArchetypeChunk are not fully qualified Perhaps because they are in a different package Or namespace Research what happens with type generic methods and operators such as Research Editor and Tests projects AFAICT there is no API documentation for these projects Its not a huge issue if the type member name is incorrect as the main page will be correctly loaded Do we needcan we have a fallback if the page isnt found Im not sure that there is an online search page for these APIs Dont show UnityBugReporter Also review the way were filtering processes will we ever debug anything other than unityexe or unity img width altScreenshot at src Environment LTS Valid overwrites paddingbottom paddingtop css Button paddingright px paddingtop px paddingleft px paddingbottom px Invalid doesnt overwrite paddingbottom paddingtop css Button padding px Obviously like in CSS you would shorthand the first block to padding px Sadly this does not work Rider is still suggesting this This is fixed in newer versions at least but LTS still has a relevant user base If setting both transformposition and transformrotation in the same code section suggest using transformSetPositionAndRotation
