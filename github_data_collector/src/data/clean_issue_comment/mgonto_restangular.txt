The Delete method supports body in Angular windowfetch and XHR I see no reason why it cannot be supported in Restangular out of the box without tricks with interceptors Please see the discussion in similar issue in angular repository Conform RFC Sec A payload within a DELETE request message has no defined semantics sending a payload body on a DELETE request might cause some existing implementations to reject the request Angular is a medium not the API itself If the API doesnt forbid it Angular shouldnt make the decision for the dev If someone is developing full stack they have sufficient control over the REST handling to properly handle DELETES with payload Since this repository didnt see any update in years not even merging simple PRs like this one is it fair to say that it is unmaintained i have model called taskToStaff contains ID taskID StaffID I need to delete documents from taskToStaff model where tskID is equal to the ID that i given curruntlly i test this but does not work thisTaskToStaffsDataSource RestangularservicetaskToStaffs thisTaskToStaffsDataSourceonetaskIDremoveAllthen Im trying to intercept requests based on their headers and I see that the headers object in addFullRequestInterceptor is empty JS RestangularaddFullRequestInterceptorfunctionelement operation what url headers params httpConfig ifheaders accesstoken httpConfigtimeOut qresolvetoken is absent return element element headers headers params params httpConfig httpConfig On the other hand the original angular httpProvider has all headers as necessary JS httpProviderinterceptorspushfunction q return request functionconfig ifconfigheaders accesstoken return qrejectconfig return config qwhenconfig Hi Thanks for this wornderful tool its really very hepful i am novice for this tools my sincere apologies if i have raised a very basic query have gone throught eh existing issues and help file couldnt get the answer My query is i want to get a group by count from the server Eg i am expecting the following output pr pj for this command ProgramgetList group typethenfunctionresp consolelogresp i dont want to get all the record in the client side and do a group by Cheers I know it sends a put request But does it send the restangular object in json What should i do to send the request body in json format The data in server id namemyName head E id namemyName head E when I use getList I get something like this id namemyName routedtTypeListreqParamsnullrestangularizedtruefromServertrueparentResourcenullrestangularCollectionfalseid namemyName routedtTypeListreqParamsnullrestangularizedtruefromServertrueparentResourcenullrestangularCollectionfalse It loss head property data I dont know how to fix this problem restangular v AngularJS v Added support for getMethodOverride in getList function Fixed support for getMethodOverride where query params should be send as data in the POST body since its an override to post Added unittests Should restangular make the etag it receives a strong etag when it sends it as ifNoneMatch http header ie strip the W from received etag when it uses it as ifNoneMatch MDN says that etagvalue may be prefixed by W to indicate that the weak comparison algorithm should be used This is useless with IfNoneMatch as it only uses that algorithm for more context Im trying to handle weak etags problem with nginx If I send a weak etag with Wetag nginx will not recognize the etag and will send OK http response But If I send it as strong etag without Wetag then nginx will respond correctly with Not Modified response
