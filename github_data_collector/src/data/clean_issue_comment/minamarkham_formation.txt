Trying this out and everything was going well until it got to Dropbox As I already have that installed I expected it to skip but it failed at that point with this error in the log ESCBESC m Installing dropbox Error It seems there is already an App at ApplicationsDropboxapp Formation failed Any ideas While install on a fresh Mojave installation I ran into two issues NVM was getting skipped and installation did work because bashprofile did not exist This fix resolves both issues by checking for existance of NVMDIR to see if nvm is installed and creating the bashprofile if it doesnt already exist It also loads nvm for the session to insure that node and the npm packages get installed gets installed Also NVM gets a version bump Fixes Whats Changed Enables adding more repositories to the list of homebrew formulae via taps using swagtaps brew tap adds more repositories to the list of formulae that brew tracks updates and installs from By default tap assumes that the repositories come from GitHub but the command isn t limited to any one location Example prisma can be installed via Homebrew however it requires the formulae to be added to Homebrew prior to installing Outside of formation this would be achieved using the following commands brew tap prismaprisma brew install prisma However the following PR provide equivalent support by defining prismaprisma within swagtaps file and prisma within swagbrews Installation Demo asciicast The following is something my team and I needed earlier in the week we forked formation and made the change and decided to contribute it back upstream as appeared to be inactive If there is anything I can do to help get this PR accepted please let me know Finally thank you minamarkham for an awesome piece of software its saved my team and I hours of effort in setting up time This looks like a great tool for setting up new developer machines and I really want to start using it myself How would you recommend I use formation within a team setting Id like to be able to customise the apps to be installed and maybe extend with some different types of installation applicable to my team members I could fork this repo and just customise there but would prefer not to diverge from this repo Ive seen the example customisation script but as thats initially written to the users home directory it could be tricky to keep that synced between team members Ideally Id like to start a private repo with scripts which reference formation and simply extend with our own functionality I dont know if anyone else has tried something like this but Id appreciate any guidance or discussion anyone might have to offer Add taps to slay Create taps Thank you so much for putting this together I was wondering if this is safe for running on a fresh machine First always skips the NVM install thinking its already installed If I switch the check to mimic the MAS install placing the skip message after the if statement and moving the install steps after the else statement it works Also should regular dotfiles like bashprofile be created or cloned and synced first When this is run on a fresh machine the NVM install step errors when trying to add the path Hi Mina This project is super awesome Thanks for making it I found a glitch when adding packages to be installed in swagcasks I had added z super handy if you havent already heard of it and found that slay seemed to think it was already installed Turns out the xz package had already been installed and had caused a false positive when running brew list grep brew I added the w to trigger an exact match Seems to work Turns out fasd is the new hotness
