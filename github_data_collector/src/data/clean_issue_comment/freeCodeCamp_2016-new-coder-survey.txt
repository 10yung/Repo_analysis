I am yrs old and my career has badly changed the course and now I am looking into changing career and prefer coding Any help how to kick start this new journey Thanks and highly appreciated for any guidance added my analysis to address Issue older applicants are decreasingly likely to get a job after bootcamp Looking for factors that correlate with no job after bootcamp These factors should increase with age so we can discern causality bootcampnetjobnormed bootcampjobnormed Why not try to assess competence High wages in IT are justified on the basis that IT requires greater intelligence I have always found this suspect It would be great to get some insight into this from a wide survey like this Thanks Im interested to find out the population numbers relevant to when the survey was active ie how many users of Free Code Camp and Code Newbie was the survey sent to This would be useful for getting a survey response and in turn work out the P value margin of error I am using this survey data for my Dissertation as part of a Master of Information Systems and Technology degree and the population data would be pretty useful I cant find it in any of the links so far ping QuincyLarson Cheers Mat Hello I am currently working on a data visualisation project and I am basing it around this data set I found the data dictionary below I asked this question already on Kaggle by the way but I havent received any reply yet Anyway something that is not fully clear to me is the meaning of the field IsSoftwareDev Does it mean a I was software engineer already before attending a bootcamp used online learning resources and so on b I am new to coding and I have already found a software dev job I suspect and hope that its answer b That would make more sense to me as its a new coder survey However there is also a BootcampFullJobAfter variable which indicates whether the individual managed to get a job post boot camp Unfortunately that only applies to coders who have attended a boot camp If anyone could clarify I would be very greatful I am trying to determine what factors in the data set lead to somebody managing to get employment in software development I am building visualisations around that etc Seasons Greetings by the way Thanks John The quantiles of ExpectedEarning for India are something like this dollars is Rs this is an insanely high figure for India PS the data for United States Of America seems to pretty legible hence I have raised this issue to get more clarity i was lead here by this article i have completed the front end dev cert and am finding it difficult landing a job in my location charlotte nc so i would also like to see what states cities are hiring the most code campers and if minorities are finding it more challenging across the country thanks Because I am a pessimist I would like to crosscompare each question to get a neural on demographics to compare them to myself thank you
