Snappy is available as a port in vcpkg a C library manager that simplifies installation for snappy and other project dependencies Documenting the install process here will help users get started by providing a single set of commands to build snappy ready to be included in their projects We also test whether our library ports build in various configurations dynamic static on various platforms OSX Linux Windows x x UWP ARM to keep a wide coverage for users Im a maintainer for vcpkg and here is what the port script looks like We try to keep the library maintained as close as possible to the original library DeltaFS uses snappy See the github page for details As systimeh is guarded by HAVESYSTIMEH if the flag is missing gettimeofday will become an undefined identifier Fixes a minor issue in see and another one see Update the PyPI url fixing point a raised in the discussion at Additionally update many other urls whether simply from http to https or reflecting various moves or linking to archived versions for pages that now give Not Found errors I want to install libsnappy on linux mint I already install GTest from github but make complained undefined reference Linking CXX executable snappyunittest CMakeFilessnappyunittestdirsnappyunittestcco In function snappySnappyZeroOffsetCopyTestTestBody snappyunittestcctext x b undefined reference to testingMessageMessage It seems like CMakeList not link to libgtest Fix it by adding targetlinklibrariessnappyunittest gtest in CMakeliststxt After optimze MUFlat MBs html BMUFlat MBs urls BMUFlat GBs jpg BMUFlat MBs jpg BMUFlat GBs pdf BMUFlat MBs html BMUFlat MBs txt BMUFlat MBs txt BMUFlat MBs txt BMUFlat MBs txt BMUFlat MBs pb BMUFlat MBs gaviota BMUIOVec MBs html BMUIOVec MBs urls BMUIOVec GBs jpg BMUIOVec MBs jpg BMUIOVec GBs pdf BMUValidate MBs html BMUValidate MBs urls BMUValidate GBs jpg BMUValidate MBs jpg BMUValidate GBs pdf BMZFlat MBs html BMZFlat MBs urls BMZFlat GBs jpg BMZFlat MBs jpg BMZFlat MBs pdf BMZFlat MBs html BMZFlat MBs txt BMZFlat MBs txt BMZFlat MBs txt BMZFlat MBs txt BMZFlat MBs pb BMZFlat MBs gaviota Before optimze Benchmark Timens CPUns Iterations BMUFlat MBs html BMUFlat MBs urls BMUFlat GBs jpg BMUFlat MBs jpg BMUFlat GBs pdf BMUFlat MBs html BMUFlat MBs txt BMUFlat MBs txt BMUFlat MBs txt BMUFlat MBs txt BMUFlat MBs pb BMUFlat MBs gaviota BMUIOVec MBs html BMUIOVec MBs urls BMUIOVec GBs jpg BMUIOVec MBs jpg BMUIOVec GBs pdf BMUValidate MBs html BMUValidate MBs urls BMUValidate GBs jpg BMUValidate MBs jpg BMUValidate GBs pdf BMZFlat MBs html BMZFlat MBs urls BMZFlat MBs jpg BMZFlat MBs jpg BMZFlat MBs pdf BMZFlat MBs html BMZFlat MBs txt BMZFlat MBs txt BMZFlat MBs txt BMZFlat MBs txt BMZFlat MBs pb BMZFlat MBs gaviota Corrects d fee ecfded ab ad de and still maintains clang compatibility like the originally Compiler tests uname m ppc le cat tmpxc gcc c tmpxc tmpxc warning warning powerpc exists Wcpp warning powerpc exists tmpxc error error ppc not defined error ppc not defined clang tmpxc tmpxc warning powerpc exists Wwarnings tmpxc warning ppc exists Wwarnings warnings generated I should be on the CLA list already If you have are going to build tests SNAPPYBUILDTESTS you will require gflag and gtest libraries Lets make them required and move the findpackage into the ifSNAPPYBUILDTESTS code block when This PR is similar to
