EmpireWorld can you check if this is better then can replace with it current better This shader works like a charm The only thing that looks weird is when I rotate a sprite then the direction of the shadow is wrong is there a way to incorporate this into the shader so that the shadow is always in the same direction from cc smkplus Javascript support has been deprecated in Unity D as a programming language note that Im not pointing to Javascript plugins when you export for WebGL platform So script templates should be removed from the library or move them to a legacy folder Althougt code can be commented in the scripts could be great to generate automatic documentation for the scripts and host it in the ghpages branch of this repository In this way we can have a presentation web for the library and also the related documentation on how the API works I have checked DocFX and it seems its possible to implement the pipeline for hosting the documentation as stated See it here DocFX is just an example but if you find another better solution we could use it too Currently the README file of this repository doesnt contain a logo for the library It could be great to have a custom logo for our repository and give it more visibility I have created a new branch called ghpages that will host the website for the UnityLibrary I think this way we can provide visitors some examples on how to use the scripts that form the library NOTE Theme is still pending for approval Please include here your opinions on what to include in the web A good idea could be to create a new separate repository that uses Github pages as a blog for community members that could be used to include useful tutorials or announcements for the community see this and some others lots of empty lines for assetbundleloader can use this to clear other cached versions as mentioned here Hi We need to test our scripts in Play Mode and Edit Mode using Unity Test Runner to make our scripts stable for public usage We have EditorTests folder for adding test scripts so make a new test script for each script to tests its functionally Also we should test them ourselves by interaction tests Thanks
