A friend of mine is looking for a good game engine he can use to work on his project Seeing that the last update was around months ago should he try Piston or is the project no longer being worked on Thanks in advance For something like rectangle its rust rectangle RGBA x y w h contexttransform graphics But for text its rust let transform contexttransformtrans textTextnewcolor draw Hello world mut font contextdrawstate transform graphics unwrap Why does text require transform and not just x and y coordinates This lint makes it easier to see when a new pub causes a breaking change In order to push an event implementing a window backend your self seems to be the only way to the best of my knowledge There should be some generichigherlevel ways that accepts events to be raised in application code since the window may not only update because of the input There is a createproxy function in glutin seems to be useful but it is still in alpha and is not supported by both windowWindow and windowAdvancedWindow Is there any good way to push a custom event for now x eventidEventId x eventidAFTERRENDER x eventidCONTROLLERAXIS x eventidCURSOR x eventidFOCUS x eventidCLOSE x eventidIDLE x eventidMOUSESCROLL x eventidMOUSERELATIVE x eventidMOUSECURSOR x eventidBUTTON x eventidRENDER x eventidRESIZE x eventidTEXT x eventidTOUCH x eventidUPDATE x eventidFILEDRAG x Button x Motion x HatState x FileDrag x Input x Loop x Event x AfterRenderArgs x AfterRenderEvent x ButtonState x ButtonArgs x ButtonEvent x PressEvent x ReleaseEvent x CloseArgs x CloseEvent x ControllerButton x ControllerHat x ControllerAxisArgs x ControllerAxisEvent x CursorEvent x FocusEvent x GenericEvent x IdleArgs x IdleEvent x ModifierKey x Key x MouseButton x MouseCursorEvent x MouseRelativeEvent x MouseScrollEvent x RenderArgs x RenderEvent x ResizeArgs x ResizeEvent x TextEvent x Touch x TouchArgs x TouchEvent x UpdateArgs x UpdateEvent x TimeStamp See Some games or applications do not use eg idle events so they might want to disable it The freetype example is fixed to using SDL Window instead of the generic PistonWindow and therefore cannot be combined with the other examples like srcspriters How can I set a window icon to the window backends There is nothing documented online regarding this Do I need to access the window backend manually At the moment piston is just a bunch of libraries and it doesnt offer GUI game editor like Godot and Unity Can we in the near future implement a full GUI game engine
