Bumps flask from to details summaryRelease notessummary Sourced from flasks releases The Pallets team is pleased to release Flask Read the announcement on our blog There are over a years worth of changes in this release Many features have been improved or changed Read the changelog to understand how your projects code will be affected JSON Security Fix Flask previously decoded incoming JSON bytes using the content type of the request Although JSON should only be encoded as UTF Flask was more lenient However Python includes nontext related encodings that could result in unexpected memory use by a request Flask will now detect the encoding of incoming JSON data as one of the supported UTF encodings and will not allow arbitrary encodings from the request Install or Upgrade Install from PyPI with pip pip install U Flask This is a repackage of to fix an issue with how the package was built Upgrade Upgrade from PyPI with pip Use a version identifier if you want to stay at pip install U
