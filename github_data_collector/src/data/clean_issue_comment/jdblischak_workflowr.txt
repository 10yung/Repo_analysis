figures The figpath doesnt seem to be working properly and Python figures end up in figureDOCNAME instead of docsfigureDOCNAME and therefore dont show up on the website Not sure if it a problem with where they are created or they arent being moved to the correct directory This test document should reproduce the issue assuming you dont have any reticulate issues need to rename to Rmd TESTtxt Potentially this is a niche problem but thought I would raise it and see if there is an easy fix Pushing with SSH doesnt work wflowgitpush Error Push failed for unknown reason The error message from git rpush was Error in git rpush error authenticating These sorts of errors are difficult to troubleshoot If you have Git installed on your machine the easiest solution is to instead run git push in

initial commit and the rest is all links to HTML commits The commits of the Rmd are not listed at all According to the Custom GitLab setup section of the vignette If GitLab Pages is enabled the links to past versions of the R Markdown files should work correctly open an Issue if you are having problems However there is currently no way to conveniently view the past versions of the HTML files Seems like Im having the opposite problem although our GitLab Pages are not enabled yet so it might be a completely unrelated issue My environment devtoolssessioninfo Session info setting value version R

in parallel with drake and using wflowpublish as the workflowr command I often see targets failing with the following error error simpleError The Git repository is locked This can happen if a Git command previously crashed or if multiple Git commands were executed at the same time To fix this you need to delete the file gitindexlock You can do this by running the following in the R console fileremovehomepatrickpapers featureselectiongitindexlock However when this happens I usually only build one target with workflowr and not multiple ones in parallel When building only this one target sequentially with drake everything is fine I am not sure if drake maybe locks something there or some other issues are introduced by parallelization in general I think this is hard to track down Would it be possible to add a flag to wflowpublish which does not lock the Git repo binder is an amazing tool for reproducible research It would be great if we could make it easier for workflowr users to integrate binder into their research projects An idea for a function eg wflowusebinder would perform the following steps Search all the published R Markdown files for library calls and related pkg usage eg pkg Create and commit a configuration file that is supported by repo docker Add a binder link to READMEmd and to the website either indexRmd or the navbar in siteyml The first step is the weakest I could imagine improving it in multiple ways One would be to have each Rmd file automatically write its dependencies after running sessionInfo Alternatively wait for the package manager functionality to be integrated before making this any more complicated Im open to ideas and suggestions cc seabbs sdhutchins xref Tweet Describe the suggested feature It would be nice to be able to specify the order in which the analysisRmd files are build with wflowbuild Maybe some sort of a dependency requirement added to the front matter in each Rmd Describe why you think this feature is needed Sometimes an output from one Rmd becomes an input into another I follow the Import Tidy Transform Model Visualize schema and if I update my transformRmd the new output wont be fed into modelRmd because modelRmd gets built first since the files are built in alphabetical order Adding double digit prefixes to the files is a working solution but it would be nice to define the dependencies more organically This would be particularly helpful when adding a step in the middle of the workflow renaming all the downstream files wouldnt be necessary Tell us the version of workflowr you are using

Describe the result of running the command or code including any warning or error messages The links to old versions git commits are broken Paths assume https protocol I can manually edit the path to

please search the existing issues both open and closed to check that a similar feature has not already been requested I read some created issues the issues and the discussion in the issue the tips under The jdblischak advice helps the users create docsassets and see the external images in the HTML document by knitting the analysis document or the function wflowbuild But since the image document is under the docsassets the users cannot preview this image under the analysis document Also the relative path of this image is not under docsassets The users cannot use kbdtabkbd to quickly get the image path Describe the suggested feature Just use the absolute path the image is stored in a public repo Describe why you think this feature is needed If the image is stored in a public path the users just copy the absolute path and they can preview it in the analysis document see it in the HTML document after knitted Tell us the version of workflowr you are using Run packageVersionworkflowr in R or RStudio and copy paste the output here packageVersionworkflowr I find a related issue but I want to set the bibliography field as a default option for each analysis document Thus I put it in the siteyml but it doesnt work only when I write bibliography addbib in a specific document it works in this specific document I dont know too much about the siteyml function seemingly it works like an setting for all analysis document For the reproducible purpose I create a workflowr project in the document learnliterateprogRmd I specify bibliography addbib thus the bibtex works in this pages learnliterateprog in the document learnliterateprog Rmd I dont specify bibliography addbib and set it in the siteyml but the bibtex works in this pages learnliterateprog
