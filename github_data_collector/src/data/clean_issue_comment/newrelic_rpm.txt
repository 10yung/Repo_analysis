I got this error in my log usage hostname s nameofhost hostname unknown option f And after some digging it seems to come from this For workaround I created a wrapper script which doesnt pass the f parameter but it would be nice if theres some check if the system is Linux which only then pass that parameter as I believe other than in Linux it either isnt needed defaults to full name in FreeBSD DragonFlyBSD and macOS or just doesnt exist NetBSD OpenBSD and Solaris There are a lot of calls to Timenow which is known to be affected by changes to system time eg NTP updates It is better to use ProcessclockgettimeProcessCLOCKMONOTONIC For more information see When tracing a request Newrelic should not stop the transaction if the response is lazyevaluated eg Streaming Racks Body response can render streaming responses by wiring an Enumerator into body The server that writes to the client then calls responseeach which iterates over each part of the body parts can be lazygenerated We are interested in tracing this code because DB queries http requests or other business logic may be running in this Enumerator
