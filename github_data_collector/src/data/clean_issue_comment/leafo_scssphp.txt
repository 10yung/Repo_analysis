PHP compatibility Im using master branch Whatever I do I have this kind of source map heres a minimal example version filecmscsssourceRootsources stdin names mappingsAAAA Instead of the name of cmsscss in my case there is stdin This is the simple cmscss h color blue sourceMappingURLcmscssmap The compiler works fine even in complex situations with importing Bootstrap framework The generated css is well Having a short look into the code I have seen that the word stdin comes from the constructor of the parser class which is called by the compile function Dont know what I have to change or if its a bug Do you or anyone here know of a PHP based autoprefixer like We use scssphp in Tiki now for which many thanks and it seems we need our prefixes fixing and it seems like it might be a good option to include in here The data as to what needs prefixing all seems to be in wondering how hard it can be TIA I mean will in the next Version Patch can add Setcache option for rename Cache Folder into something like Public etc and TrueFalse to Encrypt Cache file name this will be useful for develop website in PHP Framework when in ENVIROMENT Dev Prod Example ifENVIRONMENT production replace this look like echo linktagassetsmylibcssstylesheetscsscache c a b ae af dc e a ae css into this echo linktagassetsmylibcssstylesheetpublicmystylecss else echo linktagassetsmylibcssscssphpmystylescss No need to overload server and play with htaccess copy the finally update to css Benefit just loadding file cache instead in Prod mode it done I am looking to add annotations to the parse tree The import rule in SASS can be used in two ways As a css import rule resolving in import urlurl when compiled As a rule which actually importsincludes another sass or css file inside the currently compiled onThis particularly useful when your assets are managed by bower and you want to compile and minify everything into a single css file Here is a link explaining what Im talking about Some important links from there The logic behind how the import rule works The PR when this was implemented In the current version of scssphp the import rule will result in the following compiled css import othersubdirimportme instead of actually importing the content of the importme file After digging through the source code of scssphp I found out the solution is quite simple One should only append urlcss to the CompilerphpL Afterwards everything should work as expected in both scenarios when using import The website is outdated but it is still shown first in Google It would be a shame for such a great library when people are disappointed because of the old version It would be great when the website is updated or forwarded to new githubio page A simple to use PHPStorm integration for Leafoscssphp
