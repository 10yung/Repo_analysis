Like supply my own extension Thanks for filing a pull request for Chromeless Please look at the following checklist to ensure that your PR can be accepted quickly Once all the items are checkedoff and CircleCI is passing we will review your PR x If this PR is a new feature reference an issue where a consensus about the design was reached not necessary for small changes x Make sure all of the significant new logic is covered by tests x Rebase your changes on master so that they can be merged easily x Make sure all tests and linter rules pass x If youve changed APIs update the documentation in README and apiREADME apiREADMEmd Ive noticed that when I run multiple scripts at the same time with the launchChrome true option sometimes some of them will not work they will freeze or end on a timeout whereas if I run them one after the other they work perfectly Its as if they were interacting when they are launched at the same time in the same chrome window but under different tabs What should I do to be able to run them locally at the same time with no interaction This is a Bug Report Description No matter what I attempt I have rebuilt this project from scratch several times and redeployed the project a couple times I deleted the api gateway and built everything again as well This is the return result from the gateway version chromeless serverlessChromeless This is the

fails or you don t have such unconditional trust in your tests this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update details summaryRelease Notessummary strongv strong pThis is a huge release Many new awesome features and we have pretty much fixed all the open issues regarding Got bugs on the issue trackerp h Breaking changesh ul liRequires Nodejs br You might ask why not follow the Nodejs LTS cycle and target Nodejs In short asyncawait and WHATWG URL which enabled us to considerably simplify the codebase and reduce the dependencytree Got v is a stable release and you can continue using that if you need to support Nodejs li liThe a href functionalitya was rewritten to improve its reliability and to support retrying on HTTP status codes Previously it only retried on some network failures a classcommitlink href The option was renamed from coderetriescode to coderetrycode and it now accepts either a number of retries or an object with ability to specify number of retries HTTP status codes and methods to retry on and a function to decide how to retry See the a href for morebr Migrationbr code retries code code retry codebr code retries gt code code retry retries gt codeli liRenamed the codecanceledcode property to codeisCanceledcode a classcommitlink href liDropped support for the codebodycode option being an Array when codeform truecode a classcommitlink href The builtin codenew URLSearchParamscode API doesnt support this either and its a weird usecase If you need support for this just dont set codeform truecode and handle stringifying yourselfli ul h Improvementsh ul liLess dependenciesli liThe codetimeoutcode option was rewritten to be more reliable and flexible You can now set a timeout for every phase of the request if you want or just for the whole request Thats up to you a classcommitlink href liAdded a href which lets you easily create instances of Got with some options overriden a classcommitlink href liAdded a href which is a more advanced and powerful version of codegotextendcode With this API you can create your own nichespecific instance of Got for example a HTTPclient for GitHub a classcommitlink href liAdded a a href hooka a classcommitlink href liAdded coderequestcode and coderesponsecode events to the Promise API a classcommitlink href liThe codecontentlengthcode header is now also automatically set if the codebodycode option is set to a codefscreateReadStreamcode instance a classcommitlink href liYou can now remove the default codeuseragentcode header by passing in codeuseragent nullcode as a header a classcommitlink href liThe codebodycode option can now be any kind of object not just a plain object a classcommitlink href ul h Bug fixesh ul liFixed a problem with the cache not working when using the codequerycode option a classcommitlink href liLess unhandled errors Hopefully none a classcommitlink href liHeaders are now correctly proxied when you pipe codegotstreamcode a
