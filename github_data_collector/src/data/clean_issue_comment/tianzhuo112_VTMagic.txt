VTMagic TableView Warning once only UITableView was told to layout its visible cells and other contents without being in the view hierarchy the table view or one of its superviews has not been added to a window This may cause bugs by forcing views inside the table view to load and perform layout without accurate information eg table view bounds trait collection layout margins safe area insets etc and will also cause unnecessary performance overhead due to extra layout passes Make a symbolic breakpoint at UITableViewAlertForLayoutOutsideViewHierarchy to catch this in the debugger and see what caused this to occur so you can avoid this action altogether if possible or defer it until the table view has been added to a window Table view UITableView x be frame clipsToBounds YES autoresize WH gestureRecognizers NSArray x a f layer CALayer x c contentOffset contentSize adjustedContentInset dataSource UIFilteredDataSource x a e Kindly help with the swift version of this repo if its available or create a swift version for we the swift guys Thanks menubar Item VTMenuBarh itemScale magicControllermagicViewmenuBaritemScale f item voidsetActuralSpacingCGFloatacturalSpacing acturalSpacing acturalSpacing menuBaracturalSpacing acturalSpacing voidsetActuralSpacingCGFloatacturalSpacing acturalSpacing acturalSpacing menuBaracturalSpacing acturalSpacing item
