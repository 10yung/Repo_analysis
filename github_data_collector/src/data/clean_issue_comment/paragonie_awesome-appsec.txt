Added an example project which has no security It provides howto steps to enable encryption with SSLTLS for three scenarios one way authentication server communicates over https and identifies itself with a certificate two way authentication both server and client needs to identify itself and trust each other two way authentication based on trusting the certificate authority same as above one but trusting the rootca is enough to get the same result Java spring based web server A variation of http clients which are supported Helps the person to learn about certificates keystores ssl commands and basic web security based on certificates cool nonprofit community i figured portswiggers Web Security Academy would be a great addition to this repo Cybering is a course on YouTube Actively being released This is a bit of shameless selfpromotion well my publisher asked me to but I wonder if you would be willing to add a link to my book API Security in Action I can send you a link for a free copy if you want to read it first it is still in early access so not complete yet It has a chapter on basic secure application development techniques and then chapters covering CSRF etc It covers JWT because it is hard not to but is clear to point out the security weaknesses and covers alternatives like Macaroons and Paseto I also mention CipherSweet in a section on database hardening so Paragon IE is well covered Also it has some changes related to After running srccompilerphp the date is ignored grep r date dataCbooksandebooks fedoradefensivecodingjson date READMEmd Defensive Coding A Guide to Improving Software Security by the Fedora Security Team defensivecodingaguidetoimprovingsoftwaresecuritybythefedorasecurityteam Defensive Coding A Guide to Improving Software Security by the Fedora Security Team defensivecodingaguidetoimprovingsoftwaresecuritybythefedorasecurityteam srcUtilphp if emptyfd date dt new DateTimefd date header dtformatY DateTime Instead of just using the year it seems working when date matches the pattern YYYYMM Notes OK Four digit year and month GNU YY mm NOK Year and just the year YY Enhancement Include optional fields and examples ModSecurity is a pretty decent opensource WAF that can be placed in front of applications Can this be added to this repo Also OWASP updated its cheatsheet series and placed them on Github these are a good resource as well Can I make a pull request that adds or both of these to the repo Is there a place for this on awesomeappsec This API has been unmaintained for several years Im the new owner and keeping it maintained now The API code Now official Official announcement Main issue Main PR Whats changed Interested in a PR
