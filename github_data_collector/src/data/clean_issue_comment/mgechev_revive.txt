Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I would love it if I could just point revive to a specific configuration file and have it automatically pick up the include and exclude directories from that configuration file I have some directories that are used for test helpers multiple directories with files and it is annoying to have to pass in the exclude flag just to have it ignore them Describe the solution youd like I would like a top level exclude and include variables that work just like the CLI exclude and include flags Describe alternatives youve considered I currently use the CLI flags but again they get pretty long and having to use a bash variable to hold each one is annoying On top of this everyone on my team knows to look for the toml config file and completely forget about the extra arguments on the CLI in some random CICD file Additional context Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe When I define my own revivetoml it seems to disable all the rules Itd be great if I could just tell it to use the rules from defaulttoml with perhaps ability to turn off specific rules so I dont have to change my config when revive adds new rules but still have options like what error codes to return with In order to lint all files the linter needs to be able to use build tags It will actually fail to run if all the files in a directory have build tags Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe A clear and concise description of what the problem is Ex Im always frustrated when a rule rulevarnaming have two effect packakge name lint and variable name lint I want to set them in two rule Describe the solution youd like A clear and concise description of what you want to happen add rulepackagenaming setting to lint Describe alternatives youve considered A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered no Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here
