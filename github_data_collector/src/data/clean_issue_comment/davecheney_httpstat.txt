Adds an option that allows the user to specify a file of one or more CA certificates that can be used for SSL peer validation These CA certificates are added to the default pool of CA certificates that are used by Go Fixes It would be helpful to allow additional CA certificates to be used for SSL peer validation Currently the only options are validation against known root CAs or skipping verification using the k option In some cases clients need to include a complete certificate chain for a mutual auth transaction The current implementation of E and readClientCert does not support multiple certificates The current implementation does not support multiple certificates in a single PEM file This PR adds support for reading multiple certificates from the PEM This use case is necessary when the client needs to pass a complete certificate chain as part of a mutual auth transaction Fixes Note Sample private keys have been included as part of the test suite They are example keys only and should never be used as any part of a production implementation sizedownload The total amount of bytes that were downloaded sizeupload The total amount of bytes that were uploaded speeddownload The average download speed that curl measured for the complete download Bytes per second Example output whitespace and carriage returns added for readibility Address Header Connection keepalive ContentType texthtml charsetUTF Date Sat May GMT Link rel Server nginx StrictTransportSecurity maxage XPoweredBy PHP deb u Proto HTTP Status OK Timing DNS TCP TLS Server Transfer Lookup Connect PreTransfer StartTransfer Total To have accurate measurement of TLS and support skipped steps DNS TCP and TLS reuse the timing code has been refactored to use Go support for TLS tracing as well as a more descriptive variable namings for steps time This commit removes support for Go versions lower than Add an option to repeat the same request multiple times reusing the same HTTP connection Depends on When I try to use httpstat on service with HTTP I got following error http server sent GOAWAY and closed the connection LastStreamID ErrCodeNOERROR debug It would be really good to have the SSLTLS handshake latency
