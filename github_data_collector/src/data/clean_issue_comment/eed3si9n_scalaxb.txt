compileIncremental Compilation failed error Total time s completed Jan AM Note this xsd includes other xsd definitions but the problem occurs with or without the dependent files so Im excluding them for simplicity I have attached the generated sources scalaxbproblemsourceszip Other info Scala Ive seen this on multiple machines with multiple people in my organization I think it may be related to the dispatch dependency Reproduce sbt new eed si nscalaxbg Then open the sbt prompt and type compile or reload or anything The input is suppressed Field in XSD element nameX typeinteger minOccurs element XML element aX Gives error while parsing javalangNumberFormatException Zero length BigInteger Fixes Id like to suggest making the trait sealed by default A sealed trait requires to have all the classes that it extends in the same file Which is the case with scalaxb Having a sealed trait makes it easier to spot errors because the compiler will drop warnings Hello We using crossScalaVersions Seq When I compile clearly just one of the versions are generated Do I miss some special settings With big enums the generated fromString methods exceed the allowed method size and wont compile This PR splits the fromString method into multiple private methods with lines each grafik Could you help me please I am using scalaxb v I use the attribute maxLength in my XSD but string parameters ignore this attribute How can i fix this Example xsdsimpleType xsdrestriction basexsdstring xsdmaxLength value xsdrestriction xsdsimpleType Would be nice to be able to namespace runtime Currently one needs to manually maintain compatibility between runtimes generated in different projects noruntime doesnt work very well as it still forces the project to have a single runtime version Hello We have a legacy JAXB project which converts XSDs to java classes Recently we decided to migrate it on scala using scalaxb The XSDs are downloaded from below link under folder ICHICSRSchemaFiles While running compile task I am getting below error Referenced type urnhl orgv CD was not found Kindly check to see if anything is missing in the configuration or what could be the issue My sbt
