Im getting this error when building Error error duplicate value for resource attrprogress with config Dont know what to do Unfortunately this library does not give correct audio wave on marshmallow nougat and oreo When I input a file of length seconds and sound starts at and ends at rest seconds are blank then the audio wave shows no blank moments Instead it shouw as if the there was sound during the whole recording Proof Hi i record voice in telegram and final wave form is like following image b but when i used from this audio for test app the result was like this a my code is java byte soundBytes null try InputStream inputStream getApplicationContextgetResourcesopenRawResourceRrawf soundBytes new byte inputStreamavailable soundBytes toByteArrayinputStream catch FileNotFoundException e eprintStackTrace catch IOException e eprintStackTrace waveViewsetWaveColorColorparseColor fff waveViewsetScaledDatasoundBytes waveViewsetRawDatasoundBytes new OnSamplingListener Override public void onComplete How Detect Correct Raw Data Hi Im using this library for a personal project where I place the progressbar between an image and a panel with the default alpha channel it doesnt look very fine I suggest accepting parameters for the not filled bars color for the filled bars color and also for the alpha channel instead of using a hardcoded alpha value Thanks for this project I use this in recyclerview and start progressAnim there is some problem I think that caused by reuse with recyclerview For example the first items wave progress will be set for three or four items How can I deal with it Thanks Hi Thank you for the great library I wonder where I can find the required array of bytes that I must pass to setRawData if I want to play a mp file should I get file input stream and then get the byte array I tried to do that but the created waves were not Compatible with the voice
