Hi Im familiar with programming in arduino IDE but not with this kind of source codes which need BUILD Im looking for a tutorial for newbies to make them able to build binary file from this kind of repositories Steps to reproduce switch on wifi repeater and connected a device on it switch off the device open a telnet connection and send show stats the device is still displayed Is there a reliable way to know which devices are connected Dear Martin Im using a relay on GPIO so I defined gpio mode out So far this worked and I can control my relay with the commands described in the readme file When the devices is powered the relay always is set to high for a fraction of a second then it is set to low Is there any chance to avoid this during the start up phase of the ESP Best Regards and Merry Christmas Gisbert Hi Martin I done repeater using your code to extend WiFi of my home router with details as Gateway IP Subnet DNS In our IoT project server is connected to router with reserved dynamic IP and other nodes are connected with static IP assigned say I am using repeater for one node say static IP but my issue is when connecting this node to repeater it provides network details as Gateway IP Subnet DNS dynamic IP say so server cannot able to connect with because repeater makes it as say how can make same as How to route it When i first flashed my esp i opened the wifi connections and i could see MyAp After i configured it i couldnt see the connection I tried everything Flashed it using different settings different binaries etc but nothing worked The esp is not problematic because i tested some other things on it and it worked just fine Can someone help me fix the problem Im interested in your mesh realization that allows to retranslation network traffic through mesh I want to use it in my project based on esp but with some modifitaction My probles is I cant find any source code of it Is your realization close and I can use binary firmware only In other case where can I find source code of mesh Dear all I meet one problem about the line dhcpssetDNSWiFidnsIP from feedback of arduino IDE conversion from IPAddress to ipaddr is ambiguous I check everywhere but not find answer Thanks for read prefer your answer NAT table full and LmacRxBlk problem Excuse me The above question Concrete solution What Hi A few things really but the first is for the meshmap topology output could you make the output of this respond to a set mqtt command So that I can get a synchronized response from all the routers and my other nodes at the same time Next is is there some trick to getting the router to connect to the mqtt broker by NOT using an IP address My routers do not seem to connect if I use a hostname Lastly I found that I needed to change the WDS setting on my main ADSL router in order for the ESP s were allowed to connect Do you have any information as to why the WDS setting should be a problem Regards Robert Hi This project is amazing and I want to contribute but I noticed there is no developer documentation also this project doesnt not seem to use platformIO or Arduino so no clue how to start is possible to provide documentation like which module does what and how compile build even better if its possible to convert to platformio project
