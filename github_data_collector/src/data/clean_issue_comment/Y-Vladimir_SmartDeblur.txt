Adding Linux Build Instructions to Readmemd Hi Im unable to build SmartDeblur on my Gentoo system which has only Qt no Qt anymore I get CMake Error at usrsharecmakeModulesFindQt cmake message Found unsuitable Qt version from usrbinqmake this code requires Qt x Many thanks for a hint Helmut Whats the best you can make out of this heavily blurred picture Its supposed to be a scan of mm film from a bolex camera with mm lenses incorrectly mounted some say exposed to a very bright object at a distance Quite a challenge Hope its not offtopic How do I set up the size of blur track Did you send a paper on this technology I want to quote Looking forward to reply Hello I really like your program and found it useful for small photos However I guess you realise that modern cameras produce photos much larger than px on the long side I tried opening a MP photo from my Pentax K II but the program crashes I am running it on a computer with GB of RAM so I do not see how a photo cannot fit into it I assume that the crash is caused by a segmentation fault Also I agree that processing large photos takes a long computational time but I think it will be worth it if we can make a crop of the photo adjust the settings to make them pleasing to the eye and then plug in the fullsize photo and let the program run in the background It does not really matter if it takes half an hour if the result is good In any case very nice work I appreciate it Algorithm could get some more data after blind deconvolution by user input Ie if one has a blurred image of a screenshot and deblurs it with a lot of additional moire now he has a chance to tell that some area has the same color or that some area doesnt have a strong gradient in it The idea is quite straightforward so there should be an article on it somewhere If youre not interested in searching for possibly nonexisting article or implementing such algorithm please leave this feature request opened in case someone likes to try it and make a pull request My DPI level and the text is cut off and does not lay out right Example ss Hey Vladimir Yuzhikov First off all Your tool is really amazing From a photographers point of view it is already stunning what this tool can do to bad images However when it comes to removing motion blur the real motion blur is many times very complex Imagine shaking the camera to the left and afterwards up To remove this blur a kernel looking like a L would be required Thus the user is not able to represent the kernel only using the sliders To solve this problem I suggest creating an option to load a premade kernel This kernel can be obtained by the user by using a image editing program eg by extracting a bright spot on a dark background Id be great if you could think about adding this new feature because it would make your software so much more powerfull Greetings from Germany Rasenmaeher Hi Vladimir Hope you doing good Here is my feedback upon using SmartDeblur V I downloaded the zip file SmartDeblur winzip SmartDeblur last windows version MB Uploaded a month ago from the site The package is downloading and installing fine After this I am extracting the files in the same directory And running the SmartDeblurexe This resulting in SmartDeblur v launching However problem starting after this The moment I am uploading a jpeg image file taken by a Canon D camera the image is loading in SmartDeblur and within seconds the SmartDeblur v application is crashing I removed the entire application restarted my laptop redownload the application all over again and followed the same procedure Still the same problem remains Can you please help Please note My laptop has Windows XP Professional Vrsion SP operating system Intel Celeron GHz procesor and GB of RAM Thank you Kaushik Bhowmik From India kaushikbhowmikgmailcom
