Im unable to switch resolution in Portal It seems to have defaulted to my native one p when I switched from to however which is good The font also seems to render slightly differently and I think I prefer the nonPressure Vessel font Portal running normally Portal running in Pressure Vessel Ive not had the chance to verify whether I can reproduce the issue mentioned by TTimo here POSTAL singleplayer crashes after the content warning mature content etc not an error whereas the unsupported multiplayer instantly crashes To be clear this is when running it in Pressure Vessel System Information The steamruntime SDK seems to have the wrong version of PulseAudio It appears to be version but on my real SteamOS installation it seems to be much newer libpulsecore so I downloaded a December snapshot of comvalvesoftwareSteamRuntimeSdkamd i scoutsysroottargz from Using Docker I was trying to build Kodi inside the steamruntime SDK and its CMake scripts automatically detected the PulseAudio version was which is lower than their requirement I presume this is a bug in the SDK that should be fixed Also in the meantime can you recommend the cleanest way to update the PulseAudio in the SDK so I can try to complete the build Thank you Having access to the build definitions could be useful for distributing games outside of Steam with the same runtime When attempting to run the game inside of Pressure Vessel it crashes instantly on startup no window visibly appears Tested with Everlasting Summer When trying to run Danger Gazers with the runtime container it dies with this mediastorageSteamLibrarysteamappscommonDanger GazersDangerGazers error while loading shared libraries libcryptoso cannot open shared object file No such file or directory Trying the container since its a Game Maker title which bugsout normally with mediastorageSteamLibrarysteamappscommonDanger GazersDangerGazers homeliamlocalshareSteamubuntu steamruntimepinnedlibs libcurlso version CURLOPENSSL not found required by mediastorageSteamLibrarysteamappscommonDanger GazersDangerGazers I really wish Game Maker would sort that out already If you need other detailswant me to try something else do let me know System info With PRESSUREVESSELSHAREHOME set steam downloads saves to incorrect location localshareferalinteractiveLife Is StrangeVFSLocalMy GamesLife Is StrangeSaves the correct location is varappcomsteampoweredApp localshareferalinteractiveLife Is StrangeVFSLocalMy GamesLife Is StrangeSaves I know this may seem like a stupid idea to some but it would be nice for the devs to consider Please merge Proton with the new Steam Linux Runtime together and have Steam Linux Runtime as a rolling release feature on Linux Also in my view if Proton were to be merged then everything could be in one place and might be easier for the devs to maintain with all the code in one place and certain games that refuse to work might also now work in container Compatibility Report Rocket League issue with drawing off screen using Linux Run Time Steam AppID System Information GPUAMD Aruba DriverLLVM version Mesa Kernel version generic Link to full system information report as Proton version Steam Linux Run time I confirm X that I havent found an existing compatibility report for this game X that I have checked whether there are updates for my system available Please add PROTONLOG command to the games launch options and drag and drop the generated HOMEsteamAPPIDlog into this issue report Symptoms When opening the game main window is forced off screen I can minimize and maximize and it will eventually come back into view Reproduction Have done this several times You can find the Steam AppID in the URL of the shop page of the game eg for The Witcher Wild Hunt the AppID is You can find your driver and Linux version as well as your graphics processors name in the system information report of Steam You can retrieve a full system information report by clicking Help System Information in the Steam client on your machine Please copy it to your clipboard by pressing CtrlA and then CtrlC Then paste it in a Gist and post the link in this issue Please search for open issues and pull requests by the name of the game and find out whether they are relevant and should be referenced above
