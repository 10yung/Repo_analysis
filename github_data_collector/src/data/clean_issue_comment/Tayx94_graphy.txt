I believe it should be pretty straight forward Some info on what it takes to make it so people can just download this through the package manager can be found here I was trying out the Universal SRP in b and the LWRP in same thing new name and noticed Graphy having a stroke Looks like the FPS shader isnt too happy Here it is in normal mode and here in light mode I mentioned in Discord but will mention again in case it is lost in chat with s release LWRPUniversal RP will be default going forward and I dont believe there will be a nonSRP renderer From nevaknevak Id say we could potentially get rid of both classes all together if we use TMPro and SetText SetCharArray which doesnt allocate memory But this would need some research I get a compilation error on Unity f and Switch platform in the GraphyDebugger class at line It seems like the Switch platform wants rather to have the native screenshot code used I cant give more info about that sadly due to Nintendos NDA If you need more info about it you need to register at the nintendos dev portal Not even with the LIGHT shader versions The problem may be something related to the arrays used in the shader not being supported somehow What AssetBundle with Scene A has an refrence to prefab Graphy When this prefab and all its assets is bundled into the same AssetBundle as Scene A it does work When this prefab and all its assets is bundled into its own AssetBundle it does not work Cause This seems to be connected to a limitation of unity which causes it to be unable to load shaders at runtime from AssetBundles Solution The shader fields on the prefab must be replaced with materials in order to be loaded at runtime as far as I know I can work around this with including graphy into the main application but Id love to use graphy as an optional module Hi first of all great asset I bought it a few month before you made it free and its served me right on all my project since I like to use submodules on my projects so that if Im reusing an asset I can have separate repository for the asset I would love to do this with graphy without having to use the asset store but since this repository contains all the unity project and not just the Graphy Ultimate Stats Monitor folder I cant do it I would suggest only having this folder in the repository Remake the Graphy UI using Vertical and Horizontal Layout Groups
