I was ecstatic to find dockermachinenfs when I discovered how slow the vboxfs performed for running our development environment within containers Having done some testing with DfM Im finding the exact same issues with their osxfs That said I found a DfM solution very similar to this one called d mnfs If Im not mistaken its pretty much doing the same thing as dockermachinenfs but without most of the bellswhistlesfeatures Is this something youd be able to do If not would you be open to a PR that attempts to add in the support Im happy to give it a shot although Im far from wellversed in NFS and the different use cases Id need to test and how to troubleshoot them Of course theres a first time for everything Not every terminal supports all colors so there should be an option to supress them or you get ugly stuff like INFO Configuration t m Machine Name default m t m Shared Folder homefcareydockershare m t m Mount Options noaclasync m t m Force true m INFO machine presence mOK m INFO machine running mOK m INFO Lookup mandatory properties mOK m t m Machine IP m t m Network ID vboxnet m t m NFSHost IP m Hey there It would be great if it was possible to use different NFS options for different shared folders For example I want to share Users with the standard alldirs mapall id u id g setup but I want to share another directory with alldirs maproot This isnt currently possible as all shared folders share the same options Any ideas Add an option to share folders with boot docker as NFS server and OSX as client This is useful for situations where the underlying filesystem needs to be a Linux filesystem So if we want to uninstall the nfs support is there an easy way to do that The configuration and cleanup of the etcexports file should be improved Using the technique of Vagrant could be a good approach VAGRANTBEGIN b f e bfdac d f pathtovagrantfile rwnosubtreecheckallsquashasyncanonuid anongid fsid VAGRANTEND b f e bfdac d f We should probably use the dockermachine name and would be something like DOCKERMACHINENFSBEGIN machinebox Users alldirs mapall DOCKERMACHINENFSEND machinebox Things to keep in mind What when ip changes dockermachine does not provide fixed ip at this moment of writing
