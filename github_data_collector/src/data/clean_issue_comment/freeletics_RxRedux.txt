only security updates if desired details You use switchMap for all your side effects so eg if you consider an UpdateSideEffect that triggers eg actions and we want those actions to always be executed after each update we need to use flatMap instead like following fun UpdateSideEffectcompanion Companion clazz ClassAction SideEffectState Action actions state actions ofTypeclazz flatMap because we never want to lose any side effect action flatMap Observablejustitem flatMap ObservablefromArray Action Action Action If we call eg update actions we will only get the side effects of the last action if we use switchMap but we will get all side effect actions if we use flatMap like in my example Of course if order of side effect actions is important we could also use concatMap as well Question Im unsure why you dont use flatMap by default is there any particular reason for that Or is there something speaking against using flatMap at this position instead at all Bumps gradle from to Dependabot

only security updates if desired details The FAQ regarding reducers and side effects says Technically speaking Reducer gets every Action from upstream before the registered SideEffects The idea behind this is that a Reducer may have already changed the state before a SideEffect start processing the Action In looking through the code this behavior seems to hang entirely on the fact that PublishSubject stores its subscribers in an array multicasts events to subscribers in array order and the reducer is the first subscriber I dont think that behavior is part of the public API for PublishSubject For example see Im still learning about RxJava and am even more naive about RxRedux so I may be missing something here If my observations are correct I think the implementation of ObservableReduxStoresubscribeActual should be refactored to ensure actions are reduced before being multicast to the side effect subscribers Bumps versionsretrofit from to Updates retrofit from to
