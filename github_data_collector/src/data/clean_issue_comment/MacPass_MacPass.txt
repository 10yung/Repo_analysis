Describe the bug Autotype cuts off last character of the username and inserts it into the password field Eg Usernam TAB ePassword ENTER This of course causes logins to fail To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Select an entry with usernamepassword to autotype Press the hotkey to trigger autotype CommandT Expected behavior Username and password should be typed correctly Desktop please complete the following information macOS Catalina Version Edit I have to say that this bug isnt present in KeePassXC using the same kbdx file entry and target windows One difference Ive noticed is that KeePassXC types a bit slower whereas MacPass seems to type instantly maybe thats the cause of the issues My target window is a remote windows desktop inside Citrix Workspace so could be that the input is too fast for Citrix to process correctly Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe At work all of our passwords have a day expiration This falls between the days and year presets that are presented in the dropdown I also find this frustrating with places with other fixed cycles Describe the solution youd like It would be neat if we could add custom presets to the presented options I cannot see a way to do this currently so apologies if its already there and I just missed it I did search the wiki and website for a solution too Describe alternatives youve considered Presently I use the date command in a terminal to find what the date will be in for example days and then manually select the option As we already have presets I presume the logic is in MacPass to do the calculation internally so this will require a UI to add custom presets and then logic to display them in the drop down and perform the calculation Additional context img width

Go to an RDP window bring up notepad Click back to macpass Change autotype sequence to PASSWORD Run autotype RDP window comes back to the forefront and shows aaaaaaa the length of the password Expected behavior Autotype should have filled notepad with the correct password Screenshots NA Desktop please complete the following information macOS C Version Additional context Similar behaviors reported in keepassx for RDP NxMachine and VMWare Why this bug matters The standard way to change a password on a windows server is to press ctlaltdelete to bring up the change password dialogue The copy paste buffer is disabled while that dialogue is up which means you have to manually type long complex passwords correctly multiple times old new new password You can go into computer management and change the administrator password manually but it comes with scary dialogue boxes telling you to use ctlaltdelete and warns of lost information death destruction pestilence and the salting of your most fertile fields or maybe just the first one in that list Describe the bug All entries copies to the clipboard needs to be removed after some seconds as configured in the Preferences dialog Unfortunately this does not happen the copied usernames and password remain forever in the clipboard To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Start MacPass and open an database Open the Preferences dialog set Clipboard cleanup time to seconds Select some database entry copy the password from the Inspector pane by using right click on the password textfield Open a texteditor and paste the copied password immediately Repeat the paste action after seconds the password has not been removed from the clipboard Expected behavior The password copied to the clipboard needs to be deleted after seconds Screenshots Not needed Desktop macOS Version Additional context It doesnt matter what kind of copy action Im using shortcut right click in inspector in list the problem is always the same Describe the bug Import XML overwrites the contents of the active DB To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior File Import Import XML Expected behavior The expected behavior for File Import Import XML is to append entries to the open database Instead it wipes the entire contents of the active DB and overwrites them with the imported entries Desktop please complete the following information macOS Version continuous Can a plugin interrupt or get feedback from Global Autotype One scenario a particular app bundle if you trigger global autotype the plugin could direct a different action or an additional action So instead of looking for an entry it displays macPass or it outputs some text to the clipboard Second scenario if no entry is found on trying to complete auto type plugin could receive the window title and in turn start to create a new entry in the current database Describe the bug Many translations in French are missing such as TOUCHBAREDIT TOUCHBARCOPYUSERNAME AUTOTYPENOTIFICATIONMACPASSISMISSINGPERMISSIONS To Reproduce Lauch MacPass with the fr locale Expected behavior Correct french messages Desktop macOS Version Additional context I can contribute to complete the French translations What is the process Generic error The application MacPass can t be opened Messages related to this event from Systemlog Dec C TW D HTDD MacPass assertion failed B

comapplexpclaunchd comapplexpclaunchdoneshot x bMacPass Service exited with abnormal code Hi there just a small ideawish that would bring more consistence into the CopyPasteAutoType shortcuts Yes they can be changed in the SysPrefs but let me explain All Copy shortcuts come with and additional modifier key to the CMD key like SHIFT or ALT AutoType just has CMDT which is super awesome But CMTT is at least with me only step after CMDSHIFTU to open the URL This is superhandy and super fast but there is this SHIFT key that somehow kicks the fun a little out of this thing So here I go with my plan What about switching the default shortcuts for Copy Address and Open Address CMDU CMDT would be so nice and fingerfriendly Just an idea Thx and Cheers
