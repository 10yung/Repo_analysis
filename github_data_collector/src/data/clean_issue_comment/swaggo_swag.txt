I cant install swag Your swag version last Your go version windowsamd Hi I just want to add multiple base path in swagger doc For ex My base path is apiv I have defined two tagslet say A and B Endpoints under tag A will have url like localhost apiv getList Endpoints under tag B will have url like localhost apiv subgetList I can do this by adding router subgetList post but it is not a best practice for adding sub in all endpoints So I am searching for solutions like define basepath for particular tags or override the global base path Or is there any way of adding servers like following servers url url Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe When using OAuth security definitions it is frustrating to always have to put the OAuth information into the Swagger UI modal every time I want to authenticate Swagger UI provides functionality to include default values for these variables eg clientId realm appName see here for relevant Swagger UI documentation Describe the solution youd like In order for implementations using this library and Swagger UI such as swaggoechoswagger which Im using the relevant configuration parameters need to be provided to the Swagger UI JS library This information could be included by this library using clientId myclient in the securitydefinitionsoauth comment block or similar Describe alternatives youve considered This could also be a part only of libraries such as swaggoechoswagger that use this library these are the components that would actually call the initOAuth function from the Swagger UI library It makes sense to me to have this information available from this central library though Additional context You can see how flaskrestplus handle this here and Describe the bug After authenticating properly with OAuth Implicit I get redirected back to the swagger docs with the token in the url fragment but it does not send those as a Bearer token for my requests Even with this security definition securitydefinitionsoauth implicit OAuth Implicit in header name Authorization authorizationurl myauthurlcom and my endpoint has Security OAuth Implicit on each To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Setup swagger with OAuth Implicit Authenticate in swagger Make a request inside swagger Realize the Authorization header is not sent Expected behavior The Bearer token should be sent as a header called Authorization when making requests Your swag version eg Your go version eg Desktop please complete the following information OS eg iOS Ubuntu Browser eg chrome safari Firefox Version eg
