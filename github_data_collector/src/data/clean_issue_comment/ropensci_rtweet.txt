improving rtweet Closes My Renviron didnt like having in the path Updated to normalize to Problem I created a token following the instructions in the vignette using the accesstoken method I then restarted my R session and tried to gettoken but it launched a browser window to allow the rtweet app to access my account Expected behavior It should have reloaded my token Reproduce the problem This appears to be a windowsspecific issue and COULD be idiosyncratic to something about my machine This is what was added to my Renviron TWITTERPATC Users jonth Documentsrtweettokenrds Updating the s to s

magrittr R tools jsonlite packrat My concern was that when parsing large numbers of tweets gigabytes of data would accumulate without having a good way to start their processing other than closing and reopening the stream If we implement a way to redirect the data stream to the standard output then it can be piped to the split command and subsequently blocks of data can be parsed as soon as they are downloaded A working example with a new parameter writejsonstdout can be found here What do you think Fixes issue Update searchtweets such that the searchfullarchive function supports max tweets per request which is the limit for the Twitter premium API Fixing this bug is important because it can double or more the cost of using the Twitter premium API Thanks for this great package This is a suggestion It will be great if the user was able to choose the delimiter as a parameter for flatten and thus writeascsv Let me know if it sounds useful Happy to do a PR with this small change implemented Ive been working on building twitter networks elsewhere and had already laid a foundation before realizing that rtweet now has some builtin functionality so Ive got some lessonslearned that may be of interest I changed unrollconnections so that it doesnt mangle UTF data on Windows stdstring pains building networks such as usertohashtag will now be safe for Windows folks if thats something desired in the future The algorithm is a bit simpler than the previous one and skips the stdvectors My benchmarks are showing that its x faster If youve encountered a likely bug in rtweet please take a few seconds to look through existing issues for a similar issue If you dont see a related issue please complete the prompts below to make it easier to replicate and hopefully resolve your issue Problem Twitter offers the counts endpoint for the day and full archive searches If my understanding is correct this may be a useful budgeting tool to determine how many results and therefore how many requests a given search will find However there does not seem to be a function in rtweet that wraps this endpoint Expected behavior It should be possible to call the counts endpoint Apologies if I am missing something here
