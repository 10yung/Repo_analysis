Example code to reproduce rust let mut router TreeRouternew insertroutes mut router graph Get Boxnewmove Context Response as BoxHandler which expands to rust let mut router TreeRouternew use routerRouter let mut router mut router let method allowunusedimports use Method Get let path graph routerinsertmethod path Boxnewmove Context Response as BoxHandler router And the actual warning message warning variable does not need to be mutable srclibrs insertroutes mut router graph Get Boxnewmove Context Response as BoxHandler note warnunusedmut on by default note this error originates in a macro outside of the current crate Im expecting this to involve some design choices so its more of a tracking issue than something for anyone to pick up unless you are confident enough Currently the documentation links points towards whats in the master branch which will quite soon diverge after a release The links should be changed to point to where X is the released version and the version script should be changed to update them as well For example foo bar foo bar This is useful enough to be supported I think even though its nonstandard I dont yet have a specific design in mind so its wide open for suggestions but I would like it to fit nicely into how parameters works today Having a static lifetime requirement on Handlers seriously cripples handlers This means you cannot have any Ts in Handlers that arent static also I encountered this problem today while trying to integrate ivancerasrustorm today with rustful with this code snippet This doesnt work because ApiHandler stores a Database which isnt static I work around this issue by diving a bit lower and passing around the r d connection pool instead but that heavily bloats my code tldr please make Handler not require static it would make it a lot more flexible This is currently blocked by some variant of rustlangcargo
