This plugin stoped working after tmux commit It worked at tmux commit ec b ec fac db a bcd e bbb The commits in between involve changes related to how perpane options are handled which is used by this plugin Hi this seems to be basically the same issue as except while that issue has been fixed the same issue is still present with the git status file matching img Without telling grep that weve finished providing arguments the search query will be interpreted as an argument to grep Since b e b f e cb e f ab tmux does not start anymore if the locale enUSUFT is not locally available shell tmux need UTF locale LCCTYPE but have ANSIX It is common for nonEnglish setups to lack the above locale Thus it would be nice to either present a better error message in such a case or much better use a more suitable locale eg CUTF Thank you for your time I tried to use it on byobu if I press ctrla I get the copycat search but then i enter anything and nothing works In fact when I press ctrla I suppose its that wtf key called prefix it opens a small thing in the upper right corner to scroll up Anyone made it work with byobu The feature requested is similar to the behavior of n j n k for vivim where n is the number of steps upwards or downwards Finally a plus would be the possibility of typing nn to jump to the first match and NN to jump to the last match Minor cleanup addition see Fix support for matching quotes in URLs Dont match whitespace before file paths grep P is needed This solves one of the issues Ive commented at Im finally getting this all fixed Locally at least Associated tmuxopen pullrequest My prompt matches both path and numeric seaches p I use this for auditing purposes along with logging While it would be possible to introspect the PROMPTPS and figure out what to ignore Id be happy with being able to specify a regex to ignore as well In fact that may provide better flexibility for unforeseen use cases
