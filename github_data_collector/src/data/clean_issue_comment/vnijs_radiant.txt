Hi again Vincent Sorry to bother you again I was trying to teach validation analysis to my students and although all students set the seed to a specific value students got two different results on different computers I thought it was related to Windows vs MacOS or bits vs bits but these two factors were not the issue It would be great if you can check this to see what might be the issue Last year when I ran the same analysis all students got similar results Best Koushyar
