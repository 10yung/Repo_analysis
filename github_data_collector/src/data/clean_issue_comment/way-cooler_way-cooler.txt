 There are a lot of problems with installing Way Cooler on Ubuntu To remedy this there should eventually be an officially hosted Ubuntu PPA where we can point users to Hi it would be nice if you could provide a package for Fedora CentOS etc Ideally as part of the official repository but a copr or an other custom repo would also be fine A possible solution could be the openSuse Build Service Ive been thinking a lot about the state of the Lua libraries in Way Cooler and how they compare to AwesomeWM one of the window managers that Way Cooler was based on They have a large well tested high user base system set up This is something I cant recreate certainly not on my own However AwesomeWM doesnt currently have a Wayland equivalent nor is one as of time of writing in the works After talking with the developers they plan for the Wayland version of AwesomeWM to be in Rust as well Seeing this as a point of collaboration I have started working on a library that will allow a compositor written in Rust to add support for using the existing AwesomeWM Lua library as a means to control the compositor The librarys main focus will be abstracting some of the lowerlevel details of talking to Lua eg having an OO structure and will provide callbacks to the compositor that they must implement in order to be compliant eg returning the position of the pointer or drawing to the screen It cant be compliant because its basically a thin wrapper around xcb but it should be able to recreate of the functionality The rough plan is as follows Make the library In Progress Making it in house follow these issues Integrate into Way Cooler Deprecate but do not remove the current Lua libraries in Way Cooler Release v Remove the old Way Cooler Lua integration Release v The WM will then be split into two flavors a Awesomestyle basically a clone of AwesomeWM in Wayland b Way Cooler also known as i style that will be configured using a static configuration file and extended using DBus clients Assuming Awesome devs want to collaborate on a true successor to AwesomeWM work with them to integrate said library in their compositor Assuming remove the AwesomeWM compatibility in Way Cooler transition totally to a DBus focused WM in terms of extensibility That means no more Lua in Way Cooler Release That would be a separate project entirely if that ever happens This has been rolling around in my head for a few weeks and I think this is the correct approach moving forward It gives better support for Lua in the short term can convert more users to using Way Cooler and gives me a better avenue to pursue making a window manager based on DBus in the future Hopefully this should be enough to resolve this awesome issue See this sway pr for more details Is it available Everything looks so tiny on my laptop I wrote the initial libinput config for sway I dont like writing C and was thinking about contributing similar functionality here so that I can compare the dev experience of Rust and C for a small contribution to an existing OSS project Is this something of interest Any ideas on how you might want to see it implemented Seems like you write the core functionality in Rust and then its exposed with lua for configuration I think it should be straightforward since this also uses wlc like sway
