Im using version The app has recently been launched but there is no update prompt Why is this project deprecated Any simple say to disable checking the MacAppStore for updates if i want to use it for a non publish app Your are searching for a maintained iVersion alternative or a another solution for showing your users an alert if a new update of your app is available I recommend you this Harpy Harpy is actively maintained and has a lot of cool features Im not affiliated with Harpy and this is no promotion only a personal recommendation after searching a while for a alternative since iVersion is deprecated localizedstring path is not correct This still uses NSURLConnection but turns off the deprecation warnings for it using pragma Would be a much better idea to upgrade to using NSURLSession instead This code could use some improvement Currently it starts its own thread to download the data then starts a synchronous request which in turn starts its own thread and blocks until that returns What this should really do is just use one of the asynchronous networking calls or even better use NSURLSessions asynchronous calls to fetch the current app version from the app store It also does several performSelectorOnMainThread calls after one another Each such call has an overhead It would be much cleaner if it just did one performSelectorOnMainThread and had that call one method that does the or so calls that need to be on the main thread Finally the way it creates the singleton in load with performSelectorOnMainThread waitUntilDone NO has a race condition This should really just be using dispatchonce like one does these days to set up a singleton threadsafely I couldnt get the local release notes to display and I realized that it was because this property actually expects a file name not a path I think this property should either be renamed localVersionsPlistFileName or the logic should be updated to detect if its been set to a full path and not to append it to NSBundle mainBundle resourcePath in that circumstance I want to check if the current version is available in the app store Is this possible It seems that it only checks for newer versions available Thanks in advance
