desired details Some old versions of glgenerator have dependencies specified with version requirement rustxml xmlrs khronosapi glcommon etc Crates with such vague dependency versions became unusable because allows picking toonew semverincompatible dependencies It also breaks Cargos minimalversions feature because requirement allows picking very very old dependencies that arent compatible with Rust Because these old versions of glgenerator are unusable and cause problems for Cargo I suggest yanking them bash cargo yank vers cargo yank vers cargo yank vers First of all thanks for the effort to maintain glrs Ive already used glrs with stdweb and it works great But now I am developing a project using wasmbindgen and websys I can directly access WebGL bindings through websys but I want to use an OpenGL abstraction make the project portable to other platforms With that said I would like to know What is the state of glrs with wasmbindgen websys I couldnt find any resource on it Ive removed the changelogs from the READMEs as they were outdated and incomplete Im open to creating CHANGELOGmd files for the crates if required but I havent had the motivation to go trawling through all the commit history Other than this commit fixes Commit should fix Some of the fixed warnings are only shown in beta and nightly Fixing them increases the MSRV but as Travis only tests the stable beta and nightly channels I assume that this isnt a problem Im seeing this warning on rust nightly warning variable does not need to be mutable outglbindingsrs fn metaloadfnmut loadfn mut FnMut str const glimportsrawcvoid help remove this mut note warnunusedmut on by default Is this necessary or am I doing something wrong Is there a way I can configure it to not have this warning in my buildrs The world is a ball of sadness and glXGetProcAddress never returns null See point in this page As far as I can tell glisloaded checks if the loading function returned null or not As the X impl never returns null isloaded doesnt work as intended To be honest I dont really care if this is somehow fixed or not who actually uses isloaded anyway Id be okay with a note on the readme or docsrs front page saying be careful with X and isloaded it probably doesnt do what you want Loading every function with the string wow this isnt the right string returns some valid pointers rainbow rust extern

receive only security updates if desired Finally you can contact us by mentioning dependabot details At least for me using glUniformMatrix dv supplies the shader with a matrix filled with zeros whereas glUniformMatrix fv works as expected I ran the exact same code to test both functions the only difference was that I replaced the former with the latter and I cast each element of my matrix buffer to an f Has anyone else had this happen to them or would anyone like to test on their own box If needed I could possibly come up with an example to illustrate Hi These bindings seem to be missing the two constants glLUMINANCE and glLUMINANCEALPHA Im finding no reference to them on the docsrs page and they dont seem to be working in my project From what I can tell these constants have been in OpenGL since at least OpenGL so I doubt its a version problem Have a nice day
