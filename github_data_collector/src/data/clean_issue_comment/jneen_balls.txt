 It seems like every new scripting language these days has its own taskrunner Ruby has rake Coffescript has cake for Coco there is coke and probably some more make puns that I dont know about Since running tasks in plain bash is not complicated enough I propose to add the bake command which can be used to run the accompanying Bakefiles Each Bakefile would consist of a number of recipes with a variety of different ingredients and so on If anyone thinks this is a good idea Id be happy to build it There are a few major issues that cause it to break on OSX I have patches for most of them but the last might be impossible Uses binbash This prevents usage of a newer bash in the PATH which is needed since you use new bash features Uses GNU features of sed readlink and something else will edit this when I get home These are the easy ones to fix and I will add a patch later today The real stinker though is the buffering that occurs within the pipes In the primary code loop that actually contains the nc call in serversh there are a set of pipes that buffer the data that flow through them While I assume this is not an issue on linux it seems that OSX will buffer quite a lot of data in these pipes I could only get pages to flush when they were quite long The standard page would not flush until I added several K of text I did not actually search for the magic number just poured a bunch of text in Intense googling only revealed solutions that worked on Linux Unless anyone has any ideas I am not sure if small responses will work on OSX While reading the source is fun and entertaining having an actual example would be very helpful for us nonbashdeities Are any bashspecific features actually used in this code I havent done a full review yet but so far all Ive seen is the syntax which can always trivially be replaced by POSIX compatible syntax
