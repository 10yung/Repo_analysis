In the first few lines of youtubevideoyoutubevideojs the initial URL value is hardcoded and the youtube video Id is appended to the string as follows url httpwwwyoutubecomgetvideoinfovideoid id Chrome policies seem to have blocked the use of this protocol for some types of requests This can be overcome by just changing it to https This might be easily overcome with a trycatch of some sort but I have not tested it Thank you for this project It was very helpful for me I run the example script and the script tries to load the url but it gets blocked by the browser because of a Cross Origin Request problem This makes sense to me but are you able to get rid of this limitation Been using the library perfectly for a while Today the callback function is not being called omgigcom is experimenting similar issue Did something change youtubeside
