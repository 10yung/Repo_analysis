This PR adds the interpolation algorithm This PR is add the Jump Search algorithm Hey mgechev I noticed that you have a READMEmd file in srcsorting which has the Big O complexity for all algorithms It also has the When to use column which is blank Basecs already has many algorithms explanations and can be used to fill in thiscolumn The explanations are valid for most languages and are concise Also a READMEmd for all src folders would be helpful I would like to work on this Lomutos and Hoares partitioning functions could be reused across different algorithms Itll be a good idea to put them in separate files
