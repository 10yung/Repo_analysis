 plus some minor formatting proposal on line I installed qlstephen with brew cask but it doesnt work on YAML files Here is a non working file pouetymlzip look at this example I get a lot of plain text files with various extensions such as or inc and currently they only show the icon in QuickLook Looking at one such file with mdls I see it has a dynamic type But the content type tree includes publicdata Would it be possible to extend support to ALL filetypes mdls wgetlog kMDItemContentType dynah d rv ge xe kMDItemContentTypeTree dynah d rv ge xe publicdata publicitem mdls functioninc kMDItemContentType dynah d rv ge w xd kMDItemContentTypeTree dynah d rv ge w xd publicitem dynah d rv ge w xd publicdata Ive been using this great plugin for a long time thanks so much I just upgraded to OS X Catalina and I am having the following issue I was not having this issue days ago before I upgraded the OS I have many text files that I have generated and I have given some file extension say for example gt but the problem occurs for a number of different extensions Prior to the OS upgrade I could QL those files just fine But now all I see when I activate QL is a generic file icon rather than a preview If I take one of those files and remove the extension or change it to txt QL generates a preview no problem Ive tried reinstalling QLStephen two ways using homebrew and by downloading the latest version and copying the QLStephenqlgenerator directory to LibraryQuickLook Then I run qlmange r but no luck In my Library directory there is no QuickLook folder and I ran a find command in the terminal to see if OS X Catalina is hiding a Quicklook directory somewhere else but I did not see one If I run mdls name lKMItemContentType file namegt The output is lKMItemContentType null Same thing if the file extension is removed or changed to txt If I run qlmanage m grep public The result is publicdata LibraryQuickLookQLStephenqlgenerator loaded publicmovie SystemLibraryQuickLookMovieqlgenerator publicx printableencodedarchive SystemLibraryQuickLookSecurityqlgenerator publicxml SystemLibraryQuickLookTextqlgenerator publicfont SystemLibraryQuickLookFontqlgenerator publicx certificate SystemLibraryQuickLookSecurityqlgenerator publicvcard SystemLibraryQuickLookContactqlgenerator publichtml SystemLibraryQuickLookWebqlgenerator publicplaintext SystemLibraryQuickLookTextqlgenerator publicaudio SystemLibraryQuickLookAudioqlgenerator publicxhtml SystemLibraryQuickLookWebqlgenerator publicjson SystemLibraryQuickLookTextqlgenerator publicsvgimage SystemLibraryQuickLookWebqlgenerator publicimage SystemLibraryQuickLookImageqlgenerator publicrtf SystemLibraryQuickLookTextqlgenerator publiccommaseparatedvaluestext SystemLibraryQuickLookOfficeqlgenerator If I force qlmanage to use the QLStephenqlgenerator qlmanage g LibraryQuickLookQLStephenqlgenerator c publicplaintext p file name I see a preview It also works if i run the command above with c publicdata Any ideas Hello Ive updated the project files to generate a bit build thats handy for macOS up to and including Mojave and essential for Catalina The project files have also been updated to build under recent versions of Xcode That said Catalina will require a Developer IDsigned build or itll reject the plugin I was hitting an issue with the penultimate phase of the build so Ive tweaked the file copy target path slightly Im note sure why this was necessary Xcode was escaping the tilde causing the copy to break Cheers Tony Im not very familiar with ObjectiveC but Id be happy to submit a PR with some direction on what to do On the Public betas of Mac OS X QLStephenqlgenerator stopped working Ive attached a screenshot with the message Im receiving img width altScreenshot at src I havent found a workaround Thank you plus minor formatting proposals Ive used qlstephen before on another Mac and I know theres a theme option I cant seem to find anything about it on the entire internet Is there any secret documentation Im missing Thank you
