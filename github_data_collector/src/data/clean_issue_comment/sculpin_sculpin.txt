Currently it seems it is not possible to include a file is that the case Other projects have this built in Windows builds are failing This PR attempts to find and fix the issues preventing it from passing This adds a virtual box that can be brought up configured for sculpin using which in turn uses vagrant Completely optional but can help in getting consistency into the environment in which sculpin runs Adding additional things like a database etc is also made much easier with this Currently attempting to create a namespaced path and doesnt seem to be possible but please advise if Im incorrect Would expect something along the lines of sculpintwig viewpaths views layouts partials includes paths pathtomything mything It can be quite difficult to understand how all the pieces of Sculpin fit together in fact it seems a bit more difficult than is necessary for what the tool does This is partly because its based on earlier versions of Symfony partly because it used to be oriented around being a phar with embedded composer and partly because some of the internals are just tangled When starting on a refactor of this it would be a good idea to add some new functional test cases to ensure that some currently untested realworld usages of Sculpin are handled as expected this would help to prevent surprises Things like bundlesplugins themes etc In generate watch server mode it might be helpful to have some way of editing the site within the browser Particularly if it could handle errors more gently than Sculpin currently does in case a typo causes a crash and leaves the web browser disconnected Getting this error when trying to do the Hello World basic project Version rc When I run vendor bin sculpinbat generate watch server it keeps giving this error Didnt find at least one of this type posts This is my composerjson require dflydevembeddedcomposer xdev sculpinsculpin rc Id like to propose the following feature filtered pagination is providing an opportunity to generate an overview page only with blog posts which have a certain meta block provided It is indifferent if it is part of a list or a simple string example In blog post itself show this in overview page generator pagination pagination maxperpage provider filteredpostsshowthis On this overview page will now appear only entries with the meta information show this I hope you find this feature helpful and consider to merge it in Im trying to create myself a web blog and want to include images to my blog posts so I created a new folder into my postsfolder and give it the same name as the md file inside it Then I put some images in my posts folder and linked them in the mdfile When Im not trying to fetch the posts I get twice the posts I really have on my postsfolder Is it not possible to have postsfolder or did I something wrong folder structure source posts sample samplemd imagejpg Hi there Following the getting started guide when I try to execute any of the script it
