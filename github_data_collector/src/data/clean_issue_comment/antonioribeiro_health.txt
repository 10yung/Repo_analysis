So my APPURL is when I visit I can see that health is making requests to which cannot be resolved I was digging for the reason of this but could not find a solution When I visit myself I do get the data returned So why is it that the panel is making requests without laravel Note On package setup the APPURL wasnt laravel I changed it afterwards Its weird that I can actually goto each routes but the panel requesting something different Cache has been cleared my laravel version is laravelframework Broadcasting default failing Illegal string offset date Im getting this when i try to check this is a default installtion with App Providers BroadcastServiceProviderclass enabled am i missing something or what should be done to fix this While this project is good for monitoring a website on a sitebysite basis it will be really useful if it can be extended to cover a group of websites perhaps by a configuration file This enhancement can be easily achieved because of major and powerful features which this package already provides which are Routes which can serve as API access to the service and It already supports JSON response These two can be leveraged on to provide a unified dashboard similar to services of OhDearApp for a group of websites controlledmanaged with some sort of Authentication of course This package can be further improved to leverage on Laravel Notification to update this proposed dashboard in realtime Initial load of the dashboard may make AJAX requests to get the Health status for each of the group of websitesservers while the page keeps pollinglistening for Notifications tom update realtime If this is welcomed I will like to contribute to it provided there is someone that can help with the designprototyping of the frontend components UI design is not really my strength Is this package support kubernetes pods health check If support can I have small example Response needs to be JSON decoded so we can use the right output in further code after upgrading to laravel i got two exceptions Call to undefined function PragmaRX Health Checkers arrayget Call to undefined function PragmaRX Health Notifications studlycase So i made this PR to fix these problems please let me know if im doing anything wrong Thanks in advance Hi antonioribeiro please check if I am right on my suggestion I tried to use custom notifier and its not worked out of the box So after small digging its seems that notifier config key not used at all So in that PR I added it in notifications logic now its fit for my needs Please let me know if I am wrong and miss something Thanks I am getting this idea from the new Laravels flareignition package Can this package include a kind of hint for some of the reports that needs some tweaks for improvement Eg the check for ServerLoad reports Your server might be overloaded current server load values are and which are above the threshold values and Is there no way of appending a link to that response that gives more insight in that specific context Eg Your server might be overloaded current server load values are and which are above the threshold values and Check some stackoverflow or web article link for some ideas on how to improve this Hey This package support the possibility to customize the resources in confighealthresources Upon doing so the resources in the packages are skipped completely Its quite a shame to copypaste all resources just because one resource needs a bit of customization Would it be possible to merge the resources in the config directory and the resources in the package That way most code is maintained in the package and only that what needs to be changed is available in developer projects Let me know what you think Hey This seems like a nice package to support our dev team in ensuring everyone has a stable dev environment I looked through the checks and right now it kinda supports only one configuration Would it be possible to support multiple configurations for different environments For example local a check to test whether the routes and configs are cached makes no sense but on production that would be a valid check And within checks it would also be nice to provide several configurations for example the MySqlConnectable uses a hardcoded localhost connection But for production code and database dont live on the same machine Let me know what you think
