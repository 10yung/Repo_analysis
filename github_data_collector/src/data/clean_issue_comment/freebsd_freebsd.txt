Signedoffby Willem Jan Withagen wjwdigiwarenl vmmapsubmap is destined to to fail if vmmaplookupentry returns FALSE or entryend end I think we only need to do vmmapclipstart and vmmapclipend when vmmaplookupentry successes and entryend end In inline assembly at freebsdcontribntplibiscbacktracec the function getrbp directly set the rax by movq this implementation works in most cases but will fail with compiler optimization When compiler try to inline this small function the behavior will be a little out of expectation I produce the bug case as below static unsigned long getrbp asmmovq rbp rax n int attributenoinline setvalint v return v int main int a setval int b setval int c setval a a b b b c c c a unsigned long d getrbp printfd d d lx n a b c d return Assume rbp is x when invoke getrbp the output of the above code should be but when the above code is compiled with flag O gcc on my PC the output will be trash value For example the nd and rd number is different when execute multiple times I was running this test on OpenBSD recently getgroupssetgroups want an int and therefore casting it to uint resulted in getgroups will not return and set errno EINVAL but instead just work I havent tested this on FreeBSD but the code already was in BSD to my knowledge years ago This change is not tested I suggest try this include syssyslimitsh include stdioh include stringsh include unistdh int mainvoid gidt gidset NGROUPSMAX bzerogidset NGROUPSMAX sizeofgidt printfd d d n gidset gidset gidset int a getgroups gidset printfd n a printfd d d n gidset gidset gidset return Camcontrol only supported HGST branded drives I updated the vendors list to support WDC and WD branded drives to improve compatibility for future drive releases MacBook not Macbook or macbook no accent keys consistently instead og without accent keys An attempt was made to sort the lines and keep en strings first Reduce log level for message about unsuccesful port reset which ends up flooding syslog The following sysctl configuration also helps to get rid of excessive logging but the downside that certain USB device Create SoundBlaster are not even getting recognized by USB hub controller hwusbdisableenumeration
