 Issue Advanced Options such as double can interfere with chords being registered Example an a click b click chord cannot be bound while a double is also bound Other Issues design decision Chords not having access to advanced features IE Cant make a chord double a double b also cant make a chord such as long press a press b Empty Action needs to be present to see option Ie If you want to bind b click you must have a action for a b button even if its empty Suppose I am writing an OpenVR driver to represent the HMD I can see the game content inside SteamVR View I want to know how to direct the game content to another monitor that I have I want to emulate the monitor to be a VR screen So I expect to see the monitor to have splitted content for the left and right eye How do I send game content to another monitor in OpenVR driver In terms of code for both legacy and direct mode Whats the difference between the Vive screen and the normal monitor screen How can they behave differently when connected to the PC in direct mode How to emulate direct mode using a normal monitor What are the properties that the monitor need to have to use direct mode Hooked up a Vive Pro Eye Yesterday and today I suddenly started receiving a error No web search has given any clue as to what this error means It asks me to restart steamVR however this has no effect on the error and I can not see or use the Vive pro or index controllers Controllers wont even pair Using SteamVR Error Im trying to create a new set of bindings for a new project But for some reason I do not appear to be able to edit PoseHaptics in the SteamVR controller binding UI beta and nonbeta desktop window and inHMD I have a mandatory pose action on my default action set and a haptics action but the buttons to edit pose and haptics bindings is not available Screenshot Looking at the No Man Sky bindings the Pose button is also not available though the haptics button does show up Side note the bindings UI really needs a way to handle bindings with a large number of action sets Right now there is no scroll bar behaviour for the top bar Screenshot Ive actually had similar issues before Those the UI has a big problem with those buttons being crammed into a space they dont fit and then wrapping and ending up out of view I noticed this back when the bindings UI was opened in Chrome by the Unity plugin Though now that the Unity plugin is opening the bindings UI in a dedicated window I cant easily workarounddebug this like I can in Chromes inspector TriggerHapticVibrationAction has the signature virtual EVRInputError TriggerHapticVibrationAction VRActionHandlet action float fStartSecondsFromNow float fDurationSeconds float fFrequency float fAmplitude VRInputValueHandlet ulRestrictToDevice but

nolo We have developed a software that uses NOLOs DoF hardware accesses the OPENVR protocol and simulates HTC to report data to SteamVR At present the button does not take effect in boneworks This game uses htc vive The keys are normal during the game With the nolo device there is no key response in the game only the location What factors will affect the button not responding such as profile other factors The attachment contains the profile file that nolo is using please check In addition if controllertype adds a nolocontroller what do we need to do Thanks for your continued support and help Im trying to set the black levels directly in the HMD instead of relying on debug tools I understand this can have a side effect of black smearing I have only HMD connected I run lighthouseconsoleexe in steamapps common SteamVR tools lighthouse bin win I download the config line blackclamp I tried changing it to another value but there seems to be no effect As I understand its set to because is I tried and and even no difference in black levels Is that not the same as blackclamp debug console command that was in steamvr a few versions ago Please advise Could we get some documentation on what exactly simulatedcontrollertype does under the hood From what Ive observed when simulating Index as Oculus The HMD and both controllers return oculus for PropTrackingSystemNameString and PropAxis TypeInt becomes keControllerAxisJoystick Feature Request Expose simulatedcontrollertype to settings somehow The reason I would like this property exposed is I am converting the legacy input system of an older game to be a hybrid approach of the legacy system and actions where I have intercepted and recreated the functionality of GetControllerState which is normally disabled when SetActionManifest is called and have createdprocessed the same set of legacy action bindings using this as reference However since the game is not normally aware of controller types beyond Vive Oculus and WindowsMR and the controller simulation seems to be nonfunctional when using the new system but seems to still be possible to enable the setting in the binding file via options name mirroractions type bool default false name simulatedcontrollertype type string default none I can more or less emulate what simulatedcontrollertype does by intercepting calls and modifying their returns to the game but have no way to determine if this setting is actually in use by the bindings not about to hook vrclientx EVRButtonId seems to imply that the Joystick for Index is on Axis kEButtonIndexControllerJoyStick kEButtonAxis However when querying the Axis type using PropAxis TypeInt it returns keControllerAxisNone which seems inconsistent with other controller types such as Oculus where Axis is reported as keControllerAxisJoystick For the Index it seems that no Axis from report as Joystick I am not certain if this is intentional or a mistake
