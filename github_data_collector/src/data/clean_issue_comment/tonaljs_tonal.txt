 PR Purpose First thank you so much for creating Tonal Its been an absolute lifesaver for my app Im making this PR to create a showcase section under the projects README Id be absolutely honored to have my app Solfej showcased on there Solfej would quite frankly not be possible without Tonal Theres some very complex music theory stuff going on behind the scenes throughout the lessonsexercises and Tonal plays a key part in all of them A bit about the app Solfej is a music theory and ear training app iOS Android Web As a self taught musician and guitarist Ive always struggled with music theory This has been due to the lack of true user friendly resources the amount of nights Ive spent down youtubewikipedia rabbit holes In the last couple of months Ive set out to fix this gap for myself and everyone by creating Solfej The iOS version of the app is in beta with users and the android and web versions are being released soon Links Website for Solfej Source code for Solfej Hi This question is not entirely tonal related but my best guess is to find someone with help here I have made an app you can try it out here where I use html entities for musical symbols like a flat or a sharp The problem im facing is that on some devices the symbols have weird spacing and or styling and cannot be colored Which messes up readability Is there anyone that has or had the same experience and knows a solution Ive tried using different fonts which are supposed to be good for musical html entities and changing them all to use an img which doesnt work consistently aswell Thanks in advance In the example js romanNumeralbVII is shown to translate to a major chord it should be a dominant chord Above this in the summary it says A roman numeral symbol is a string like bVIImaj But the example shows bVII being incorrectly translated to the major chord I think that changing the example call to js romanNumeralbVIImaj Would solve the issue The documentation website linked in this repository description seems to have moved When clicking the link it shows the question how do you get here It seems tonaljs is missing a feature to output chord subs or i just missed it being there For instance Cmaj can be subbed with Em or Cmaj with Em G Bm b G Dm etc Actually I would be fine with helping out on inserting it in tonal if it is missing and if needed ive finished conservatory jazz guitar so have all the knowledge to make it work Currently it seems theres not support for advanced chords like Amaj sus C add etc The link on Github on the Code tab is broken Hello I am completely lost I find some examples but I cannot get how I am supposed to use the library I would like to pick a root note say G and then a scalemode say aeolian and finally retrieve all notes in G aeolian and get the list of all chords compatibles with this scale Are there guides to explain how to do that Thank you Hi I dont understand why considering whatever chord except from Cmaj I tested some chords the function chord returns different chords the inversions but the tonic of the sequences of notes that I put in is ALWAYS in the second positionis it a bug or am I doing something wrong Is there moreover a way to have always the same name of a chord without considering the inversions so I can put notes in whatever order I want Thanks in advance for the answers here some examples consolelogChordnotesDm D F A C consolelogchord DFAC Fm consolelogchord FACD Am consolelogchord ACDF Cm consolelogchord CDFA Dm consolelogChordnotesEmaj E G B D consolelogchord EGBD GMaj but I should expect Emaj consolelogchord GBDE BMaj but I should expect GMaj consolelogchord BDEG DMaj but I should expect BMaj consolelogchord DEGB EMaj but I should expect Dmaj Hi are there any plans to support solfegesolfa notation I recently started using Tonal in a project at SightReadingMastery and it would be very useful there I can imagine it would be in many other applications as well I noticed Teoria supports this feature as well Tonal is a fantastic library Kudos to everyone who has made it possible
