Hi C Users admin Desktop Polycode Polycodemaster Release Windows Framework Examples Windows PolycodeExamples PolycodeExamplessln When I opened the example sln and compile the following error happened Error error LNK cannot open file BulletDynamicsddll C Users admin Desktop Polycode Polycodemaster Release Windows Framework Examples Windows PolycodeExamples DPhysicsBasic LINK DPhysicsBasic Friends I really interested in your game I have tried twice within one year still failed to build it Can you update it to latest VS version with latest dependencies link because certain links already obsolete Hi May I know where to put these projects glext and wglext projects urgent KT Recently I have downloaded this game engine as my learning resources in my journey to create my own D Game Engine I have followed the sequences to create sln with CMake and build it with VS but there is some error in the building process all projects were built successfully but with the except of Bullet project There is a built error Error error MSB cmdexe exited with code C Program Files x MSBuild MicrosoftCpp v MicrosoftCppCommontargets bullet May I know how to solve it First of all I do not endorse other people who want to make a fork out of Polycode to not credit the original author back as that is not ethical Why I suggest for Polycode to use Unlicense is because since the term Free as in Freedom and Open Source means that the user can own the codesoftware as soon as the downloads it and uses it Placing any kind of restrictions within the software or in terms of legal stuff ruins the sense of freedom and gives off a sense of no ownership as there are restrictions in place as to how people can use the code Unlicense still does protect the original authors from people suing the orginasation Would be nice to have And should be almost for with the Lua support Fixed a memory leak The tangent buffer was never being deleted It will be nice to have a software that can do all in one so we dont have to worry about exporting and importing All the models can be created using one software Also does the game engine automatically convert cpp to dll when they run the game
