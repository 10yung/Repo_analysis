In fcb c the hubotirc adapter was moved from nodeirc to a fork and pinned to a specific ref There appear to be two problems with this Because the dependency is pinned to a ref the hubotirc adapter is no longer tracking any bugfixes or updates made to that fork The fork that has been selected is missing vital bugfixes from upstream An example of one such missing bugfix is martynsmithnodeirc I happen to be encountering this multiple connection error right now Suggested fix move back to martynsmithnodeirc Im happy to send a PR to do so Let me know if the maintainers are open to switching back The list of hubot adapters in the hubot documentation is being replaced with a link to a GitHub topic search Add the hubotadapter topic to your repository on GitHub to include it in this list cc Hi I noticed my bot was accepting invites to random channels despite having both HUBOTIRCPRIVATE and HUBOTIRCIGNOREINVITE set to true Some investigation found the issue Line in irccoffee is if not processenvHUBOTIRCPRIVATE or processenvHUBOTIRCIGNOREINVITE This actually seems to work opposite the order of operations is wrong I believe it works out as If not processenvHUBOTIRCPRIVATE or processenvHUBOTIRCIGNOREINVITE So if you set it it wont ignore the invite This is fixed by either unsetting HUBOTIRCIGNOREINVITE which is more of a workaround than a fix or the following change I dont know coffeescript but I was able to fix it in my test by changing the line to if not processenvHUBOTIRCPRIVATE or not processenvHUBOTIRCIGNOREINVITE But Im not sure thats the correct fix hence why Im not doing a pull Thought Id mention it in here though stefan In hubot arnaudmm was trying to use thenotice method like coffeescript robothear toto msg robotadapternotice systest tototo This didnt work because the first argument is an envelope object that should have a user or room This does work coffeescript robothear toto msg robotadapternotice roomsystest tototo When a user quits the channels listed are all the channels the bot is in not just the channels the user is in Hi When trying to install hubotirc Im getting the following warning nodeicucharsetdetectortargetmk recipe for target Releaseobjtargetnodeicucharsetdetectornodeicucharsetdetectoro failed npm WARN optional dep failed continuing nodeicucharsetdetector nodeicucharsetdetector is an optional dep of the irc module youre using for hubotirc The issue seems to be fixed if we use version of the irc module I see that you recently updated your packagejson with this version in your master branch but hubotirc tagged still ships with version of the irc module I know that this is not really a critical error but do you have any plans on updating irc module version so we can install hubotirc without warning FYI Im using node v Cheers We have found that sometimes when the bot is cycled it reconnects to the room before its old nick is released and therefore reconnects with a different deduplicated nick Eg instead of connecting with myrobot it uses myrobot which is automatically generated by the irc server When that happens the robot will not respond to its new nick eg myrobot but only the nick it was expecting eg myrobot This makes it difficult and confusing for users to interact with This seems like something that would need to be dealt with via the irc adapter hence I am opening this issue Our team is using the IRC hubot way ie create a real slack user for hubot and used hubotirc adapter We have some customized hubot command but recently some of them are failing I look at the debug code and found out that if the message we send to hubot contains urllink the message will get changed Say we send hubot command abccom And when receiving this from hubot the message has became command abccom Thus will cause our command fail to parse It was completely fine in the past months until last week Is there anyway we can avoid this Thanks in advance I already raised an issue in githubhubot but I was told to try it here Right now I try to create a Dockerized Hubot instance but it stucks while launching dockerhubot gitmaster docker logs f tailall dockerhubot Wed May GMT UTC DEBUG Loading adapter irc Wed
