I keep getting the same error even after changing the value of HDOP to a higher one What I mean by high is Any solutions to fix it IF YOU DONT REMOVE THESE FOUR LINES THEN YOUR REPORT WILL BE CLOSED AUTOMATICALLY Questions and user problems should be directed at the forum Please be very sure you have found a bug when opening this issue If there was a previous discussion in the forum link to it Bug report Issue details The Yaw drift on APM much much higher than that on BetaflightCleanflight when not using a magnetometer We observed drift of about degree in mins on betaflight when sitting on the desk and in APM degree drift was observed in about secs Tested this on various autopilots and the performance is the same Our guess was that this is because of the EKF not tuned correctly when not using a magnetometer so we tried reducing the noise values of gyro and acc but it didnt really make much of a difference Any ideas Version Platform All AntennaTracker x Copter Plane Rover Submarine Airframe type Quad X Hardware type Kakute F AIO Kakute F V Pixracer mRo Pixhawk Logs Please provide a link to any relevant logs that show the issue Bug report Request position message using MAVCMDSETMESSAGEINTERVAL doesnt respond within the required interval Sending message COMMANDLONG with MAVCMD MAVCMDSETMESSAGEINTERVAL to request a position message at intervals of ms down to ms doesnt respond coherently Version Copter Copter Platform Copter Hardware type Pixhawk I want to switch than if then else I think it is easy to understand that the processing differs depending on the value of the same variable This makes for slightly larger builds on F and H but gives us fast double precision maths I think it is time we started testing that This add support for writing to dataflash logs from scripting This also adds a example writing to both dataflash logs and a file on the SD card There is also a second example that reads in data over serial and writes to dataflash closing The examples use findbaudrate and tabelconcat from Tested both in SITL and on real hardware This generally works OK not all the the formats are supported for lua so I added a helper to auto fill the timestamp for a Q character in the format string Is there a nicer way to give the binding access to APlogger I had to make a couple of functions public to get this working Possibly we may have also bypassed some checking that gets done by logger before logging Many thanks to WickedShell for helping me out when I got stuck more than once As mentioned in this Thread We had the Sync Problem it was gone later in a DEV Version of But with the stable and RC the problem is back Version Copter Platform All AntennaTracker Copter Plane Rover Submarine Airframe type hex Y octa etc Hardware type Cube TMotor F A Pro II Brushless ESC A in This PR solves which prevents a fly away of copter I have created a new param that takes in max allowed distance of the first waypoint when the user switches to mode auto If the new param Ie AUTOMAXWPDIST is set as this feature is disabled It is disabled by default If the distance to first way point is greater than maximum allowed distance then copter does not switch to mode auto and raises a message alert Here is what currently happens on master if a user switches to mode auto when the mission was set from some different location far away It can easily lead to a fly away situation Screenshot from copy After these commits and setting up the param here is the message that is raised Screenshot from I dont know if this is the best approach to solving this problem but I feel itll be a good safety feature to add rmackay peterbarker magicrub if possible please suggest any changes that can be made to make this PR better
