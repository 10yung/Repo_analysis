Hi My name is shauyin I am working on bees My bees are around and each video is around GB i wonder if JAABA is possible for tracking bees and can also check multiple bees at the same time Can you please make some suggestions Thank you for replying Best Shauyin Hello everybody I have a minor question there is a feature on the PrepareJAABAData interface which I am not entirely sure what it is used for see attached image Would it be possible to use this regions of interest feature to limit a specific behavior to happen only inside a certain ROI eg every time the mouse is inside the ROI the assigned behavior is always Investigating If not what is this feature used for I couldnt find any information about it on the JAABA website Thank you for your time Hi I would like to use JAABA to assess mouse grooming behavior In our lab we use the open source software Deeplabcut DLC for tracking of mouse body parts and all the input data required by JAABA and prepared by PrepareJAABAData GUI can be extracted using DLC I was wondering how it would be possible to create adequate input for JAABA manually not using the GUI Any suggestions Thanks in advance Yara I already have tracking data and video frames labeled with behaviors Could one use the program by using the inputs of tracking and behaviors rather than labeling the behaviors in the GUI The JAABAPlot window does not resize and can not be moved around when opened on a small screen like a laptop This makes program unusable because the menu bar and experiments loading are not available to user Is it possible to update the params file used by Eyruns Fly Tracker As seen in the FAQ the last version is here I can make a pull request with this change if you want Also could we get a compiled JAABA version with these last modifications Something like To adapt to multiple behavior jab files Right now we only show the jab file names in the list but it might be better to show individual behavior in the list in addition to the jab file names When an old score file being used as perframe feature is removed by the user it gives an error Error using JLabelDatadeleteSingleScoreFeature line Assertion failed Error in JLabelDatasetScoreFeatures line objdeleteSingleScoreFeaturescoreFeaturesDeletedi Error in JLabelchangeScoreFeaturesDone line datasetScoreFeaturesscoreFeaturesFileNameListNew Error in guimainfcn line fevalvarargin Error in JLabel line guimainfcnguiState varargin Error in ChangeScoreFeaturesDialogdoneButtonPressed line JLabelchangeScoreFeaturesDone Error in ChangeScoreFeaturesDialoggeselfdoneButtonPressed line callbackgeselfdoneButtonPressed Error while evaluating uicontrol Callback Need to fix this JAABA is compatible but these two might also need updating Start JAABA b kill JAABA Open window File New project input some stuff for a new proj Hit Done get harderr trace below Attempted to access figpos index out of bounds because numelfigpos Error in JLabelGUIDatasetLayout line selfguiposrightborderrightpanels figpos panellabelbuttonspos panellabelbuttonspos Error in JLabelinitAfterBasicParamsSet line handlesguidatasetLayoutfigureJLabel Error in JLabelnewFileSetupDone line initAfterBasicParamsSetfigureJLabel
