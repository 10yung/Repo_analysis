 Issue Summary The lefthands heat maps which can be read from datumhandHeatMaps is not properly flipped back to the original image Type of Issue Enhancement offering possible extensions pull request etc OpenPose version Latest GitHub code Issue Summary Is there a way to output hand heatmap to some local files by only setting some FLAGS instead of going to the code and manually write output It seems currently the writeheatmaps flag only works for body heatmap Type of Issue Enhancement Hello First of all I want to thank you for this great work I want to train the model on my own data but I do not know which annotation tool I will use can you advise me Thank you OpenPose Output if any Is there a heatmap ground truth dataset for hand How to know your heatmaps are correct or not Type of Issue Enhancement offering possible extensions pull request etc Usually bigger pictures takes longer to process as OpenPose tries to detect people on the entire picture but sometimes its known that a target person will always stay in a specific small area ie a person poledancing and never move out from there for the entire clip ie imagine a x area out of a x picture so it would be faster to crop that area in x pictures and run OpenPose on them but then the JSON aligments wont match with the original x pictures anymore making them unusable would you consider adding a feature that allows to focus only on a smaller area to speed up detection considerably Its SO much faster when I crop the pictures first but I also need the JSON data to align with the originals afterwards I think that would be a really useful feature especially on landscape shots where the person is usually at the center and their left and right have nothing important to detect Hi all I am trying to get the coordinates of joint keypoints which file should I look into and how can I print them out I am running openpose on MacOS CPU only All help are appreciated Thanks in advance Hello your job is great Ive been studying human poses recently Can you tell me the order of the body heatmap I think the actual point order is not consistent with what you provided Finally the key point is LElbow or is LShoulder anyway thank you I am using openpose on computer one with nvidia gtx graphics card and the other with nvidia rtx super with nvidia driver cuda cudnn with nvidia driver cuda cudnn The codes are Exactly the same but only cost G gpu memory otherwise will cost almost G gpu memory Why is there such a difference Can you explain it thanks Im trying to run this on lowresolution images that contain one human The images are about x pix The program doesnt work very well on such lowresolution images The majority of them do not have joints detected well Though heatmaps appear to be somewhat ok I was wondering if someone would have any tips on how to modify the program to perform better on low res images Thanks Heres an example of an image that didnt work Issue Summary error while excute make file Executed Command if any make jnproc Errors if any useruserHPZ G openposemasterbuild make jnproc Performing configure step for openposelib CMake Error The source directory homeroboticsopenposemaster rdpartycaffe does not appear to contain CMakeListstxt Specify help for usage or press the help button on the CMake GUI CMakeFilesopenposelibdirbuildmake recipe for target caffesrcopenposelibstampopenposelibconfigure failed make caffesrcopenposelibstampopenposelibconfigure Error CMakeFilesMakefile recipe for target CMakeFilesopenposelibdirall failed make CMakeFilesopenposelibdirall Error Makefile recipe for target all failed make all Error Type of Issue Compilationinstallation error Screenshot from General configuration ubantu cuda cuDNN If Python API Python version
