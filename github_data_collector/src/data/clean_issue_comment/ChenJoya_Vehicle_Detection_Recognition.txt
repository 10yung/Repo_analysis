Hello I wonder where does cifar NetRCNNmat come from Is it a trained RCNN car Hi I have been trying to test the program is there any chance of changing the language for GUI CPU GUI default MATLAB GPU There is a problem with the CUDA driver or with this GPU device Be sure that you have a supported GPU and that the latest driver is installed parallelinternalgpuisAnyDeviceSelected parallelgpuGPUDeviceisAvailable line if parallelinternalgpuisAnyDeviceSelected nnetinternalcnngpuisGPUCompatible line ifcanUsePCT parallelgpuGPUDeviceisAvailable trainNetwork line nnetinternalcnngpuisGPUCompatibletrue The CUDA driver could not be loaded The library name used was nvcudadll The error was CPU Can you write a step by step guide to test this b gt gt shibie rcnnObjectDetectordetect line bboxes boxScores thisRegionProposalFcnIroi shibie gtpictureCallback line bboxes detectcifar NetRCNNcifar NetRCNN frame guimainfcn line fevalvarargin shibie line guimainfcnguiState varargin matlabgraphicsinternalfigfileFigFileread gthObjecteventdatashibiepictureCallbackhObjecteventdataguidatahObject UIControl Callback Hello this project is very interesting and I want to try it myself But after I clone it on my PC and run I failed I download the three file mentioned in README carsmetamat cifar NetRCNNmat AlexNetNewmat and put them in the model folder but afterI load picture matlabs console give me some message like this I am new to this area and know little about it I dont know whether there are anything I missed to build the environment Or some other operations Would you mind giving me some help plz Sorry to disturb and thank you for answering me
