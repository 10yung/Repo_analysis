the following information Revive SteamVR Hello Ive recently installed revive and all games seem to work fine with the exception of contractors Once the game is loaded through the revive launcher within steam VR it gives a Fatal Error with a black screen Oculus Quest Oculus Link Defector not working on Lenovo Explorer I get the following message when I try to play Rendering to your HMD please put on your rift headset and nothing shows on the headset Describe the bug The native desktop gameplay window for The Climb has multiple black outs occur during gameplay Some are very fast but others such as when landing a jump last multiple seconds It does not appear to be caused by the obstructed view prompt in game Inside the Index HMD the game has no blackouts I wonder if it has to do with the presentation of the SteamVR chaperone system like if it appears AT ALL Or the other possibility is if it is caused by Motion Smoothing or other steamvr video improvements It is really hard for me to test this but I have some recorded footage showing the blackouts Ill do another quick test to see if I activate the chaperone if it blacks out the screen But I obviously cant record that for you I did confirm the blackout displays on my monitor at the time of recording I recorded the content using OBS in multiple ways and it also made no difference One test the issue occurred when OBS was not recording I also confirmed that the onscreen presence of the chaperone boundary is not the cause gameplay showing blackout at sec To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Play The Climb Randomly experience blackouts on the default desktop gameplay window I am recording it via OBS other games do not seem to have this issue like beatsaberSteamVR for example Expected behavior I expect the window to show the exact same as what I see in game Environment please complete the following information App The Climb OS Win Headset Index Versions please complete the following information Revive latest

To Reproduce It will happen every time regardless of if I launch it from in the headset or the desktop using the Revive menu Expected behavior Im not really sure what this means or how it differs from
