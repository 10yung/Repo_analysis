Hello I have variable length barcode and in my case I trimmed all my sequences to the maximum length from my longest barcode so I have for smallest barcoded sequences a lost of a few true biological sequences at the beginning and an alignment of trimmed sequences will look like this AAAGTTATCGGC for longest barcoded sequence AGTTATCGGC ATCGGC for the shortest barcoded sequence From version DADA allowed variable length amplicon for the dada aligner to deal with ITS amplicons NEWS and the collapseNomismatch to merge pair with variable length BUT what about learnErrors Does it takes into account the variable lengthstart Like performing an alignment of the sub sampled sequences before the error learning This would begin the error learning score at position for the shortest barcoded sequence instead of a position from my above example To make it short can a variable start of amplicon sequence compromise learn Errors or other subsequent functions Thanks in advance R mi Probably derived from iBOL Ideal would be to work out a solution like we did for UNITE where one of the official release files on their end can be sniffed and parsed as is wo additional reformatting but not sure if that is possible here Hi Benjamin I have encountered a problem that has been bothering me for days I am using DADA to deal with some SSU data sequenced with Miseq PE after Sample inference I have dozens of sequence variants per sample meet my expectations but after theMerge paired reads and Construct sequence table the ASVs number increased to thousands and tens of thousands highly out of my expectations I have some experience in analyzing S and ITS data using DADA but I cannot figure out what is wrong with my process please help me Package version Data pairedend sequencing data of SSU Expected ASVs Note nonoverlaping reads using mergePairs justConcatenate TRUE dadaFs dadaFs dadaRs dadaRs dimseqtab dimseqtab All the best wishes Wei Fu Hi I encountered this problem with the derepFastq command Error in addbin Calloc could not allocate memory of bytes No problems with the forward reads only with the Reverse ones Thanks in advance for the reply May be related to and Currently on dada version First observed when trying to use the UNITE database but can also replicate using the standard RDP trainset rdptrainset fagz I tried to update RcppParallel using BiocManager on version which appears to be downstream of the fix described in the previous issues Output from sessionInfo sessionInfo R version Platform x pclinuxgnu bit Running under Ubuntu LTS Matrix products

pipeline for analyzing data from an experiment using microbial cells carrying a plasmid with a mer barcode that helps us distinguish cell lineages or strains Were using Illumina to sequence the barcode and some of the surrounding plasmid sequence and using the barcode sequences rather than genomic DNA to track community dynamics Since our sequence data include a sizeable segment of the plasmid backbone which is a known invariant sequence it seems that we should be able to use the sequence data covering the backbone segment to calculate error rates directly rather than using the dada algorithm to estimate them and then apply those error rates in doing sample inference on the barcode segments Does that make sense Would it give us any improvement in terms of either accuracy or efficiency If so can you recommend a way of doing it within the dada package or should we plan on writing a new script of my own to generate an error rates matrix Hello I am new in this field and having trouble in analysing my data Can anyone please suggest me what exactly is wrong in creating tree As m getting this error after th days fitGTR optimpmlfitGTR modelGTR optInvTRUE optGammaTRUE rearrangement stochastic control pmlcontroltrace Error in optimpar lbf fn fn gr NULL method NelderMead function cannot be evaluated at initial parameters In addition There were warnings use warnings to see them warnings Warning messages In optimizef fn interval c lower NAInf replaced by maximum positive value In optimizef fn interval c lower NAInf replaced by maximum positive value Please suggest Silva was just released Do you plan to put it centrally on Or should users generate the dada versions on their own Hi Were running a set of human fecal samples through DADA Its a sequencing run on a MiSeq V region used While the quality profiles we get from the MiSeq look ok the ones from DADA are a bit worrysome Here the MiSeq F R Here the DADA for a couple of samples FWD And REV Any idea why they look so bad We can still use them as the FWD reads are very good and we dont need much more from the REV but still would be good to know why they look like this Some additional information on the sequencing run Were using V chemistry kits density was with over PhiX and Q r Q r Thanks Hi I am new to dada I have demultiplexed sequence contain samples I am not able to adapt the illumina workflow so any one can send the script It would be timely help and very helpful Please help me in this issue Thank you for your valuable time
