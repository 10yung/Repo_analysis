It is import to put Notification component into your Layout component otherwise reactadmin will not deal OPTIMISTIC logic it will block in STARTOPTIMISTICMODE redux status so following actions will be lost Layout Notification Layout Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe It is very hard to write proper browser tests for react admin based applications since most of the elements have no proper selectors Describe the solution youd like A solution would be to have some attribute like datajs or datatest on the elements that atleast give some context For example the resource menu items could have datajsresourcemenuitemresourceid and buttons like the save form button to have datajsresourcesubmitbuttonresourceid Fix The useGetMatchingReference hook has an unused property filter So I just remove it Todo x Remove the unused prop x Fix tests if broken I just stumble across the following in current master branch useGetMatchingReferenceSelector filter prop is defined but not being used inside the hook I believe it could affect the initial value of useReferenceInputController filter prop js const useGetMatchingReferenceSelector referenceSource filter Defined but not used reference resource source id const getMatchingReferences useCallback state const referenceResource getReferenceResourcestate reference const possibleValues getPossibleReferenceValuesstate referenceSource resource source return getPossibleReferencesreferenceResource possibleValues id referenceSource reference resource source id return useSelectorgetMatchingReferences Please do not submit support requests or How to questions here For that go to Stack Overflow What you were expecting Describe what the behavior would be without the bug When submit form to update data which will use useMutation then through DataProvider Data in resources key of redux can be changed successfully But it do not update data inside customQuery What happened instead Describe how the bug manifests Should synchronize data inside two key or reload Custom Query Steps to reproduce Please explain the steps required to duplicate the issue especially if you are able to provide a sample application Trace in redux devtools Environment Reactadmin version V Last version that did not exhibit the issue if applicable React version Browser Stack trace in case of a JS error Greetings all First of all I wanted to thank you for reactadmin About problem I faced with moment when filter disappears from Filter panel after clearing the value after returning to the pagerefresh page What you were expecting displayedFilters will contain information about current filter What happened instead displayedFilters is empty Steps to reproduce How it looks you can check in RA example Open Catalog Posters Add filters Max width Set some value eg url will looks like this Refresh pageor open any tile from grid and press back button Select your value from step and remove not cross button Filter disappears Related code In my project I have Author filter When I add this filter from list Add filter I got this displayedFilters authorId true filterValues Its correct I select some Author and now props look like displayedFilters authorId true filterValues authorId Array It looks correct too But if I refresh page or open view page and return back I have this props displayedFilters filterValues authorId Array And because of displayedFilters is empty when I remove value filter is disappears Because of this the user has trouble when they just want to delete the current value and enter another to select a different author Environment Reactadmin version also tested on React version Browser Chrome Version Safari What you were expecting I was expecting to see a login page or a the last page I had signed into before upgrading from to What happened instead The localhost launches a browser window and just iterates through all the routes In firefox it asks to stop or wait In chorme it just never ends Steps to reproduce Upgrade from to I can get you access to my private repo but not sure what else I can do Cant create a sandbox One of the things I found was the issue showed up on staging after I did npm install production Once I did that on my local machine it started doing the same thing But after that when I deleted my nodemodule folder the issue was still there The issue disappeared when I downgraded from to Environment Reactadmin version Last version that did not exhibit the issue if applicable React version BrowserFirefoxChrome Stack trace in case of a JS error This could be a good start to fix Object object issue on SimpleFormIterator I was able to reproduce and fix the issue if you have a plain array such as tag tag tag I didnt edited docs but the idea is if you dont specify a source param in the TextInput and its just input its a plain string array otherwise its an object you could add more than just input or just name property as you wish on source To solve it I use the loadercontainer css class from the demo jsx Admin loading Loading classNameloadercontainer Sandbox Note You have to enlarge the sandbox frame in order to see it Screenshot of mystifyingdiraclo m
