Hi Samuel when will there be a new gem with the included support for messageslimit COUNT option Thanks it came at the right time Use GitHub pages to serve mailcatcherme Also automate version updates on the website Dont crash whole app on UTF errors Fixes Fixes Fixes Fixes Fixes Fixes Fixes Fixes Fixes Fixes Fixes Hi plain text version should be encapsulated with pre tag in order do display tabs Is there a way to limit the mailbox size and drop old emails I would like to prevent mailcatcher to consume all available disk space It would be extremely useful if MailCatcher kept the browser synchronized with latest mail thats been received Is there any way to do this If not please consider it a request for a new optionaction to always show latest Then you can just keep the page open and dont have to interact with it to preview changes This is my first shot at adding an option to change the MailCatcher title to be able to see the difference between multiple mailcatcher instances I couldnt decide if it only should be an addition that it should be able to replace the whole title In the end I settled for an addition as it keeps the branding in place See feature Please tell me if this is a valid fix for the issue or that it needs to be done differently Hi On a plain text mail Plain Text tab displays HTML On a HTML mail Plain Text tab displays HTML and HTML tab displays plain text This is just weird and should be easy to fix I guess smiley TODO You should provide stepbystep installation instructions since problems seem to be quite common It took me some trialanderror to finally get it running I added a badge of Travis CI So that the result of Travis CI can be known from README The branch of the target is master
