I ask because I cant find function prototypes in libskiaso which are defined in includech Description When a class is derived from SKGLView UI elements on top of that element are not shown in XF WPF

few SystemDrawing types Error A reference to the type SystemDrawingPointF in assembly XamarinMac was found but the type could not be found in the assembly including for Point Size SizeF Rectangle RectangleF This is with Visual Studio Mac build img width altScreenshot at PM src These types seem to coincide with this type forwarding in xamarinmacios According to this Available Assemblies doc SystemDrawing is not supportedfor XamarinMac Modern But it seems that there are extension methods in SkiaSharpViewsMac that use SystemDrawing classes The preprocessor directives wrapping the SystemDrawing extension methods indicate that they will be included for Mac if WINDOWSUWP TIZEN However a similar project in C seems to work fine Could this be due to something that the F project system does differently for the assemblies or canshould these SystemDrawing extensions in SkiaSharp not be necessary for Mac Modern target since they arent supported Here is a repo containing both C and F projects which are identical in function and does not use any SystemDrawing types The F project will not even build due to the above errors Any suggestions for how I can get around this issue if it cant be fixed preferably without having to include the SystemDrawing alternative mentioned in the Available Assemblies doc above since I dont really need it Im not that familiar with the more advanced assemblies and project build systems in the NET ecosystem so apologies in advance if I misunderstood something Description Skia sharp measures wrong Width value while measuring Arabic Text
