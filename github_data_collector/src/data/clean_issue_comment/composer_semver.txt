Implementation for A constraint should provide a way to retrieve its lower and upper boundaries For example should return as the lower boundary and as the upper boundary The exact number of digits and number of version digits needs to match what Composer uses Need to review how suffixes like dev or pl would need to be treated here Instead of directly matching a constraint implement functions on the constraints to generate code which verifies if a particular version number matches the constraint In particular the multi constraint should optimize the expression by checking only the minimally necessary boundaries on a conjunctive constraint This is useful to generate code in composer install which later gets verified at runtime and needs to be very fast Needs documentation Considering this library is a wee bit larger than composerspdxlicenses composerspdxlicenses I reckon it deserves proper documentation Eg not just some basic usage description in the README Any suggestions feedback
