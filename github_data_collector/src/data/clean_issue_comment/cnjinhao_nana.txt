mingw g and possibly in other versions too it is related in a way or another to these vague reports Calling formicon leads there and in the debugger it looks like the copy constructor of stdlocale is called on some rubbish on the stack despite the binary mode being specified where locale wouldnt be used Might be related to some namemangling ABI changes but as turning off optimizations is a quick fix I did not look into it further The bottom line is it is not an issue in nana at all However what do you think should we document this behaviour besides this issue in a comment somewhere in the

cdf ba d da f c e d f calling graphicsgradualrectangle results in a rectangle that is pixel wider than the given width For example this rect nanarectangle r will result in the area to be filled horizontally and vertically From a quick look at sourcepaintgraphicscpp I see that XDrawLine gets invoked with goodrctright The documentation of XDrawLine says draw a line between the specified set of points x y and x y which to me sounds like the coordinates are inclusive on both ends of the line Conversely rectright is usually exclusive so that right left width which is consistent with nanas behaviour Its a bit confusing but take the example of a pixel wide rect which would be given as left right right left width Connecting pixels to actually means lighting the pixel at column and the pixel at column thus pixels which results in the bug Im describing This does not work stdvectornanainputboxinteger items itemsemplacebacknanainputboxinteger foo As no move constructor is available for the nana fundamental types and all of these contain stduniqueptrimplement impl
