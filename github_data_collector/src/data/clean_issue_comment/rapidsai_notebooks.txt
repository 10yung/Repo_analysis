Add SVR example to the svmdemo notebook JohnZed Currently SVC and SVR are in a single notebook let me know if you prefer to have the SVR example in a separate notebook Describe the bug Hi While looking for MultiNode MultiGPU examples I have noticed that KMeans MultiNode MultiGPU notebook is in reality a SingleNode MultiGPU example It makes use of LocalCudaCluster which if I am not wrong only works on a single machine with multiple GPUs I think it would be wellworth to Rename notebook file name from kmeansmnmgdemoipynb to kmeanssnmgdemoipynb Change the description in the notebook stating it is a SingleNode Multi GPU example In the future add a MultiNode MultiGPU example The notebook I am referring to Finally please let me mention that the link to this notebook at READMEmd file is wrong Hope it helps Miguel Hotfix for SSSP copy of working version in branch Thank you for contributing to RAPIDS Notebooks Here are some guidelines to help the review process go smoothly Please write a description in this text box of the changes that are being made Please ensure that you have written units tests for the changes madefeatures added If you are closing an issue please use one of the automatic closing words as noted here If your pull request is not ready for review but you want to make use of the continuous integration testing facilities please label it with WIP If your pull request is ready to be reviewed without requiring additional work on top of it then remove the WIP label if present and replace it with REVIEW If assistance is required to complete the functionality for example when the CC code of a feature is complete but Python bindings are still required then add the label HELPREQ so that others can triage and assist The additional changes then can be implemented on top of the same PR If the assistance is done by members of the rapidsAI team then no additional actions are required by the creator of the original PR for this otherwise the original author of the PR needs to give permission to the persons assisting to commit to their personal fork of the project If that doesnt happen then a new PR based on the code of the original PR can be opened by the person assisting which then will be the PR that will be merged Once all work has been done and review has taken place please do not add features or make changes out of the scope of those requested by the reviewer doing this just add delays as already reviewed code ends up having to be rereviewedit is hard to tell what is new etc Further please do not rebase your branch on masterforce pushrewrite history doing any of these causes the context of any comments made by reviewers to be lost If conflicts occur against master they should be resolved by merging master into the branch used for making the pull request Many thanks in advance for your cooperation Automerge triggered by push to branch that creates a PR to keep branch uptodate If this PR is unable to be immediately merged due to conflicts it will remain open for the team to manually merge adding new notebook that uses cugraph and cuspatial to analyze This notebook quickly goes over using cuGraphs Pagerank BFS and Louvain as well as cuspatials haversine distance wgets is for review will be removed if the data used is approved for reuse otherwise it will go to notebookscontrib and cuXfilter will be added readme is coming soon if approved Thank you for contributing to RAPIDS Notebooks Here are some guidelines to help the review process go smoothly Please write a description in this text box of the changes

for your cooperation This seems to be missing from the cuml demo notebooks cuML has been building out the sklearnmetrics API on GPUs It would be nice to see a single demo notebook that could show off these metrics side by side with sklearn So far we have accuracyscore adjustedrandscore r score We are adding more each release We need a demo notebook for random projection This should be a simple demo Description says it all This would make it easier for users to understand the notebooks
