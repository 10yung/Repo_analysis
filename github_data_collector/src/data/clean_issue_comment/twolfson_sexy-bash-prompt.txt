Sometimes tasks can take a while to run it would be great to get a readout of how long a task took to run Ive looked this up previously and I believe its possible in bash via traps We should probably only show the timer when the task takes over seconds maybe make this a configurable setting if someone requests it bash todd at Euclid in githubsexybashprompt on master time cat C real m s user m s sys m s todd at Euclid in githubsexybashprompt on master time cat C real m s user m s sys m s todd at Euclid in githubsexybashprompt on master s In we will work out how to support optin switches for extension Exit code reporting is planned For now we can discuss here what it should look like Ive seen this feature in a few different shell prompts over the years There are different ways of doing it A couple things we could try off the top A special STATUSSUCCESS and STATUSFAILED color that modifies an existing token like the prompt character The same colors that modify a new token also userconfigurable As discovered during research for the remaining in progress actions git am and git rebase can walk through multiple commits During each pause there are files that list out the current step and the total amount of commits eg step total Should we display this information inside of the rebase am notice bash todd at Euclid in githubsexybashprompt on devaddremaininginprogress rebase cc rpdelaney We wrote a installation test script Unfortunately Travis CI hangs while running it Look into why this is and how to fix it This would be great for testing multiple environments eg bashrc autoinvoked bashprofile update required bashlogin exists
