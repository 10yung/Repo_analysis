 Just reviewed a couple of my PRs on various open source problems most of which didnt get any commentattention from the project maintainers This made me think about Chaosbot again and I think that many OS projects can really benefit from giving contributers some more influence over merging PRsmanaging issues etc We already had a nice thing going on what if we try to move it towards a SaaS solution aimed at helping out OS projects on Github maybe even publishing it at the GH marketplace if were successful Wed need to have a good functional design first and this project should then really aim at creating a finishedusable product instead of having more of a focus on being an experiment Just a thought maybe with some combined development time we can actually make something useful andrewda xyproto rhengles PlasmaPower eukaryote rudehn MUCHZER markim philr hongaar md Smittyvb Swizz Redmega mpnordland Heres an idea since it seems that chaosbot has completely fizzled out I propose we make an Ethereum contract chaosbot with the ability to update itself Its easy to implement using Is there any backup of the code that was uploaded first I would like to have the original ChaosBot on my private git server Hi I have tried to see this project a few times but I always get a Have I been unlucky or is this expected and I should just clone and try to run it locally thanks Now that Chaosbot V is dead I thought I would upload a Gource animation Here is the link Dedicated to PlasmaPower Im not experienced in nodejs so I was hoping to learn from some of you Any nodejs guys want to create a new repo and put down some scaffolding Currently members of the org have permissions to deleteedit stuff but not to block users Is this what we want Im creating this issue mostly to get discussion away from Since I dont think this is important Ill be unsubscribing from this thread so if you need me please mention me yay nay If we go to a full docker deployment I guess it doesnt matter too much either way
