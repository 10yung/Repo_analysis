These are required deps and versions sh natal init TestApp interface omnext Creating TestApp Creating Leiningen project Updating Leiningen project Creating React Native skeleton node v v npm v lein v Leiningen on Java Java HotSpotTM Bit Server VM reactnative v pod version watchman version Is this by design Ideally Id like to be able to make a change in any namespace and have it hot reloaded in my simulator Is that possible i tried following similar steps to my wiki entry for emacscider but i wasnt able to succeed i can connect but I cant eval the entire corecljs file without error does anyone have experience trying this Ill keep tinkering and report back I was changing source to cause the recompiles below The problem is right near the end when I did cljsquit orionDesktop mfikes cd foobar

platformiOS SimulatorOSlatestidC F C C C AF BF FC A test Ive been doing little spike projects to get the feel of different features and components Theres a gotcha when you do this Im noting here in case it helps someone else I expect to be able to switch between two natal based projects by stopping the Simulator switching to different directory and running natal launch natal repl but this leads to an Invariant Violation Application XX has not been registered when opening second project The solution seems to be to close the React Packager terminal window This might well not be a natal issue but perhaps it is possible to ensure projects dont overlap from React Packagers perspective love your work If I press CtrlCmdZ and enable Chrome Debugging I get the default Welcome to React Native page in the simulator and it seems I am not running the Omdriven app anymore Shouldnt it be possible to use the Chrome Debugger exactly as I do in regular Om apps with source mapping and everything Really excited about Natal Im wondering if perhaps the versioning is out of sync because I see the name of my app flash briefly then briefly the instructions from indexiojs and then a white screen Just opening this up for now in case there might be an obvious cause Ill keep debugging in the meantime
