OSLib Scala SBT Ive been using the following way of spawning a child process and I see intermittent errors The application handles these errors and keeps running osproccommandLinecalltimeout Im also trying out ZeroTurnarouns ztexec where things seem to be consistently working I wanna peek the how many bytes in OutputStream that I can read in case of blocked by process However I found when I use substdoutavailable it always returns seems available didnt implemented by osOutputStream nor javalangProcessPipeInputStream Thus there might be no way to implement a nonblock reading by oslib
