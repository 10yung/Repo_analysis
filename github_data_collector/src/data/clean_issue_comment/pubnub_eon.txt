I would like to suggest if you can add a map marker removal feature so that a marker can be removed from the map Doing it using mapbox functions causes the map not to work anymore Hi Just cloned the project and tried to go through bower etc and I get this big warning that bower is about to stop working any minute now Is this some red herring or does the code really need a rescue Thanks I made a few changes to the eonjs file and the v eonjs files that allow me to use the ghpages branch as a cdn for examples on JSfiddle At example here If I use instead of It doesnt work because the default version always tries to use http Hi there Any plans to move Project EON to use Any plans to move to Mapbox GL JS Thanks Michael
