Related to issue from myexploit All shells caught from win test machine from powershell generated by unicorn fail to load the stdapi extension and are nonresponsive If youd like I can upload the win test vm so you can duplicate the issue This is not a issue but a request Could you guys create a function for unicorn to take custom ps payloads and generate them into hta payloads This would be great thanks
