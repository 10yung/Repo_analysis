This project is awesome for writing new text but Id like to be able to edit text thats already present Right now I just copypaste it into Emacs when invoking emacsanywhere but I was wondering if this was possible to get automated curl fsSL bash dependency check passed emacsclient dependency check passed git Installing Emacs Anywhere Cloning into Usersjohnemacsanywhere remote Enumerating objects

config dotfiles GNU Emacs Org mode version emacsd atomicchrome version atomicchrome usepackage Issue Emacs Anywhere works very well in all kinds of text fields except for the the editor I tested on Google Chrome using both atomicchrome and ghosttext The extensions are able to connect with Emacs but only part of the text in the field becomes available and my edits are not reflected on Emacs are not reflected in the browser This would make it possible to just add it to path from anywhere and it would even be possible to set up with straightel and usepackage This kind of makes sense as it is strictly an emacsrelated plugin so it should be configurable inside emacsd It wouldnt be the first time that nonelisp stuff went into an Emacs package eg tide and its tsserver directory Hi again been using EA for months on linux and lovin it Now at work have to use OSX and it works well only issue is that emacs is always on space and chrome on space when i launch EA it takes me automatically to space where EA opens Anyway to define the EA frame to open on the current space where it was launched from thx Z Id like to know why there is no support for OpenBSD Is there any tool been used that ties it to Linux and GNULinux distributions What would be needed to add support to OpenBSD and while Im at it the other BSDs too On invoking the shortcut I receive an error popup reporting The action Run Shell Script encountered an error The popup has the options OK dismissing the poup and Show Workflow which opens UsersreeLibraryServices showing Emacs Anywhereworkflow If I try to open it and run it in Automator I get an error popup showing The action Run Shell Script encountered an error execution error System Events got an error osascript is not allowed assistive access execution error System Events got an error osascript is not allowed assistive access emacsclient could not get terminal name emacsclient error executing alternate editor With only an OK button After some googling I found that the osascript error had been experienced by people in other contexts In particular I reviewed this stack overflow issue Following that I tried giving the Emacs Anywhereworkflow file a checkmark in Security Privacy Allow the apps below to control your computer It didnt make any difference Hello I would like to recommend a keystroke to update the content of the original window while still editing This is useful where the interaction with the text is much longer ie when one doesnt just jump into the editor and out But even here when writing this issue text Id like to open it in emacs change to Markdown mode type some text call some function to update the issue text check the Markdown preview then back to writing mode continue editing in emacs close the frame done In particular I was thinking of this when using Shadertoy There the text input is in a Codemirror enabled area Attempting to paste into Firefox Developer Edition emacsanywhere would close the frame and paste its contents into whatever buffer was open in the main emacs instance Renaming to Firefox fixed the issue for me Mac OSX High Sierra Hi zachcurry I have read on this wonderful package on Reddit and today I finally had time to try it out I am using i as window manager and Ubuntu and will try to explain what happens when I use Emacs Anywhere Basically the emacs window opens fine and I can write but on frame close i gets stuck for something that it seems like seconds without being able to to keypress anything except that canonical CtrlAltF for terminals After that time everything goes back to normal No paste happens Let me know if I can try something else on my side for debugging Thank you very much again
