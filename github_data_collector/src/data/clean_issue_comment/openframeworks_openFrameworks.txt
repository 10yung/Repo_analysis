When trying to use ofGstVideoPlayer and calling setFrameByFrametrue on it I get a wrongly decoded image See below img width altScreen Shot at src And when I do not call setFrameByFrametrue I get the movie decoded properly as seen in the following image img width altScreen Shot at src I dont have any previous experience with GStreamer and it seems massive Out of looking at some of its examples and the ofGstVideoPlayers code I found out that the code in the update function was being done wrong so I replaced with some of the code used in GstFlowReturn ofGstVideoUtilsprocesssamplesharedptrGstSample sample which is the function that properly decoded the movie when not using the frame by frame feature Copying and pasting code is a super bad idea and a function should be used instead on both instances but as I do not know if what I changed is correct from the GStreamer point of view I opted for leaving it like this for know As well I am not sure how this change would affect other platforms ofOpenALSoundPlayerplay calls glGetError so if I run it in a thread it crashes Is there a reason this is there or can I make a pull request removing it Ive made a post on the forum but im reporting here too because i think its a bug With Raspberry Pi buster when i create a TCPServer listening for incoming connections when a client connect the app slow down a lot from FPS to You can test this behaviour with the TCPServer example Just run it and connect even from the same machine with nc or maybe not tested with the companion example TCPClient So its not a network issue Same app in other linux distros runs fine As reported year ago in the forum ofLog messages do not show up in debugging console I have the same issue on win vs of downloadpage I have set ofSetLogLevelOFLOGVERBOSE Is this known or resolved see On Windows using Microsoft Visual Studio Community and OF nightly code from ofv androidnightlytargz This also happens using OF on

the handler yet being called And trying to hook it up there to the ofAppurlResponse handler well I failed to find a syntax to do that it doesnt seem like the right way to do that anyway and there seems to be another bug with registering that For a minimal example to reproduce this you can add the following code to say the ofAppkeyReleased handler of a clean ofApp so you can test it by pressing a key eg void ofAppkeyReleasedint key ofURLFileLoader UFL ofHttpRequest request requesturl requestbody content requestsaveTo false requestcontentType applicationxwwwformurlencoded requestmethod
