Hello I have a project and I need to use the Short Term Fourier Transform directly but I noticed that despite being the documentation I cannot use it Would it be possible to export the function so that it could be used Or is there another way to access it that Im not seeing Thanks As READMEmd says all the offset data has been normalized to have a standard deviation of on the training set after simplifying the strokes Thus each dataclass has its own scalefactors to scale down and these numbers are usually between to depending on the dataset These scale factors are stored into modelinfoscalefactor I thought the scalefactor should be the std value of all the offset data in a class However checking the the std value of the birdfullnpz dataset and the scalefactor in birdgenjson I found they are different vs How can I calculate the correct scalefactor I can use web workers in the following code simplehtml html html langen body script new Workersimplejs script body html simplejs js importScripts importScripts importScripts const musicvae new musicvaeMusicVAE magentadatajscheckpointsmusicvaetrio bar musicvaeinitialize Which works properly But if I add the following line the code breaks js importScripts With this error Uncaught null Script error I dont have more information Ill try to debug the gansynthjs code if I have time PS ES modules dont work because of This browser does not support Tonejs It would be useful to be able to supply an audio version of a NoteSequence either prerendered using better quality sound fonts or a recording to which the NoteSequence is aligned for example to showcase a transcription algorithm and play it while visualizing the NoteSequence I can imagine an AudioPlayer which would play the audio using Tonejs and call the run callback in sync An interesting option would also be to bind the visualization to an audio element which would allow the user to easily control the playback and have the visualization updated in real time The README file is translated in Korean for better development by Korean developers midiconvert used by Magentajs seems to consider both channel and as drums as per General MIDI so when loading a MIDI file with urlToNoteSequence notes in channel will have isDrum true This is inconsistent with the behavior of Magenta where only channel is loaded as drums as per General MIDI Among other things this means that MIDI files created with Magenta and containing more than nondrum tracks will be loaded incorrectly in Magentajs SoundFontPlayer sometimes continues the playback for a very short time invoking the run callback after the stop method has been called This typically happens when there is a rapid sequence of notes This can cause problems for example when using the player together with a Visualizer and trying to clear it or display something else on the same canvas immediately after calling stop In this case the old NoteSequence will overwrite the new content of the canvas I found that if you reduce the tempo in the loop cuts out early I believe it has something to do with the callback length being defined using totalTime before the transport begins Hi I was trying to use the BodyPix model with Magenta but the tfjs version required is Is it possible to update it Thanks
