changing the Pinax docs theme perhaps as part of our upcoming release The docs have had the same look for a while An example of a possible theme is Sphinx Alabaster I think it is now a default Sphinx theme Imo its a nice clean modern look Let me know what you think Authors files could be standardized More than one format is used Also consider adding a script to automate addition of authors to the file See pip repo as an example With the new LTS release of Django can Pinax drop support of Django x and Python x In fact Django will stop supporting at the end of April Thats year to transition over all Pinax projects Ive noticed that you have setup your travisyml file to only check for build runtime errors but you can also deploy the site if the build succeeds Just change the script section to yaml beforedeploy mkdocs build verbose clean strict And add a deploy section yaml deploy provider pages skipcleanup true githubtoken githubtoken localdir site on branch master Also after adding a no sudo and bumping the python version your travisyml file will look like this yaml sudo false language python python install pip install mkdocs beforedeploy mkdocs build verbose clean strict deploy provider pages skipcleanup true githubtoken githubtoken localdir site on branch master Now follow these steps for setting the githubtoken variable in Travis CI Go to the settings of your account Click on Developer settings Click on Personal access tokens Click Generate new token You may need to enter your Github password at this point Name the token something under Token description it doesnt matter Enable the publicrepo scopepermission Click Generate token at the bottom of the page Go to the settings of the target Travis CI repository Create an environmental variable with the following settings name githubtoken value Your Token Display value in build log No Press add Thats it For more help read my stackoverflow Q A or just ask below Update to reflect the move to gulp Link to the static build process documentation in Add howtos Setting up build process dependencies for the first time Customizing the theme Customizing JavaScript in staticsrcjssitejs where to go to edit LESS and how to rebuild CSS where to go to edit footer how to change the site name in the top left how to change the top left to be a logo how to add left nav bar The quick start doesnt even mention anything about npm install While it may not be the place for showing customization of the starter project it would be good to get people up and running with a single build of the static files We have had pinaxthemebootstrap for quite sometime now only recently separating out the vendored statics These leaves a few bits and pieces but mostly just a set of templates mostly using bootstrap class names Id like to propose we start a pinaxtheme project that does the following full semantic markup templates for most if not all pinax apps that require templates release pinaxthemebootstrap packages on that contain the LESSSASS that maps our semantic markup to bootstrap rules the pinaxthemebootstrap npmjs package should also contain any specific rules and js that are now shipped as part of the Python pinaxthemebootstrap package provide more than one basehtml template so as to ship with alternate layout options This should make it easyier to create npmjs packages for Bootstrap Foundation and any other framework In addition we can layer in additional npmjs themes for adding more style on top of default style from the framework
