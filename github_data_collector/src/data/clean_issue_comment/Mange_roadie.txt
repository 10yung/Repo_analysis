Hi we have situation that our outgoing mails contains some part of HTML page which contains a link to stylesheets in query string form html link relstylesheet hrefdebuggeryes ampcmdresource ampfstylecss typetextcss Roadie raise error TypeError no implicit conversion of nil into String in buildfilepath method I change this method to prevent this exception findstylesheet will raise CssNotFound when no real CSS file exist in href A proposal PR to make roadie compatible with frozen string literals Since Ruby it is possible to make the string literals frozen by default There are rumors that ruby will have this option on by default Inspired by Run into this issue with b char Example RoadieDocumentnew if mso hello bworld endif transform Output DOCTYPE html n htmlheadmeta httpequiv ContentType content texthtml charsetUTF headbodypworldpbodyhtml n The comments have been stripped away and all of the string before b is missing This does not happen if the char is not in a comment This gem is now entering passive maintenance mode I will not be actively maintaining it anymore What exactly does this mean I will not guarantee any responses on issues or PRs I will probably respond but I cannot guarantee when I probably wont add or change anything without prompting Security issues will be fixed Please send me an email as per the instructions in the README Major bugs will be prioritized Minor bugs will probably only be dealt with if a PR is opened No feature request will be honored unless it comes in the form of a PR and its not even guaranteed then It is okay to ping me on issues and ask for updates Dont bother doing it after just a few days though Why Maintaining open source software requires energy and a wantpassion Ive not been using this project myself for years and I mainly work in other things than Rails at this point That means Im far removed from this project and see no personal gain in maintaining the energy to keep this going At work I cannot maintain this project At home Id rather spend time with my children and on projects that Im currently passionate about Im still pretty proud of the project and I dont want to see it gone so I want to keep updating it when needed But on the other hand the feature set is pretty stable and well working now AFAIK so I also dont see the need to pretend to be actively maintaining it Please Prompt me when things break and I will probably fix it I wont guarantee how fast Ill move but Ill try to make the effort sometimes The bigger the issue the more likely it is that Ill do something about it Contributions are welcome like always I love contributions and seeing other people getting value from this project Keep doing it I apologize for not replying quickly bowingman This is opensource You can always fork and maintain that fork yourself if you feel thats warranted Thats how this project started in the first place so I know the feeling smiley How long I dont know Maybe if I started to use this project in my professional life again I could find the time to maintain it despite being boring I cannot guarantee that happening at all so no timeline sadly Can I take over or Can I become a contributor Its not impossible but its not likely I would accept someone I havent worked with IRL or know on a personal level Thats because I want some form of creative control over the direction and I want to maintain the existing code style If I know you Im more likely to know that this will keep working the way I want it to Still as I said its not impossible even if weve never met Show me good PRs bug triaging documentation fixes whatever and youre a candidate if you ask for it Actually a triager would be very welcome someone that can ask followup questions on issues create test cases for the problems and so on That sort of thing That would definitely make it much more likely for me to spring into action just as good a finished PRs would be Probably even more reviewing code takes energy Let me know if you want to help out heart Closing words Thank you for these years I wont be gone but Ill have my back turned Poke me with a soft finger if my attention is needed Thank you for understanding Or if you dont at least thank you for reading Roadie should have some form of reporting system where it can scan an email for bad patterns and tell the user about it Suggestions for warnings Report on invalid URLs Warn about form etc in the email Reporting should be transparent and optional Ideas on implementation Test modules Include them run the assertions on the email This would be better served with another gem right roadiedoctor or something crazy like that Doesnt help with detecting problems in production where dynamic helpers mightve ruined something that would appear okay in test Callback for both enabling and for handling problems Makes it very optional Sadly also a bit of a threshold to climb to enable it See code sample below Store it on Document when enabled Easier to enable and you can report it however you want afterwards Might be more useful for more people since its possible to send all of them in a single message See code sample below ruby
