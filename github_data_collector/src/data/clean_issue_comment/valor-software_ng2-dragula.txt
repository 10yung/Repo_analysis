 Note Please fill out the below IF YOU DO NOT YOUR ISSUE WILL BE CLOSED AUTOMATICALLY REQUIRED Before filing a usage question Change each to x when you have done it x My issue title starts with usage question x I have read the README especially the classic blunders section x I have looked at the demos to see if my use case has obvious examples x I have searched the ng dragula issues including closed issues x I have browsed the issues labeled future reference for problems that have been solved before Use case description required When providing a nested array of data everything is working perfectly However when providing the EXACT SAME data structure via a BehaviorSubject subscription async pipe and drag the items in a particular way it results in the UI duplicating the item however the model remains correct A clear and concise description of what you want to achieve I hope to be able to throw nested data at this template and be able to manipulate it as the user sees fit Can you show a demo or a picture of what you want to achieve Steps to reproduce Visit and click use static data and try dragging an item from one column to another Select the same named exercise however a different one to the one that you dragged back to the original column All should work as expected Then try to perform this using the dynamic data See GIF below for an example of this behaviour

found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems
