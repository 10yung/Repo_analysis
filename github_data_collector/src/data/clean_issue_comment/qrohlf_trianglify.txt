Hi thanks for this nice library I was playing around with it and made this Dockerfile What do you think of it Apparently I somehow managed to publish a by accident from this branch hopefully its working well for everybody but apologies to any users that got bit by any untested functionality Ill do some final testing This means a few things Ill be fasttracking my work on the next release Because the next release will include breaking changes relative to the current on npm this means it will be published under the version release checklist Improved test suite x support the latest version of nodecanvas remove from optionalDependenciessup sup x Default includeNamespace to true for SVG generation x Switch from gulpbrowserify to microbundle x Add two new color functions sparkle shadows Write Changelog Update README Update live docs Update Trianglifyio Merge next branch into master announce release sup sup Im removing nodecanvas from optionalDependencies because the default behavior of npmyarn is to attempt to install all optionalDependencies display any install errors but not fail the full npm install operation if installation of an optionalDependency fails This is proving to be extremely confusing for many users that are consuming the browser version of Trianglify and seeing a bunch of install errors for a totally unnecessary noderelated package when they try to npm install Trianglify working PR TODO Replace gulpbrowserify with microbundle Remove compiled files from repo generate in a prepublish script Update CDNJS definitionlink can relate triangle with its poly vector Motivation post process generated svg with d js for instance This solves part of issue Id want to create an svg background looking like an irregular mesh maybe its possible to achieve without changes of source code compilation is best left to CI There are probably people running into who dont know about the config option and dont find it in the readme It should probably default to true and those who know that none of their use cases for generated SVG content require an xmlns can turn it off This will make it possible to remove the dist folder from source control and also prevent me from having to remember to versionbump the CDNJS link in the README and provide support for it See for an example of issues caused by CDNJS in this case minnonmin version issues The current sanity checks for cellsize are not sufficient it is still possible to create an infinite loop by passing in a string ie instead of for cellsize Oops
