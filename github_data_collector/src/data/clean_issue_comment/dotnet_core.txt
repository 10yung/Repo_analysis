Problem encountered on Operating System windows Is this supposed to be version instead I ran into issues when running the doctor build command After altering this file to I no longer had these issues It specifically says in the myMicroservicecsproj file TargetFrameworknetcoreapp TargetFramework Not sure if this needs corrected or just something with my personal environment Thanks I have an ASPNet Core project that I started it using the Net Core I hosted it on the IIS and windows server and it was working perfectly I upgraded the entire solution to and then after a while And hosted it on the IIS My current server is Windows Server and the IIS version is but when I browse the website address using the web browser it shows the x d error I have installed the version of the Net Core Hosting Bundle on the system and following runtimes are installed with it After lots of tests I found that the problem goes out by installing the version of the Net Core Hosting Bundle This package adds the following runtimes to the system It seems that the MicrosoftAspNetCoreApp is needed or covers the deficiency of the MicrosoftAspNetCoreApp When I ran this code it gt this error malithmalithAspireE G dotnet Usage dotnet options Usage dotnet pathtoapplication Options hhelp Display help info Display NET Core information listsdks Display the installed SDKs listruntimes Display the installed runtimes pathtoapplication The path to an application dll file to execute InstallPackage SystemTextJson Version Issue Title Im having problems with some NET Core versions related to NTFS permissions General Since NET Framework x and Windows Server IIS im using Application Pool Identity as Microsoft recomendation to have a more secure server publishing And this works very well just give the AppPoolId the NTFS Read only permission to its home directory and the sitesystem works great with least permission giving the server more security However if the application executes something or has to write some files i need to give explicit NTFS permission to that folder When i start to work with NET Core im giving the same behavior Application Pool user configured as Application Pool Identity and NTFS home directorys permission with Read Only However recently im having problems with some systems running from NET Core x to x Seems like this is not standard to NET Core framework to run with less privileges and i was shocked to see for example telling to change to LocalSystem to make it work Seems like some libraries are asking more permissions to work After some debug i find that i need to give Traverse permission on home directory of the system to make it work with Read Only because without that Traverse the system tries to load things from C Windows System Inetsrv as LocalPath instead of for example C Inetpub SYSTEMXXXXXXX I tried to find a recomendation of permissions something official to work with NTFS Permissions i didnt find So my suggestion to the NET Core project its that set the any default NET Core appsystem runs with Read Only NTFS permissions and force libraries to work with that Today if you want to put a DLL inside your project you are forced to set NTFS Permission on root folder to Read and Execute potencially insecure as any code injected in your site could be executed remotely I believe this version should be the LTS package Problem encountered on Operating System windows Provide details about the problem you are experiencing Include your operating system version exact error message code sample and anything else that is relevant Release Notes Download Release Notes Download Release Notes Download Blog posts NET Core Please report any issues you find with or either responding to this issue creating a new issue or creating a new issue in one of the following repos aspnetHome for ASPNET Core questions aspnetEntityFrameworkCore for Entity Framework Core questions dotnetcli for CLI tools and questions dotnetcorefx for API issues and questions dotnetcoreclr for runtime issues dotnetcoresetup for installer issues dotnetwinforms for Winfroms issues dotnetwpf for WPF issues Here is a list of issues that we are tracking and working to resolve with the Jan release Well tick them off as each is resolved See any linked issue for progress or resolution details x SUSE Linux package repository broken x not yet available on Linux package repositories x Centos Linux package repository broken on x yum install dotnetsdk fails on Centos x Linux package repositories are temporarily down Debian and RPM packages Problem encountered on Operating System windows Provide details about the problem you are experiencing Include your operating system version exact error message code sample and anything else that is relevant Problem encountered on Operating System windows Provide details about the problem you are experiencing Include your operating system version exact error message code sample and anything else that is relevant
