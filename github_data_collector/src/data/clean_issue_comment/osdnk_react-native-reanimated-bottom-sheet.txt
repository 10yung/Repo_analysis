Thanks for this wonderful library It would be great if we can determine which snap point index were at currently Thanks Hey Is there any possibility to call onCloseEndonCloseStart on a different snapPoint than the last first onearraylength I want that my SearchBar disappears on Opening the BS and reappears when the BS is minimized on any snapPoint other than fully open For example these snapPoints onOpenEnd is called on which is perfect but onCloseEnd should already be called on as well as and Thanks in advance and besides this question I love your Component D Hello I have Simple

Security The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

comes from the props the BottomSheet is already open There is nothing I can do to change it it seems so If true sheet will grows up from bottom to initial snapPoint
