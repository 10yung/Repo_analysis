using serverless with parameter integration lambda the http method is modified to be named method where as without that parameter the http method is named httpMethod This cause the code here to throw

support in apolloserverlambda we me and smschick found PR that was created a while ago and never was updated after abernix had some comments on the PR The main thing that abernix had mentioned was being sure that the file upload process was happening in the right order This PR takes those comments and some of the work from the original PR and hopefully solves the issue Thanks to charleswong for his work on the orig PR Please let me know if theres anything youd like to see Currently all tests are passing which includes single and multiple file uploads node Warning The route option
