At the moment if you want to use a custom controller but otherwise use the HighVoltage internal mechanics you have to turn off routes and unset the homepage due to the way the routes files is coded HighVoltageparentengineroutesdraw do if HighVoltagehomepage get HighVoltagehomepage to redirect root to highvoltagepagesshow id HighVoltagehomepage end if HighVoltageroutes get HighVoltageroutedrawermatchattributes end end We could nest the home page routes under the if HighVoltageroutes logic which is more what I would expect if I disabled the gem routes I think that is a standalone improvement But I would also like to suggest that the home page routes and could be modified to support just using a custom routes drawer to enable full custom controller support One way is to add a new config option controllername or rackendpoint with a default of highvoltagepages which could be inserted in the routes ie root to HighVoltagecontrollernameshow id HighVoltagehomepage and a similar change in the route drawers Alternatively we could modify the current route drawers to use a different get options method signature ie in routes drawer def selfmatchattributes HighVoltagecontentpathid to highvoltagepagesshow as page format false end paired with HighVoltageparentengineroutesdraw do if HighVoltagehomepage get HighVoltagehomepage to redirect root to HighVoltageroutedrawermatchattributes to id HighVoltagehomepage end if HighVoltageroutes getHighVoltageroutedrawermatchattributes end end This is neatly internally consistent but has the problem of backward compatibility Which could be overcome with a little ugly check on the return value type of matchattributes being an array or hash Is it possible to assign some static pages one layout and others a different one while still having them managed through High Voltage
