Forgive me if this has been asked and answered already I couldnt find it in issues It would be great for legibility if we could fetch icons by their class names so textfaplus instead of text xf They do exactly this at imgplaceholdercom This code use image dimensions and Appdefaultsscale which is not configurable for fontSize computing Hence font size could not be lesser then some computed value It would be great to set any font size So now when I want to have a wide image think thumbnail I have to calculate the height manually I have to get the width of the actual rendered image and then put it through the calculation One could think that something like this would render an auto sizing image div classcontainer div classrow alignitemsstretch div classcolmd img datasrcholderjs x autoyes div div div Right now with would be holderjs px autoyes for a md column on a large screen but that second dimension is screen size dependent Which makes it unusable outside of my own development machine screen with being the tested rendered width at Maybe either and extra flag or another unit say px r With the r referring to ratio and thus the percentage of the actual width forced and recalculated Or maybe rx rautoyes and that making a autoscaling fill the container until on of the sides hit any thing being height or width Or an extra flag forceAspect with the size given in a px p type of way I looked at the source but Im quite lost Right now I tried to just wrap the script but it is not very user friendly Maybe something for v Setting the size attribute appears to have no effect in v when the width is set to eg img datasrcholderjs px size followup to would be good to curve outlines if the placeholder has rounded corners Hi I was hoping you could support Turbolinks I think Ive found what code needs to be changed but dont do much Javascript and dont understand how this code is packaged I think what needs to be changed is here in indexjs javascript if typeof globalTurbolinks object globaldocumentaddEventListenerpagechange function Holderrun to javascript if typeof globalTurbolinkscontroller object Turbolinks globaldocumentaddEventListenerturbolinksload function Holderrun else if typeof globalTurbolinks object Turbolinks Classic globaldocumentaddEventListenerpagechange function Holderrun I hope this makes sense When combining the with auto and textmode parameters Im seeing an incorrect width and height on first load Once the browser is resized the correct dimensions are shown they are always x holderjs x autotrue textmodeexact An example patternlabpagesbasicpage Then once browser is resized patternlabpagesbasicpage Note that this is within the Pattern Lab environment so Im not sure if it applies on a basic static HTML page For example Thanks Tomasz It would be great if we could get support for RGBA For example HolderaddThemecustom bg rgba fg rgba and img datasrcholderjs x bgrgba ampfgrgba Thoughts Holder with Material Icons issue started here added this new issue to follow the new extended issue Holder with Material Icons work with external resources in html Move Material Icons external resources to css and holderjs stops working To illustrate added jsfiddle Remove from HTML to see mmaterial icons stop working link relstylesheet href classholderjs Also never working object datasrcholderjs x themevine text xE F size fontMaterial Iconsobject Maybe this is to do with CORS
