I use glium as renderer in a imguirs project and have D object picking working on another thread by following this example In summary to enable D picking a SimpleFrameBuffer is created with a color buffer and a depth buffer The color buffer is initialized with a custom texture which has in the background and object ids on their corresponding D texture locations In the example the background ids are set to but in my case I use because my object id starts with and that is not something determined by me Picking works well until I add some gui to the screen The background ids in the background somehow become which makes the program think the mouse clicks on object The background on gui windows is It seems to me that imguirs is interfering my SimpleFrameBuffer object the gui clears the D background to and my code sets the gui to But they they should reside in separate memory I am not sure whats going on I can hack it by adding to all the ids but the interfering still bothers me fixes with a default feature of winit and compiling with features winit causes both features to be active leading to duplicate imports and incorrect type versions Apologies if this was reported somewhere

not compile imguiwinitsupport warning build failed waiting for other jobs to finish error build failed discussion based on comments in Can everybody please clarify what exactly is expected of me that is not being provided at the moment Ill happily consider giving full access to more people but Im also getting very mixed signals here rasky wants review of this branch which Im not capable of delivering because this pull request has very little information about the change and reviewing the pull request requires a good understanding of both the Dear Imgui feature which is still experimental and how that maps to imguirs What about JasperBekkers jaynus What needs do you have that are not being met at the moment but would be if I gave full admin access to some people you My criteria for a crate being unmaintained is usually that pull requests dont get merged which doesnt seem to be the case here because the problem seems to be lack of review andor lack of active development Im not actively doing work on this crate but its not the same thing as not accepting any changes Theres nothing preventing somebody else from reviewing this pull request right here In fact if docking was in dear imgui master and somebody from Embark had reviewed this pull request Id merge it without hesitation Theres nothing preventing somebody else from implementing critical changes that werent finished If reasonable pull requests were submitted Id merge them And just to be clear in any case forking wont be needed Id much rather completely give away this project to somebody else than let it rot However the discussion so far seems to be mostly about credentials not about the actual effort that moves the project forward Ive already given contributor access to one other person and will gladly do it again But what exactly does it change in practice other than credentials TLDR I need X but Gekkio doesnt doprovide Y please fill in X and Y Q is not possible right now but if Gekkio gave admin access to ltname of person gt it would be possible please fill in Q The docs state The DPI factor from winit is used directly without adjustment rust deriveCopy Clone Debug PartialEq pub enum HiDpiMode The DPI factor from winit is used directly without adjustment Default But if you look at this helper function the winit dpi is not used at all in with Default rust cfgfeature winit pub fn scaleposfromwinit self window Window logicalpos LogicalPosition LogicalPosition match selfhidpimode ActiveHiDpiModeDefault logicalpos logicalpos tophysicalwindowgethidpifactor tologicalselfhidpifactor On my machine the dpi for my window changes from to after a while and now the mouse clicks are all off center I realized that when I use HiDpiModeRounded everything works fine I think the problem is that the framebuffer scale is set correctly for dpi changes but scaleposfromwinit doesnt get the correct size I think it also should scale it by the current dpi The glium renderer always samples with linear interpolation I have a use case where Id like to set this to Nearest displaying sprites at magnified scales where the original pixels should be clearly visible For now Ive simply replaced the filter in the source of the renderer but itd be nice to customize this on a pertexture basis This PR adds initial support for the Dear Imgui docking branch The dockingviewport branch is a longliving branch that will eventually be merged to master and brings many new features to Dear Imgui While some features can be used almost without changing code docking others require extensive support in the backend viewports Since it might take a while to correctly implement for viewports in our several backends I thought we might as well start implementation This PR has initial support it passes cargo test by fixing the layouts but does not yet wrap new APIs It was written off v as is still not stable NOTE This PR should probably be merged into a new docking branch Theres no way for me to target a branch that doesnt exist yet if somebody creates a docking branch I can change this PR and let it point there Hello Ive stumbled across your bindings to imgui and would love to use it in my app that uses the threers crate which is a pretty highlevel graphics library akin to threejs Ive used imgui in C projects before and I know that for this to work I have to essentially implement the rendering component that draws the command buffers created by imgui How does this task work in your library Do I have to implement a specific trait Are there there any rough pointers you could give me when it comes to me extending your library to work with threers Thank you in advance By running both the examples Glium and gfx I noticed that the frame rate is capped to exampleshelloworldrs uiioframerate exampleshelloworldrs uiioframerate exampleshelloworldrs uiioframerate exampleshelloworldrs uiioframerate Ive already removed the VSync even if Ive a hz monitor so is not due to VSync but nothing change After some tests Im able to say that the frame limit is set in Glium and Im pretty sure that it depends on some internal configuration of the render I would like to remove this frame cap because I would like to fully use the VSync any idea use imgui mod support fn main let system supportinitfile systemmainloop ui WindownewimstrHello world size
