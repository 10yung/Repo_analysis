hiperfare I used your tool to export successfullyHow to view particle system files in unity d Hi you can verify why not works or is there a way to make it work Link Animator Thanks I even checked on old versions Contra until on following versions not wokrs I dont know why and what is the reason Is it possible to decompile those I want to decompile the shaders of a game I used to play but most of them comes into the compiled format Is there a way around it Link for the game files if needed here mb I was tried to rip ice scream s asset and i find rod kids model in Asset List but theres problem with rod kids model his model looks messup his legs and arms looks flickering and terrible hes covered in black glitches his model looks even horrible Js Charlies Lis and Mikes models looks all fine but rod kids not Perfare needs to fix this Phoenix Point uses wwise audio and the script dumper will fail on any asset that has a field of certain wwise types The root issue seems to be that these objects have a valueGuidInternal field of type byte The dumper attempts to read this array by realigning the stream after each byte but all the array elements are packed in the asset file with no padding between them I am unsure if the packing behavior is specific to these wwise types or would be the case for all arrays of byte or boolean I have made a local change that skips alignment after reading a primitive type if the type is an array element instead realigning after processing the whole array This seems to work for Phoenix Point but I dont know if it will break other games Is it possible to do something about loading all assets to RAM AssetStudio can take sometimes more than GB of RAM for one game before finalizing reading assets when it can go down about New to this kinda stuff and had this recommended to me how do I use itopen it Currently when exporting assets from an AssetBundle the files are exported in a directory named after the SerializedFile name which is definitely a sensible choice However often the assets in the AssetBundle are part of containers that have their own directory structure specified which allows a more intuitive placement of the exported assets I think it would be nice to allow the option of recreating the directory structure using a specfied folder as root with the assets exported at this point in the subdirectory having the name of the container Eg CAB contains the Mesh BLOD and the Texture D Balb as part of a container having the internal name and path assetsmaincontentmodelsBasset the option would allow to specify a path create the pathassetsmaincontentmodelsBasset directory and then would export BLOD and Balb in said directory Currently all rigged models on my end always export as unrigged models no matter what i do
