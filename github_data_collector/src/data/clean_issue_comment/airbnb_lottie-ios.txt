I would like to contribute my grain of sand to the overall performance improvement project This PR updates the README file to mention the last version of Lottie that supports ObjectiveC to help users with older projects or users starting new ObjectiveC projects that wish to import Lottie I add lottie in my project by cocoapods but why it still ask me to add Lottieframework can u help me thanks Simulator is OK my own device iphone p will crash when launch Basically when I was giving dynamic negative animation speeds through lottiereactnative the animation wouldnt play at all After debugging it through lottiereactnative and lottieios I found out the issue was on not using the absolute value on the calculation of layerAnimationbeginTime After making this change the animation would start to play in reverse again This fixes a regression we noticed when updated from lottieios from to and above Please see the breaking change in here In the animation was always done inside CATransaction and whats important when it detected no animation was needed it still used CATransaction but with duration set to removed the use of CATransaction in favor of CAAnimation which is fine for the case when animation being in progress was detected But when no animation was detected it was left with animationLayerposition position animationLayertransform xform which in our case still caused an animation to be performed when it was not needed maybe some iOS system default animation In the attachment you can find movies showing how animation looks with and without the fix when contained inside refresh control of a table view Animationwithandwithoutfixzip Since performance is poor when scrolling See I have tried to work around it by stopping animation during scrolling However performance stayed low even when the animation stopped To repro it I have created an app with pages where every page has a Lottie animation With Core Animation profiling I have tried scenarios Scrolling when Lottie is animating Scrolling when Lottie is stopped Scrolling when Lottie is replaced with a UIImage Here are the results setting shouldRasterizeWhenIdle to true had no affect Check these before submitting x The issue doesnt involve an Unsupported Feature This issue isnt related to another open issue This issue is a x NonCrashing Bug Visual or otherwise Crashing Bug Feature Request Regression Something that once worked but doesnt work anymore Which Version of Lottie are you using Lottie What Platform are you on MacOS x iOS What Language are you in x Swift ObjectiveC Expected Behavior When scrolling if animation is stopped FPS Frame Per Second should stay high and Device Utilization should stay low I am expecting the same performance as if Lottie would be replaced with a static UIImage Actual Behavior Regardless of animation state runningstopped the performance is low Code Example Test app A simple app with pages where every page has a Lottie animation Also expose buttons RemoveAdd Lottie StopPlay Lottie Note the app was tested with a much bigger JSON file and the profiler screenshot above was created with that file but even the committed Animation JSON shows that Device Utilization stays high when animation is stopped but the FPS stays stable above Animation JSON how to create a AnimationView with the file path LottieiOS Issue Hello Sorry youre having an Issue Please help us
