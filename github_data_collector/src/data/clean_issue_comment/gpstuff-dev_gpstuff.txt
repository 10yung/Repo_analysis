Hi there It seems the development has ceased for quite a while Could anyone provide more information about the development Like a rough roadmap Current known problemsissuesbugs It will be greatly helpful if someone wants to pick up from the last commit By the way is there any fortune that someone would rewrite everything in the MATLAB OOP paradigm Best regards The gpjpred function says to provide an optional input tstind for the FIC approximation if none of the test points are also in the training set However when I try to use this function with an FIC model I get the error Error using gpjpred line tstind not provided This error is occurring with GPStuff New PSIS version based on updated Does not work at least for me Problem with nested handles reported in the likstudentt definition file if you follow the script on the GPstuff page There are other minor problems before that but they are easily fixed I assume that this demo has not been run against octave yet Should easily be fixable just introduce sub functions shall likely do it myself From Lu Cheng It was said in GPStuff manual page that periodic kernel was coming from this paper In page equation and GPStuff appendix there is the canonical periodic covariance function And it is not obvious to find the explicit form of quasiperiodic covariance function in section In the demoperiodicm there is alway the decay term ie another SE term which is very confusing I suggest add an additional example which set decay to and not including the extra length scale
