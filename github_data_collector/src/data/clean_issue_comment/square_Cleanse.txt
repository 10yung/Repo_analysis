Hello thanks for this amazing library I have an issue with adding the library as a dependency using Swift Package Manager in Xcode Error message The package dependency graph can not be resolved unable find any available tag for the following requirements I think the format of Packageswift should be updated Right we throw a fatalError if we have duplicate bindings for the same type This can be improved Likely throw an exception to be handled by the RootComponent of function If the type was of a AnyWeakProvider type then we would only retain a weak reference to its FutureProvider instance causing it to become deallocated We want to retain a strong reference to this FutureProvider like we do for normal providers because we still need to be able to acquire an instance of its getter Im having issues with dependency cycle My Coordinator needs a LoginViewController and my LoginViewController needs a Coordinator to function But I havent found a way to get this to work with constructor injection I also tried propertyInject but the propertyInjection method doesnt get called Below youll see an example of my implementation swift protocol HomeRoute func routeHome protocol RegisterRoute func routeRegister class Coordinator HomeRoute RegisterRoute private let loginViewControllerProvider ProviderLoginViewController initloginViewControllerProvider ProviderLoginViewController self loginViewControllerProvider loginViewControllerProvider func routeHome show Home func routeRegister show Register swift class LoginViewController typealias Coordinator HomeRoute RegisterRoute private var coordinator Coordinator initcoordinator Coordinator selfcoordinator coordinator Tryout with propertyInjection is not being called func injectProperties coordinator Coordinator selfcoordinator coordinator swift extension Modules struct App CleanseModule static func configurebinder AppBinder Bind Coordinator BTW is there a way to bind multiple variations of protocols to the same Coordinator eg my RegisterCoordinator might only need a Coordinator confirming to HomeRoute protocol but should get the same Coordinator as the Login binderbindLoginViewControllerCoordinatorselfsharedInScopetofactory ApplicationCoordinatorinit binderbindtofactory LoginViewControllerinit When running the app this doesnt seem to do anything binderbindPropertyInjectionOfLoginViewControllerselftoinjector LoginViewControllerinjectProperties
