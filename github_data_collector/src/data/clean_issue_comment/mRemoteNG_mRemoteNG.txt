Ability to run python scripts Expected Behavior It would be useful to be able to run python scripts over RemoteNG a bit like SecureCRT does right now Pressing F or selecting help mRemoteNT Help displays error dialog Expected Behavior To bring up a local help file Current Behavior Help is not available locally You can still review on the web site Possible Solution I believe the request has a leading back slash making for an improper open Steps to Reproduce for bugs Provide an unambiguous set of steps to reproduce this bug Include code to reproduce if relevant Start mRemoteNT Hit F Error appears immediately Context A hinderance in looking up help for the product Not major but does then require access from the web site to assist Your Environment Version used V mRemoteHelpFail Operating System and version Windows x OS Build Often times we are quick to type a command only to realize we are in the wrong session Can we create a colored border that may make it easier to distinguish one session from another I know the tab shows it but its so small and not where most people are looking when they are typing Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above Session is unlocked

Description AdmPwdE wwwadmpwdcom specializes on secure automatic password management and retrieval for local and domain accounts in Windows environment Managed password is securely stored in Active Directory and eligible persons can retrieve it from there AdmPwdE also provides integration SDK library that allows password retrieval logic integration to other applications This allows to eligible people getting and using password on the fly without storing it typing it or even knowing it This feature substantially increases security of local and domain accounts because password is automatically regularly randomized password does not need to be stored anywhere else than in Active Directory AdmPwdE toolset allows for automatic password retrieval and usage Motivation and Context Possibility to automatically retrieve connection password in RDP manager greatly increases its value because users do not need to care about password expirations and changes to update passwords stored in mRemoteNG credential storage passwords do not leave the company they arent stored in connection file automatic password retrieval is fully integrated with current mRemoteNG features of default credentials to be used User has possiblity to turn on automatic password retrieval when configuring default credentials in Options Credentials dialog box Nothing else is needed just keep password field empty in Connection configuration and mRemoteNG retrieves password when connection is established How Has This Been Tested Feature was tested with and without option to use AdmPwdE for password retrieval turned on Without this option mRemoteNG behaves the same as if the support for AdmPwdE was not implemented so user experience of users who do not want to use this feature is not impacted When option is turned on and password retrieval succeeds it was tested that connection is successfully established When password retrieval fails for some reason it was tested that mRemoteNG just asks the user for password the same way as if the password is not specified UI language translations for new UI element checkbox were added for neutral and Czech languages It was tested that Czech translation displays when language of mRemoteNG is set to Czech for other languages for whose translation was not provided it was tested that neutral language message is displayed Screenshots if

branch I have updated the changelog file accordingly if necessary I have updated the documentation accordingly if necessary When using the right click Sent To feature on a pane to detach the pane and send to a screen the pane is sent with a very small pane size As RDP is set to smart size the remote desktop is resized accordingly Unfortunately even if remotely open windows are minimized Windows resizes all open Windows to scale as well It would be better if the pane size was retained Alternatively an option made available to set either a fixed size or percentage or screen sent to Version used Operating System and version Windows x Hi the app is great I dont know where it was my whole life It would be great to have ability to right click on folder tree node and exclude it from the search It could be grayed out or with some other icon crossed out magnifier
