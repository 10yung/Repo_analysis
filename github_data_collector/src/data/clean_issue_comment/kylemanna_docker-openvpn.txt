Ive followed the installconfig instructions in the readme and it happens without error Once I run the container and connect to it pinging just hangs and theres no name resolution My local openvpn

continues every seconds ad infinitum Hello im using this container to do somethig but im not sure that im doing all ok I have a VPN server vpn ip on VPS with public ip then i have clients in diferents locations User with subnet xxx vpn ip User with subnet xxx vpn ip User need to conect to the user subnet and other times conect to user subnet with this user We do a remote assistence In the future we can add more clients type user and and more clients type like user Now I can connect to user with user and all works good but when user conects to server I lost the routing and only can connect to user in other words last user conected is conected to user Now I can ping all users but I cant route to user or user subnets on demand only the last one connected Its possible to do it with your container Thanks I have generated two client configs with docker run v OVPNDATAetcopenvpn logdrivernone rm it kylemannaopenvpn easyrsa buildclientfull CLIENTNAME nopass docker run v OVPNDATAetcopenvpn logdrivernone rm kylemannaopenvpn ovpngetclient CLIENTNAME CLIENTNAME ovpn docker run v OVPNDATAetcopenvpn logdrivernone rm it kylemannaopenvpn easyrsa buildclientfull CLIENTNAME nopass docker run v OVPNDATAetcopenvpn logdrivernone rm kylemannaopenvpn ovpngetclient CLIENTNAME CLIENTNAME ovpn And I can connect to the server but both of them are getting the same IP I have read that this may be caused by same CN in client certificates but I havent specified any CNs manually I have also tried to setup permanent IP for each client by setting it with ifconfigpush in etcopenvpnccdCLIENTNAME but I still get the same IP regardless of this configs Any ideas Hello Im setting this up on our AWS infra with an attempt to make the following enhancements over the stock configuration things that are now working split route traffic so only X X goes over VPN not full traffic ability to query AWS side DNS for internal resources like private DNS and internal load balancers only for specific domains OTP for users things that still need to be done change IP of clients to theyre not in the range worried about conflicting with home networks move key data out of the OVPN file into separate keycrt files for editing configs without spoiling keys About the address parts on the current config there are lines that mention route server Couple of quick questions how do the relate to eachother Since the vs thing I dont know for sure if those are even related Any time I change either of them I can get the clients to start having different IPs but then the VPN breaks I assumed I could just change to something like route server and that would be it but that doesnt work can anyone explain why or what needs to be done to get it working also if anyone knows about the separate key file part I havent looked into that one yet Thanks This PR includes work from others that have been fixing the build The build was failing for the following reasons googleauthenticator otp needs to be in noninteractive mode duplicate iptables rule in revocation test needs to be caught random file needs to be created for easyrsa rng My client configuration like this My Mac os x logfile like this There is no problem on windows but there is a problem with my Mac os x why Running this container on Ubuntu LTS on a GBit dedicated and im barely pushing mbits on my Windows client machine Are there any solutions ways to debug this My CPU usage is also very low under load when trying to speedtest on the server openvpnconf server verb key etcopenvpnpkiprivatevpnsitenetkey ca etcopenvpnpkicacrt cert

gateway need to add push route to allow the clients see What I get I can ping VPN gateway and every host of VPN Host Subnets from Why is this happening I did not include the IPTable rules which I did not change from the default ones generated from docker or this image itself but if you feel like you need it to debug too let me know Thank you Hi friend A Netflix proxy error appears and does not allow video playback I have several docker OpenVPN in different countries especially in France none works Is there a problem can you help me Thank you
