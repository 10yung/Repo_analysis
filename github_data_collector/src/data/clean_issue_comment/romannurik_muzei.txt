Hi Im Emanuele Iannone a master student at University of Salerno Since my bachelors thesis I have been working on a code smell refactoring plugin called aDoctor which is able to identify and fix energyrelated problems in Android apps I launched it on your project finding different instances of code smells I chose one of them and let the plugin automatically fix it In this case I chose Member Ignoring Method that is present when a non static method does not use at all instance variables and other non static methods These kind of smell may have a non trivial impact on energy consumption as shown in this paper Besides this kind of refactoring does not impact on the functionalities of your app so it is totally safe Let me know if you are interested in this refactoring proposal Hello all I discovered this amazing app only recently and I love the ability to configure different effects for home and lock screen The only thing which Im missing is D parallax effect I found that this feature suggestion was rejected in due to possible CPU issues but maybe could be reevaluated now I was using another D app extensively during past years and it had no visible impact on the battery so Id say that its safe to use with negligible impact on resources Could you please reconsider adding this cool feature Thanks in advance Muzei is really awesome app I would love to see it in more languages Is there any way I could submit a translation into my language like crowdincom or similar service If not do you think localization support could be added in the future Bumps braceexpansion from to

background service so app cant start activity in onCommand method Maybe can change onCommand return PendingIntent like getArtworkInfo to allow start activity As part of the documentation is now built with Dokka which has a different format for its HTML documentation that caused the prettify script to not properly be applied The prettify script and the other related documentation tweaks should be adjust to work with the new output of gradlew muzeiapidokka The title sounds ridiculous but it is true Since the source I m working on contains a limited set of images I ship a defined set of declarations in JSON It contains something like elements I read this JSON transform it to Artwork objects and call MuzeiArtProvidersetArtwork It works fine but there is a noticeable delay before images actually appear on the UI It might take almost a minute to do so on a real device Timings from an emulator Step Time Reading JSON ms Transforming to Artwork ms MuzeiArtProvidersetArtwork s Timeout before images appear s One thing I ve noticed right away is a ton of such log entries DMuzeiArtProvider Notified for batch change on contentruming muzeiearthview DMuzeiArtProvider Notified for batch change on contentruming muzeiearthview DMuzeiArtProvider Notified for batch change on contentruming muzeiearthview Not sure it is necessary to occupy the thread with logging K entries especially taking into account UritoString calls But the real issue is somewhere else and it occupies the majority of time As per the documentation Muzei should add androidsupportsMultipleDisplaystrue to our wallpaperxml to ensure we support multiple displays The documentation referenced in the readme apimuzeico which redirects to the wiki has not been updated to v and still documents the legacy v API The full API reference hasnt been updated either Additionally the changelog in that same wiki is still at v In my app I have a JSON file with over image URLs I have two questions If I add them all using ProviderContractArtworkaddArtwork inside onLoadRequested method will Muzei download all of them right away When I open my source in BrowseProviderFragment Muzei will start to download all the images over GB which is really bad Can we add thumbnail property to Artwork so it will be displayed instead of the full image Thank you
