 Ive been transitioning my workflow into using tidymodels but am noticing a lack of broom coverage Glance Doesnt Work Tidy Does r tidymodels broom parsnip librarytidymodels setseed split initialsplitmtcars props cartrain trainingsplit cartest testingsplit carmodel linearreg lmcarmodel carmodel setenginelm lmfit lmcarmodel fitmpg data cartrain doesnt work but classic lm does broomglancelmfit lmmpg data cartrain broomglance works broomtidylmfit Is this something planning on being ironed out in the future Ive also noticed discrim supports no broom operations either Thanks for your feedback I was browsing through the projects of the tidymodels organization and I see that theres a project on Econometric Tools and why people flock to Stata on this topic Im not sure where to put this comment feel free to move it elsewhere if its relevant elsewhere I think incorporating econometric models in some way in the tidymodels framework would be interesting but its definitely reinventing the wheel since theres quite some work on econometrics in R In particular zelig is a bit of the tidymodels of econometric modelling wrapping nearly all standard econometric models into a unified framework I wont list all of the econometric packages out there because I think zelig can be a good starting point to think about this Prepare for release Check current CRAN check results x devtoolscheck x devtoolscheckwindevel x rhubcheckforcran x revdepcheckrevdepchecknumworkers Update crancommentsmd Polish NEWS Review pkgdown reference index for eg missing topics Submit to CRAN usethisuseversionpatch devtoolssubmitcran Approve email Wait for CRAN Accepted tada usethisusegithubrelease usethisusedevversion I dont know how the author fsolt feels about it but to me the dotwhisker package would be a natural part of the tidymodels ecosystem topepo I heard back this Im confident this project will get done it might just take some months to get there We should build a centralized site like tidyverseorg I think the headline announcement needs to be the API is under development and we are going to get things wrong for a while so dont build on top of this stuff for a while and expect abstractions to change ie we dont want people to bake early mistakes experiments into their code and then get stuck with them As per recent tidyverse Do not import notice Not sure how this was accomplished on the technical end but would probably be good to replicate here tidymodels has a tagging system so that users can easily load other tidy model packages for a specific domain eg text analysis etc For example the user could use r tagupdatetext analysis The following packages are out of date reticulate Start a clean R session then run installpackagesreticulate tagattachtext analysis Attaching packages tidytext keras These extra packages would not be formal dependencies to tidymodels Also Im in the process of defining how tidy a package needs to be for inclusion which Ill document somewhere In the meantime what tidy time series packages on CRAN would mdancho DavisVaughan and robjhyndman suggest for inclusion
