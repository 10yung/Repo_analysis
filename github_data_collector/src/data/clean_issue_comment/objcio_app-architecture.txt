Would it be possible to put the example projects under an open source license like the MIT license FolderViewControllerswift if let changeReason userInfo ItemchangeReasonKey as String let oldValue userInfo ItemnewValueKey let newValue userInfo ItemoldValueKey if let changeReason userInfo ItemchangeReasonKey as String let oldValue userInfo ItemnewValueKey let newValue userInfo ItemoldValueKey The problem seems to be on line of FolderViewController swift viewModelfolderContentsbindto tableViewrxitemsdataSource dataSourcedisposedby disposeBag Im getting the following Recordings Warning Unable to create restoration in progress marker file Assertion failed This is a feature to warn you that there is already a delegate or data source set somewhere previously The action you are trying to perform will clear that delegate data source and that means that some of your features that depend on that delegate data source being set will likely stop working If you are ok with this try to set delegate data source to nil in front of this operation This is the source object value UITableView x fa e c frame clipsToBounds YES autoresize WH gestureRecognizers NSArray x bdb layer CALayer x a contentOffset contentSize adjustedContentInset This is the original delegate data source value RecordingsFolderViewController x fa e d a Hint Maybe delegate was already set in xib or storyboard and now its being overwritten in code file UsersjeffDeveloperapparchitectureRecordingsMVVMCPodsRxCocoaRxCocoaCommonDelegateProxyTypeswift line Recordings Assertion failed This is a feature to warn you that there is already a delegate or data source set somewhere previously The action you are trying to perform will clear that delegate data source and that means that some of your features that depend on that delegate data source being set will likely stop working This seems to happen in both Xcode and using RxSwift and RxDataSources Setting the tableViews delegate and dataSource to nil after superviewDidLoad fixes the issue for me Im following the steps in the README to install RxSwift via Carthage but running into complier issues Specifically No such module RxDataSources The only error I get when running carthage update platform iOS is a build failure from xcodebuild but Im guessing is the same issue Seems like everything is installed correctly Fetching RxSwift Checking out RxDataSources at Checking out RxSwift at xcodebuild output can be found in varfoldersvndjlphdns qcvv qqwcs c bswTcarthagexcodebuildCSrNEVlog Skipped downloading RxSwiftframework binary due to the error API rate limit exceeded for But heres the good news Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit Check out the documentation for more details Skipped downloading RxDataSourcesframework binary due to the error API rate limit exceeded for But heres the good news Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit Check out the documentation for more details Building scheme RxBlockingiOS in Rxxcworkspace Building scheme RxCocoaiOS in Rxxcworkspace Any ideas Anyone else run into this Id love to be able to build so I can play around and better grok reactive programming i download the project and when i run the OneAppEightArchitectures it is runs some errorsmy Xcode is In the switch below deleteRows or insertRows was not reached because of this typo switch changeReason newValue oldValue case let Itemremoved oldIndex as Int tableViewdeleteRowsat IndexPathrow oldIndex section with automatic case let Itemadded newIndex as Int tableViewinsertRowsat IndexPathrow newIndex section with automatic case let Itemrenamed newIndex as Int oldIndex as Int tableViewmoveRowat IndexPathrow oldIndex section to IndexPathrow newIndex section tableViewreloadRowsat IndexPathrow newIndex section with automatic default tableViewreloadData In the MVCVS version of the Recordings application one of the features that can be implemented with ease thanks to the architecture is the Time Travel Debugging I noticed that when traveling through the history of the View States in case a view is presented on top of the actual View Hierarchy you lose access to the slide until you dismiss the actual view which adds another view state to the history in this case the culprit is the recording screen Is that behaviour expected If not or even if it is how would be a good way to not lose access to the slider when the history contains a screen that is presented on top of the actual view context Is it a bad thing if the Coordinator becomes huge If it is what are good solutions Thanks I was getting an xcodebuild error when running carthage update platform iOS for the MVVMC project as it couldnt build RxDataSources I got it to work by updating the cartfile to this github ReactiveXRxSwift github RxSwiftCommunityRxDataSources I dont want to create a PR because Im not sure if this was just an issue for me
