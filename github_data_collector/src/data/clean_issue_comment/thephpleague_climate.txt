Im trying to check if an argument is defined I need to distinguish between the default value which is valid to be passed manually and the argument not being defined at all Im aware of the Managerdefined method but that requires reparsing argv and in my particular use case argv isnt even available in this section of code What Id like is something like climateargumentsprovided name Though that might be a bit confusing with exists and defined already available on that object Having it only accessible on the Argument object would work too I think The method would check if Argumentvalues is nonempty Happy to PR if you think this is workable Per issue the Spinner was added in release Aside from the above closed issue there isnt any documentation I could find for Spinner Thanks for creating and maintaining Climate what great fun it is to use Hi I really like this little lib because of its minimalism very quick to get up Thank you very much However after adding some functions to a small tool I need to start thinking about how to organize multiple levels of mostly radiobutton menus do you have some hints or examples for how to handle this Or is there any other library extension addon that helps with that I really would like to make it a little bit more declarative so menus could be defined with a config file with the option key as function name to execute when selected but before I get lost I just wanted to ask if I could learn from someone who has solved that already Thanks for your attention Hey there what do you think of centering column contents or aligning numbers to the right As far as I can see there is a buildCell method that calls another pad method and also already knows the column width Roughly outline as use example php php climatetabledata STRPADRIGHT or null is default anyway name STRPADRIGHT age STRPADLEFT centered STRPADBOTH And inside the Table class I imagine php protected function buildCellkey column align thiscolumnaligns key width thiscolumnwidths key return thispadcolumn width align Regards pcntlsignal is used to handle signals it would be useful to give CLImate the ability to do something when for example CTRLC SIGTERM is pressed No one seems to be able to understand the argument parsing including myself whenever I go back in there its time to redo it getopt seems like the way to go to simplify the whole thing Id like to be able to grab the trailing args php foophp d val foo bar php foophp d val foo bar Then I want to get an array foo bar back is common as an argument separator like everything including arguments with a leading following is passed literally to somewhere else Ive searched for it in the docs but actually found no way how to grab every trailing arg Ive only found a way to grab a single arg Was this an oversight in the implementation or was there just some undocumented feature Unless I missed this in the docs there doesnt seem to be an easy way to set up multiple commands The argument parsing is nice but it would be great to handle multiple commands with seperate argument configurations Commander refers to them Gitstyle subcommands Maybe the symfonyconsole component would be better for what Im trying to do but just thought Id mention the issue to see if Im missing something or in case its something wed like to add to the roadmap It is often a possibility to disable interactive console when running an application Is it possible to have it in CLImate It probably only makes sense with the Input So when the interactive mode is disabled prompts should either return their default value or null It is the applications responsibility to handle any other cases like getting the data from an option
