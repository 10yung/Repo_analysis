Most people think theres a way to save the column contents via textarea however the saving does not actually work and its confusing Field copy is available via context menu right click When pgweb is terminated any new request or a custom query will never seem to finish however the backend is gone and we should print out an error message Example query SELECT nnspname AS schema ttypname stringaggeenumlabel ORDER BY eenumsortorder AS enumlabels FROM pgcatalogpgtype t JOIN pgcatalogpgnamespace n ON noid ttypnamespace JOIN pgcatalogpgenum e ON toid eenumtypid WHERE ttypname NAME GROUP BY Should fix issues with large blobs of data stored as bytea or jsonb Fixes I have a table with one bytea column where Im storing small images Unfortunately if Im having like more than rows there pgweb totally hangs when I want to see the rows and its unresponsive When I try to export data the client seems to form an invalid API call to the backend For example clicking the CSV export button calls the backend with the improperly formatted url If I modify the call to remove the pghost parameter like so or fix the url to be properly formatted without removing the pghost parameter it works as expected I am running and I dont believe this issue was addressed in This question arised from learning this one I did neither careful code study nor experiments but there is a feeling that theres no need for files like pkgapisessioncleanupgo Instead it should be sufficient to configure an sqls connection pool feature Am I wrong Identifier quoting is incorrect and fails sometimes Steps to reproduce run psql do the following commands in the psql postgres create table bad table id int CREATE TABLE postgres insert into bad table id values INSERT run pgweb try to view data in the bad table see the error message instead of a data The ability to see a pretty printed syntax highlighted display of the definition of a given view materialized view in the Structure tab would be extremely handy The command select pggetviewdefviewname true is easy enough to remember but I wind up needing to copy and paste the output into a text editor to see everything especially for views with large definitions
