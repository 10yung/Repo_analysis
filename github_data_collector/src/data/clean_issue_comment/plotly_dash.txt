Ive been using Dash for a while and would like to dip my toes into Dash development would this PR be welcome x Previously all callbacks were emerald green now clientside callbacks will be sienna red I would like to color code components that are not present in the layout differently this would be very useful for debugging if suppresscallbackexceptions is enabled However its not clear to me what the cleanest way is to do this would anyone have any suggestions here I have run the tests locally and they passed refer to testing section in contributing I have added tests or extended existing tests to cover any new features or bugs fixed in this PR optionals I have added entry in the CHANGELOGmd If this PR needs a followup in dash docs community thread I have mentioned the relevant URLS as follow this github PR number updates the dash docs here is the show and tell thread in plotly dash community As encountered in it would be useful for component developers to expose degradation warnings errors etc in Dash Devtools As currently implemented only frontend errors thrown from within the React Error Boundary components are caught handled by the Dash Devtools making it impossible to both expose warning error information to the user and rendering a component at the same time On nonES ES etc compatible browsers I think there may be an issue with async Dash and regenerator runtime The error is ReferenceError regeneratorRuntime is not defined in the JS console specifically when trying to use async Dash Table Hopefully this could be fixed in the webpack config see import regeneratorruntimeruntime and here regenerator true cc MarcAndreRivet Minor fixes to use HTML tags In HTML the script tag does not need the typetextjavascript attribute It would be great if we could add All Contributors to Dash All Contributors is a free bot you add It adds an auto generated piece of code to the bottom of the README that creates the contributors list Here is the Emoji Key and Contribution Types The docs are listed here The next image shows an example allcontributors And it is shown here Very easy to add people just by commenting on PRs or issues Describe your context dash

disabled and dash fails to load As such we need to restrict our cookie usage by disabling functionality This patch removes the disabled functionality in a graceful manner allowing dash to load in very restricted iframes Contributor Checklist x I have broken down my PR scope into the following TODO tasks not needed x I have run the tests locally and they passed refer to testing section in contributing x I have added tests or extended existing tests to cover any new features or bugs fixed in this PR optionals x I have added entry in the CHANGELOGmd dash dashbootstrapcomponents dashcorecomponents dashdaq dashhtmlcomponents dashrenderer dashtable Im building a multipage Dash app with a callback trigger on dccLocation that also uses flasksendfromdirectory in a Flask route However the Dash callback seems to be interfering with the Flask route because flasksendfromdirectory is no longer fired in its flask route
