Rails introduce Webpacker gem which can help you to avoid using Sprockets Is there any way to make JSRoutes usable with Webpacker We have a large scale production application that uses JS Routes heavily for all of the javascript paths We have an advanced setup since we separate out our admin and non admin routes We have routesjserb files configured to get parsed and then compiled as part of the asset compilation process However what Ive discovered is that when the routes change the file does not get regenerated unless it is removed from the sprockets cache If I add any comments at the top of the routesjserb file it gets reprocessed This seems like an order of operations issue like sprockets is calculating the fingerprint cache information of the file before ERB is changing the actual contents of the file Itd be cool to store the routes with the key being hashed then the value being encrypted with the original key This way nothing would be gained by looking at the routes only when you made use of a route would it expose it and if youre using an admindeploynukespath youll have probably authenticated them already example routeMap sha of admindeploynukespath AES encrypted path with the key admindeploynukespath findRoute routeName hashedRouteName SHA routeName AESdecryptrouteMap hashedRouteName routeName assuming data key Of course this would require extra libraries but I guess theyre pretty small and the amount of data being encryptedhashed would be small so pretty quick Maybe overkill but might be a nice option
