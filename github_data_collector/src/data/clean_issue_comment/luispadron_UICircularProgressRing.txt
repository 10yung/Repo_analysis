warning This issue will be closed if the required information is not filled warning Version Version Details I dont know How to create gradientColor ring Can you show Some Code Hi This seems to me a strange behavior but maybe I did not understand something from the documentation If I setup the Ringvalue before adding the Ring to the view hierarchy the value shows and when I startProgress it starts from there the animation If I setup the Ringvalue somewhere else like after pressing a button and before startProgress everything starts from Although the line is not there anymore I did try RingsetNeedsDisplay to update the visual This is test code but on the official app I will need the Ring to show progression on a hours period The app wont be visible all the time so I need to set the value from where we are when the app open before starting the animation swift import UIKit import UICircularProgressRing class ViewController UIViewController let progressRing UICircularProgressRing

inside animation block What is the expected outcome Progress ring alpha fades to within animation block completion called What is the actual outcome when I do that the animation block never gets to the completion block what I see is that the alpha property was set on the progress ring it disappears but the knob remains visible and is unaffected Post sample code or example here If sample code cant be provided because its too long please provide a small example project where I can test if you cannot provide either There is not much I can do I noticed a weird issue that I think may have something to do with the fix you implemented I think you may want to look into it When switching states in my application I use some animations when removing some UI controls So when I switch from a playing state to stopped for example I want the progress ring to fade and then I remove it using something like this swift UIViewanimatewithDuration delay options curveEaseOut animations selfprogressRingalpha success in selfprogressRingresetProgress selfprogressRingremoveFromSuperview However when I do that the animation block never gets to the completion block what I see is that the alpha property was set on the progress ring it disappears but the knob remains visible and is unaffected Im not sure whats going on but because of the strange behavior of the knob not getting the alpha set to Im assuming it may have something to do with your code change I wasnt sure if to write this here for context or open a new issue Regards Yariv Have you tried fixing this yourself This project is open source and Im a student with very minimal amount of time Please give an attempt at fixing the issue first before creating a bug report This saves everyone time and benefits anyone who uses the library Pull requests are welcome Add inReverse variable to UICircularProgressRing class to all the user to determine which direction the value label is counting warning This issue will be closed if the required information is not filled warning If its a question about something that is happening within your code base either post a small amount of code or post an example project where I can try to assist Make sure to communicate back and keep issue updated or it will be closed Version Version Any Details Has the question been answered here before No Please provide as much detail as possible below Hi First of all thank you for this awesome library Really appreciate your efforts My issue is I want to let timer run even after endTime For example i will give startTime to start the timer and endTime in order to complete circle per ring and I want the timer to run infinitely Is there any option available or how can I achieve it I have attached a video for reference Thanks ezgif comvideotogif Library should support SwiftUI and integrate with new framework nicely Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Currently do not have an easy way to place a background image that fits inside and only inside the rings Describe the solution youd like A way to send in a UIImage that fills the space inside and behind the rings matching the ring radius Describe alternatives youve considered Ive tried playing around by adding an Image View inside the UICircularProgressRing view and setting its radius to match that of the rings clearly this is smelly and the image seems to always sit on top of the ring thus hiding the ring Is there an alternative that is similar to what I have tried that may actually work I feel like this could be a useful and valuable feature to an already excellent library Try the following code func testProgress selfprogressViewouterRingColor UIColorwhite selfprogressViewouterRingWidth selfprogressViewinnerRingWidth selfprogressViewanimatePropertiesduration animations Void in selfprogressViewouterRingWidth selfprogressViewinnerRingWidth selfprogressViewouterRingColor UIColoralphaHex e completion selfprogressViewouterRingWidth selfprogressViewinnerRingWidth selfprogressViewanimatePropertiesduration animations Void in selfprogressViewouterRingWidth selfprogressViewinnerRingWidth It never sets the width to It goes from to then If you take out the second animation it pops to as expected Basically mixing animation and nonanimation doesnt work Also the color just pops midway through the animation from White to grey Theres no fade
