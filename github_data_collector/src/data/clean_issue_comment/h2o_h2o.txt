Hi I just found this URL Web Framework Benchmarks to benchmark the different web framework and the results shows the H O ranking as well as i found in the project README file that is very fast and also provides much quicker response i am not expert in benchmarking and analyze the results may it is wrong just i want to know is this benchmark valid or why the H O rank is not very good in different sections Regards Hi This PR adds h oprobelogrequest and h oprobelogresponse calls to hopefully the correct location in the http server code path I checked using Linux with h ohttpclient h olog that the probes are indeed triggered These macros arent used by h o but this header file is the first search engine hit for someone looking to polyfill OpenSSL so that a single program can work portably against either or Therefore it is helpful to the wider community if this header file contains the full polyfill for BIOMETHOD setters added in The two methods I needed polyfills for personally were BIOmethfree and BIOmethsetcreate The rest such as BIOmethsetgets are only for completeness following the logic above OpenSSL also adds getters such as BIOmethgetctrlbm I have no need for them myself but the same logic applies this useful header file should be a full polyfill for the benefit of the wider community The documented BIOmethgetsetreadex and BIOmethgetsetwriteex are new in and therefore code that wants also to work with shouldnt be using those Hi I am interested in your library libh o and and want to use it in CC I search for day and I can not find any useful manual to cover all ability and base functionality such as multithreading http message processing MIME parsing complex file serving and so on just found the simple document A warm welcome to libh o I am not application user I mean h o as webserver I want to use it as library for now i can add it to my sample C code and compile it and have a very basic functionality but need more to use advanced feature multithreading so on would you please help me in this regard I couldnt understand it access log is only global directive and there is no any other directive that i can see to set log files for vhost individually wiki page has information but it is confusing when i looked the default config file on freebsd installation for example access log information is written on top of the config file but in wiki page it is bottom of host configs like this one i also added this directive end of the host directive for only access log and error log but i couldnt see any error for config and h o web server does not use it these too it writes log on default location varlogsh o how can i handle logs more effectively for example to record logs into database like postgresql When i created a web site with self signed ssl and to test h o web server for this web site i also created web page which has only phpinfo command to show php setup information but if i use phpinfo and get the information about my installation I can only see the page as plain text without any css modifications and no php logo etc When i deactivated this header in h oconf it shows everything normally headeradd ContentSecurityPolicy defaultsrc https This patch removes a debug printf on receiving unknown frame type which could flood system log when a client sends a lot of unknown frame types This is necessary so that the length used here cant overflow the destination buffer hi I would like to try h o on dragonflybsd but i couldnt success about it Firstly one of the dependent port asked py setuptools and stoped to install than i install seperately python and develpysetuptools then i continue to install but this time mruby gives error and i thought i can skip that by canceling Mruby option from port option than i tried again but this time give error again and it says something is not there important file does not exist First Error Related to Python in this case dependent port python has not been
