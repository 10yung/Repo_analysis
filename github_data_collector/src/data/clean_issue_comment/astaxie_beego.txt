My application is Beego React Beego will also serve the React static files Reactrouter will handle routing for URLs in the frontend So we need to have a default route for Beego For example all URLs starting with api like apixxx will go to Beego backend and all other URLs like view admin should go through Beego and go into static files and let Reactrouter serve it Of course I can implement such a functionality with a custom filter and determine whether a URL is starting with api by myself But Im still looking for an elegant way to do this For example a default route so any URL that doesnt match any other api routes will go into this default route and let Beego serve static files the entry point of React Any suggestion post userlogin func LoginPost Please answer these questions before submitting your issue Thanks What version of Go and beego are you using bee version go Beego What operating system and processor architecture are you using go env windows xxx message label type AddTagForm struct Id string formid jsonid validRequired Name string formname jsonname validRequired label error message Please answer these questions before submitting your issue Thanks What version of Go and beego are you using bee version go windowsamd bee version v What operating system and processor architecture are you using go env win intelR i What did you do appname MyBeegoAPI httpport HttpsPort HTTPSCertFile conf wwwcnbundlecrt HTTPSKeyFile conf wwwcnkey runmode dev autorender false copyrequestbody true EnableDocs true EnableHTTPS true EnableHttpTLS true EnableHTTP true https goland http server Running on https server Running on go build exe http server Running on What did you expect to see https What did you see instead exe https Please answer these questions before submitting your issue Thanks What version of Go and beego are you using bee version What operating system and processor architecture are you using go env What did you do If possible provide a recipe for reproducing the error A complete runnable program is good What did you expect to see What did you see instead go run filter for all request before routing beegoInsertFilter beegoBeforeRouter filterFilter beegoHandlera Handler httpHandler beegoRouterb Controller getGet beegoController The Filter populates some values into the context of request the values is visible in the Controller but not for the Handler This is caused by pass the original req rather than the one in context The request in context is the one that the filters may modify PR fixes this issue The filters may do some changes to the request such as putting values in the requests context Signedoffby Wenkai Yin yinwvmwarecom
