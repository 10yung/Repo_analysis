trying to convert a VideoClipFile thats already loaded into memory and convert to a binary stream so that I can save it to a cloud storage system However the cloud storage system only accepts binary streams so I cant just use the normal save The other option is to write the binary stream to file then open it as a binary stream but if I have thousands of videos thats going to be too costly Thanks for the help
