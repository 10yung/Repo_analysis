 here myJobxml says next onfoobar tostep but the text says Decider is always returning the value foobar which forwards the execution to step shouldnt the xml also say tostep Adds profile payaramicroremote that runs single Payara Micro instance for a test suite Profile payaramicroremotecontrol serves for starting and stopping such instance Currently few tests fail Security because theres no security management in payaramicrodeployer and EJB timers that might hint at bug in deployment process Hi all Im reading Aruns book and I find it very good done Direct to the point without too much bloating discussions I was trying to launch the servlets examples in Docker but WildFly had problems to start because some not compatible dependencies from java with a moduleinfojava were being copied in WEBINFs lib I add the scope testshould be perhaps provided better At the time the book was written java wasnt around yet Thanks so much in advance for your feedback Bye Fabio Add a new sample to demonstrate EJBstyle interceptors using interceptor This is the Simple chat Demo But how to make the group chat in this case This testcase reproduces Payara bug This contains two sets of fixes The SAMs no longer return SUCCESS with emtpy principals for mandatory authentication The ServerAuthContext sets up two SAM module instances to satisfy the spec requirement that the mandatory flag can be accessed from the requestPolicy The first fix is important as currently the tests fail to return proper http status codes for unathenticated protected resources on multiple app servers The second fix is just for complying with the letter of the spec as the requestPolicy is not actually used in any of the current tests
