If I want to use cpu for training how should I modify the code Excuse me can you share your X times to rebuild the imagesse set BSD Urban Thank you Excuse me can you share your X times to rebuild the picture se set BSD Urban Thank you When I use the trained model you provided with C in opencv the image after super resolution appears sharply jagged How can I solve this problem Hello Can you tell me what is your experimental facility I used a GTX pc and a GTX TI pc for training network Both of these computers can not carry on the experiment Show the same errors as follow I solvercpp Iteration Testing net F syncedmemcpp Check failed error cudaSuccess vs out of memory Check failure stack trace x fd d e cd googleLogMessageFail x fd d e googleLogMessageSendToLog x fd d e b googleLogMessageFlush x fd d e e e googleLogMessageFatalLogMessageFatal x fd d caffeSyncedMemorymutablegpudata x fd d fd caffeBlobmutablegpudata x fd d c f caffeEltwiseLayerForwardgpu x fd d b caffeNetForwardFromTo x fd d b caffeNetForward x fd d d caffeSolverTest x fd d db e caffeSolverTestAll x fd d c caffeSolverStep x fd d a caffeSolverSolve x a train x main x fd d libcstartmain x e start nil unknown Aborted core dumped And I had ready modify the bathsize from to PSBecause of the limit computer memoryonly GB It seems that its impossible to process all training pictures in floder which named as Train I used only pictures to generate the train dataset that named as x h In fact there are pictures in training dataset floder I have no ideal whether it would influence the result in end if or not
