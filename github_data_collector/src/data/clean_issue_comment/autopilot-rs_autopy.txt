for sharing this wonderful tool I want to combine autopy with tesseract to do OCR onthefly without saving the image to hard disk I found this answer at but I got AttributeError Bitmap object has no attribute tostring when I ran the codes below bitmap autopybitmapcapturescreenrect bitmapencoded bitmaptostring Can you bring back the tostring function or at least inform me how to implement it Thank you in advance May you have a nice day Multiple display support is currently missing but would be nice to add Hi python crushes on windows if autopybitmapBitmap exceeds certain size in pixelsbytes On Windows Education version it always crashes on pixels its screen scale factor is it could be important imho On Windows Server Datacenter version it always crashes on pixels bytes its screen scale factor is On linux all fine autopy installed from official wheel Python conda Minimal example for replication python import autopy tmp autopybitmapcapturescreen lenbytestmp tmp autopybitmapcapturescreen lenbytestmp It should return but it crashes without any messages I need this to convert screenshots in autopybitmapBitmap to numpyndarray or PILImage as it described in UPD today on Windows Server Datacenter version it decided to crash with bigger images x Got the follow error message Using a raspberrry pi with buster piraspberrypi pip install U autopy DEPRECATION Python

wheel for Python to build on windows so I disabled that here the bit version builds fine Not sure what the cause is suspect it might be related to Will leave this issue open in case anyone wants to tackle it but putting this on hold for now since its a pretty big time investment and not sure how common this need is If youre interested in contributing it should be possible to reproduce this with cibuildwheel locally or against the CI by opening a PR Hi Modificators CONTROL SHIFT etc doesnt work in Windows only in Linux
