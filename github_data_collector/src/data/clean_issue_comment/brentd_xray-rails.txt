Using a fresh checkout of master and with Ruby the test suite fails to run with these errors FailureError DummyApplicationinitialize SprocketsRailtieManifestNeededError Expected to find a manifest file in appassetsconfigmanifestjs But did not please create this file and use it to link any assets that need to be rendered by your app Example linktree images linkdirectory javascripts js linkdirectory stylesheets css and restart your server specdummyconfigenvironmentrb in top required It seems that the test suite is incompatible with Sprockets Our Travis CI configuration only includes Ruby versions up to Sprockets requires Ruby Therefore we have no coverage of Sprockets or for that matter any coverage for current versions of Ruby Im trying to use xray in a dockerized project but it doesnt works Does anyone know how to make it work with Docker Resolves Ive used this gem before with success but I just tried adding it to an app that happens to have a strict CSP and am running into this error Refused to load the script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive scriptsrc self https strictdynamic sha nonceRNrEgMJkrdj D U IljIDQ strictdynamic is present so hostbased whitelisting is disabled Note that scriptsrcelem was not explicitly set so scriptsrc is used as a fallback I wonder if there would be an easy fix to make it work out of the box with strict CSP Could it be as simple as changing libxraymiddlewarerb n helperjavascriptincludetagscriptname n helperjavascriptincludetagscriptname nonce true I dont know if that helper can access the requests nonce from within a middleware but maybe Otherwise it could always use a regex to extract the nonce from the meta namecspnonce tag As a workaround I guess Ill have to disable my strict CSP in development but Id prefer to keep it strict in development as well so that I ran into any CSP issues sooner Reference Added support for runtime appendviewpath and prependviewpath instance methods in controllers So far xraybarhtmlerb partial have been raising ActionViewMissingTemplate if you call appendviewpath or prependviewpath in your controllers action because lookupcontext in that partial doesnt take over its viewpaths from your controllers action view We added additional view paths to Xrayrequestinfo struct using monkeypatch and now you can use appendviewpath and prependviewpath in your application When loading of jQuery is deferred the Javascript Xray script loads ahead of this and loads a blank object This is a stripped down approach to allow defer loading the script via a config option Hi guys We defer the loading of scripts in our asset pipeline this is causing Xray to load before jQuery and return an empty object On the page this loads as follows img width altScreenshot at src Is there a method in place to overcome this If not perhaps something like would work Thanks in advance I have been using xray for a while now and all of a sudden it stopped working a couple of days ago I removed all the browser extensions to make sure nothing is interfering with the gem Do you have any insights using ruby version radialgradient is now supported by all current browsers Also the cover keyword has been deprecated in favor of farthestcorner This fixes the following autoprefixer warning autoprefixer xrayrails appassetsstylesheetsxraycss Gradient has outdated direction syntax Replace cover to farthestcorner
