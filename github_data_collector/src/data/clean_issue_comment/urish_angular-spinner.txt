 is out of date Could you import v please Hi Uri I have added overlay on older angularjs spinner Please merge it on angularjsspinneroverlay branch Few folks are still working on angularjs version so it will be helpful for them Please let me know your thoughts if it doesnt seem fit to you Thanks Vikas Vaidya can we add overlay to whole page using spinner We added us spinner in our project and a preloader comes whenever there is a service call We managed to fade the page while preloading now there is a requirement that we need add a text under the loading spinner is it possible I think it is a cool feature to have if you can extend this directive that would be great Hi Urish thanks for the nice plugin I am facing a peculiar situation If I use spinnerkeyspinner my application is not all opening in IE If I remove and use only span usspinnerradius width length span then my application is working fine both in firefox and IE But when I use span usspinnerradius width length span even in firefox the problem I am facing is the place where I have used scopestopSpin there the spinner is starting and never stops The same is happening both on IE and firefox Instead if I use span usspinnerradius width length spinnerkeyspinner span the spinner starts and stops correctly and my application works fine on firefox but on IE the my application is not at all starting it just scraps off Please find my related post on stack overflow Hi Urish Thanks for the nice spinner The example plunker given on github showing the following error on ie object Error description Unspecified message Unspecified name Error number In my angular js application if I comment out span usspinnerradius width length spinnerkeyspinner span my application working fine on ie But if I uncomment this line the application is not at all running and is displaying the above error How can I fix it Please see the error image for reference spinnererror Getting default color from the element style is better than writing color constants in HTMLJS Especially when colors come from SASS variables Right now the code use attrspinnerKey to determine the key value However in many cases we want the key to be a variable that can be eval to some string keys This should be supported by adding a eval function Can we disable shade out the application background Something like jquerys block UI plugin Ive been using a different way of creating controllers so is not exactly as your example I cant get the spinner to start var myApp angularmodulemyApp ngRoute uibootstrap toaster angularSpinner angularmodulemyAppcontrollerproductsController functionscope modal http toaster usSpinnerService scopehey hey usSpinnerServicespinloadingproducts not working no errors thrown though My view is as follows h Productsh hey span usspinnerradius width length spinnerkeyloadingproductsspan hey is correctly displayed just as a reference Am I bringing the usSpinnerService service in an incorrect manner Thank you I though of asking this in stackoverflow but here you can also tag the issue as a question right sorry if not
