 I am faceing this issue in when i had updtae project gradle to Cannot choose between the following configurations of project library debugApiElements debugRuntimeElements releaseApiElements releaseRuntimeElements All of them match the consumer attributes Configuration debugApiElements Found comandroidbuildapiattributesBuildTypeAttr debug but wasnt required Found comandroidbuildapiattributesVariantAttr debug but wasnt required Found comandroidbuildgradleinternaldependencyAndroidTypeAttr Aar but wasnt required Found orggradleusage javaapi but wasnt required Configuration debugRuntimeElements Found comandroidbuildapiattributesBuildTypeAttr debug but wasnt required Found comandroidbuildapiattributesVariantAttr debug but wasnt required Found comandroidbuildgradleinternaldependencyAndroidTypeAttr Aar but wasnt required Found orggradleusage javaruntime but wasnt required Configuration releaseApiElements Found comandroidbuildapiattributesBuildTypeAttr release but wasnt required Found comandroidbuildapiattributesVariantAttr release but wasnt required Found comandroidbuildgradleinternaldependencyAndroidTypeAttr Aar but wasnt required Found orggradleusage javaapi but wasnt required Configuration releaseRuntimeElements Found comandroidbuildapiattributesBuildTypeAttr release but wasnt required Found comandroidbuildapiattributesVariantAttr release but wasnt required Found comandroidbuildgradleinternaldependencyAndroidTypeAttr Aar but wasnt required Found orggradleusage javaruntime but wasnt required As compile is going to be deprecated end this PR replaces with implementation that is the new usage thanks nice work First of all nice library and great animation However I think the interpolators at the moment is created based on some precalculated constants For example in ActionBarInterpolator private static final float FIRSTBOUNCEPART f private static final float SECONDBOUNCEPART f Override public float getInterpolationfloat t if t FIRSTBOUNCEPART return f t t f t else if t SECONDBOUNCEPART return f t t f t f else return f t t f t f The constants used in getInterpolation eg f are precalculated based on the values of FIRSTBOUNCEPART and SECONDBOUNCEPART If either or both of these values are changed the constant values need to be recalculated This limit users of this library from changing the value of FIRSTBOUNCEPART andor SECONDBOUNCEPART to whatever they want because if they change these values they have to do their own math to work out formulas for the interpolators So I think it would be nicer to provide generic formulas for interpolators with perhaps FIRSTBOUNCEPART and SECONDBOUNCEPART are variables to avoid users being worrying about the formulas themselves What do you think I know that this is not an issue but i would really appreciate if you give me this information Thank you First of all this library is great When do you plan to implement handling righttoleft layouts functionality It is just changing GUILLOTINECLOSEDANGLE constant to positive value
