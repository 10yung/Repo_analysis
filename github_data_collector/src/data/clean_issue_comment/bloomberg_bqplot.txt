I am trying to implement bqplot for larger dataset more than k data points However one issue is overplotting For alleviating the overwhelming perception load I intended to scale down the size of the markers No matter how I adjust defaultsize the marker size stays the same Also how to set a larger the display estate I would like replicate the same plot as matplot but using bqplot powers the interaction ideally Screenshot from According to the last build of latest was one year ago Dec Normally this happens each time something is pushed to master maybe theres something wrong with the repo setup This will fix it is an update of the MarketMap figure related to and The same way Map became a Mark MarketMap should be a Mark and not a Figure We should apply the equivalent patch maartenbreddels did in but this time for MarketMap debounced Deprecate Scatters defaultopacities in favor of opacities defaultcolors was deprecated in favor of colors in bqplot Other marks had opacities instead of defaultopacities so this will make bqplots API more homogeneous This is the first of several PRs for making Marks implementation more general by adding common marks logic inside of it For this purpose we need to make marks APIs more homogeneous Describe the bug Setting unselectedstyle after selectedstyle removes the selected marks styling To Reproduce selected This also fixes issues with selectedstyle and fontstyle not being properly applied
