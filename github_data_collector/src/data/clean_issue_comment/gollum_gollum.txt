This updates a number of assetrelated dependencies including a switch to sassc It works but downside sassc breaks jruby support due to native extensions We can choose to make sassc and sprockets development dependencies so that jruby is only supported with precompiled assets But then the jruby travis build would still fail Alternatively we have to hack conditional dependencies into gollum sass for jruby sassc for MRI When comparing many wikis one cant even start to compare without first having to deploy the solution Requires Gollum version Gollum b With an asciidoc page the history links and compare links are broken because they refer to pagemd file extension is always md and not to pageasciidoc if i manually change the URL to asciidoc everything works as expected See This will also allow migrating to SassC as the old ruby sass gem is deprecated Currently mathematical typsetting is provided by mathjax which potentially has a small bug due to the discontinuation of the CDN However for a few reasons mathjax is possibly less preferred than KaTeX for typesetting In particular the KaTeX project has more github stars and contributors than mathjax Further KaTeX demonstrates that they are faster than mathjax Currently gollums mathematical typsetting is hardcoded to be provided by mathjax eg with the flag mathjax Is it possible to have x also support KaTeX provided typesetting Work on is evolving steadily This is to document various tasks that still need to be performed before we can cut the release Any help also with documentation welcome Resolve the remaining issues under the x milestone Resolve the remaining issues under the corresponding milestone for gollumlib Note this currently hangs on a forthcoming release of rugged Update the following files in the root of the repository ISSUEmd HISTORYmd READMEmd Update the project wiki remove any old information on limitations security etc and update information on new features and funcationality thats current in the wiki Release Notes Compile and package static assets making sure they run out of the box Review and cleanup image assets Release new version of the adapters Release new version of gollumlib Set adapter dependencies correctly in gemspec and Gemfile Set default adapter correctly Release new version of gollum Set adapter and gollumlib dependencies correctly in gemspec and Gemfile Check adapter selection in tests Reviewcleanup licenses Githubs Primercss has been added to gollum for styling implemented in This issue is meant to track any styling issues that can be improved upon but also as an open invitation to improve the styling more generally Use Primer to style the breadcrumbs Box overlays Gollum currently uses custom dialog modals upload rename new When the switch to Primer CSS has been merged we should look into deprecated these custom modals for Primers Boxoverlay At the moment this package is still experimental I want to collect some suggestions for improvements regarding mobile devices here editor is not usable on my Android with Chrome v Android I use swiping to type on the virtual keyborad Doing so deletes characters from the editor text area Situation got worse with latest changes by dometto dont get me wrong Awsome work dometto Really appreciate your improvements Now als without swiping on the keyboard sometimes characters disapear Hard to describe I cant add empty lines at all get immediately deleted File upload is not really usable On the edit page I cannot dragndrop files to the editor area on a mobile Clicking the upload button and then the select file button only shows me limmited options on Android as a file source Camera Camcorder Downloads directory Copy and Paste does not work Thats what I found so far I could also investigate some of the issues just dont know when I can find the time
