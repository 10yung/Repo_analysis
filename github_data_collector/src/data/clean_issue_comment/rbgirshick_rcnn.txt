status this problem occurred at the beginning of the trainThe iteration did not startCould any one give me some help how will i be able to start matlab being in rcnn directory because i am unable to find matlab in any folder of rcnn thanks I tried the rcnndemo and no detections were made because all the scores were negative What could have happened I trained a simple model using my own dataset and the same thing happened Hi I have used the RCNNmodel that you have provided to get the results on VOC The thing is I could get MAP with the provided model while in the paper the lowest claim is Also you claimed MAP for RCNN in Fast RCNN paper while I have got when I trained my network Since I am using your code without any modification I think the problem is with the networks that I have used Is it possible for you to release the trained rcnn models mat files that you have used for VOC and using Alexnet and VGG Thanks so much I have a simple question after loading a trained model for classes can I limit the detection to a single class when I run rcnndetect I tried removing some of the strings in rcnnmodelclasses but it doesnt work I executive the command keycaffegetinitkeythen there is an error prompt Invalid MEXfile homelrjMatlabCodercnn rcnnexternalcaffematlabcaffecaffemexa usrlocalMATLABR abinglnxa sysosglnxa libstdcso version GLIBCXX not found required by usrlibx linuxgnulibgflagsso Hi I come across the following error when I run the demo code of rcnn Error using caffe Unknown command getweights Error in rcnnloadmodel line rcnnmodelcnnlayers caffegetweights Could anyone know how to fix it Thank you
