Ive tried to use pluck on the enumerized value but instead of returning the databased stored value it gets casted into a string Making it impossible for me to do an upsert as it needs the value itself Is there a way to make the pluck to return the values themselves using value doesnt work as I get an SQL error saying there is no such column or looking the value up in some other way just from a string Rails ships with a nice set of bulk insert features while these are not working properly with enumerized attributes inserting nils This PR attempts to add a support for these features into enumerize Guys I think that the way this library sets default values for enumerized attributes is wrong I am referring to this part of this method ruby if attrvalue attrvalueempty valueforvalidation valueforvalidationempty value Utilscallifcallableattrdefaultvalue self publicsendattrname value end It seems convenient in most cases But not in my case I use multiple true and have multiple default values And if an empty array was stored intentionally this if statement is getting triggered and here we got a set of default values instead of an empty set So generally it seems like this if statement should not be triggered for empty arrays But that is still tricky isnt it Seems like this library is just guessing what is the desired behavior So maybe instead of guessing it could be configurable We could have an additional option like allowblankempty Maybe not maybe we just have to treat empty arrays different For singular enums thats kinda hard to figure out whether that blank value is desired or should it be replaced with a default one And nobody complained before so its most likely not worth it wink
