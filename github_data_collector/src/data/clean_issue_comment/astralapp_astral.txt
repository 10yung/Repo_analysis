testassertions and spies deprecate old assertionmethods e e ba dad a Security The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th Bugfixes fix use Stringfield in lookup when checking for constructor d test add fluent API for testing Handlebars c ac c

can disable automated security fix PRs for this repo from the Security Alerts page details I wanted to create a tag named slam and figured out that I couldnt When exporting stars as JSON on the server the file I get back is only an empty JSON array Astral is loading forever by repeatedly adding all my stars to the untagged stars category resulting in duplicates and making the app useless As an example Please consider supporting compact style in sidebar That would lessen screen real estate used per each item in the sidebar Current style seems quite wasteful Please consider adding support for GitHub topics Dont mix them with users tags as theyre something different Topics are like creators tags so they should remain being discernible from users own tags Its so regrettable that GitHubs stars page is so limited It not only lacks filtering by topics it even doesnt show them Fixing these things via Astral will be a great UX improvement Mind that this is different request than one stated in Ive been using this app for almost years so I have over stars and lots of tags Today I decided to try the selfhosted solution so I could learn the codebase and possibly add improvements and PRs Everything works fine and I am glad it loaded my existing Astral data However I noticed it didnt populate my mysql database with all my existing stars and tags Thanks to the json export I see it would be possible to create an import script to bring in all the existing data However I wanted to ask if perhaps this is already possible and Im missing something Or if its somehow a bad idea to do this and it will break my selfhosted installation Per syropian TPS You cant sign in on mobile because the app is not optimized for mobile This request is to do so on some level
