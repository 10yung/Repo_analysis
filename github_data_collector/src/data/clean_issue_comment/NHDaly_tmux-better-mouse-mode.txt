Hi friends Unfortunately I havent had the time to maintain this package of late I havent been keeping up to date with the latest tmux in a long time My setup mostly works and I havent been spending much time tweaking it anymore Would any of you active users be interested in joining maintenance of this package If so please let me know either via an email or a comment here Thanks Hi I installed this plugin today but unfortunately the option emulatescrollfornomousealternatebuffer is not working properly for me Here is my configuration runshell configtmuxpluginstmuxbettermousemodescrollcopymodetmux set g mouse on set g emulatescrollfornomousealternatebuffer on Id like to be able to scroll in less using my mouse wheel but it doesnt work Heres

line per mouse wheel scroll click smoothest Scroll one line only on every other mouse wheel scroll click Scroll one line only on every fourth mouse wheel scroll click The and cause a Repeat Count Invalid error from tmux Love the plugin but it seems not work with my tmux setup Im happy to paste config files if requested Thank you for this TPM plugin I had been thinking about all of the different ways I could bulletproof my tmux scrolling hack I made a while ago the main idea was to contextually enable the ability to scroll up in history in a shell which isnt in alternate window mode via copymode and to naturally pass the event on into alternate window mode programs that enable mouse mode such as vim and to emulate arrow keys when the alternate mode program doesnt enable mouse mode such as less This makes for perfect UX This is exactly what you have done and it is a beautiful thing we can even configure exactly whether doing so in a different pane yanks focus to it or not I love it so much Now another concept that I was toying with in my mind is some method of addressing the disparity in when I change between using a mouse with discrete clicks and a Mac touchpad which is able to give the control of individual scroll clicks but also effortlessly flick to spam a lot of events So far we have config here letting us choose how many lines to scroll for scroll wheel emulation for the copymode scrolling and alternate mode arrow key emulation this is a linear one to one relationship to the mouse event I was hoping that maybe we could have a configuration that allows for acceleration here As we rapidly send a lot of wheel events it can increase how many lines each event moves This will make it more effortless to traverse larger distances with a traditional mouse wheel A drawback might be that on a platform such as macOS the end result is the combination of two scrolling acceleration behaviors I was going to use differing config between my different platforms though it should address that issue Disclaimer Im new to this plugin and tmux Im seeing the following problems scrolling up on my scrollwheel cycles through previous commands not history if I press Prefix first then scrollwheel works if I select some text I enter copymode and scrollwheel works if I keep left button pressed scrollwithoutchangingpane doesnt work Details below tmux V tmux

cancels The issue is that in and simple arrow keystrokes are sent but irssi needs those for bashstyle history browsing There needs to be a way to send alternate keystrokes for which bindings in irssi could then be defined Really nice project Im trying to get the emulatescrollfornomousealternatebuffer option to work and it does for less but not for git log I tried to understand how it works but I didnt get very far could you maybe explain how it detects which programs it should send arrow keys to to scroll Thanks Im running tmuxgit and copymode will exit upon scrolling back down to the bottom I think a cool feature could be if the Control key or other modifier key is pressed the number of lines scrolled are different For example if control is pressed lines are scrolled This can be done with a multiplier x or just another scroll speed variable Thank you for your time
