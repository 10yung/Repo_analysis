 Hello My Manjaro notebook has createap to share WiFi from the router to other devices just like now typing Windows laptop createap works generally properly but when download with high speeds Really annoying that notebook stuck to connect router and share WiFi after that downloading process begins It suddenly drops the connection what I use as an ap notebook to router and then other devices can not get Internet as a result Ive used nat also normal WiFi sharing mods on createap both dropped after download beginnings Bridge even no Internet on the ap notebook Manjaro notebook is Lenovo e It has TPLink TLWN N dongle to get better signals from the router I can not download anything without connection breaks always have to stop current process and restart createap which time consuming and ridiculous So how to solve this annoying issue Thanks I am using a Lan for connecting to the internet which my mac address is registered to the ISP so I only can connect via one device I am using createap script I have hidden my SSID and also changed the mac address but is there any other settings I can do make it difficult for anyone to detect my identity that I have shared a Hotspot i am usin manjaro and i have mis system updatedand when i ejecute create script apt the system crash and for work again i need pus the power button and shudown the laptop i use this syntaxis createap w novirt wlo enp s f u SSID password i have hostapd v On Ubuntu If I use the createap command on our router to setup the WiFi interface and connect to it with multiple devices here is what happens I can connect from any client device to the external internet I can ping the router from any client I can ping any client from the router I cannot ping one client from another client So it seems like there is some issues with routing within the subnet When I try to ping from one client to another I can see that the ARP request makes its way to the router but is not propagated to the other client device Any tips on what to look for would be appreciated Hi how to start second AP when hostapd already running Config dir tmpcreateapwlp s confAdBTYRH PID Network Manager found set ap as unmanaged device DONE wlp s is already associated with channel MHz fallback to channel Creating a virtual WiFi interface ap created Sharing Internet using method nat iptables v legacy unknown option toports Try iptables h or iptables help for more information Doing cleanup done Consider the following scenario a SBC running Ubuntu generates an AP with the command createap n wlan mynetwork mypassword A device connected to the AP sends some WIFI credentials to the SBC At the next reboot the SBC connects to the WIFI network instead of generating an AP I tried to implement this pipeline Since the createap script sets the interface as unmanaged for NetworkManager I tried to run nmcli dev set wlan managed yes nmcli dev wifi connect mynetwork password mypassword But this is not working Is there some other setting that is changed by createap that I have to take into account Avoid that everyone have to search for the error message find and then remove the file Just put that in the error message directly Hi under my Rpi with Archlinux Arm Ive installed Pihole and so the required piholeftl but since it conflicts with dnsmasq I had to remove it and now the script createap doesnt work anymore Since Ive read that piholeftl its just a fork of dnsmasq is there any chance to get it working by pihole side Thanks Marco
