this zte a dont have twrp yestarday i make it run but it compile every time more than mb recovery image And twrp LIE that new twrp is small of old I disable all busybox crypto And all issue was IN init init was compiled x MB compare with old twrp init is byte now i paste init from mediatek and it is impossible to compile I try with kernel source and prebuilt kernel When i paste new twrp with old twrp only move directory and init is old it run ut when run new twrp with new init x mb it dont run WHAT IS THE EXPECTED RESULT Explain what the expected result is as completely as possible WHAT HAPPENS INSTEAD Explain what happens instead as completely as possible ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Add any additional information you know about the issue such as possible causes and solutions Use and upload tmprecoverylog and the output of dmesg tmprecoverylog Link here dmesg Link here When I try to decrypt my Pixel using TWRP gatekeeper verification failed appears in the logs What does this mean and why is it relevant I am running an official build of TWRP downloaded from x I am running the latest version of TWRP x I have read the FAQ x I have searched for my issue and it does not already exist Device codename raphael TWRP version x WHAT STEPS WILL REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM I created a backup of all partitions except cache using TWRP WHAT IS THE EXPECTED RESULT I expect the folder datamisckeystoreuser which contains the Signal secret private key file and the registered fingerprints for example to be included in the backup WHAT HAPPENS INSTEAD I wanted to ensure that the backup contains the expected folder So I walked through the split data images and there the datamisckeystoreuser folder does not exist Restoring a previous TWRP backup didnt work and I had to wipe and start from fresh May be some more folders are missing I opened a recent TWRP backup from my OnePlus device and there the mentioned path exists in the backup I assume that restoring the newly backup made will also be not recoverable because its missing some crucial data Other content from the data partition like datadata or dataapp was included in the backup so TWRP was able to access this partition I dont know why it excluded some folders ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I already opened an issue for in the repo of the maintainer for this unofficial build and he mentioned that I should contact you tmprecoverylog there was an error while uploading Request Entity Too Large so Ive put it in my nextcloud added txt extension there so a short preview is shown dmesg I am running an official build of TWRP downloaded from I am running the latest version of TWRP I have read the FAQ I have searched for my issue and it does not already exist Device codename crosshatch TWRP version WHAT STEPS WILL REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM Update to android run TWRP via fastboot boot observe not asking for system password try to mount data profit WHAT IS THE EXPECTED RESULT Asks for password allows mounting of data system etc WHAT HAPPENS INSTEAD No password doesnt mount checkbox doesnt check ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Add any additional information you know about the issue such as possible causes and solutions Use and upload tmprecoverylog and the output of dmesg tmprecoverylog dmesg WHAT STEPS WILL REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM Adding TWOEMBUILD true to a devices BoardConfigmk and building WHAT IS THE EXPECTED RESULT Build finishes successfully WHAT HAPPENS INSTEAD The build fails with the following errors bootablerecoveryguiguicpp error unused label error WerrorWunusedlabel error bootablerecoveryguiguicpp error unused parameter allowcommands WerrorWunusedparameter extern C int guistartPageconst char pagename const int allowcommands int stoponpagedone errors generated In some devices fastboot can be locked down again thus rendering the smartphone somewhat secure again after setting a password in android of course Keeping TWRP installed in this case means a security hole anyone can just boot in recovery and just do whatever he wants This issue could be solved by saving a password somewhere in a file in the data partition I would advice against reusing sdcardTWRPtwrps because its readable by even unprivileged applications I am running an official build of TWRP downloaded from x I am running the latest version of TWRP x I have read the FAQ x I have searched for my issue and it does not already exist Device codename raphael TWRP version WHAT STEPS WILL REPRODUCE THE PROBLEM Make a backup WHAT IS THE EXPECTED RESULT The backup should restore perfectly as no errors were displayed on creation WHAT HAPPENS INSTEAD The dreaded extractTarFork process ended with ERROR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION Ive lost so much data over the years because my TWRP backups have failed and this happens to me on different devices Ive owned If the filesystem is even slightly corrupted when a TWRP backup is created the backup will fail to restore Backups can fail to restore even if the host file system appears to be fine seemingly at random e fsck should be run before the backup is created and the backup tarballs should be tested afterwards to prevent data loss
