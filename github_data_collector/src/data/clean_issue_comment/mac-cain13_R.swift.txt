error Use of unresolved identifier instantiate demo project link Rgeneratedswiftzip Seeing as using the new build system now the default in Xcode requires us to declare the correct output file in the run script I think we can avoid having to pass the output argument entirely when running the generate command For example our run script is configured like so img width altScreenshot at src Since Xcode generates the SCRIPTOUTPUTFILECOUNT and SCRIPTOUTPUTFILE environment variables when executing the run script we could just read these directly like we do with any other environment variable I guess that people who continue to use the legacy build system might not be defining the output file so to account for that the generator can just fallback to previous behaviour if SCRIPTOUTPUTFILE is missing The end result would be that the run script would be as simple as rswift generate ps thanks for such a great tool Im happy to help out on this ticket if you think its a worthwhile change The constants generated by RSwift make the open quickly feature of Xcode so messy and useless to some level Is there anyway like special comment on top of the constant that make them unavailable from listing in open quickly window Screenshot at This addition allows us to safely get an array of all the images contained within a namespaced folder it was chosen to only make this available for namespaced folders as this indicates these images are semantically grouped this is particularly useful where we want to dynamically or randomly pick an image from this group whilst maintaining the safety of Rswift This PR adds install instructions for using RSwift with SPM This is preferable for those starting new projects and wanting to avoid cocoapods given the nowwidespread support for SPM I changed it to be the recommended method however opinions may differ Please feel free to just add it as another option if thats preferable I installed with CocoaPods Then i got warning Rswift File could not be parsed as Info Plist from URL pathtoprojectmodulename SRCROOTprojectnamemypathInfoplist on xcode However i can use Rswift methods Using version Xcode CocoaPods Rswift RswiftLibrary BuildPhase iOS introduces native dependency injection for storyboard view controllers It would be truly awesome to add this feature for Rswift More here And whatever other new features exist in version that I forget about Also to Examples and other documentation The problem this PR is trying to solve What this PR does This PR introduces a new flag usedevelopmentlanguagedefaults which when passed will cause the NSLocalizedString macros to have the value option set to the translation value in the developmentLanguage if such a value is available and we are not using base localization Testing I could really use some insight on how to properly unit test this behavior End notes First time opening a PR please let me know if I missed something I love this project and use it in pretty much all my apps I think it would be great to have this functionality but please let me know if you think otherwise The current fallback behavior for NSLocalizedString checks if a table exists for a given locale but not if the key itself exists in the table This means that if a key is missing as often is the case for large products where the translations take a while to catch up then the key itself will be returned unless a default value is specified which currently only gets set for Base localization Projects using Rswift are prone to using keybased localization approaches meaning keys are not actual English sentences but string ids eg screenElementsomeSubElementmainTextSome very long winded text about something etc etc etc If you use key based localization and you have missing keys this effectively blocks you from releasing an app update until you get the translations since you dont want users to see meaningless strings which is not ideal Arguably if a release cannot wait for translations the next best thing would be to at least attempt to default the missing keys to the development language so that user impact is minimized
