I would appreciate it if the leaps and gstat packages could be installed Hello For a while I am looking for the file where the error messages are defined I want to change the language of them but I cant seem to find them Can you help me As per W specifications buttons default behaviour is to function as a submit button The buttons outputted have the following html button class dclButtonmodulebuttonR ZjR dclButtonmodulesecondarylight KYaF dclButtonmodulesmall VJc Hintbutton When clicking on the hint button within a form this causes the form to submit Adding the typebutton attribute to the button via HTML inspector causes the form to not be submitted This is an issue as we are wishing to embed DCL into a Moodle lesson activity and as the users to submit the answer they get from the DCL code they put together however clicking the hint button seems to submit the question page with an empty value as the user hasnt yet put a value in to the lesson form Bumps eslint from

did not show anything when print command used in scriptpy on Hello I use DataCampLight to create some small exercises in python Currently I work on a decision tree example and i want to plot that small tree In scikitlearn this done by using graphviz which is not available on the DataCamp Server Is there another way to do this best regards reisman It says in the documentation that datacamplight does all the heavy lifting by offloading the processing and environments for Python and R in Datacamps servers Is it possible to set up a private server instead and have datacamplight use that instead Thanks Im hoping to use this for teaching econometrics online but would need a few more R packages to do so wooldridge has all the example datasets from the popular Introductory Econometrics textbook by Wooldridge forecast has useful forecasting functions developed by Rob Hyndman dynlm has other useful function for dynamic linear models Thanks for your consideration
