Im guessing older versions of OS X stored newlines the same way as DOS Shows up as M in text editors in Linux and on Github These should be converted to newlines as in n Locked versions are kept for preservation sake This fixes a rather nasty crash on startup Unfortunately the github diff viewer doesnt work because of the Mac line endings I suggest pulling to fix this issue Fix on This doesnt really matter since one can still use Glider Edit to unlock them but it seems a little against the spirit of open source that you cant initially open them in the games own editor This makes development on modern computers much easier though obviously might cause issues for those who want to compile for legacy OS The checkedin house files are missing the resource forks which contain PICT assets In my copy of Glider Pro Slumberland has a KiB data fork and a KiB resource fork Only the data fork appears to be checked in Also the quicktime movies are missing the resource forks which contain the moov atom Quicktime supports storing the resource in a separate qtr file or flattening the files to a single stream
