My attempt at This patch works if the message the user selects from the search activity is one of the messages that are loaded when user first taps the conversation from homescreen I need help with loading older messages while getIndexOfuuid thismessageList in processExtrasBundle extras I have tried calling moveToMsg with the hopes that the onScroll function that loads more messages when user scrolls to top gets called Unfortunately this didnt work I cannot think of another fix please help I also did some refactoring moving things to functions so that I could reuse as much code as possible My attempt at resolving Voice recorder starts recording with Cancel Attach and Pause buttons I would suggest that the pause button is large enough and well placed so that the other two buttons are not accidentally pressed Not sure if this is sufficiently accomplished in my ui choice I have tested this a bit Feedback regarding my UI choices and code quality would be greatly appreciated In WhatsAppSignalTelegram you can quote a message very fast when you swipe the message to the right edge of the screen General information Version pcr Device Samsung Galaxy S Android Version Android stock Server name self hosted Server software ejabberd Installed server modules Stream Managment CSI MAM Conversations source PlayStore Steps to reproduce The user receives a message in Arabic or Persian text Im not sure if the length of the message matters but usually we are talking about a short message for example The user quotes this message and writes a reply Once sent the reply does not display properly because the right margin of the message bubble is cutting off some part of the text Depending on the reply the result can be minor or severe In the case where the reply is also in Arabic script its possible that the first one or two letters are cut off entirely which could make the message unreadable Expected result All the text should be visible within the chat bubble Actual result latintext arabictext General information Version Device Samsung Galaxy S Android Version Android stock Conversations source PlayStore Steps to reproduce At the screen to enter phone number Make it possible to paste the number into the field Currently long pressing on the input field does not trigger any action At the verification screen Allow to paste the four numbers into the fields by a single paste Currently long pressing lets one paste the number but its actually not entered This would make it even more quicksy and comfortable Feature Request After the suggestions to store received media in a percontact subfolder structure have been rejected for plausible reasons see eg Id like to ask again but formally now if it is possible to store the JID of the contact and optionally the timestamp in the filename to make it easier to filter files based on those criteria You might argue that the timestamp is already part of a files metadata in most file systems but depending on how you handle your files copy to other systems the timestamps might get messed up Now Filename stored consists of random hex characters not possible to distinguish from which contact media was received when just looking into the Conversations Media folders After Feature Request has been implemented Filename are named with JID of contact Timestamp and random characters eg contactjabberservertld randomhexcharactersjpeg Benefit Files can be distinguished and copiedmoveddeletedbackupedetc on a per contact base very easily Extension Make this configurable Make the pattern configurable either by letting users specify a mask or by giving some options eg JIDTimestamprandomextension TImestampJIDrandomextension FDroid Xiaomi Android MIUI Steps to reproduce have some text in clipboard other app or copy a message long press the input field Expected result Allow to PASTE PASTE AS QUOTE and other options Actual result Allowed to PASTE and other options Might be related to aka Xiaomi issue How to debug Hello I have a situation where a user has his local storage storageemulated that is getting quite full The user realised that there was plenty of media in storageemulated Conversations Is there a possibility to move that location to the sd card I already rad in another issue that Conversations is supposed to do that automatically but this is not happening on that users phone neither on mine Otherwise would it be possible to just provide a location manually The current media browser simply lists all received files chronologically which becomes quiet unclear and makes it hard to find a specific file if there are many Additional the view is reset once the browser is reopened and the search starts again Therefore categories would increase the UX a lot for example Time Today File File n Yesterday File n File m Octobre th to th File m File k File type Add titles like Images File File n Audio records File n File m Videos File m File k Currently only avatars are fetched and displayed of already joined rooms Itd be fancy if Conversations displayed all available avatars from the public list of Theres already an API for that
