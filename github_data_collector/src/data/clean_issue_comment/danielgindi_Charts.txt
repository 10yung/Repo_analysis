address when its half pie and width is larger than height draw bigger pie chart The key idea is to fake the radius and adjust the circle box when screen width height it should be the same as a full pie chart since the radius should be diameter anyway but when screen width height the radius is minwidth height to use the maximum space before after the portrait portion width height should not be

Details construction Essentially in the Platform files attempts to alias types to their AppKit equivalents for regular macOS apps works file but fails in Catalyst apps because while those are Mac apps Catalyst needs UIKit for certain things Basically I changed this line in four files if canImportAppKit to if canImportAppKit targetEnvironmentmacCatalyst Which causes the macro to skip over this on Catalyst apps Testing Details mag No changes to unit testing performed though I have successfully tried my fork in a Catalyst app and the changes above have no effect on the macOS demo app in the
