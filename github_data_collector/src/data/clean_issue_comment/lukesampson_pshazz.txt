Git completion isnt working for git commands example Type git ch then hit tab should result in checkattr display gitattributes information checkignore debug gitignoreexclude files checkmailmap show canonical names and email addresses of contacts checkrefformat ensure that a reference name is well formed checkout checkout branch or paths to working tree checkoutindex copy files from index to working directory cherry find commits not merged upstream cherrypick apply changes introduced by some existing commits Or something like it if the plan is to replicate what Oh My ZSH is offering Cmder

but have nothing to do with theming Current state of themes makes no sense in this regard eg agnoster enables ssh and z but agnosteralternate doesnt I believe that the onoff switches for these plugins should be in the config independent of the theme file It would be cool if it was possible to display paths like fish does obrazek Top is pshazz theme agnosteralternate bottom is fish The git root is in the iTerm ColorSchemes folder and I am currently in the terminal subfolder You can see that fish shows git info at git root also treating path beforeafter repo root differently in this case abbreviating the path before repo root just to single letters I believe this could be achieved by hardcoding git revparse showtoplevel in the theme to get the repo root path and determine the rest from full path but a cleaner and faster solution would be to get direct support from the git plugin Since the default theme displays only the current folders name I find it helpful to display the full path of the working directory on the window title instead of using a theme that displays it inline with every command Adding hostUIRawUIWindowTitle gl to prompt achieves that If you dont find this useful enough to add to pshazz Id appreciate any pointers about how to add this to my PS profile without overwriting pshazz NB I dont believe this issue is related to Using PowerShell Core I have a

gracefully rather than semiinstalling as currently occurs runs pshazz in current window but obviously on next startup Pshazz is not initialized properly when used inside pwsh PWSH and normal powershell use different profile locations Creating symbolic link for profile file is working PWSH powershell PROFILE C Users Ash Documents PowerShell MicrosoftPowerShellprofileps Powershell powershell PROFILE C Users Ash Documents WindowsPowerShell MicrosoftPowerShellprofileps Screen Already created symlink for profile Hi ive created a theme I can even do a PR to the project later and im very happy with the results But maybe it can become better All I need is a way to write a section of the prompt vars in the endo of the line My custom theme looks like this And I need one like this Is there anyway to do that Thank you
