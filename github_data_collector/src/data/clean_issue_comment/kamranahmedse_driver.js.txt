This PR ads autoprefixer to webpack configs postcssloader was already included in dependencies to automate adding vendor prefixes to CSS based on browserlist config defined in packagejson Note that changing browserslist configuration might also impact JS output since Babel preset also uses it I left values at defaults and on built it only impacted CSS The overlay prevents anywhere else on the screen from being clickable Having the ability to make this option would allow for more interactive tours ie click this button to continue or autocomplete options being clickable whilst a highlight is active Hello Im a new open source contributor and Id like to make an effort on this project to solve some existing issues This one is about make title optional Please feel free to give me any feedback about the change Thanks Seems like title is required when a description is set It would be nice to be able to skip the title and only use the description instead It would be nice if it was possible to add custom classes to each button so that they can be styled consistently with the web page For example current version var driver new Driver animate true nextBtnText Next prevBtnText Previous new feature of adding classes to buttons var driver new Driver animate true nextBtnText Next nextBtnClass btn btnprimary prevBtnText Previous prevBtnClass btn btnsecondary Can we pass component HTML Element for popover to render Currently it accepts only description eg driverhighlight element someelementid popover title some title description This is description position top component button Either description or component can be passed on Hey guys i am using driverjs in an ionic project While using slider the driverjs not work correctly Because of the overflownoneimportant in the driverjs css the real overflow of the slider get lost and the app always shown the first slider page Please change the overflowhidden important to overflowhidden In my application has a sidebar with button for toggle width hide or show When add step in this button and user click in this button the stage position crash Exists idea for fix this or options in current version for fix this See this simulation simulation This is because the red circle changes position when clicked Since Thank you I am developing for an intro that some steps dont highlight anything but just have a dialog in the center of screen Cannot have any existing api to achieve that Added the possibility to add the property elementPosition to a DriverStep When this property is set to fixed the popup and the stage will be positioned fixed This fixes in issue in which the tooltip would not stay on the highlighted Element when the user scrolled It was not enough to set the position to fixed on all fixed highlighted elements because a child of fixed position element is itself not fixed but behaves that way because of its parent
