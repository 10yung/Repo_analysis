Hi As one of Andrew Ngs ML lecture learners your repo is AWESOME If there is a Korean translation I think it could help a lot of students studying in Korea If you allow may I translate this in Korean Changed If of features is use Normal Equation to If of features is use Normal Equation Removed from to remove error in matlab when running script as per pull request Removed the from the to get rid of error checked against current Matlab operators here is not a listed operator Might have been in the past Script runs now with no errors Matlab R b Solution of the programming assignment on bias vs variance I think that the mu and sigma values are feature specific so for each feature we need to apply its mu and sigma In linear regression variable I have the following error Error File computeCostm Line Column Unexpected MATLAB operator Error in run line computeCostX y theta When I debug the following code for i numberOfTrainingExamples gradient gradient hypothesisi yi Xi end it returns error in gradient wrong dimension I figured an alternative by replace loop statement by grad msumhyX grad end mhyX end theta end gradient has same dimensions as of theta
