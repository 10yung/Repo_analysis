 Description This PR implements the ability to display memory in GiB instead of MiB The default is to use MiB to preserve current behaviour The precision for both used and total RAM can be set These precisions both default to I also noticed a single character whitespace misalignment and took the liberty of cleaning that up in this PR too Features Memory can be shown in GiB using memoryusegbon Precision for both used and total GiB can be set separately using memoryusedgbprecint and memoryusedgbprecint Issues Requested as a feature in TODO NA Neofetch version Screenshot Config file Verbose log Hi I am trying to arrange the info from neofetch in an aesthetic manner but cannot find a way to disable the disk subtitle from being prefixed with something that throws the infobars from CPU useage and memory out of alignment It would be amazing if an off or none flag could be tried Thanks Just as the title states trying to display and image in the neofetch output doesnt work when using gnometerminal pretty much using the same exact config that I use in Konsole which works Ubuntu Description There are two issues on Chrome OS First the etclsbrelease output has changed and has an extra line thats being matched when trying to detect the version The regex needs to be more specific Ill open a PR with that once I get the second issue figured out A second version line was added for the Android support that was added a while back Second the Chrome OS ascii logo only shows when using distroshorthand tiny If I add another before Chrom then it works but I figure theres some other

Screenshot from Config file Verbose log id like if there was a option to turn off disk useage percent as i cant find once to turn it off Description Using Linux Mint on an ASUS Maximum Hero VII motherboard the Host is reported as All Series traced this to the fact that neofetch builds host by concatenating the contents of sysdevicesvirtualdmiidproductname sysdevicesvirtualdmiidproductversion

simply the black sheep here in terms of the Linux kernels support of dmi id But it looks a lot like a better host string for this scenario could be built from boardvendor and boardname than from productname which is poorly filled getmodel already does clean up of dummy OEM data at the bottom and removes System Version and arguably should also remove All Series as a aknown ASUS OEM dummy That would leave model blank We could add a little section after the cleanup that falls back to bard info if its available Something like if f sysdevicesvirtualdmiidboardname f sysdevicesvirtualdmiidboardversion then model sysdevicesvirtualdmiidboardname model sysdevicesvirtualdmiidboardversion to run at end if model is empty That would report Host MAXIMUS VII HERO Rev xx on my box Mind you for board info the vendor is also useful but hey thats a minimal analog to missing product info for the machine I could happily submit a PR if it helps when I find time Im guessing this arises because I built the PC and is an issue only for people who build their own PCs from bits as in I put this board into a case and here we are um aparently ubuntu cinnamon will be a thing so hopefully we will get ascii thingy soon Description Using default configuration terminal console output is unreadable To restore it reset command is needed or restart If youre suggesting a new feature then just a description will suffice Problem can be resolved by changing colorblocks to off Neofetch version Screenshot Selection Config file Verbose log Run neofetch vv neofetchlog Upload the
