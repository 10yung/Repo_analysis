Please let me know if that is possible to achieve this using PDTSimpleCaelndar Hi We noticed an issue recently where even though we give as firstlast date it displays a different date I got to the conclusion that you take into consideration the timezone when using the dates Do you know if we can prevent this See attached screenshots screen shot at screen shot at When I tried to use UIAppearance properties with PDTSimpleCalendar I saw odd behavior and dug in further In an unsurprising case Apples documentation on how to create a UIAppearanceContainer is skimpy and sometimes wrong After digging into the code and discussing it with engineers in the WWDC labs I have made these changes The engineers involved have requested that I file a documentation bug with Apple Which I am doing Primarily I have moved the default properties into initialize and then used them in the didMoveToWindow Almost all custom accessors have been removed This allows a cleaner execution model and is the WWDC labs consensus preferred implementation The code is now shorter aligns with the UIAppearanceContainer pattern and works Is it possible to set two month per page means when calendar initialise there are two months par page then when user scroll then display next two month par page is it possible Hello I know this is good demo and good example code But in my issue In My ios App that developed By Other Developer and set the SimpleCalender But Now i want to set the RangeCalendar instead of the SimpleCalender But I dont know how to do this Other Developer Code is Like DatePickerViewControllerh file interface DatePickerViewController PDTSimpleCalendarViewController DatePickerViewController is simple view controller And in DatePickerViewControllerm File voidviewDidLoad super viewDidLoad self setDelegateself selfweekdayHeaderEnabled YES selfweekdayTextType PDTSimpleCalendarViewWeekdayTextTypeShort PDTSimpleCalendarViewCell appearance setCircleSelectedColor UIColor defaultColor PDTSimpleCalendarViewHeader appearance setTextColor UIColor defaultColor So Please Guide me and Help me where i set and where i change in code For set RangeCalendar Thank s in advance archfear craigmcc tirsen tewha philvarner PDTSimpleCalendarTestsHostApp Assertion failure in UIApplication runWithMainScenetransitionContextcompletion BuildRootLibraryCachescomapplexbsSourcesUIKitSimUIKit UIApplicationm PDTSimpleCalendarTestsHostApp Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInternalInconsistencyException reason Application windows are expected to have a root view controller at the end of application launch Dear author can increase the hours minutes I hope you can reply to me Thank you for your Hi I came across this amazing lib I saved me a lot of time and designing But one question about it How can it be set in a page of a specified date initially but not in the first date page
