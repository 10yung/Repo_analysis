This closes It automatically builds libv with Travis CI and publishes it to GitHub Pages I only added ACPI build but normal build can also be added if needed File as well as sourcemap will then be published to ghpages branch However compaling fails because of some error at least on Travis CI on my repository javalangNullPointerException No warning class for name ambiguousFunctionDecl at

fails So it may be problem with newer version of Closure Compiler I tried to use Arch Linux via v on your website to download the v sources via git and it failed The way it failed it looks like there are files that the the Arch Linux image thinks it has that arent available to it jor kjs GET filesystemjs Uncaught Error Could not load file icopysharchusrlibgitcoregitremotehttps Going to I get this Not Found The requested URL archusrlibgitcoregitremotehttps was not found on this server Apache CentOS Server at icopysh Port I know this occurs for these files I first noticed this problem a few months ago and at the time I ran a few other commands and was able to find some other files that also appeared to be missing from the server but I didnt write up an issue at the time and now I dont remember which files they were Redox OS is an OS written in Rust Trying to boot the latest ISO from fails I allocate MB RAM and MB VRAM This is the text output it seems to freeze afterwards SeaBIOS

build libv js on Travis CI at every commit and publish it to some server or GitHub Pages This would be very good because users then wont need to install and configure Closure Compiler and other build dependencies Can you also configure Makefile to also build sourcemap file for libv js Also the version on your website is very old from Can you also update it So I was in the middle of setting up Windows and before it could show drives to install Windows on it got a BSoD I retried the same thing happened again It has the error code x B xF xC x x and says INACCESSIBLEBOOTDEVICE The ISO I have has worked in the past for every emulator Ive used and I even tried retrying it via VirtualBox QEMU the ISO works I decided to try setting up Windows K since the furthest edition of Windows uploaded for the public was Windows and I wanted to try something new as well Capture Ive been trying to figure out how to get the Arch Linux image to be able to connect to the internet the way the Linux image does but I cant figure it out I found an old issue which indicates that the Arch Linux image could connect to the internet previously but running udhcpc as is done for the Linux image tells me bash udhcpc command not found running busybox udhcpc because the udhcpc binary on the Linux image is a symlink to a busybox binary tells me udhcpc SIOCGIFINDEX No such device and running dhcpcd w as described in results in this dev loaded udev no valid intervaces found timed out forked to background child pid number Ive tried several times to dig into this more but Im having difficulty understanding it Originally noted in issue To reproduce On the Windows demo play a wave sound file and as it is playing hover the cursor over the play button Expected The tooltips should show up immediately and the sound playback should be uninterrupted Observed The sound is interrupted and only when you move the mouse does the tooltip animation start to update and the next sound fragment is played Other kinds of animation also produce this effect eg opening the start menu opening menus and minimising the window I have a x Windows ISO I have used to boot to on your website It works perfect on VirtualBox except when I tried it on your website it went fine until it started downloading display and VGA drivers by default It all became packed into small pixels and I made it send CTRLALTDELETE which rebooted the OS only finding out the display and VGA were screwed forever I converted it to a IMG file it works perfectly so is it that ISO files are supported just not stable or is it that its just my ISO I found it on winworld and I am not sure if it has been modified slightly or if its v Hi Im trying to upgrade to a later seabios but getting no where getting blank screen after updating seabiosbin and vgabiosbin which options did you use to compile the current version I see you removed the config file here which indeed doesnt fix the issue Any clues would be helpful
