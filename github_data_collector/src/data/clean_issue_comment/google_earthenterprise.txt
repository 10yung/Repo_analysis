Scons uses python on EL This causes issues with installing specific dependencies For example GitPython is required for building both open and portable however since portable is built using python you must install GitPython on both python and python which if done using yum as install instructions suggest causes python GitPython to work incorrectly To Reproduce cat the scons executable and notice that the shebang specifies the system python Expected Behavior Scons explicitly uses Python Installation instructions specify that python packages be installed on Python This fix was already merged into master but there was talk of wanting to merge this into if possible So here is the PR if we want to do that tstccamp tstrcrihfield tstdsugar Wed probably want release notes updated as well but it looks like theres still an open PR for that so Im guessing best to handle it there tstmswartz The original issue is Verification steps Set up a reverse proxy to a GEE Server with a WMSserved map Do a GetCapabilitiesRequest to the proxy server and see in the response that OnlineResource points to the proxy server Viewing a WMS source should work wether using a reverse proxy or not Fixes an intermittent failure in the integration tests where an asset finishes building before the test can check that its in progress Added an option to config for setting the maximum allowed percentage difference between the size of the cache and size of the dirty map Implemented check for whether or not to prune the cache when Add or Remove is called determined by whether or not the percentage difference of cache and dirty map size exceeds the configured limit The flag indicating whether a database is the default is stored in the publishcontexttable However if the Open GEE installation is upgraded from an older version such as the publishcontexttable may be empty This causes some queries to return no results making it appear as if published databases were not published at all Describe the bug The slack landing page doesnt load and it is controlled outside of the earthenterprise admin group To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Click on the link on the GitHub home page for the repo or here The page doesnt load Expected behavior A page loads allowing the user to sign up for the Slack chatroom Additional context One solution would be to migrate the slack chat over to Gitter We have evaluated this before but it was mostly redundant between the services so didnt keep it around However now that the Slack link is not stable I believe its worth revisiting Trying out a new system PRing rsts separately from published files to streamline review process Opinions welcome Refactors the job loop to make it easier to retry failed commands This PR should not include any function changes only refactoring and new unit tests The unit tests were written as early as possible during the refactor and used to ensure that changes did not break or change functionality Addresses To verify Build and publish a map or globe Use cutter to create a polygonbased cut with Polygon Level under Advanced set to Note If your polygon is not very small then the cut will take a very long time Zoom all the way in before making the polygon or use a very small polygon from a KML file I performed my testing for this on CentOS
