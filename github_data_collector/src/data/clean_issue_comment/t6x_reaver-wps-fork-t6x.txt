Hello If I try to run the latest inbuilt version of WashReaver I get this error a href src titlesource imgurcom a So I downgraded to v which runs ok but than I get new problems If I run Reaver on its own it just wont associate a href src titlesource imgurcom a If I do the association manually than I get this a href src titlesource imgurcom a Wifi chip that Im using is Realtek RTL AU Injection and everything else seems to work just fine Anyone knows what could be the problem here The first problem was wash i wlan X ERROR pcapactivate status X PCAP generic error code couldnt get pcap handle exiting Problems solved by comment There is now a second problem wash i wlan X ERROR pcapactivate status X PCAP no permission to open the device couldnt get pcap handle exiting When attempting to use

called from resendlastpacket sendc I have tried moving closer to the router too Are there any other mac compatible pieces of software that I can use to handle authentication aireplayng isnt supported it seems Hi I am still learning about all the details having said that Ive been able in the past to get the pin for a PSK enabled routers This time I am encountering this issue with reaver stuck at and keeps on repeating the same key after its done so many keys I was reading the following link and someone suggesting I should modify the code to bypass this problem but I am not sure why the latest version still have this as a problem when it goes way back From the link above I sort of understand what the problem is but I would like to know what is the right way to fix this issue and if there is a simple solution since its been a long while I am using Reaver v in latest Kali Here is my reaver command line for a Broadcom router with PSK enabled reaver i wlan mon b xxxxxxxxxxxxxx c k v S N When I rean reaver initially it always displays the msg Found packet with bad FCS skipping then it starts and after hours or so it got stuck at the first pins are Now if I try reaver to start with a specific pin it just keeps on repeating in an endless loop Thanks Trying to compile Reaver using my Android LG G D that has LineageOS Linux localhost Lineagega e SMP PREEMPT Wed Jun UTC armv Android I was hoping that I would be able to compile washreaver latest source on Android and then use nexmon drivers to turn my Android phone Broadcom wireless card into monitor mode or use an Android supported external USB Wifi card However the WashReaver source code did not seem to compile successfully at all I installed Termux android app I then installed make clang libpcap libpcapdev configure seemed to create a configstatus and configmak However when trying to do a make I get the following error wpsmono In function monitor datadatacomtermuxfileshomereaverwpsforkt xsrcwpsmonc undefined reference to ualarm wpsmono In function parsewpssettings clang error linker command failed with exit code use v to see invocation make Makefile reaver Error According to it says the following ualarm is not implemented in Android version of libc bionic check Bionic unistdh Moreover ualarm is obsolete The answer is in the Linux ualarm man page This function is obsolete Use setitimer or POSIX interval timers timercreate etc instead fadden May at Can we change wpsmonc to use timercreate instead of ualarm by default or something or if the OS is android or does not support ualarm or is there a better way to compile it Thanks Could the following ENC encryption type WPA WPA OPN CIPHER CCMP TKIP AUTH PSK Please be added to the wash j Json output for all networks as seperate values Including wash a all openencrypted devices Similar to what airodumpng outputs Thanks From my little understanding on the subject once first four numbers of the pin have been correctly guessed by Reaver or bully it will then proceed to bruteforce the other as the th digit is the checksum of all Did i get it right I have noticed that there might be few routers with WPS that do not follow that pattern as either reaver or bully gives Exhausted secondhalf possibilities without success Would it be possible to add a switch to carry on with the second part of the pin cracking the same as a first part I have a laptop with a bcm wireless chipset I installed the broadcomwl drivers and enabled its monitor injection mode based on the instructions at following that i performed a check using the airodump i prism command which seemed to suggest it was constantly capturing packets identifying beacons handshakes and when supplied with the wps flag it identified wps data as well using airodump to actually dump the packets data into a file and having wash use that file produced proper information about the networks similar to what airodump was showing the issues are wash does not work with the interface directly it just does nothing when supplying the info to reaver directly based on the file captures it gets stalled at waiting for beacon and does nothing What are your thoughts about adding an easier method to output the WPS configuration methods in json for example wpsconfigmethods wpsconfigmethodsstr Label Push Button Virtual Display according to Wireshark the bit values for the WPS configuration methods are USB Ethernet Label Display External NFC Internal NFC NFC Interface Push Button Keybad Virtual Push Button Physical Push Button Virtual Display Physical Display Hello pin

reaver b xxxxxxxxxxxx p c i wlan mon vvv N T r w without N option the transaction would just fail I can only reproduce this result above by adding N I tried using this method to connect with the
