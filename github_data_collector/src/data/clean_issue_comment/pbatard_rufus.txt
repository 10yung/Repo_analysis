everywhere I can not see it in device manager through disk part in windows nowhere I have no idea what happened this USB was used for years without any problems till booting with Rufus Do you have any ideas how can I restore my USB to make it work again I was not able to checkbox all of the above because immediately closed Rufus Hi I just installed Windows and tried to do VHD with installer from

desktopamd iso Actually a got it via zsync which has a builtin checksum test Issue description When creating persistent a live drive Rufus makes an ext file system in the partition for persistence This file system has errors It is still possible to use the file system for example with Lubuntu but Part of the drive space in the file system is lost wasted compared to a healthy file system when Lubuntu or other flavours of Ubuntu is booted This might not be seen when connected to an operating system that is already running The size of the lost drive space is small in a GB pendrive significantly bigger in a GB pendrive and huge ina GB SSD I used an SSD in several test runs because the loss is so big that it very easy to see and also because it is a high speed device so that I could do several tests within a rather short time The errors in the file system may not create any corruption of files in the beginning but I am afraid that it may cause severe problems later on When booting liveonly I noticed that a log directory was mounted and some of the errors are that some inodes have links I tested various things in three different computers and another user tested it in a fourth computer I ran standard Windows fully up to date in two computers and a Windows Insider version fully up to date in the third computer After some repetitions things started to look good but when I specified the starting conditions in a strict way I could reproduce similar not exactly the same size of lost drive space Original drive a standard storage device with FAT Oriignal drive zeroised completely overwritten with zero bytes In these cases between GiB and GiB were lost already marked as used by df h when booting into the persistent live system for the first time A single test starting from exFAT showed GiB lost drive space Thinking aloud It seems to me that the tool to create the file system is buggy or is using some buggy or not compatible system software dllfileOr maybe you could fix it by compiling with some flags for more strict less optimized for speed operation Or you could test if there is a version for ext or ext that is more robust I think that ext gets much more attention than ext nowadays Repair I tested that it was possible to repair the file system with e fsck f and then there was no lost drive space only the normal amount reserved to management and similar size as that of the linux tool mkusb Reformat I tested also that it was possible to reformat the ext file system with AOMEI Parition Assistent the freeware version and that file system was working almost correctly there was a Resize inode not valid message But no other complaint not the huge amount of errors caused by Rufus and there was no obvious loss of drive space for the user Final words I wish that you will fix this bug or find a way around it soon and I am willing to help with testing when you have new versions of Rufus or simply new ways to set the conditions to make it work

start to add the frigging Windows subbuild number in our version detection because its starting to become a bit difficult to tell Windows version apart for instance there are two official H ISOs using Build How does winver gets the subbuild number Use VDS for GetDrivePartitionData and use this opportunity to call on IVdsVolumeMFGetFileSystemProperties to get the file systems Or we might switch to using WMI as Microsoft advises and create our own C wmi library interface Also we should use VDS to query data for label sanitization Detect if ReFS is available eg Windows Pro Workstation vs Windows Pro and only offer the option if it actually is Are we losing our toolbar buttons as some people are reporting in Hirens WinPE x rarr Well the issue is that the buttons are there but the icons arent displayed most likely because the ImageList or CreateIconFromResourceEx function calls are broken on Hiren Also it seems that the Hiren people screwed their users by using SSL libraries that cant handle recent TLS so you get the This SSL library is too old message Add a prompt about cycling port on x Im seeing triple screen on our protective GPT MBR notice on one machine Should we replace the hlt in gptS with a loop The FormatEx API appears to be very temperamental about formatting drives at times eg GPTNTFS with a fixed large drive repeatedly throwing errors such as Volume is in use Zeroing the drive tends to help but is there something we could do about that If we see a Small FAT x partition with a large size typical of unpartitionned drives we should probably not report it Switching from GPT to MBR without cycling seems to be an issue eg UEFINTFS rarr FreeDOS What on earth does one need to do to get Windows to actually refresh its layout Add a separate checkbox to enable Fido UI should be disabled during port cycle until we detect the cycled device again with timeout in case the user yanked the device Label changed by the user should not revert to ISO label once the drive has been created Sometimes VDS can be super slow for no reason rarr This seems to happen when no drive letter has been assigned Possibly VDS doesnt like that we exclusively lock the physical drive Should we drop locking if we dont have any letters Add a note about efi boot bootx efi not found in the FAQ Create a new Surely DD mode should be default over ISO for ISOHybrid FAQ entry x Its possible using ImgBurn to create dual UDFISO images that fail when trying to open them as UDF with Could not locate UDF root directory see RDriveImageUDFFailiso rarr Looks like an ImgBurn compliance issue with UDF as even zip cant open a pure UDF image from ImgBurn anyway Could we add a UEFINTFSlike second partition for BIOSonly bootable media to warn UEFI users that they need to recreate it like we do with the MBR bootloader for UEFIonly media x bf d b cde afcabeba b c d Im still seeing drive letters being dropped after creating flash drives Do we have an actual issue here rarr This could have something to do with using DefineDosDevice in AltMountVolume when formatting ext partitions as were going to remove the letter when we we call AltUnmountVolume We probably want to look at drive locking and ext as we are most likely too lenient about this in x b f ca f cb db Formatting null on slow format Maybe we should pick our ETATransfer speed code from WinSCP instead of wget Itd be nice to have a better formatted message for UEFIonly BIOS warning message using the second block for the message so we have more space Do we want to add the Linux Foundation Preloader to UEFINTFS for Secure Boot whiners The problem is there only appears to exist an x version of it PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY You MUST read and complete the checklist below by placing an x into each so that it shows x NOT x or x BEFORE clicking on Submit new issue Failure to perform these steps WHICH ARE ONLY THERE TO HELP YOU will result in the issue being dismissed without warning Checklist x I looked at to see if my question has already been answered x I performed a search in the issue tracker for similar issues using keywords relevant to my problem such as the error message I got from the log x I clicked the Log button or pressed kbdCtrlkbdkbdLkbd in Rufus and copypasted the log into the line that says FULL LOG below x The log I am copying is the FULL log starting with the line Rufus version xyz I have NOT removed any part of it Additionally if applicable I ran a bad blocks check by clicking Show advanced format options then Check device for bad blocks and confirmed that my USB is not defective I also tried one or more of the following Using a different USB drive Plugging the USB into a different port Running Rufus on a different computer If using an image I clicked on the button to compute the MD SHA and SHA checksums which are therefore present in the log I copied I confirmed by performing an internet search that these values match the ones from the official image Issue description Sometimes grubconf has multiple LABELs in single line something like linuxefi imagespxebootvmlinuz inststage hdLABELCentOS x x x instkshdLABELCentOS x x x acpiosiLinux quiet But the conversion code in isoc converts LABEL once so the second LABEL doesnt get converted isoc fixconfig replaceintokendata Would it be possible to call replaceintokendata multiple times until nothings converted Or any better solutions will be appreciated Thanks Soohoon Checklist x I looked at to see if my question has already been answered x I performed a search in the issue tracker for similar issues using keywords relevant to my problem The speed comparison in your website and the README file are completely outdated It would be a good idea considering Rufus had major changes since v that was years ago Also the UNetbootin link redirects to the new official link which is and the versioning for their program appears to be different Latest one is According to properties the software is still v but for some reason they never changed that Also the windows link loads the microsoft website which tells you to download from codeplex which redirects you to archivecodeplex which tells you the project is on a microsoft link It would be better to just link the file download than going through several links Test new Rufus release v Update UNetbootin link with the newer one Test newer release of UNetbootin Update Windows link Test with Windows Ubuntu and any other OS that seems relevant Maybe BSD one This could go something like this User would create a text file with the same name as the ISO but with a specific extension For instance if you use enwindows x dvd iso you would create a enwindows x dvd ruf or something in the same directory The ruf file would contain simple commands like d sourcescversionini r sourcesbootwim Cmydirmybootwim i CmydirEIcfg sourcesEIcfg to delete replace or insert a file onto the target USB during ISO extraction First of all thank you for a great utility Does Rufus support command line argument So that you can specify an ISO when starting Rufus Something like rufusexe isowin iso If not would you consider adding that feature Thank you for your time Best regards Bob Such as the one from DOSUSB ISO as well a regular DOS ISO data Basically this would copy what are expected to be DOS files to a DOS bootable USB We may also want to handle pure image executables such as the ones used on Memtest ISOs through Syslinuxs image load or something Might also be able to use something similar to this script details summarygeteltoritoplsummary
