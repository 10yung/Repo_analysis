 Context and Description A description of the issue As a new user of Kitura and in light of the news IBM is going to withdraw from Swift Im thinking about switching to Vapor as I am very concerned now about putting a lot of effort into building something on a potentially dead end platform Thoughts Environment Details Information about your OS Swift version and Xcode version if on macOS Steps to Reproduce etc Expected vs Actual Behaviour Expected to happen Actually happened When I build my Kitura project without any updates packageurl upToNextMinorfrom packageurl from on my new Mac macOS Xcode Swift project builds and runs fine but local path location does not work Engine can not load any stencil template or serve static files When i trigger something like try resprenderindexstencil context title title response is The operation couldn t be completed KituraStencilStencilTemplateEngineError error Not any css or js files loaded in static html files rendered via respsendhtml from static files directory I set breakpoint at fileServerserveFilefilePath requestPath requestPath queryString queryString response response in sample project KituraStaticFileServerswift and got filePath equals to UsersusernameLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataKituraSamplemasterdpowtcfjwuvoqafwzhnollapcnidSourcePackagescheckoutsKiturapublictesthtml which looks like an issue Default path in StaticFileServerinit is public and it leads to unexpected location under Kitura dir in DerivedDatablablablacheckouts It looks like entire path location system broken when Kitura build under Swift Xcode x and macOS x I think KituraStencilTemplateEngine issue have same issue We need solution in short time I have two project in production powered by Kitura which needs to be supported Add a new codable route for POST with no object as input Description This allows to create a resource without arguments like this routerpostresource respondWith Resource RequestError Void in respondWithresource nil Motivation and Context It is not possible to use the POST verb without argument making it weird to create a new resource from an endpoint that has no dependencies How Has This Been Tested External testing done Im unsure about where to add the test if needed Checklist X If applicable I have updated the documentation accordingly If applicable I have added tests to cover my changes Regenerate the Jazzy docs for and Context and Description I noticed that the code coverage testing hasnt been updated in over a year I thought I might go and write some of the tests needed but the version that was last tested has significant differences from the current version of the code Environment Details Available to see at this link Steps to Reproduce Available to see at this link Expected vs Actual Behaviour Expected to see the current version tested The last update to the code coverage was over a year ago I want to develop an iOS application that hosts its own web server on an iPad or iPhone users can access from a PC or Mac or other phone Is this possible with Kitura What level of support does this have And are there any documentation or examples I can get started with Thank you Curl had a bug where it would call back twice with chunked encoding This then causes the Kituranet parser to be unable to read the body and throw an error This was fixed in however Ubuntu includes by default wbittles raised a bug report against Ubuntu and we hope they will update the curl version to fix this issue This was discovered due to the Kituraio OAuth guide failing and tracked in this issue however since this is a Kitura issue I felt it made more sense to be tracked here until it is resolved Context and Description Update the Kitura helm chart sample to include best practices for configuration monitoring and deployment Context and Description We want to use application level encryption We couldnt find proper way to do it without disabling Kituras some features Similar Example JWT It might look similar to JWT But it is not suitable for this case Diffrences Keys are created for each session Keys are kept in session Accessing session in Body Decoder is not possible Discussed Solutions TypeSafeMiddleware TypeSafeMiddleware for Codable routes that created the structure you are interested in and use a dummy struct for the body Disadvantages It looks like I can not use same TypeSafeMiddleware for different models We have to create TypeSafeMiddleware for each Model or I have to decode models in Routes Raw Routes Create a normal middleware for raw routes that attaches the decrypted body to the request UserInfo Disadvantages Unnecessary weight in Request I have to downcaseFrom any objects or use json decoder in each Routes Expected vs Actual Behaviour In Middleware I should able to write RouterRequest before it is processed by Route There is no method for write x In Middleware I should able to write RouterResponse after it is processed by Route WrittenDataFilter Example Kitura Compression Example Request Body json Encrypted Request status encryptedTextasdwqe weafcxzblo Decrypted Request UserId UserNameTest Context and Description If a Kitura server crashes or hangs when deployed how do we investigate and debug it We probably need a core file Will it contain everything we need Are there are any special requirements for how the app was compiled for it to be useful Are there any other resources external to the core that need to be captured What requirements are there on the deploy environment to ensure the core is a generated and b remains available for investigation eg after a container restarts Environment Details Information about your OS Swift version and Xcode version if on macOS Steps to Reproduce etc Expected vs Actual Behaviour Expected to
