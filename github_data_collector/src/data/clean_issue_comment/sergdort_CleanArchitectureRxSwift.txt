PostsViewModel is exposing to the view the Post mode as output let selectedPost DriverPost My question is PostsViewController knows Post data model which means that the view knows the model As far as I understand MVVM architecture the UI view doesnt need to know the model Post What do you think is there a place to change the selectedPost parameter to be let selectedPost DriverPostViewModel Hey I have added the test cases for CreatePostViewModel Hope it is useful Thanks I tried Xcode it works fine but crashes on Xcode whenever you click Realm Tab RunLoopThreadScheduler private final class

but they have absolutely no logic or critical business rules associated to them it only defines entities and a use case provider protocol You have redundant use cases provider implementations that are fully aware of everything and cant talk to each other Use cases implementation should have no knowledge about core data realm etc you just write platform agnostic code using protocols and inject adapters as dependencies Builds upon the solution in PR to fix bug Changes confirm dialog from Void to Bool observable True represents Yes False represents No Dismisses the dialog if disposed Remove

Hello I cant wrap my head around how to communicate with a child view controller I have one trigger from the ParentViewController that is needed in the ChildViewModel and a second one from the ChildViewModel that should trigger some UI changes in the ParentViewController trigger ParentViewController input no idea ChildViewModel trigger ChildViewModel output no idea ParentViewController My code currently looks something like this final class ParentViewController UIViewController var viewModel ParentViewModel private let disposeBag DisposeBag override func viewDidLoad superviewDidLoad bindViewModel private func bindViewModel guard let viewModel selfviewModel else fatalErrorView Model not set let triggerToChild rxsomeTrigger let input ParentViewModelInputtriggerToChild triggerToChild let output viewModeltransforminput input outputtriggerFromChild driverxsomeProperty disposedby disposeBag final class ParentViewModel ViewModelType struct Input let triggerToChild

PostUseCase as associatedtype so I write the required method only once I started to write the Code but It dontt work Here is the General UseCase in Domain public protocol UseCase associatedtype E func many Observable E func saveentry E ObservableVoid func deleteentry E ObservableVoid Here is the General UseCaseProvider in Domain public protocol UseCaseProvider associatedtype U UseCase func makeUseCase U Here is the UserCaseProvider in CoreDataPlatform public final class PostUseCaseProvider DomainUseCaseProvider private let coreDataStack CoreDataStack private let postRepository RepositoryPost public init postRepository RepositoryPostcontext coreDataStackcontext public func makeUseCase DomainUseCase return PostsUseCaserepository postRepository Here get the error Type UserCaseProvider does not conform to protocol UseCaseProvider and Protocol UseCase can only be used as a generic constraint because it has Self or associated type requirements Any idea Now in app when
