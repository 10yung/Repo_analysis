 If you have an issue with a plugin consider creating an issue in the plugins github repo instead Pre Steps Homebridge runs on Windows Only one Plugin homebridgechamberlain v iOS iPhone and iPad Air Before opening an issue please review the Troubleshooting Page on the Wiki to ensure that this is a new issue and alternatively search the closed issues for similar problems Link to the Troubleshooting page on the Wiki Provide a general summary in the Title above Expected Behavior If youre describing a bug tell us what should happen If youre suggesting a changeimprovement tell us how it should work When Win is connected via WiFi the Home app status shows correctly When Win is connected via Ethernet the Home app shows No Response Current Behavior If describing a bug tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior If suggesting a changeimprovement explain the difference from current behavior Tried uninstalling and reinstalling both Homebridge and plugin in Ethernet mode only Tried alternate plugin MyQ with same results Steps to Reproduce for bugs Please add a series of steps to reproduce the problem Versions Please run commands and include versions below Homebridge Node OS Windows Configuration If relevant include the contents of your configjson file between the two lines below Remove any sensitive information passwords etc If output is long Please extract only the relevant portions if possible Consider creating a gist etc json Plugin code was added through GUI without error Homebridge Log Command Output Paste relevant output between the two lines below Remove any sensitive information passwords etc If output is long Please extract only the relevant portions if possible Consider creating a gist etc However please include the beginning of the log where the homebridge initialization happens if possible Log output shows Homebridge communicating with Plugin Device whether its on Eth or Wifi This is a follow up to nfarina you mentioned that you maybe wanted to combine the typescript migration with the hapnodejs update However I think this introduces some more unnecessary delay to the process So the following PR should be seen as just a suggestion to speed this process up In this PR I updated hapnodejs to the currently latest version and adjusted some of the direct access imports which caused some problems with the new project setup of hapnodejs I tested it with a simple switch plugin and couldnt find any more problems I followed development of hapnodejs closely since v and thus know that we havent introduced any API changes which could cause further problems However Im happy about anyone proving me wrong regarding this and help fixing it Andi Homebridge is running smoothly Version oznuhomebridge docker Synology I use some Philips Hue devices with a Hue Bridge native HomeKit support Homebridge adds some innr bulbs and tado v into Apple HomeKit which woudnt show up in Apples Homeapp otherwise Using my iPhone Homeapp shows all devices as expected But on my AppleWatch devices connected via Homebridge innr tado often appear offline now answer until I also open Homeapp on my iPhone and my watch updates status Why the differen status using watchOS or iOS Any suggestions sincerely paradeiser Currently the only way with Homekit to get fading Hue scenes and all the other stuff the bridge can actually do is to use Shortcuts on an iOS device to trigger the scene as part of something else The problem with that of course if you cant use Homekit sensors to trigger the scene and youre stuck using an iOS device Pushcut just created a server which you can run to get around this but it requires an iOS device with it running all the time in the foreground not ideal and struck me as a bit daft when we have Homebridge running I suppose we could send Pushcut webhooks but again requires an iOS device Currently you can make scenes which blink fade change colour etc and put them natively on the Hue bridge You obviously cant share these in Homekit As theyre on the bridge you can trigger them with the native API the way all rd party Hue apps work we could use something like Hue Lights to easily create the complex scenes we want and then a Homebridge plugin which adds the scenes as switches and triggers them on the bridge when you turn the device on I wouldnt know where to start so hopefully a talented programmer can step in Shortcuts in the homekit allow you to fully control devices via telegrams I wrote a bot that receives updates and performs the specified actions The problem is that shortcuts can only receive data so automation should be launched every seconds to receive updates via api telegrams But telegrams can also send updates via webhook which can not be received through shorkat I suggest writing a simple web server in the form of a plugin that can accept incoming connections save data from telegrams while simultaneously including a virtual switch to the homekit which in turn can download this data from the internal web server Thanks for attention Hi I have used Homebridge since with no problems Now I have introduced in configjson this module in order to see an IP

restarting Homebridge app Home says Homebrdige not responding If I delete the script Homebridge works fine I dont understand why Consider that the code is validated Hey guys I installed the
