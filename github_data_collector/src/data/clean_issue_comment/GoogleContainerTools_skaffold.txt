 Issues without logs and details are more complicated to fix Please help us by filling the template below Expected behaviour Skaffold only exits when instructed in dev mode Actual behaviour After running skaffold dev and a few hours later I get the following error deployer cleanup reading manifests kubectl create Running kubectl context minikube create dryrun oyaml f

when using the kubectl deployer This is a feature request to have a skipdeploy similar to skipbuild in skaffold init This would detect artifacts to prepare for skaffold build This simplifies the code that an artifact has to implement to participate to an inferred sync Instead of listing all the files in the workspace and mapping them to a destination all is required is to return a list of sync rules This also makes it possible to support deletions for inferred sync rules Related to Tanka has been officially announced by grafana It is an interesting alternative to helm and seems to fit as possible deploy option for Skaffold Expected behavior When using skaffold with helm running skaffold dev it should use the latest local image built Actual behavior When running skaffold dev it is building the image but trying to use some remote image giving the following error Normal Scheduled s defaultscheduler Successfully assigned defaultcoredeployment cb d pn to dockerdesktop Normal

David Gageot davidgageotnet Hi I have a remote k s cluster as my deployment target Skaffold is great tool for kubernetes development But now I cant tail log from pods in remote kubernetes cluster this feature only work in local cluster So great when this feature is available
