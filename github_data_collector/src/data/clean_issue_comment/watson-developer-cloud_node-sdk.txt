Start the title with the service name in brackets speechtotext websockets Steps to reproduce Expected behavior Actual behavior Node version SDK version When you open an issue for a feature request please add as much detail as possible A descriptive title starting with the service name A description of the problem youre trying to solve A suggested solution if possible I upgraded from v to v and found that the includecount param is removed which is stated in the release notes I think this is really useful as Watson Assistant has a limit for intents inside a workspace If I cannot get the current Intent count in the workspace I do not know how many intents I can add For example when I need to add intents and the workspace has intents inside the adding requests will fail Really need the count to determine if I could add Intents to a workspace Is it possible to add it back In the official docs the includecount param is still there In the curl results the pagination contains total and matched when I set param includecount to true but the Nodejs client doesnt have this option supports mpeg and I have mp files I thought recognize API would support mp but doesnt seem so Do I miss anything I can feed in either mp or aac const Speech recognize functionpath windowbtoa requireBase btoa consolelogpath var body new FormData let metadata partcontenttype audiompeg bodyappendmetadata

consolelogJSONstringifyres null catcherr consolelogerr We need to update examples like to use the new authenticators Looking at previous resolved issues i found a closed one that i dont understand if it has been resolved with added feature or not I attemped to build a custom library including only a subset of services for use clientside on browsers I made a new directory in the root folder and included that indexjs use strict exportsToneAnalyzerV requireibmwatsontoneanalyzerv exportsNaturalLanguageUnderstandingV requireibmwatsonnaturallanguageunderstandingv exportsSpeechToTextV requireibmwatsonspeechtotextv exportsTextToSpeechV requireibmwatsontexttospeechv exportsAuthenticator requireibmwatsonauth That is my package dependencies from the packagejson after installing browserify and tinyify name watsondevelopercloudcustombundle version description Use the Watson JS SDK in browsers via browserify main indexjs scripts start node indexjs author license Apache dependencies browserify ibmwatson latest tinyify devDependencies engines node I generate the new bundle like this browserify p tinyify indexjs standalone Watson watsonsdkminjs I can see the included prototypes of the bundle when i load it in browser While i have been trying to instantiate a class i have come accross some examples using different techniques like the following const speechToText new SpeechToTextV authenticator new IamAuthenticator apikey apikey url var speechToText new SpeechToTextV username INSERT YOUR USERNAME FOR THE SERVICE HERE password INSERT YOUR PASSWORD FOR THE SERVICE HERE url Since i already have an API made in PHP that produces the accessToken from the credentials of my services and because i dont want to expose the service credentials either in the clientside code or embeded into the library sdk how can i instantiate a service using the prefetched accessToken i have Reading on about the token expiration i have solved this by fetching a fresh token from my API if a request from the client validates as unauthenticated or also if the endpoint is down since i have a failover support embeded with two services credentials just in case so i handle the tokens properly through my API and client side code that fetches fresh ones i just need to hide the credentials from eyesight and use the produced accessToken if possible Is there an example somwhere if this is supported Thats a sample of a token object I am currently using And further to my question since i can see that axios is being used for the services POST or GET requests if not a websocket connection is used STTTTS are the promises resolved inside the library synchronously or do i have to call them with an async function and having to await until i get back a response I am also eager to know if the STT accepts a mediaStream passed in as a paramter so that i dont have to rewrite microphone access code since i have that before i start the service and if a TSS accepts an audio object passed in as a parameter so that i can reuse one audio object because that technique seems to work better for mobile support Lastly my intention is to use a future supported sdk that i can get a subset of services into a bundle in order to use it from various browsers I am currently using the speech javascript sdk that offers a few out of the box features like handling microphone access etc but i really want to further the exploration of the services and be able to use custom models train them and have something used that will be maintained in the future in order to get new updates and reproduce my custom bundle Overview Visual Recognition doesnt recognize IAMAPIKEY and URL from credentialsenv provided by the service When I put the credentialsenv provided by the visual recognition service to the working directory the api returns Error Missing required parameters apikey Expected behavior The apikey is loaded from credentialsenv Actual behavior the api returns Error Missing required parameters apikey How to reproduce Download credentialsenv to the working directory of code from Visual Recognition service Run following code with nodejs var VisualRecognitionV requireibmwatsonvisualrecognitionv var visualRecognition new VisualRecognitionV version Screenshots If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem SDK Version v Additional information The SDK only reads the variables started from WATSONVISIONCOMBINED However the values of credentialsenv are started from VISUALRECOGNITION SDK v reads both values With the V API it is possible to create a Watson Assistant workspace Previously one of the parameters was dialognodes This matched the name in the exported skills workspaces JSON files Thus it was straighforward to parse such a file and then pass it as parameters to the create function With the new camelCasing of parameters this roundtrip is broken
