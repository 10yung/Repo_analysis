reproduce the bug it cannot be fixed Im not sure that Im getting this right so please recheck it It seems like comparing t with xbc is meaningless because all integers inside xbc are the same and based on x Is it a typo Details Operating system MacOS Rack version v Hardware relevant to your issue eg graphic card model audioMIDI device shouldnt matter its piped through MIDIPipe Summary I wanted to use two MIDI devices together so I used MIDIPipe to put them both on the same virtual device using different channels Using Channel Filter and Channel Router Inside VCV Rack I use the standard MIDICV module to connect VOct Gate and RTRG via polyphonic cables with polyphony mode set to and Rotate selected This almost works However if I hold down a note on one of the devices and play a chord containing that note in the other one it cancels the helddown note even though they are in different channels I verified by logging in MIDIPipe that the Note On and Note Off messages really are on different channels Also it doesnt happen in GarageBand So I suspect some kind of polyphony bug in VCV Rack where notes from different MIDI channels are being mapped to the same polyphony channel Steps to reproduce I dont know how you debug your MIDI but basically send a Note On on one channel and a Note Off for the same note on a different channel and see if it stops the note I have installed various libraries in rack around modules When I try to open some of them rack creates a lot of lag and when I try to search something it gets some times to a condition of nonresponding Firstly I am curious why it is so slow on searching modules Secondly is there a mechanism so I select by default a subset of all the modules that I use to appear when I press rightclick to add a new module Rack version Operating System Windows Thanks a lot Issue Found a similar issue which was closed but the problem it described was not solved I dont think having no audio device active should cause cpu usage with any number of threads Id even expect an empty rack to use near CPU when theres nothing to draw and nothing to calculate Especially when running other audio software at the same time its disastrous in a live setting when one program suddenly starts hogging all cpu time just by starting it Proposed solution Something along the lines of limiting the rate of whatever is being processed when no audio device is loaded Search existing issues before posting a new one to avoid duplicates To file a bug report fill out the form below Use a descriptive title that best explains the bug in

system PopOS very close to Ubuntu Rack version v Hardware relevant to your issue eg graphic card model audioMIDI device Audio device Intel Corporation Sunrise PointLP HD Audio Summary Hi everyone I am on a Linux laptop and I just downloaded the latest version of VCVRack However no sound is coming out of my computer when I press a MIDI key Steps to reproduce I first launch the jack server jackcontrol start Then I launch Rack Rack This is the output in the console Cannot lock down byte memory area Cannot allocate memory Cannot use realtime scheduling RR Operation not permitted JackClientAcquireSelfRealTime error Cannot use realtime scheduling RR Operation not permitted JackClientAcquireSelfRealTime error Then when I press a key it should play a sound with the default startup setup whether I choose ALSA or JACK in the AUDIO module Where is the issue Thanks If developers cannot reproduce the bug it cannot be fixed Summary This is just a quality of life improvement Save time scrolling around b y providing quick access to common views The motivation for me is that Im using an old laptop with a touchpad and its a bit tricky to move about Proposed design Provide possible shortcuts using the number keys Save a shortcut Navigate to a module and interact with it press ShiftCTRLn The module and zoom level is assign to slot If a slot is already used it is overwrite no checks are performed to preserve a previous shortcut information Use a shortcut Press CTRLn The store module is centred and the zoom level is set according to the save information If a slot is not defined no action is taken If a module is no longer valid no action is taken The shortcuts are stored in the patch This might be a little bit tricky since is considered a base in the code and everything else is oversampling but Id love it if we could choose lower engine sample rates ex kHz and kHz so that I can get a lot more oomph out of my liverealtime patching and avoid nasty crackling and then I can switch back to for my renders If you accept as a concept and its not too crazy to implement Id be happy to submit a PR Details Operating system Windows Rack version v Hardware relevant to your issue Network MIDI connection via rtpMIDI using the iOS app GeoShred Control on an iPad Pro as a MIDI controller Summary Using GeoShred Control with VCV Rack as described here when two notes are being held the third note and any additional notes will usually respond as if pitch bend is being released from a previouslyheld state It feels something like a ghost portamento sliding the note from some mysterious nonexistent prior note I have attached an audio file demonstrating the behavior as well as the patch file used to generate this example recording MIDICV MPE Issuezip Summary The goal of this proposal is to brainstorm a way to add DAWlike global transport functionality to VCV rack With the upcoming of Rack for Daws its likely that lot of users will expect VCVs sequencers and other timebased module to play in sync with their DAW regardless of the position from which the playback is started in a track Furthermore having such a module in VCV standalone would make it easier to develop modules for DAW like functions as automation recorders WAV players etc Proposed design One approach could be to have a Transport module outputs two CVs One CV output would indicate the index of the beat which is currently playing A function would allow to convert a v signal to an absolute beat index The max beat index would be ridiculously high to face any situation One Phase CV would output the position inside the current beat with a v signal like ZZC Clock already does
