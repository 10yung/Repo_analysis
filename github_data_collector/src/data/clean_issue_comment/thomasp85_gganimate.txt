I have created a basketball animation using gganimate as seen below You can get the full animation on my blog post Look at animation under Paul Pierce Isolation img width altScreen Shot at PM src Now there is one problem with this once the seconds reach single digits it shows only one digit Its doing what its told to do but I want it to display so that it closely matches a NBA broadcast Here is my

of glue in the titles make things a bit too complicated for me to hack Hey Ive created a geomcol with ggplot and gganimate Everything works perfectly fine except ordering the bars according to size of a certain variable Usining a simple ggplot without the gganimate this is simple but to do this dynamcially so to speak as in all those youtube videos seems difficult I am yet to succeed Does anyone on the top of their head know if its possible to do Or in general is it possible to create a Bar chart race with this newer edition of gganimate when i try to knit r ggplotdf aesxoriginalprincipalamount

file includes the following lines sourceline ppajonathonfffmpeg sourceline ppajonathonfffmpeg However these PPAs appear to no longer be publicly available See here As a result gganimate is failing on travis I know because I have a fork Not sure if this is just something funny in my RStudio setup or what but the progress bars from gganimate dont flush the line between updates so I get something that looks like this Apologies if this is nothing to do with gganimate And thanks for a totally awesome package Lifechanging for looking at MCMC output Screenshot I see in NEWS that there is this bullet in v Better fallback strategy for lack of gifski However it seems that current fallback strategy is to not do anything at all Neither warning nor error is generated if there is no gifski availabile and its really not intuitive what needs to be done Context Ive came across one user trying to use the package and he claimed that there was no output Ive tried replicating it on both Mac and Ubuntu and behaviour was gganimate call creates all the frames it needs All intermediary png files are dumped into working directory No output in RStudio preview window is generated No error or warning I thought that there might be a bug so tried git bisect rolled back to v and immediately got the error The gifskirenderer is selected by default but requires the gifski package to be installed Either install gifski or use another renderer Personally I would say that this is correct behaviour since it is clear what I need to do Hi Im trying to use gganimate package and version of R and RStudio are the newest When I load devtoolsinstallgithubthomasp gganimate there was an error like below Error package or namespace load failed for gganimate onLoad failed in loadNamespace for gganimate details call NULL error The png package is required to use gifskirenderer Error loading failed Execution halted I dont know what is the problem and I dont know how should I download or set up gifskirenderer Could you please help me with it Thanks Ivy When format auto the system call is hardcoded to use the ffmpeg executable on the search path This pull request removes that restriction and allows a custom path to the ffmpeg executable I have been trying to learn how to use gganimate to animate plots I was following the vignette at and when I tried to replicate the codes given there I dont get the same results as given on the page When I run the code given below I get the gif given here Compare it to the one on the page anim ggplotiris aesx PetalWidth y PetalLength geompointaescolour Species size transitionstatesSpecies transitionlength statelength anim enterfade exitshrink GIF saved using animsavefilenamemygifgif As you see the gif is laggy as hell When I try to modify it using height width res etc using the code below I get the next gif animateanim res height width GIF saved using animsavefilenamemygif gif Still laggy and not smooth Compare it to the one on the vignette page I have the latest versions of ggplot gganimate tweenr transformr What should I do How can I get silky smooth gifs Please help This report is based on this SO post The original example includes a map of Texas but Ive left it out here to simplify the code The problem is that shadowmark doesnt properly draw points that are drawn via geomsf Without shadowmark things work fine
