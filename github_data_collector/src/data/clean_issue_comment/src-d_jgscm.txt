Looks like need to add explicit dependencies on googlecloudstorage and googlecloudcore From WARNING The googlecloud Python package is deprecated On June this package will no longer install any other packages I was able to fix by adding But it looks there are other issues related to working with folders x Hi Looks like url decoding needs to be implemented to support decoded chars in folder names x In the dirmodel method there is a segment of code that calls selfget on every contained blob if contents are set see below This organization creates a massive slowdown when navigating to GCS directories with more than a dozen files I suspect it should be straightforward to refactor this to directly use the returned googlecloudstorageBlob objects returned by bucketlistblobs Similarly for directories with many subdirectories you should be able to use the list of prefixes directly rather than running selfget many times offending code python def dirmodelself path members contentTrue for blob in blobs contentsappendselfget Ive filed this bug for tracking purposes I dont have the bandwidth to resolve the bug at present
