When I try to rescale this image from its original size x to new size x this happens obrazek cannot rescale to this size preserving the image aspect ratio seems to always show up I was under the impression that the whole purpose of this utility is to change the aspect ratio of the image It would be ideal if pipes were usable with the CLI for enabling more expanded usecases After having worked with ImageMagick in the past I could see this being a highly requested feature With ImageMagick you can have the input arrive from a pipe or have the output sent to a pipe Examples Pipe to file caire in bridgejpg scale perc smallbridgejpg Input from pipe caire scale perc out smallerbridgejpg smallbridgejpg Input and output from pipe cat smallbridgejpg caire scale perc smallerbridgejpg There are usages of pipes in the OpenFaaS CLI also in Go if that helps Just ran gofmt w on the project root Thats all I made this PR with a project going on over at and its definitely a work in progress So if I got something wrong or this is annoying at all please file an issue over there and well sort it out
