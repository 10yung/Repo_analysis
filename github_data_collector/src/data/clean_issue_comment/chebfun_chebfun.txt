Hi Ive used the library for some signal processing and would want to convert my entire algorithm to MEX or C using MATLAB coder Is there a mex file for the entire library Please let me know Best Aditya See discussion in Summary reintroduce some basic mappings to deal with endpoint singularities Creating a pull request a to start discussion b since this is fairly light in terms of code and impact elsewhere whilst still allowing some cool stuff see below c I dont intend to add much more functionality Because why not y chebfunx realsqrtcosxcos xsqrtabsx x pi pi singmap ploty axis equal y

coeffs for spherefun and diskfun objects and also adds these and related functions for spherefunv diskfunv and chebfun v objects I think I and my student can work around this in the meantime but the diskfun and spherefun subclasses but not chebfun chebfun t nor ballfun are missing the convenience functions vals coeffs and coeffs vals Also since Matlab can return multiple outputs I think the vector field versions could all have the convenience methods too Note also the Givens rotation solution from are not too onerous either and greatly help with stability For example the following code represents a normalized associated Legendre function of order m as a vector of coefficients of normalized associated Legendre functions of order if m is even or is m is odd Then Chebfuns normalized leg cheb and ultra ultra routines could finish converting the coefficients to trigonometric form on the sphere julia function alfhi loNInt MInt Convention assume positive and negative normalized associated Legendre functions are the same Purpose convert normalized PNM Mx to normalized associated Legendre functions of order if M is even of order if M is odd M absM x zerosNM x N for m M for l NM m s sqrtl l l m l m c sqrt m l m l m l m a x l a x l x l ca sa x l ca sa end end x end Presumably only minor modifications are required to make this Matlab compatible Originally posted by MikaelSlevinsky in If I run the following code S spinopks Stspan e ut spinS e I get the following output for t t e Columns through Columns through spin replaces the first entry of tspan by and u ut which sounds like a bug However Stspan e works as expected There seems to be a similar issue for the other spin codes at least spinsphere I think it would be better if the second output argument of paduapts was a vector of quadrature weights At the moment we have x w paduapts x w logical array where w is a logical matrix that denotes the grid points from a Chebyshev tensor grid Could be better to be consistent with chebpts legpts jacpts etc x w legpts x w I want to solve the following equations for as a function of All functions and integrals are on the domain gx xy dx gy gx dx The context
