update the data the screen moves about pixels up and the screen flickers I am using rn versionfunctional component Like this avatar The current behavior of recyclerlistview is to render an empty scrollview and then wait for its on layout event to get its actual size before rendering all the children inside it If an estimated scroll view size is passed then the children can also be rendered in the first pass based on those estimates removing an initial blank render When the onlayout event comes with the actual size the scroll component and all its children will readjust accordingly I am hopeful that this is not a bug but wanted to crosspost here just in case Please see SO below I see many references to this but no examples In my use case the dimensions for each item will be in the data and will vary How can I access the data from within the layoutprovider I am facing an issue in the recycler list view The scenario is i am using nested recycler list as i need a section based on the grouping of data In my scenario i can change the data provided to the list by selecting the different sort strategy of my data Basically i have three sorting scenario like based on id based on alphabet based on date of joining grouping based on id is by default selected and it only groups rows inside the inner recycler list But sorting based on alphabet has rows in them But when we change the sorting strategy from id to alphabet only rows of inner list is shown for each header rows because its loaded initially so how can i make sure that this situation can be handled NOTE re render only showing the number of items previously scrolled If you change the data it throws an exeption See in this snack Instructions to reproduce Scroll to the bottom Type letter A in the TextInput Result

Versions recyclerlistview reactnative Hello I have a big list of items that I render using RecyclerListView around items The thing is when I filter the data and I would get to items the app crashes on android and I have no idea why On iOS it works fine On android emulator it works fine as well The problem is when I create an unrelased APK and I test the app on real device I dont see any error message so I have no idea how to fix this problem Any idea Changed the expo link for extendedState demo
