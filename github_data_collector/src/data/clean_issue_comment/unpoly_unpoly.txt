When adding uptarget to a form UnPoly will POST it with content type multipartformdata also if enctypeapplicationxwwwformurlencoded is declared on the form Clients want custom scrollbars for their website using css such as webkitscrollbar webkitscrollbartrack webkitscrollbarthumb After adding the code for custom scrollbars within my main css file if I close the opened modal unpoly seems to add overflowy hidden to the html tag on Chrome browser might be related to this from One of the in Rails UJS I still use in almost every Unpoly project is the datadisablewith functionality when submitting a form Would it be an idea to have such functionality in the core of Unpoly as well Maybe something like updisablewith I could make even a PR for it if you like Given this example html form methodpost actionmyaction uptargetpost button typesubmitSavebutton button typesubmit namemyparam valuemyvalueDo something elsebutton form On most systems submitting the form by pressing the second button sends a POST request to myaction with the parameters myparam myvalue On Mac devices Safari or Firefox however always the value of the first submit button is part of the Params hash Chrome on Mac works fine Digging in Unpolys code I found that the method submittingButtonform in this case contains the wrong submit button javascript submittingButton form selector submitButtonSelector focusedElement documentactiveElement if focusedElement ematchesfocusedElement selector formcontainsfocusedElement return focusedElement else If no button is focused we assume the first button in the form return efirstform selector The condition for the if clause matches in Chrome but fails in Safari or FF on a Mac focusedElement is not the targeted button but the HTML element The property documentactiveElement works only reliably for input typetext elements The MDN Reference states Which elements are focusable varies depending on the platform and the browsers current configuration For example on macOS systems elements that arent text input elements are not typically focusable by default I am not sure what would be the best solution to this issue The browser market share of Safari is around so we might need to work around this Heres a minimal example in the console one can see that the text input triggers autosubmit while the reset input clears the text input but does not trigger autosubmit My use case was for clearing a filter form without additional JS but as a workaround Im currently using a small snippet to autosubmit on reset Ive just started using Unpoly for a project and a few weeks into it everything feels great as far as the client experience goes I do however miss hot reloading like you have in React and others Ive been reading the API docs to figure out how to implement the browser side of it all but so far Im not quite getting ifhow it could be done Any pointers as to proceed would be much appreciated Here are two questions that I have on the top of my head Is it possible to request a reload of everything even the body in a coordinated manner Does Unpoly handle changes to head at all Im really shocked because I come from Turbolinks and found Unpoly by accident WONDERFUL CONGRATULATIONS Just one question coming from Turbolinks is there a way to load the cached page just like it happens default way but check in background in parallel for new content on that page and replace the content with new one if available From Turbolinks docs during standard navigation via Application Visits Turbolinks will immediately restore the page from cache and display it as a preview while simultaneously loading a fresh copy from the network This gives the illusion of instantaneous page loads for frequently accessed locations Greetings Whenever an input field with the form attribute is used Id expect upautosubmit to behave the same for outoftheform input fields So if a field out of the form but with form attribute set changes Id expect the form to autosubmit or an upvalidate to trigger a validation From my understanding the framework doesnt consider these type of fields at all Using upvalidate on form inputs seems to break focus in at least two common situations With upformconfigvalidateTargets form moving from first field to the next using kbd Tabkbd will switch focus and then lose it once the validation results arrive Can be worked around by using a more narrow target Regardless of validation target pressing kbd kbd down on a select will switch to the next option and then lose focus once the validation results arrive I have no idea how to work around this Both issues manifest themselves at least in Firefox and Chromium on current Fedora I have user menu that lives inside a drawer The menu contains an Edit profile link This links is upinstant and opens a modal unpolyissue However that modal will not open consistently Depending on the length of the click sometimes the drawer will close but the modal will never appear There is obviously the easy workaround of not using upinstant so this is not a very serious issue for me
