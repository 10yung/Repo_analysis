 h Repro steps Using AddLinkToURL to add two urls inside the text such as Affogato and mylink Note that the text must contain n character to repro this bug labeltext Affogato Espresso served over gelato Traditionally vanilla is used but some coffeehouses or customers use any flavor n n mylink If the label s layout was not set correctly before adding the link the last accessibility element will get the wrong boundingRect all zero from the return value of boundingREctForCharacterRange boundingREctForCharacterRange using label s bounding size to measure the position of the highlighted element but the textContainer seems to ignore the n character will have additional line Thus if user setting the correct frame such as using sizeToFit it works fine But if the user calls it later after adding the link the position of accessibilityElement will get wrong Solution NSTextContainer s size does not need to be the same as the label s bounding size Instead we can use CGSizeMakeselfboundssizewidth CGFLOATMAX CTFontCreateWithName replaced with CTFontCreateWithFontDescriptor avoiding CoreText error CoreText performance note Client called CTFontCreateWithName using name The problem is the same as here Hi I am using this library in iOS AppThis is great but i want that if someone entered Day or month name then it should not convert that into clickable link Please suggest how to do this Thanks in advance I see the notice Any properties affecting text or paragraph styling such as firstLineIndent will only apply when text is set with an NSString If the text is set with an NSAttributedString these properties will not apply and the setText method if text isKindOfClass NSString class self setTexttext afterInheritingLabelAttributesAndConfiguringWithBlocknil return the setTextafterInheritingLabelAttributesAndConfiguringWithBlock call setText with a mutableAttributedString The document tell me to set text rather than NSAttributedString then the setText call itself with NSAttributedString in any case Hi I have a problem if my text break lines too much like this M M M M M M See more So I can not detect right link This my code func gestureRecognizer gestureRecognizer UIGestureRecognizer shouldReceive touch UITouch Bool if gestureRecognizerview is TTTAttributedLabel let label gestureRecognizerview as TTTAttributedLabel let point touchlocationin label let link labellinkat point return false return true link wrong or nil use cocoapods useframeworks then I try it but didnt work And in awakeFromNib method selftitleLabellineSpacing didnt work What should I do next
