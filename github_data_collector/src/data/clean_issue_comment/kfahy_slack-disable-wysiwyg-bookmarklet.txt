This seems to have stopped working in the newest version of Slack I am running the Slack Desktop app on Ubuntu This was working for me previously I am constantly running Slack in developer mode and after each restart I have to copypaste the content of indexjs from slackdisablewysiwygbookmarklet into the console in Slack This was working as expected until very recently I am noticing today that is no longer works to disable the WYSIWYG editor I still have formatasyoutype functionality enabled in Slack Additionally I have discovered a new feature that is when I paste content with markdown in it bar should not be formatted until I submit I am seeing a little popup message that says Apply Formatting If I do not apply formatting this message doesnt get formatted at all I was able to submit a message with Markdown and have it work as expected that is display as formatted text in the chat history This seems to have changed within the last few days slackDebugversionInfo versionHash f a f de e a a abb befa versionTs minVersionDataTs Hi kfahy thanks a lot for putting this together As of now the readme of the project says The contents of this repository and the remainder of this README are left intact for reference but should not be used going forward However turns out its not quite the case at least for me personally even though Slack has implemented a preference to turn off wysiwyg which is cool but they broke copypasting with markup preserved Eg I select a text with markup I copy it I paste it to the Slacks input and all the markup is gone It used to be preserved and I personally use it a lot But the good news is your bookmarklet does save the day again With this bookmarklet applied I select a text with markup I copy it I paste it to the Slacks input and the markup is preserved So just wanted to say that its probably worth mentioning in the readme Thanks again I just wanted to say Thank You for putting this together and I didnt know of any other way to get a message to you other than to create an issue Feel free to just close this Thanks so much for figuring this out and sharing it with us all Im sure you experienced the pain of the wsywig as much as everyone else did But thanks for wrapping it up so nicely and creating such easy to follow instructions putting it out for free and allowing us all to leach off your work You made the last two weeks of using Slack bearable for me and I just wanted to thank you for you that Cheers Chase I am using this with nativifier but it runs too early and slackDebug is not yet ready The app is created with nativefier m name slack disablecontextmenu disabledevtools internalurls slack comslack comconfluent okta com inject tmpnowysiwygjs to solve it I added a timeout to call the function later after s Not elegant but works I dont know too much about js to make it better It looks like this js setTimeout function const workspaceIds slackDebugclientStoreworkspacesgetAllWorkspaces for const workspaceId of

redux payload For all I know it may be possible to run slack in developer mode from the app store but I didnt see an obvious way to do it and uninstalling then reinstalling is quick and easy to do This is just a documentation PR Hi I worked for an hour to try to make it work in a userscript but I cant make it work in GreaseMonkey on Firefox the reduxdispatch function call doesnt return and I cant find an error anywhere Here is my code if someone finds how to make it work javascript UserScript name disable WYSIWYG editor version grant none include runat documentidle UserScript const

consoleerrorresult not firing Id be happy to make a PR in that case On macOS you can use launchctl setenv to set global environment variables for application bundles No need to start it from the Terminal sh launchctl setenv SLACKDEVELOPERMENU true then restart slack I dont use slack but I thought it might be helpful to share this technique Create a file pathtofilejs Set your NODEOPTIONS to r
