Hi there I am trying to use SAE for a small data set After the training process how can I use the trained SAE for my data set For example in Matlab trainAutoencoder command is used for training the encoder and then encode command is used to encode the data Which command should I use here after the SAE training process Hi guys Im trying to build a DeepLearning network which contains a subtraction operation between two layers and I cant find a way to do that while MATLAB has just an addition operation additionLayer for more clarification the equation below discribes the step that I should do C X AvgPoolingX any suggestions guys I am trying to find the dbnsizem function to execute the dbnsetup code The function is missing from the source code Any help in executing the code is appreciate is it possible to add fully connected layer in a CNN architecture now I understand that only the last layer of a CNN can be fully connected with prelayer I use DBN for the classification of bearing fault data sets at Case Western Reserve University The data set includes failures but the final classification result is always a category When you modify various parameters of the network in nnsetupm the result will change accordingly For example when you change nnlearningrate to the classification will change from to Many people have encountered this problem but No suitable solution was found Sincere hope that someone can help me there is a line in testexampleCNNm that says randstate When I looked it up on MATLAB it is discouraged to use it Instead rng is recommended But when I used rng and varied my kernel size the error rate is vastly differently from using randstate Is every generator other than twister flawed Does that mean the result that state generator gives is also flawed I have a question I want to transplant a simple LSTM adder or a simple LSTM regression model to the simulink Could you please tell me if there are any specific examples I ve met an error in running testexampleCNN with my own trainning data the code is as below error in using cnnsetup line Layer size must be integer Actual error with testexampleCNN line cnn cnnsetupcnn trainx trainy The structure of original data is trainx double trainy double testx double testy double While my own data structure is trainx double trainy double testx double testy double So what should I do now Should I modify my data or the code Hi I have a problem for the NN CNN Please help me One row of the sample data MNIST indicates as a handwritten numeral Each handwritten numeral is a gray image one band But my training datas are lots of RGB images three bands How can I use NN CNN for RGB images
