Hello Currently solverL RLS solves A x b lambda x Could it be extended to A x b lambda W x As done with other solvers Thank You Hi I am very new to tfocs Firstly I play a normal optimization like newxoutOPTS tfocs funObj x OPTS But it always failed in first run and return nan I found that the iterative values of x went too wildly so that my funObj cannot compute a value How can I set up the optimizer of tfocs to give small increment of x eg in every iteration for stabilizing the optimization Thanks I am reporting the problem below after I didnt get any response on CVX Forum I want to solve a linear program with the tfocsSCD routine of TFOCS tried v and v that generally looks like a href targetblankimg src title beginalign min boldsymbolx boldsymbola mathsfT boldsymbolx textupsubject to lVert boldsymbolAx rVert infty le boldsymbol endalign a However after the first continuation iteration TFOCS returns an error message Below is an example of the code followed by the error message SAMPLE CODE opts optscontinuation true optsstopCrit contoptsmaxIts mu e Arandn arandn x tfocsSCDsmoothlinearaA zeros proxl mu optscontopts ERROR MESSAGE Continuation step of mu e Auslender Teboulles singleprojection method Iter Objective dxx step e e e Finished Step size tolerance reached Continuation statistics mu xx e Continuation step of mu e Error using tfocsinitialize line Could not determine the dimensions of the problem Please supply an explicit value for x Error in tfocsAT line tfocsinitialize Error in tfocs line varargout maxnargout feval tfocs alg smoothF affineF projectorF x opts Error in tfocsSCDsolver line varargout maxnargout tfocs smoothF affineF dualproxF z opts Error in tfocsSCDmux z optssolverobjectiveFaffineFdualproxFmux z opts line continuationsolvermux z optssolverobjectiveFaffineFdualproxF mux z opts Error in continuation line x odata optsOut fcn mu x z optsTemp Error in tfocsSCD line x odata opts continuation continuationsolver mu x z optscontOpts
