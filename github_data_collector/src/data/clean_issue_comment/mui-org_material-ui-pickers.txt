Thanks for this great package See title Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Currently on the desktop there isnt a good way to allow users to select a date range that has dates from two months start in January and end in February Describe the solution youd like Id like to be able to display two months when selecting a date range similar to Google Flights Describe alternatives youve considered For now displaying single month is an option but from UX perspective two months view would be better Also use Snackbar instead of spinner cc oliviertassinari Environment Tech Version materialuipickers formik yup Steps to reproduce Change input or focus on the picker component Expected behavior Set touched object contain the name of the picker component Actual behavior Not working as expected Live example Shouldnt it also consider the validationError to be set before calling it this useEffect will trigger when the value changes The Problem I have a page where there are three KeyboardDatePicker and if anyone of them is without any preseted date blank waiting for the user fill it the mask doesnt work accepts letter its suppose to be numbers only and it gets very slow you wait some seconds for the input show up But if comes with any date preseted I can erase and everything works fine How can I let the field blank without this Is a perfomance problem The three date are the same component New After some testing I discovered that its only the KeyboardDatePicker that causes this and he only show up when a certain option is selected in a Select But I made it show up along with the page not depending on the condition and it worked just fine Theres something with condition that may interfere with the perfomance of KeyboardDatePicker Thanks so much for your
