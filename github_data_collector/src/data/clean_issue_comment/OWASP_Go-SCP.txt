Hi all Id like to propose the addition of a glossary for certain terms that may be misinterpreted or need additional explanations to be unambiguously interpreted by readers This would also require a review of the complete document to ensure the uses of such words are correct according to their glossary definition This is particularly important in some specific cases like crypto where terms are sometimes misused and there can be confusion as to their meaning and the instances of their use across the document could be linked to the definition in the glossary for fast reference Heres an example of what glossary entries could look like encoding function which transforms input into a different representation without the use of a key These are reversible and do not provide real security because if the algorithm is known their output can be reversed hash may be a reference to a hashing function or its output hashinghash function cryptographicallysecure function which transforms input into fixedlength output also known as trapdoor or oneway function Their output cannot be reversed in the sense of retrieving back the input information from the output because its fixedlength property does not retain the original information but it can be guessed by attempting all possible inputs until we get the same output encryption process by which input data plaintext is transformed into encrypted data ciphertext via the application of a secret key The output of an encryption process may be reversed decrypted using a key KDF or Key Derivation Function In this document when referring to a KDF we mean a function which takes a user password as input and derives a key which can be used for storage and authentication or a high entropy key for use with symmetric encryption algorithms This is not a hash function but a construction around a hash function to make it more resistant to attacks such as bruteforce rainbowtables etc A simple example to understand what is meant by construction is PBKDF which uses salting and iterations to increase the cost of breaking the hash to the attacker The crypto section would then be revised to use these terms appropriately I want to translate this book into Chinese Its a pretty good book Hi this book is useful for gopher to follow the best practice of secure programming Would you mind I translate this book to Traditional Chinese I will link to origin repository and follows the license thanks
