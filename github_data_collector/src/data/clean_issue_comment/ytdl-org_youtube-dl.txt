Description of your pull request and other information This pull request fixes the RoosterTeeth extractor to allow downloading bonus episodes from the service this fixes The following videos are examples which cannot be downloaded with the current version but can be downloaded using my fix The extractor fails to download the episode JSON metadata due to a HTTP Error The reason for this is that the API endpoint used by the extractor to extract the metadata apiv episodesid does not seem to support bonus episodes However by reverseengineering the website of RoosterTeeth I discovered the endpoint apiv listitemsbybulkidorderedtrue slugstrue which is used there to gather the metadata Both endpoints return the same data if the request is answered The new endpoint however does also support normal episodes which are downloadable with the current version By the way I allowed thumbnails of the type bonusfeatureimage to be also accepted because this type and not the common episodeimage is used to indicate thumbnails of bonus episodes I have tested my fix on python and python not python as I cannot install this python version on my system It would be good if someone else can test this for me I have also tested to download videos which could be already downloaded with the older version and so far every video I tested was possible to download I am using the version of
