For the carousel indicators the navbar toggler and the upcoming stand alone accordion components it would be handy to switch from svg background images to inline SVGs This way well have more control over hover states and we could save some file size in our generated CSS Maybe we should switch to SVG for the close button to this will make it easier to theme the focus state see In I tried combining too many things in one PR In this PR I just enabled the possibility to use RFS in the utility API We ll see how well deal with the responsive font size and responsive spacing classes afterwards Closes Codepen with bug present in issue Tested this in Codepen The minwidth on the col actually prevents the col from taking up the entire row space This was only an issue on the default cols because specified cols have a fixed flexbasis property that prevents this issue from happening Closes Updated the docs pages by searching for the rounded classes and replacing them by the new borderradius classes See Closes Preview Instead of setting a background color on the tr tag we set the backgroundcolor on the th or td tags below the tr tag This way we can set the correct backgroundcolor for the th and td tags that also have color variant class tableprimary tablesecondary closes when installing bootstrapsass into ASPNET Core project the sass files are not added to the project The reason is described here package authors should use contentFiles element instead of old content element when creating packages The author do include those files in the contentFiles folder when generating nuget packages However he also need to specify the contentFiles element in xxnuspec file like this issue Only one folder whose name is contentFiles in xxnupkg is not enough if we want to access those files in VS Solution Explorer Steps to reproduce Create default aspnet core project with either CLI or Visual Studio dotnet new webapp cd webapp InstallPackage bootstrapsass NET Core Operating system and version Win Visual Studio optional Fixes x Contrast colors are added to themecolors x Instances with old code are replaced to text contrastcolor Closes This adds a standalone accordion component with its own settings and markup Preview Also added a flush and striped variation Closes Fixes by moving the border bottom from the header to a border top on the body we fix the overlapping issue where the border would be invisible if the body had a background color This also allowed me to also remove the overflow hidden on the accordionitem which fixes Also fixes Currently this is still a work in progress x Add active state x Add focus state x Add icon based on collapsed state Double check design Double check code Check if all conditions described in are met If these conditions are met check if is still relevant
