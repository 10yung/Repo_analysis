some protector example vmp use win program to dynamic execute net code so we should use dnspy to debug or dump net code in this case but dnspy antidebug is not strong ERROR with disabled profile when loading any EXE file to odbg OS WIN X the default one doesnt really work thanks Hi I am fairly new to reversing so I am sorry for the dumb questions that I am about to ask I am trying to reverse this program which has IsDebuggerPresent and CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent to protect against debugging I used the x dbg and found that using the Obsidium profile will allow me to run the program without it picking up x dbg Now my main goal is to use ScyllaHide with other debugging software such as Mega Dumper Smart assembly explorer dnSpy and fiddler I have looked through the manual so I did use the InjectorCLIx exe program to attach the HookLibraryx dll file onto the program I am trying to crack However this only allows me to open x dbg debugger and all of the other debuggers I would like to use is still detected by the program If anyone could shed some light on what I am doing wrong or how I can fix this it is appreciated Hi I do not know where to turn for help so I am writing here A lot of time I can not run this application in debug mode This is openjdk which is protected from change protected library jvmdll PEiD has detected a low version of VMProtect although this is most likely I have a lot of creakme version and with them there are no problems but with this version there Here is the link to the file I used dbg and pluginsScyllaHideTitanHideSharpOD ver Windows has a separate implementation for OutputDebugStringW rather than passing the string to OutputDebugStringA quoting their note Important In the past the operating system did not output Unicode strings via OutputDebugStringW and instead only output ASCII strings To force OutputDebugStringW to correctly output Unicode strings debuggers are required to call WaitForDebugEventEx to opt into the new behavior On calling WaitForDebugEventEx the operating system will know that the debugger supports Unicode and is specifically opting into receiving Unicode strings The plugin if Im not mistaken currently supports OutputDebugStringA only This article by ntquery talks about this scyllahidelog Some Nt WINAPI functions are not exported by a DLL so it is necessary to get the function addresses from another source The other source is the PDB le The adresses can be resolved with the NtApiTool packaged in the release It will download the PDB le from the Microsoft server to resolve the missing function addresses Ok I executed PDBReaderexe where it wasin the NtApiTool folder I didnt move it in the x dbg directory And it created some folders with some pdb in them What should I do now I must admit that I am ashamed of myself right know Please help I get the error C after a dll call before the installation of the plug in I was getting the error at the start of the Module ntdlldll now I get the error after the call of a proprietary dll I tried most of the options but every time I get the same error in the same location Hello According to I can use ScyllaHide to inject a DLL img so does this means I can inject ANY dll into a process in a stealthy way even if its not related to debugging Hi I use ScyllaTestx exe and see that ScyllaHide OutputDebugStringA protection for OllyDbg doesnt work img width altsnap at src img width altsnap at src This problem was mentioned in Twitter years ago too
