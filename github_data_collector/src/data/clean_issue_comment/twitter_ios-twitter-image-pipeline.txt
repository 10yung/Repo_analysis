Thanks for sharing TIP Looks very very impressive Currently I use PINRemoteImage in my app and enjoy it very much If I may I wanted to ask the following What were the reasons you felt that PINRemoteImage would not be good for the Twitter iOS app What are the key differences to consider when choosing between both Thanks again for sharing this library Hi guys You published this library very conveniently since we just yesterday started seeing problems with our image caching over at Forza Football Reading your description they are similar to yours and everything this library does seems to fit us very well so we are evaluating it right now However there is one problem that pretty much every image caching library on iOS suffers from how to handle updatedoutdated images I would like to ask you if its possible or how you would solve an updated image residing on the same URL as before For example if our servers set a maxage of days will the library discard the image after days and request a whole new one even if its the same image We sometimes need to update an image on the same URL so we cant set a too high max age But we still would like the HTTPcaching functionalities Ideally after days the library would request the image and if it gets a it just keeps the same image in the cache and refreshes the TTL Looking at the process you describe in your README it seems to me that the library will never attempt to refresh an image if its already in the cache Is this true
