See Please review and let me know if this works for you Since Restify x removed the restifyerrors property I had to use the restifyerrors package The most important change is that restifyerrors dont allow the customization of the body but it does allow the creation of new errors using the makeConstructor function So the JSON output will change a little bit from error errorDescription to code message Does that comply with the specification In Restify v x all errors definitions were moved into the separate repository restifyerrors As a result restifyoauth code requires refactoring as described here errors doesnt really exist natively in restify in the same way as before thus switch to restifyerrors for errors gives better errors The framework will always check for a token on POST requests Here is an example apppostusercreate userCreate appgetusercreate userCreate function userCreatereq res resjsonjsonJay SON return The get requests returns correctly the post request returns the following code BadRequestError message Bearer token required Follow the oauth token link to get one Why can I not use a password granttype without providing a Authorization header Hi everyone is it possible to set custom error messages within the ropc optionhooks as i dont have access to res the only way i found is to modify the ropcgrantTokenjs file Regards In at least some cases sending without declaring explicit content types can lead it to not be set when the response is sent Hi Im not sure Im approaching this right but when using restify with restifyoauth to secure an api endpoint for Web app Im getting a login dialog at least on Chrome To battle that I forked and added a new option noWwwAuthenticate next to the tokenEndpoint wwwAuthenticateRealm etc and then I have a logic to not set appropriate header in makeErrorSendersjs for both setWwwAuthenticateHeader and setWwwAuthenticateHeaderWithoutErrorInfo I think I overlooked something in the docs orand usage specs Do reckon there is a proper approach to it In case you find this useful I can create a pull request Hi I would like to use both Authorization Grant CC and ROPC with same tokenEndpoint restifyOAuth ccserver tokenEndpoint token hooks restifyOAuth Hooks restifyOAuth ropcserver tokenEndpoint token hooks restifyOAuth RopcHooks What is the best way to setup or patch Regards Is there any interest in supporting some way of disabling the automatic addition of the token route in order to support usage of restifyoauth in multiple servers on the same domain My use case is that Id like to have a restify server running at mydomaincomapiauth which has a token route and then multiple other servers running at other points which do not grant tokens but use the restifyoauth library to validate tokens To be more explicit Im interested in something like this javascript server running at mydomaincomapiauth var restify requirerestify restifyOauth requirerestifyoauth server setup restifyOAuth ccserver includeTokenEndpoint true serverlisten server running at mydomaincomapiusers var restify requirerestify restifyOauth requirerestifyoauth server setup restifyOAuth ccserver includeTokenEndpoint false serverget function req res if reqclientId return ressendUnauthenticated rescontentType applicationjson ressendmessage I can tell you got a token from the other server serverlisten If theres interest Im happy to work on a pull request Thanks
