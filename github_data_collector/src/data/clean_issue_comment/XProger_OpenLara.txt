 In the original game every time you run into a wall while pressing Action Lara don t crash into the wall I mean when Lara wit the wall with her arms and say Uhhh When playing OpenLara it doesn t matter if you are pressing Action Every time you run into a wall Lara chashes into it For example in the original game if you run into a climbable wall while pressing action Lara runs into the wall stops in front of the wall with no crashing and automatically climbs it With openlara Lara crash into the wall before climb it Changing direction problems When you press A switch version Lara changes direction by rotating her body into the floor So the main issue here is when you change de direction when you are in a square platform For example in the original game if you climb on a gym box or any block or square platform and you are standing in the edge when you press Circle PSX version Lara makes the direction change animation into the oposite edge of the block and she keeps standing ON the block That means that you can change the direction standing on a block without falling down If you do this with OpenLara Lara changes the direction into the oposite edge and FALLS down You have to press Action to avoid Lara falling So the problem here may not be the change direction action itself maybe the problem is the Lara start position on the block I mean that if you climb on the block Lara is not standing on the very edge of this block I can notice that Lara is standing a little foward maybe that s the reason why Lara falls down when the change direction animation ends Enemies are not too aggressive Playing OpenLara I can notice that enemies are in a easy mode Two player mode error When you play the LAST OpenLara version for switch multiplayer mode is not working well When you press the player stick to start the multiplayer mode the screen goes black for player and in the player screen graphics are not shown well This problems are not present in last versions of OpenLara for Switch Using the change direcion action to avoid hurting Lara In the original game if you fall from a high platform and you expect several damage to Lara if you keep pressing Circle button psx while Lara is taking contact with the floor you take less damage This is useful because you can keep Lara alive in a lot of accidental falling situations AND the changing direction animation starts JUST when Lara touches the floor With OpenLara this is not working like that If you fall from a high platform and you keep pressing A switch Lara doesn t makes the change direction animation when touches the floor and of course she doesn t avoid hurting Bad button combination to enter First Person View mode Some advanced players need to use the guns while using the Look button So with openlara is impossible to do that because if you are pressing L with the guns in Lara s hands you cannot use the guns because if you try to do it you enter into First Person View mode I think a better button combination should be LR When holding down X around this area in Tomb of Qualopec the highest point in the corridor just before the second switch in the room with the movable platforms Lara behaves as if shes standing in front of a pushpullable block even when shes not anywhere near a wall Pushing up or down doesnt seem to do anything anywhere in the bugged area grafik Current version start level with black screen After some steps and turns the image appears and disappears after a few steps Sound and control are presented iOS version of OpenLara unable to save game Finding save crystal give saving error but enable load current save If application closed and started again saved progress is absent F CE FA C ACD DFFCA I have a couple of test levels which were created in DXTre D This is the only editor capable to create levels for anything other than TR These levels just crashed OL Seems like this is the same bug which was already fixed in OT years ago Look here for explanation Ive seen that occasionally when rats went inside movable blocks or puma went through walls in narrow places Also rats can climb on top of movable blocks Lara can shoot through walls Looks like this can happen at steep angles It can be seen if she faced the first opened door in St Francis Folly but stands below it When gorillas are above her on a ladder she sometimes shoots through walls and kills them You need to keep pressing ACTION so she still targets them even when she cant see them In St Francis Folly pushing not pulling block towards first door doesnt properly trigger camera switch It seems to me that enemies know far later that Laras nearby and when theyre alerted they dont immediatley run right at her like in the original half the time they even run away from her Even the TRex isnt a real threat that way In original Lara cant grab the opposite ledge from standing jump she can in OL and in OL she stumbles over the edge if she takes running jump instead PS That classic OT bug Yes I know its extremely hard to fix and wont expect it to happen any time soon but there should be a place for this bug nevertheless Screenshot from
