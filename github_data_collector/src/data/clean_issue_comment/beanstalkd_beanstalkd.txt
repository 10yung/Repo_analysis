I know this was previously an issue that was supposed to be fixed in However were still seeing this happen Were currently using beanstalk and noticed that our binlog directory has grown to over GB in usage When looking at beanstalk stats we have roughly K jobs in a delayed state Even with our maximum job size of MB of jobs are going to be less than or MB each that only puts us at GB of storage It appears as though jobs that have been purged are not being removed from disk Is there a safe way to clean up after this How can we prevent it from happening This is from PR Add a command wait id r n that responds with DELETED id r n or BURIED id r n only once a job has been deleted or buried This allows a client to be notified about the status of a job without polling From the docs The wait command waits until a particular job is out of the system before responding It can be used to block a client until a job is completed It looks like this wait id r n wait options id is the job id to wait for wait responses The client expects one line of response once the state of the job has changed which may be DELETED id r n to indicate the job was deleted via the delete command normal success BURIED id r n to indicate the job was buried via the bury command NOTFOUND r n if the job id does not exist A response wont be sent by the server until the specified job is deleted or buried The wait command can be issued multiple times before a response is received in order to wait on a collection of jobs IMG Not sure that it has much of use really Just created while was exploring sources Should we add it to sources as an ASCII diagram Hi Iv got this errors on syslog and process killed could you explain it to me Aug nlkjgqueueba beanstalkd Error in usrbinbeanstalkd free invalid size x f fd

systemd beanstalkdservice Failed with result signal The somewhat reliable way to run beanstalkd is to have f fsync on every command That means very bad performance The default option F never fsync is a bad idea If machine crashes user can lose everything since last time kernel flushed buffers instead of just couple of milliseconds of data Lets look at the benchmarks to get an idea of good default value for f ctbenchputdelete nsop MBs ctbenchputdeletewal fsync ms nsop MBs ctbenchputdeletewal fsync ms nsop MBs ctbenchputdeletewal fsync ms nsop MBs ctbenchputdeletewal nofsync nsop MBs ctbenchputdelete nsop MBs ctbenchputdeletewal fsync ms nsop MBs ctbenchputdeletewal fsync ms nsop MBs ctbenchputdeletewal fsync ms nsop MBs ctbenchputdeletewal nofsync nsop MBs Performance degrades only for the fsync period zero ms is a good enough tradeoff between performance and the amount of data lost in a powerloss crash We can measure performance for other f values around the value of ms to get more accurate measurement beanstalkdmaintainers what do you think Problem description this is a specific solution meant to address raised in and The idea is to have a pipeline command which causes a fixed set of subsequent commands to be handled atomically This could be used to reduce the number of round trips to the server or for use cases where a set of actions needs to be atomic Proposed solution new command pipeline bytes r nthe commands in the pipeline r n response OK bytes r nresponses to those commands r n The commands following pipeline would be exactly as they would be if not in a pipeline The data following a pipeline OK would be the responses from each of the command in the same order as the commands were included in the pipeline Semantically they would be processed the same way except if any command failed the others would also fail We would add two new error codes PIPELINEERROR one of the other commands in the pipeline failed PIPELINEINVALID one of the commands in the pipeline cant be used in a pipeline The set of commands allowed in a pipeline could be limited to put reservewithtimeout delete use watch and ignore We might also want to include kick touch and bury With pipeline putintube becomes pipeline use put move becomes pipeline delete use put admittedly not exactly the same thing reservebatch becomes pipeline reservewithtimeout reservewithtimeout On some OSX fsync does not affect performance that much I was staggered by this and started looking What I have found For applications that require tighter guarantees about the integrity of their data Mac OS X provides the FFULLFSYNC fcntl The FFULLFSYNC fcntl asks the drive to flush all buffered data to permanent storage Applications such as databases that require a strict ordering of writes should use FFULLFSYNC to ensure that their data is written in the order they expect fsync usage on OSX should be replaced with fcntlfd FFULLFSYNC if FFULLFSYNC is defined otherwise fallback to fsync In case of IO error in walwrite the srvwal is disabled command is not completed INTERNALERROR is replied to the user But that happens only once in a lifetime of a process All further commands will not touch the disk and jobs will be just stored in the memory Client will have no clue that his next retry was not fully successful that is beanstalkd no longer stores jobs to the WAL This is not a robust solution Client should have a better chance to understand that storage is broken except for transient INTERNALERROR reply ADDON also walmaint should be error checked before returning a success to the user Related issue Protocol states If a client violates the protocol such as by sending a request that is not wellformed or a command that does not exist or if the server has an error the server will reply with one of the following error messages OUTOFMEMORY r n The server cannot allocate enough memory for the job The client should try again later INTERNALERROR r n This indicates a bug in the server It should never happen If it does happen please report it at But often the program throws INTERROR into the face of user when job cannot be written to the disk c r enqueuejobcsrv j jrdelay if r replyserrc MSGINTERNALERROR return At the same time when WAL file cannot be allocated program respond by OOM c We want to update the delay deadline on disk so reserve space for that if delay int z walresvupdate csrvwal if z replyserrc MSGOUTOFMEMORY return Returning OOM for the case of error with IO is too optimistic unless we can extract a special case of ENOSPC No space left on device and report OOM only for that case All other IO errors should be reported as some kind of IO ERROR so the user should stop using this server and check beanstalkds output for the clues and maybe check disk for consistency If INTERNALERROR was chosen to indicate a bug in a software it means that it should not be used for disk IO errors because they can happen and it is not in a power of beanstalkd to prevent this so user should take measures with his hardware And INTERNALERROR should be used only for bugs unexpected cases for which should be generated a log message that could be reported to the maintainers of beanstalkd kickjob should return MSGINTERNALERROR on IO error so the client will get a clue what is going on
