why i install tensorflow and import tensrofow have error abour illegal instruction core dumped Is there any way I could request you to upload the file for TF macOS Catalina Itd be greatly appreciated Thanks Hi first of all thanks for your effort in creating different flavors of TensorFlow binaries I am currently in the process of creating a Docker base image containing somewhat recent versions of Python and TensorFlow with AVX support You provide a Python version which additionally has AVX F support enabled but this version wont run on my target system as the CPU does not support AVX F Is it possible to ship a Linuxtargeted version but without AVX F support Ubuntu would be fine Alpine would be even better for use in Docker containers although I guess that you could make a Ubuntucompiled binary work under Alpine as well by swapping musl for libs in the Alpine image This seems like a good starting point Can we have TF or for Ubuntu and python python is a default version on Ubuntu I use MacOS High sierra with Python and have G without AVX support I would like to use one of the latest versions of Tensorflow My cpu support avx and avx but not avx f I build tensorflow myself And tensorflow works well but tensorboard still report the following error F tensorflowcoreplatformcpufeatureguardcc The TensorFlow library was compiled to use AVX F instructions but these arent available on your machine I have two questions How can I set cpu feature support when building tensorflow I think it is configured automatically when building on my platform How can I control tensorboard version tensorboard is collected when installing tensorflow whl file Is it possible that tensorflow is suitable for my cpuavx and avx but not avx f but tensorboard is not suitable for my cpu
