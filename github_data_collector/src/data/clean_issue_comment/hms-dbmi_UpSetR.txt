upset does not allow matrix class inputs or the identical class table because UpSetRordersets tries to subset using the idiosyncratic data sets instead of the more standard data sets See the example

asmatrix asdataframe upset PS I really enjoyed the UpSetR presentation at BioC When trying to generate plots where zeroonly sets are included by specifying the sets explicitly sets upset fails if the first or last column contain only zeros The attached patch for the FindStartEnd heuristic fixes this behavior for me Im not sure whether this breaks other use cases though Hi I have an UpSetR plot stored in a variable plot I am trying to export it as a PDF file plot upsetfromListdata orderby freq pdffilefilenamepdf onefileFALSE plot devoff But the resulting PDF cannot be opened by Preview I am running the script on mac os X Exporting to JPG produce the expected plot plot upsetfromListdata orderby freq jpegfilefilenamejpg plot devoff Am I missing something Hello The tool is quite practical but for my use case it lacks an empty category a way to display the population that is in no set One option would be to build a new category like none but it would appears on top of existing categories and show a black dot for the population that appears in none I am considering implementing a solution that would take an optional population or an optional count to display it on top of grey dots Would this make sense would this be welcome Description When simultaneously using a log transformation for the intersection scale and using a query to highlight certain intersections the query does not highlight the appropriate bar in the intersection plot Working example R libraryUpSetR df dataframematrix ncol nrow df c nrowdf df df namesdf cID var var myquery listlistquery

actual data generated by the UpSetR package in terms of the number of possible intersections generated and their associated value I work primarily in Population Genetics and something like that would be really useful to be able to determine things like betweenpopulation diversity ie the sum of intersections between all overlaps vs withinpopulation diversity ie value of single category with no overlap Hello thank you for this useful package I like the ability to condense many venn diagrams down into one visualization Im having a problem displaying all intersections between sets Here is my
