Functional Torque Controller Led guidance and MPC GUI Motivation to extend the gokart infrastructure to a wider audience to create a baseline solution in AIDO style docker and so on for the gokart This will be the first stepping stone for an AIDO competition with gokarts in years to create an infrastructure also for research in the area of compositionality of learning and similar You will need to work a bit with everyone mainly Alessandro for the zauron Enrico and Giole for MPC related control datahaki for everything so good team spirit and use of git are a must Milestone Write a client process that translates a joystick configuration into actuator commands and sends them to the gokart via a defined protocol yet to be defined Show that you can control the gokart by joystick Milestone Extend the client process to listen to IMU and wheel odometry messages and create a position estimate of the moving gokart in realtime Background The original clothoid appoximation scheme by Reif performs all computations in the complex plane The resulting clothoids are invariant under addition of multiples of to the angles of the control points For example the clothoid between the two points x y and is identical to the clothoid generated between and Task Description The original scheme involves approximating integrals of complexvalued functions We have generalized the computations to polar coordinates to track winding numbers Our current implementation handles one additional winding compared to the original scheme Extend the scheme by tracking the winding number in the npoint Gauss Legendre quadrature numeric integration Illustration clothoidcomparison References video video Approx Clothoids with Extended Winding Numbers Master Thesis JG Motivation Apart from racing purposes the gokart is usually considered a ludic device that can be driven by all kind of possible users children young people adults old people that are generally characterized by different driving styles and different perception of risks In this thesis we want to implement humanbased constraints about pathaccelerationscollision speed in the preexisting MPCC strategy aiming both at ensuring safe trajectories both at improving driving comfort and fun As an example strong accelerations should be penalized when a child is driving on the contrary an adult might be more excited by high accelerations and strong braking Tasks Definition and implementation of humanconstraints in the preexisting MPCC in terms of pathspeedaccelerations Definition of suitable cost functions with different aims driving comfort safety Introducing the possibility of lowspeed collisions with obstacles on the track Providing the user with the authority of controlling the pedals in a cooperative driving framework Expected outcome Appropriate documentation of all the experiments showing the ability to turn good theoretical models into working code Modular and reusable implementation of the tasks References Marc Heim Thesis Motivation The goal of this semester project is to define and implement a model of the steering column of the gokart that takes as input the necessary torque to steer the vehicle in the track In the past we have not assumed any model but used a simple PID controller to steer The new model helps to determine the steering torque directly and is therefore much more suitable for future extensions than the current position controller Tasks Literature review of the state of the art for the modeling of the entire steering system motor trusssystem front tire Main goal come up with a model of the steering column Understand the existing implementation MPC produces steering angle and steering rate as input for the steering column the PID controller then uses these numbers to command the steering System identification conceive and carry out experiments for data collection find parameters for the chosen model Modify the existing MPC implementation to use the new steering model and provide a proof of concept through simulation Slow driving experiments on real hardware tests that establish robustness Extra Investigate change in racing lap performance steering characteristics Expected outcome Modular and reusable implementation of the tasks Leave a trail of good documentation behind References Marc Heim Thesis Borrelli s paper steering column Antonia Mosberger Thesis power steering Background The brake on the autonomous gokart consist of the builtin hydraulic braking system behind a pedal that can be actuated by the human driver or alternatively by a software controlled linear motor One shortcoming of the braking system is that the brake cannot be actuated on the left and right rear wheel tire individually Prior investigations of the braking system have established response time and braking deceleration at locked tires Prior control strategies were a simple antilock logic Task Description carry out experiments that investigate the braking effect under different track conditions temperature rise of linmot enhance the existing antilock braking by incorporating the rearwheel motors and wheel odometry develop a model for the brake and braking effect of the gokart for use in a MPC develop and test MPCbased deceleration with performance guarantees that does not violate constraints on operating temperature and antilock characteristics References Emergency Braking Antilock Braking Background While the gokart is manually driven around a track the TrackReconModule classifies the space into free or occupied After one loop around the track has been completed the module automatically extracts the lane boundaries When the software is closed the information about the track is discarded Task Description store the coordinates of the track waypoints allow to reset the track waypoints in the GUI Visualization of Track Background Postprocessing has shown that while the state estimation is reliable the mapping of the lidar points is not straightforward In rapid turns there is an angular deviation that likely stems from a twist of the lidar mount Task Description write an offline pipeline to determine the actual lidar pose with respect to the gokart coordinate system quantify the amplitude of the mismatch of pose and lidar position introduce a liveestimation of the lidar position with respect to the gokart coordinate system make use of the new functionality to enhance the obstacle mapping Visualization of Twist References video
