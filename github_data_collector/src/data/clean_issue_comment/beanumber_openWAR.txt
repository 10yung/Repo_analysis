bisboxscorexml is not available for games this season For example this directory has no bisboxscorexml which is a file this library depends on to build out war Im looking at working around this but wondering if anyone has some info on why gameday at mlbcom isnt providing this file anymore ds getDatastart Retrieving data from found games Error in groupeddfimpldata unnamevars drop Column gameId is unknown So the update by znmeb fixes part of this but now I get ds getDatastart Retrieving data from found games day gid anamlbo day gid bosmlbt day gid chamlbk day gid chnmlbm day gid clemlbs day gid houmlbt day gid minmlbb day gid nyamlbt day gid pitmlbd day gid pitmlbd day gid sfnmlbl day gid slnmlbn day gid wasmlbc Error in groupeddfimpldata unnamevars drop Column gameId is unknown It looks like MLB gameday has changed the game ids in their anchor tags The urls from game day are including the dayxx portion of the url in the gameid now this is causing an issue in getUrls where it tries to parse out the year month and date readData was returning s due to this issue I received this error when retrieving data for the regular season When I change the line of code in getData from out dplyrbindrowsdslist to out docallrbind lapplydslist dataframe stringsAsFactorsFALSE the code completes without an error though balls and strikes are of type character so they need to be converted to integer out transformout balls asintegerballs strikes asintegerstrikes I compared running makeWAR on the May data set to the MayProcessed data set and noticed that the deltafield and deltapitch columns in the New MayProcessed data set differed from the original MayProcessed data set They actually look transposed which you can see below I did this using dplyr but I first noticed it when testing makeWAR after refactoring for dplyr NewMayProcessed makeWARMay headNewMayProcessedopenWARPlays c batterId start B start B start B pitcherId gameId delta deltafield deltapitch deltabr deltabat NA NA NA gid anamlboakmlb NA NA NA NA gid anamlboakmlb NA NA gid anamlboakmlb NA NA NA gid anamlboakmlb NA gid anamlboakmlb NA gid anamlboakmlb headMayProcessedopenWARPlays c batterId start B start B start B pitcherId gameId delta deltafield deltapitch deltabr deltabat NA NA NA gid anamlboakmlb NA NA NA NA gid anamlboakmlb NA NA gid anamlboakmlb NA NA NA gid anamlboakmlb NA gid anamlboakmlb NA gid anamlboakmlb The original MayProcessed data set was added over years ago and there have been quite a few changes to makeWAR since then I imagine this happened when openWAR and dplyrized Im pretty sure it has to do with Line xdata mutatexdata deltapitch ifelseisnadeltafield delta delta deltafield So I guess it boils down to which data set is correct Is it the original MayProcessed data set I received the above error when running dat openWARgetDatastart end The error occurred after going through all dates and no dat resulted JSS prefers to publish papers about packages where the package is on CRAN and has been there long enough to have matured ie obvious bugs ironed out and a few active users This is partly because we have so many submissions that it helps to filter some out and this approach provides some basic quality checks So I suggest you begin by developing the package for CRAN This is a preference rather than a requirement and it is not stated anywhere in the JSS rules A paper describing a package that has only recently been put on CRAN will still be considered but the probability of it getting through the reviewing process is smaller Are the replacement levels robust Can the robustness of these estimates be improved with data from multiple seasons
