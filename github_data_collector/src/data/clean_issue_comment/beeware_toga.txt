This PR has a lot to disentangle And I will split it in at least two separate PRs I just wanted to discuss the ideas first You may have strong opinions about this especially on the first part Take it merely as a first suggestion Changes to togaTree Document all arguments This is especially useful for data explaining what is accepted as a data source Provide two additional keyword arguments sortingFalse and sortkeysNone The implementation can query those values to see if it should support sorting and if yes how to sort the columns If given sortkeys should be a list of sort keys as in Pythons sorted function If not given it defaults to caseinsensitive alphabetic sorting For sorting to work the data source should implement a method sortaccessor reverseFalse keyNone which sorts all its children It should be equivalent to Pythons sorted function with the addition of the accessor argument I can attach an example with a reasonable default implementation if you like Improvements to Cocoa implementation Switch from a cellbased to a viewbased NSOutlineView This does not change the appearance but speeds up drawing of the cells by orders of magnitude Especially resizing columns is smooth now Previously painting each cell took around ms This improvement mainly comes from no longer creating a new view for every cell Instead I allow NSOutlineView to create and reuse existing views on demand If multipleselect is True allow the user to select all rows by pressing CMDA Default to alternating row colors Implement sorting by column if sorting is True and if the datasource provides a sort method This will actually change the order of elements in the datasource Edit Change the cocoa implementations of insert to actual insert the new row instead of reloading all rows This is much quicker and prevents the current selection from changing on insert Add a more complex example with icons and sorting A view of the file system freakboy I have been looking at the ImageView widget and wondering about implementing some styling such as alignment frames etc I have seen in the src that you have already stubs of commentedout code for alignment This has raised a question for me when should properties be determined by the given style and when should they be given as properties of the widget itself Some platforms show horizontal lines to visually separate content as seen in many macOS preference panes On macOS this is typically a NSBox with type NSBoxSeparator On iOS this could be a UIView with a pixel hight I have no idea about other platforms Would it make sense to ass this as a Widget Hi I am a beginnner in a beeware and I am trying to make a application with beeware by using the example given in the documentation When I run the briefcase dev command the application

names for lists of dictionary objects These special keys are not mentioned in the API docs What are the full list of special keys Also the docs state that data argument is a list of str Is that still true or does it have to be a list of dict now Is there a variant for horizontalrow lists eg is style Pack directionCOLUMN supported Is DetailedList too restrictedspecific for a generic widget What if I want more than one icon What if I want an Icon some text then an icon etc Whats the best way to implement a custom DetailedList List of Widgets Boxes Expected Behavior If youre describing a bug tell
