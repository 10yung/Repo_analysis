VolumesworkProjectszappatestsassetscoffee From my understanding its impossible to do via connectexpress middleware and it could be nice addition to zappa Say get render index foo bar And if request has header Accepttype applicationjson server will respond with JSON foobar instead of view index rendered with foobar Will it be accepted into upstream If yes I can do that Today i tried to run a simple app to test zappa but after npm install express npm install zappa i goto windows console with node arequirezappa i get the error Cannot read property prototype of undefined at zappajs zappajs Edit now running at Trying to get a sense for where were at following the recent discussion on the list and the similar issue with coffekup that lead to coffeecup I just noticed offtheshelf npm install zappa got broken with the release of express alpha so Id be looking at putting something together rather rapidly Has anyone already started on this track I was using everyauth lib as middleware and it doesnt work with Zappa when passing express middleware object as arguments of contextuse Didnt see any shortcuts for joiningleaving rooms as well as broadcasting to specific rooms
