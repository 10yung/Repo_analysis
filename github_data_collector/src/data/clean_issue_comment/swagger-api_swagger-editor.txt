configuration issue i tried opening the url in chrome but i only get a Cannot GET error Content configuration Is your feature request related to a problem Our swagger file has more than lines Its very good that I can jump to the definition of a model or path by clicking the little arrow in the UIpreview window It would be great if the inverse would be possible Sadly I do not have any good
