 This extends query server with batch knn query based on the batch knn query implementation in the python bindings Hi Even though we are able to see progress bar in terminal using this line indexcreateIndexpost printprogressTrue SS Progress bar cannot be seen in Jupyter Notebook cells Could you please fix this issue Thank you For example tqdm progress bar has another function for Jupyter Notebook like from tqdm import tqdmnotebook as tqdm I am using scispacy UmlsLinker which relies on nmslib Upon trying to import nmslib I get the following ImportError envscondadirectorylibpython sitepackagesnmslibcpython mx linuxgnuso undefined symbol ZTINSt thread StateE Trace is the following from scispacyumlslinking import UmlsEntityLinker from scispacycandidategeneration import CandidateGenerator import nmslib I used pip to install scispacy into my conda environment and exported that to a yml file Subsequently I created this conda environment in another machine using this yml file There is no import issue in the original conda environment but there is in this one in c how to input the label the sampledata do not contain the label who can help me Thanks for the effort you put in this library I am facing two issues with loadIndex A suffix dat is added to the specified index name with no way to disable or change it MemoryError for a relatively small index G on a G server First I create and save the index as follows python index nmslibinitmethodhnsw spacecosinesimil indexaddDataPointBatchdata ids indexcreateIndex M post efConstruction printprogressTrue indexsaveIndexsavedindexndx the data contains roughly million entries dat suffix is added automatically to the filename A dat suffix is added to the file name savedindexndx with no way to disable or alter this behavior This is not a blocker I can rename the file But I want to know if its recommended to suffix the saved index filename with dat MemoryError As I mentioned despite that the index index is relatively small around G when I try to load it I get the error python MemoryError stdbadalloc The code I use to load the index is the following python index nmslibinitmethodhnsw spacecosinesimil indexloadIndexsavedindexdat printprogressTrue I also tried loading the index with the following code python In index nmslibloadIndexsavedindexdat This fails with the error TypeError Traceback most recent call last ipythoninput cc b in module index nmslibloadIndexsavedindexdat TypeError loadIndex incompatible function arguments The following argument types are supported arg object arg object object Invoked with savedindexdat The error message and the function signature arent very helpful to understand the input parameters or to debug I am using nmslib Thanks I am using pip x on WIndows I already have pyblind and numpy Thanks a lot Hi Neoanarika It would be nice to have the function to retrieve all the nodes that are part of the existing index Was just wondering any reason we did not expose this function Thanks in Advance Has anyone attempted to leverage this to us GPUs Jeff I am getting a dlopen error when importing nmslib after tensorflow python c import tensorflow printtensorflowcontrib import nmslib File string line in module module tensorflowcontrib from ImportError dlopen cannot load any more object with static TLS printing tensorflow contrib simulates importing a module that uses tensorflow eg extending its classes switching the order gives no error and everything works correctly But in the context of a large code base it is hard to ensure that nmslib is always imported first since there are many entrypoints The same thing happens with tensorflow and it looks similar to this issue This does not happen on my mac but only on our Circle CI build running in a circlecipython docker image Any suggestions for how to fix this I have tried setting the env variable CXXFLAGSfPIC ftlsmodelglobaldynamic when pip installing nmslib Currently one cant save a optimized index for HNSW that was previously loaded Trying to load such a saved index causes NMSLib to crash As far as I can tell its cause it uses ElListsize to determine what to write but it never saves ElList nor does LoadOptimizedIndex restore ElList
