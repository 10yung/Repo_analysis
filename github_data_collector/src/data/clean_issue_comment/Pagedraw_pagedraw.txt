Security Alerts page details The downloads do not work I was trying to use pagedraw i have installed pagedrawcli but when i run pagedraw login it opens up a page which says The page you were looking for doesnt exist how can i proceed Steps to reproduce nvm use git clone cd pagedraw yarn install cd desktopapp npm install cd Terminal yarn devserver Terminal yarn runelectron Cancel to open json Create new json In pagedraw app create new Artboard and rectangle in it Then Preview button Got error chromewebdata Not allowed to load local resource filepagesundefinedplay amd SMP Debian deb u x GNULinux Are preview working on windowsmacOS Any chance to make preview work Electron app wouldnt start for me I get no windows So I removed show false from new BrowserWindowshow false And enabled dev tools Errors are attached img width altScreenshot src Steps Cloned fresh copy of Pagedraw from Github Followed the install Procedure Started Dev server Started runelectron Additional Info OS MacOS Mojave Node Not sure what I am doing wrong Would appreciate some help in this matter How do I import a sketch file I realize this product has just been open sourced and a community has not yet formed Anyway im throwing this idea out there because i think it could be interesting When exporting to React Angular or another framework first some internal representation is created from which the export can occur Lets call this internal representation Pagedraw Model PM The PM could be least common denominator which the frameworks support Maybe this idea is somewhat similar to but then for the web When the PM can be extracteddownloaded It can also be uploaded by users for other users to get the component for their framework of choice Right now there are collections of components for particular frameworks such as for react But they dont offer a good search function only textual with browser search function When there are a lot of components in the collections searching becomes more difficult The PM could help with this By having a definition it could be queried like show me all the models with a single text input and a button Making such a search would not be easy but searching for the type of things can be done Hoogle comes to mind when searching for types not that i suggest that this can be used on for a component search Its not difficult to imagine a repository or marketplace from here if you will I hope someone finds this idea useful I dont have the time means and resources to work on it at the moment But i would like to discuss it a bit more Hi jaredp and co I was trying to get Pagedraw to load on a browser locally and subsequently deploy it I went through the following cloned the repo yarn and then yarn devserver If I visit I get the message described on This is a placeholder needed for our build system in dev mode You should never see it If I just served desktopappindexhtml I get the following error img width altscreenshot src Any tips on getting it to work on a local browser Thank you
