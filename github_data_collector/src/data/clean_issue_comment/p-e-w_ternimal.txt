 Glow renderer capable of frames per second if the terminal can handle it Would be great if ternimal would be capable of printing some stats after the run exactly to check what the terminal is capable of is it fast enough for example Not super happy with the name of the parameter but let me know if this works or how to tweak it so it does Fixes The idea is to extend the current gradient syntax of DISTANCECOLOR to X Y X Y COLOR Where the xnyn coordinates are locations in a x square whose coloring is determined using a combination of a Delaunay mesh and Barycentric interpolation The program then cyclically animates the movement of each point to the next location xn yn every tick seconds new parameter This idea would dramatically enhance the texturing and animation capabilities of Ternimal This could use the same Fourier system as the thickness function Ternimal hides the cursor while drawing a frame to suppress flickering If CtrlC is pressed during this time Ternimal exits but the cursor remains hidden ternimal thickness runs fine but ternimal thickness padding gives Insufficient arena size for path generation For the configured radius and padding either width or height must be at least In other words making more space padding somehow results in less space I just tried this out on Win with unexpected results x Top is PowerShell bottom is Cmder Not totally sure if its the font or wrong version of PowerShell
