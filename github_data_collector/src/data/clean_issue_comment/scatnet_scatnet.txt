Does anyone know how to use the svmtrain function I have followed the tutorial steps to use affinetrain for image classification training but the results were not very ideal I want to change the training function into the svmtrain But the input of svmtrain is different Ive got the following errors Error using svmtrain line Y must be a vector or a character array Error in svmtrain line modelsvm svmtraindoublefeatureclass Error in demo line model svmtraindb trainset svmoptions Y represents the features of all images which is single array but it seems that it can only be a vector like maybe a array I dont know how to fix it Is there anyone can help The problem seems to be that in scat the U metaresolution field isnt initialized Therefore in waveletlayer d its always set to I didnt see an easy way to solve this wo passing an extra parameter to scat since Wop is a cell array of function handles and theres no access to xresolution field hello when I run the audio demo m there are error Error using createsrc line No data files found in the specified directory Error in gtzansrc line src createsrcdirectoryfilegtzanobjectsfunfileN Error in audiodemo line src gtzansrcpathtogtzandataset I cant fing the file of gtzan Thanks Hello I dont understand the following behaviour of the ndorder scattering in d Some coefficients are exactly zero when Q and j j even when pathmargin Inf At first I thought it was because the antialiasing filter named lowpass in convsub d doesnt intersect the range of values rng but the same problem happens when filtoptformat is fouriermultires or fourier Below is a minimal working example Oddly enough setting filtoptB seems to solve the problem why so N load handel y y N T filtoptQ filtoptB filtoptJ TtoJTfiltopt filtoptformat fourier scatoptM scatoptpathmargin Inf Wop filters waveletfactory dN filtopt scatopt SU scaty Wop setfigure WindowStyledocked sc displaysliceS imagesclogabssc display energy in logscale to see the black vertical stripes figure hold oncolormap copperhold offdrawnowcommandwindow why is the normalization constant ie pisigma slant in morlet dnoDC and morlet dpyramid different from gabor d ie pisigma slant I can under stand the later as pisigmaxsigmay but i dont understand the first one I am completely new to this field so it might be a dumb question Should probably be moved to the relevant papers folders no They arent really relevant to the general classification framework Calculating the resolution of a signal by taking the quotient with the filter size is errorprone and not always welldefined Perhaps this should be replaced by explicitly passing the resolution with the signal at all times Notably this can cause problems in convsubd where fouriermultires needs to calculate the resolution
