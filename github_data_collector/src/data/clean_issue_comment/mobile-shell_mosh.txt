Proper documentation for State Synchronization Protocol other than a reference implementation would be much appreciated and probably improve adaptation Personally its hard to get a general flow of how to open a server running SSP or connect to a server via SSP from the C Running into this really weird bug with one particular server When Im done with my SSHmosh sessions I like to run exit to tell the server to cleanly break off the connection On most of my servers this works well However on one shared server that I use with others when I run exit from the shell it is immediately followed by the output logout but nothing happens The only way to quit mosh in this state is to issue the Ctrl and then the period command to quit mosh on my side client which is a bit annoying Why isnt mosh terminating the connection Just to test I spun up a fresh Ubuntu server and installed mosh and mosh correctly kills both client and server when I issue the exit command What could be going wrong My cursor changes style from pipe to rectangle in ZSH shell when use vim mode but also in vim when switching from Normal and Insert modes The cursor changes styles when I use ssh but in a mosh session I see only the pipestyle cursor and it never changes Is there a way to fix that behavior Im using the latest git version build on the server and on the client Server archlinux mosh build mosh g cc d Client macosx mosh build mosh g cc d our company use jumpserver as a boston server but it was really slow while do some work in ssh I try to use mosh but it seems need to install mosh in server and I not certain if it can work with jumpserver cause it is not a really ssh SIXEL is an image format that allows highquality image display in terminal For detailed information check libsixel repo and Wikipedia As shown in the comparison below it seems that sixel graphics are supported by SSH but not mosh The terminal emulator tested with is wslterminal v which is based on mintty On Linux mlterm also has sixel support outofthebox SSH img sixelssh mosh img sixelmosh What could possibly go wrong shell mosh serverusrbinmosh hostexamplecom Option s is ambiguous server ssh sshpty Usage usrbinmosh options user host command clientPATH mosh client on local machine default moshclient etc Oops I meant usrbinmoshserver How about Hey this looks like the client and not the server As you can see the display leaves characters from a previous screen and some characters disappear You can see some content from running two ls commands before opening vim Screen Glitches mosh from macOS to Ubuntu LTS Terminal emulator is iTerm Mosh breaks with tmux CC After running the command it freezes and all input is ignored R img width altfb src R img width altfb src It was displayed correctly in and were installed newly newly and tried whether you recurred This phenomenon recurred by an upgrade to and This problem doesnt form by R If its in case of ssh a problem doesnt occur Hi I am having a strange issue with mosh In general mosh has been working great across a wide range of computers that I have Today I installed mosh on a desktop computer of mine For testing my laptop and my desktop are both connected via WiFi to the same access point Computers and mosh versions involved Laptop MacBook Air running macOS Catalina mosh version on laptop mosh installed with homebrew Desktop MSI Cubi running KDE neon User Edition based on Ubuntu mosh version on desktop mosh installed with apt using the default repos of KDE neon Network Both computers are connected to the same Access Point which in turn is connected to a router by cable Things that work I am able to SSH from the laptop to the desktop text userlaptop ssh I am able to SSH from the desktop to the laptop text userdesktop ssh I am able to listen on UDP port on the desktop and send a message to it from the laptop text userdesktop nc w lu text userlaptop nc w u EOF hello EOF text hello I am able to listen on UDP port on the laptop and send a message to it from the desktop text userlaptop nc w lu text userdesktop nc w u EOF hello EOF text hello I am able to connect to the laptop with mosh from the desktop text userdesktop mosh Problem I am unable to connect to the desktop with mosh from the laptop text userlaptop mosh Shows the following message at the top of the terminal with a blue background text mosh Nothing received from server on UDP port To quit Ctrl After about seconds without contact mosh times out and then it exits a few seconds after that with the following output text mosh did not make a successful connection to Please verify that UDP port is not firewalled and can reach the server By default mosh uses a UDP port between and The p option selects a specific UDP port number mosh is exiting
