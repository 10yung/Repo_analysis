Wrong number of parameters instead of passed justify Which is correct as it is that pandertmpDF justify lrrllr works correctly I hope Im not missing something TIA Chris This is tangential to what I think is a bug report Ill put in separately Is it possible to have the options on pander essentially on pandoctable to allow rownamesTRUE This would be symmetrical with rownamesFALSE which is allowed and would greatly simplify asking for rownames of data frames to be printed TIA Chris Is there a way to set multiple pander options in the same command I feel it clutters the code to have lines of panderOptions commands It would be great if we could panderManovafit type from the car package Its complicated however by the fact that the Manova function prints directly instead of generating an object with a relevant matrix pandoc PandocLuaException string local figcaption true bad argument to format number has no integer representation Error pandoc document conversion failed with error

warranty not even for merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose My use case was just caption NULL Im not sure if the default caption still works with this PR Since Im mostly writing stuff in German and the hyphenation function which pander uses under the hood already supports a bunch of languages including German Id like to have an option to change the current hardcoded value of enus The relevant code seems to be this line of helpersR If Im right we just need to be able to set hyphpattern directly in pandoctable and maybe other relevant pander functions I dont know and pass that argument on to koRpushyphen Of course enus could still be the default According to the package documentation the following languages are currently supported out of the box de German new spelling since deold German old spelling en English UK enus English US es Spanish fr French it Italian ru Russian So a lot of nonenglish speaking people would benefit of this addition What do you think Consider the following reprex R librarydplyr librarypander dataframea This a hopefully selfexplanatory example of unduly removed hyphens pandoctablesplitcells usehyphening TRUE a This a hopefully selfexplanatory example of unduly removed hyphens In the output table the hyphen of the word selfexplanatory gets removed because the parameter rmhyph of koRpushyphen is left at its default value of TRUE Im not familiar with the code and therefore didnt submit a pull request yet But I guess it would be enough to add the argument rmhyph FALSE to the following line of helpersR What do you think Alternatively if you see any benefituse case in having the hyphenator removing existing hyphens beforehand I dont an additional parameter could be introduced which passes the the option on to koRpushyphen If I run the following call Pandocbrewtext heading n text output fileinsamdirrtf convert rtf call Pandocbrewtext heading n text output tablesfileindiffdirrtf convert rtf The first call works fine The second creates a file in tables but this file contains only the markdown string and is not converted to rtf same for docx Additionally there is an error displayed pandoc tablesfileindiffdirrtf openFile does not exist No such file or directory
