There is already a deferred fileClose My Environment X Windows This is just an enhancement request Ive noticed that NVM W distinguishes between and bits but not between ia amd and arm If using NVM W on a Windows on ARM machine An arm machine will be identified as bits but it cant run x executables it can run x though So it would be good to have a clause on installcmd to handle it Make sure you have reviewed the common issues and existing issues before submitting a new issue If this is a question about how to use NVM W please use stackoverflow instead If this is an issue regarding antivirus

their node versions It wouldnt require changing any existing behaviour it would be just extra commands maybe One is for assigning a custom name to a version And another one for setting the version based on the custom name So you dont have to remember which version are you using in which project I think its a minimal effort change which brings a really good feature on the table
