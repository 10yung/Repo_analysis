Sorry for offtop Is it exists datasheet for LRA thar used for rumble in switch Do you have the schematics of the right joycon pinout i need to make a bridge for the r button You have the data images listed for the Joycons but not the pro controller Hello I have a weird way of trying to add controllers to my arcade fighting stick but I seem to have run into a new situation with trying to convert the signal from the joy stick into a way signal output Ive done it before with Xbox but the Switchs joy stick is new to me Any ideas would be appreciated Iam currently working on a small project DIY controller and I would like to add the switches iconic small factor joystick so I ordered some from china sadly it would take a lot of timemonth till they come and iam already working on the model so can some great soul take me those measurements preferably into the image Im trying to use BTstack on ESP to read basic data buttons joystick and IMU from a JoyCon controller BTstack has limited support for HID host applications but the HID documentation here is great so Ive been trying to implement what I think is correct protocol I am able to connect a JoyCon to the ESP as an HID device by using the existing hidhostdemo from BTstack I can send any output report I want LEDs change accordingly so I know output reports work However the only input reports I ever receive are the F standard input reports that contain button and joystick hat data If I change the reporting mode using a subcommand or change the name of the ESP to Nintendo Switch so the JoyCon uses full reporting mode by default no data comes in on the ESP not even in response to output reports As far as I can tell the ESP isnt receiving data aside from F reports on the HCI or L CAP layers when it definitely should be Is it possible that there is some incompatibility in BTstack that prevents it from receiving specific reports from a JoyCon Perhaps more L CAP channels need to be opened somehow theres only one for control and one for interrupt currently I can post code if needed but the only modifications Ive made to hidhostdemo are for output reports which dont seem to have any issue I want to add a led to each joycon but I dont know where to connect them I know you can connect them to the HD rumble but I want the leds to stay on while the joycon is on and turn off when the joycons are off I will appreciate it if someone could help me with that Thanks in advance EDIT I think I got it I just need to find Jc on the other joycon ive got a spare wired switch controller what would i need in order to make the wired controller also how
