 I actually have multiple beacon with the same UUID major and minor for some reason but at the end and only ibeacon was scanned I can scan the other beacon using some other apps I also found that the bluetooth address is missing maybe thats the source of the error Below is the screen shot of the app IMG idk why I cant rotate that changed getStaeFromAdapterState to getStateFromAdapterState For example I have iBeacon devices I want to detect them in two separate panels Thanks Hi Could you consider adding support for Estimote telemetry packets as described here I did one Android app about years ago but Im struggling at implementing this myself I found this doc which might help Hi Since this app is Apache v licensed are you considering the fact to add it to FDroid There is a strong community behind that do not use Google Play nor anything else except FDroid You can find some documentation here Otherwise if you dont want to work on the inclusion of this app by yourself would it be ok for you if someone else do it for you
