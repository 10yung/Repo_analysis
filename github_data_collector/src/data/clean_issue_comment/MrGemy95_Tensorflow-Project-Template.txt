 I found that in your example code you loaded the model then ran the variable initialisation which effectively erased the loaded model I changed the code to load the model after initialisation to avoid this problem I hope you accept this change I was running this on tensorflow so it is possible that this behaviour didnt exist in previous versions Add initpathpy in mains in order to add root path in python path Import initpathpy in examplepy
