Most western languages are read from left to right however some languages Persian Arabic are read from right to left which impact how they should be displayed I would find useful if this crate could in addition to detect languages map a Language or a Script to the direction it should be displayed which could be a simple enum DirectionLtr or DirectionRtl for instance It would be interesting to know how this library compares to cld
