Hello I am creating the iOS Mobile application to detect snoring I need to apply Mfcc and Spectrogram to the audio file and need to pass these two in the Tensorflow lite I need to apply Mfcc Melfrequency cepstral coefficients and Spectrogram to the audio file Can you suggest me any solution for this Thanks in Advance Tried to use a simple Neural Network without an activation layer at the output The output needs to be a continuous number example price The API requires an activation function linear but the backpropagation is not implemented That way failing pull requests could be seen automatically travisciorg does this for free and its super popular This probably isnt an issue for this SDK I just added this as a discussion Ive been messing around with getting Neural Networks to play games for example but I want to take it a step further Would it be possible to use something like Mendel an iOS SDK for Genetic Algorithms to evolve a Neural Network using this SDK Tanmay Bakshi TajyMany To those following this repository We are in the process of performing a complete rewrite of Swift AI which will include an update to Swift full Linux support many new features and major improvements and optimizations across the board Heres an overview of whats happening Swift Package Manager x Create a GitHub organization account x Use SPM modules for each component x Update full library to Swift x Break out iOS and macOS examples into separate dedicated packages Features x Brandnew feedforward neural network Recurrent neural network Convolutional neural network x Deep learning support Tools for building genetic algorithms Signal processing APIs Fourier transforms etc Linux Use a C BLAS library for optimized vector calculations OpenCLCUDA acceleration iOS macOS Metal acceleration Experiment with Apples new neural network tools for certain operations iOS API x More intuitive API for creating training and updating neural networks x More intelligent training methods Potentially support Caffe models Optimizations Better memory management The neural network training routines are currently optimized for speed at the expense of memory large upfront allocations are made in order to avoid small heap allocations later We can achieve a better balance x Make use of UnsafePointer when appropriate Bypassing Swifts type safety in certain places can give us a big performance boost x Better random generation of weights Some applications need weights generated along a normal distribution instead of a uniform distribution x Better support for alternative activation functions Website A place for viewing documentation sharing code and getting help This would be fun to have But it also costs Help and Contributions Since Ill be making some dramatic changes to this library I probably wont be accepting contributions until Ive at least settled on the new APIs and standards However there are a few places where I could use some help FeatureAPI suggestions Im especially interested in feedback from people who have used other machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow Torch etc Deep learning experts If this is you lets be in touch Logo and branding The Swift bird is cool but apparently some fruit company owns it Sponsorship Asking for money is lame But it helps things move faster Thanks to everybody for using Swift AI Im excited to see what we build Collin There doesnt seem to be much testing going on Ive got a slave server dedicated to Jenkins Also TDD would be cool I heard its popular with the kids Thoughts
