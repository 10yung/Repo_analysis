Hello Firtsly thanks for developing MODIStsp Until now I had never had problems using MODIStsp Recently I encountered an error Initially I thought it was GDAL But I installed GDAL and the error persists I have also reinstalled MODIStsp several times Please see the error message below Report Thank you in advance Oliver Report Main error Processing and Reprojecting Terra NDVI files MODIStsp

about writing own tabs Im not an expert at this and just want to use the tool Does anyone know the alternative lines to install cairo with x Best and thank you Johannes Hi Im experiencing problems

help to understand what each classe significate Regards Renan Received via mail and moved here Hello professor and researcher I am Rodolpho post graduating in meteorology in Brazil and you could ask an email question about your time series automation package First question Can you add new MODIS products for GUI download Second question I have observed all the processes and there is no way to go wrong but in MODIStspextract to extract the time series of values mean and standard deviation in the different polygons occurs Error in local Object Thank you for your attention and availability Professor Rodolpho Luiz Barros de Medeiros Im testing rgdal and its reverse dependencies with PROJ and DACCEPTUSEOFDEPRECATEDPROJAPIH The CRS offered by PROJ are changing so that even though rgdal is still using the projapih interface for a few more months the underlying CRS parameters are changing Since few are using PROJ yet you have some time to fix this as rgdal will be built with PROJ metadata files in most cases However PROJ was released March so youll need to adapt I attach my check files checklog testthatRoutzip From Great package I have just question while running the package I saw written that QAs were computed In my PC several folders were created In which folder the corrected images of MODIS are Or should I make something else eg use another package in order to take the good quality images When working noninteractiveli eg using an options file it would be better to allow at least some parmaters to be specified from command line For example Start and End Date Bounding Box if spatial file not specified Ouput folders Output options format compression etcetera I am trying to use MODIStsp for running a large batch job on a remote Linux server while logged in via ssh ie solely on the command line without access to a graphical user interface I am using the standalone bashRscript version Unfortunately without an available X output both the installation and after successfully installing the package via X forwarding the loading of MODIStsp fail due to the requirements of loading the GTKcairoDevice even when one is interested in only using the package from the command line entirely without GUI This is true both for an interactive session and when calling the standalone bashRscript version directly from the command line without GUI See below for an example Is this a known issue Or can MODIStsp not be used in command lineonly mode logged into a server due to its dependencies on GTK Is there a workaround other than forwarding X to the local host everything works fine when doing the latter but for various reasons Id prefer not to do that I imagine ideally the GTK libraries should only be loaded if the user requests the GUI and remain unloaded
