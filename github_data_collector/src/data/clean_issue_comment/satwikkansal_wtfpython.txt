the following is untrue printr n n it should be one of the following printr n n printreprr n n py print print output The example python from typing import Optional class S pass class A S Optional S S pass if name main printok TypeError Optional t requires a single type I believe there is a namespace clash between the class variables and the types python var tuple l l zipsortedzipvar printl l l zipsortedzipvar printl printzipsortedzipvar printlistzipsortedzipvar result shell zip object at x C A DAC zip object at x C A DC int int int The above does not round up Alice TypeError cant multiply sequence by nonint of type float The implementation of deep copy was not shown a ba The ids of the two will be the same Now a The ids of the two will still be the same as both a and b are referring to the same location changes made to a are made to b as well Hence a b Now if we do import copy ccopydeepcopya ida will not be equal to idc Python x load module path error Program execute display like this error ImportError No module named xxx also you used like this code from xxx import xxx or from xxx import xxx Example module initpy A initpy apy python def func printAa B initpy bpy python from Aa import func func mainpy python from moduleB import This code will display error when running python bpy I think maybe Python Interpreter not support this grammar And code will display error when running python mainpy if you use syspathsappend or syspathsappend like this code still a mistake Because program when load module abspath is mainpy file not bpy file And C C language is not such Solve Method file return current file path ospathabspathpath return file abspath ospathdirname return folder abspath ospathjoin join path load one level catalog path ospathabspathospathjoinospathdirnamefile load two level catalog path ospathabspathospathjoinospathdirnamefile etc Now that the project has Travis integration I think we can use a static code analysis tool like coala which can help in detecting errors like following upfront Markdown linting errors and the linting errors in the code inside the markdown Invalid or broken links like TOC references etc Grammar checks The commands to perfrom such checks can be added to Travis as well as precommit hooks if the contributor likes and will help in reducing future errors
