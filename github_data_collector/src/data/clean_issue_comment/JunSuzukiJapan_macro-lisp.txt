 How can I produce an expression such as xyzwq It seems to be missing There is almost no documentation Some assumptions The lispcode gets expanded to rust code without runtime overhead All rust functions can be called as lisp functions All rust macros can be called from lisp but without the Other rust special forms like threads and methods get called as in rust and dont have corresponding lispmacros There are some lispmacros which espand to rust special forms defun defvar defconstant Functions defined in lisp can be used in rust code Some other questions are there more lisp macros maybe also defmacro if there is defmacro can these macros be used in rust code can all rust code be written in this lispmacro and how It would be nice if you add my correct assumptions and the answers to my questions to the readme
