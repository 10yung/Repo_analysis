you X I have searched open and closed issues for duplicates X I am submitting a bug report for existing functionality that does not work as intended X I have read X This isnt a feature request or a discussion topic Bug description Signal is prefering contact data from the sim card over the real contacts from the phone Steps to reproduce export contacts to your sim there are multiple sim management tools available that can help with it wait a bit until Signal refreshes its knowledge about contacts whatever time interval that is Now the interesting part here is SIM contacts are very limited in length characters so longer names get truncated And Signal shows truncated names all of a sudden Also when you exported contacts a while ago it may happen you change the name of one of your contacts using the usual android ways With a usual setup thats a local phonebook or a google addressbook Whatever Name is changed Default Android Contact app shows changed name Signal wont Ever It uses the possibly truncated or by now just wrong name from the SMS Android also allows you to select Which contacts to display in contacts app settings slightly different where exactly depending on the app and about all of Android then follows this Say you select Google and Phone Contacts only disabling SMS You wont see the SMS stored ones except in Signal Expected result Describe here what should happen after you run the steps above ie what would be the correct behaviour Follow the same as the rest honor the addressbooks to display Wherever that setting ends up it appears to be central using multiple different dialers they all follow what any of them set Or add an own option that lets one disable some sources for contacts Device info Signal version According to play store from
