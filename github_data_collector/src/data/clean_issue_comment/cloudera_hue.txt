Is the issue already present in or discussed in the forum no What is the Hue version or source eg open source CDH CDP Is there a way to help reproduce it In sparkconfpy here the value for USESASL is set to false by default and is not logically computed based on hiveserver s auth config Above value is referenced here in beeswax This results in broken integration when hiveserver is using kerberos I would like to know if we can default this to the value we get from HIVEUSESASLget Or was there a reasoning around not doing this in first place jdesjean romainr When displaying a Spark Job in the Job

problem when using hue recently that the active requests is running very high and directly let hue cannot use and strangely we do not use it very busy I have search hue document but I have not find the meaning of active requests and why it sometimes running so high anyone know this So currently there isnt anything that contains the result container so it overflows this code limits it to px when not in full screen and px when in full screen so that the scrollbar shows up It also works much better with browser zoom Notes the best way to do this is to have the window sizes calcd in the view model so that I dont need to hard code this If they were there we could just reference them currently the windowresize event is distributed all over the codebase Screen Shot at AM Is the issue already present in or discussed in the forum no What is the Hue version or source eg open source CDH CDP na Is there a way to help reproduce it na Assign the hiveserver address according to the hash value of the username When the connected hiveserver is down it will automatically find other available hiveserver for reconnection
