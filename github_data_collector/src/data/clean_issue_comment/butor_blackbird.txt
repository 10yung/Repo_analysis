you can use the theater dollar instead of USD this to favor a faster balance of the excange Is there a balancing function How can you be sure that the buy sell and sell buy will be the same amount Is it possible that on one exchange I will buy or sell more than on another Then I can get stuck with either money or cash and then I lose money Will the blackbird support the bitmex When I change Demomodetrue and run dockercompose up it does exit with code When looking at the logs it shows this blackbird Blackbird is running pid blackbird composecliverboseproxyproxycallable docker wait aee fa

after fees and everything they are all about even Am I missing something Got Blackbird up and running Only set for exchanges Bitfinex and OKCOIN tough to move all balances out of my other exchanges to
