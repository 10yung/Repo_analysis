Hello everyone It has now been almost a year since we first started discussions about the future of FlaskRESTPlus in During the past months a few of us have been granted maintainers access on github SteadBytes j awry aluna and myself Unfortunately we never had access to the FlaskRESTPlus Pypi project hence we have never been able to release any new version This situation led us to fork the project under a different name so we can move forward The new project name is flaskrestx and it will be handled by the pythonrestx organization We are at the early stages and we still have a lot of setuporganization to do such as CI renaming copyright checking etc Our current milestone is to deliver the equivalent of the v that has been discussed in After that we will start migrate issues and PR that are still relevant and build a roadmap Well let you know here when things are ready Import OrderedDict from collections instead of collectionsabc Fix issue Note that I havent included the change to the CHANGELOG since this issue was created in the current version and there is already a change note about import compatibility with Python I have defined model as below The field samplereceiveddate is required and required valid format as shown below neworder apimodelNewPGxOrder providerid fieldsStringrequiredTrue minlength maxlength patientid fieldsStringrequiredTrue

as required field but not so far as the given format I have mentioned format as dtformatiso If i pass date other than the format still it is not giving the error OrderedDict should be imported from collections instead of collectionsabc For example When trying to import it gives the following error from collectionsabc import OrderedDict Traceback most recent call last File stdin line in module ImportError cannot import name OrderedDict from collectionsabc I have manually tested it on Python versions and The current code is not failing because of the tryexcept For tracking purposes this change was made on PR and is related to issue Can I submit a PR to solve this issue Adding a global error handler using apierrorhandler doesnt seem to have any effect The error handler code is not triggered when an exception happens Code python from flask import Flask from flaskrestplus import Api Resource app Flaskname api Apiapp apierrorhandler def defaulterrorhandlererror return message

itsdangerous Jinja jsonschema MarkupSafe moreitertools pyrsistent pytz six Werkzeug zipp I am trying to use sendfromdirectory with RESTPlus and it looks as thought it is ignoring the path I am giving it in the first argument code greatly simplified down to basics apiroutemissionspathfilename apiparamfilename The file to download class MissionFileResource def getself filename return sendfromdirectorydata filename asattachmentTrue I get the following response message The requested URL was not found on the server If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again You have requested this URI filesmissionsmission json but did you mean filesmissionspathfilename or filesmissions or filesmissionsupload It seems to be using the resource URI and not the path I am explicitly setting I have also tried providing an absolute path as well to no avail Would it be possible to support this other way of file upload I am not sure if this is some standard but I ran into this by using ReactAdmin file upload which support Drag and drop fileupload it sents the Image via JSON instead of normal file upload Code I now handle it with this code in my view python data requestgetjson imagemime imagebase data image src split image base b decodeimagebase The result is that the swagger specs are not in sync regarding how this endpoint should be used I think that with some guidance I can boil up a PR if its possible at all to do this under the OpenAPI specification When using a model that has an attribute of the same type and a circular reference occurs swagger does not render the documentation This was a fix found in a post from edwardfung edwardfung thanks for your post When doing PUT or DELETE requests with int data I randomly times out of get a type error stating that int object is not iterable The only similar issue I could find was submitted on the flaskrestful git repository and it was closed in stating that it has been fixed in their version
