In that other people could be sharing the same public IP address Assume it would Hi I have two questions is pwnat applicable for symmetric NAT how about two symmetric NATs can ICMP Time Exceeded message payload be used to transport data I encountered a enterprise NAT which does the following host A inside the NAT binds a UDP socket to a local address say A sends a packet to another public host B B sees A as A sends a packet to host B using the same socket B now sees A as host C is behind another NAT host A and C both drop packets from unknown origin I would like to build a tunnel between A and C traditional p p hole punching method wont work because when A tries to connect C its using a different public address than B sees I dont think the original pwnat is designed to solve these kind of problems it seems that pwnat focused on removing dependency on host B says that This will work behind many NATs and firewalls but not all does that intended to mean symmetric NAT is not supported in this case the problem lies exactly that C dont know what the public address of A is I intercepted some ICMP Time Exceeded messages for ICMP ping requests the original ping body was included in the Time Exceeded reply can we modify the reply use that part to encode some data will the modified packet be accepted and routed correctly by NATs Im trying to build a prototype that can penetrate symmetric NATs Im new to the field succeeded in getting ICMP Time Exceeded replies by modifying TTL but still learning about how to read ICMP Time Exceeded replies from OS can this method be adapted to run on iOS and work iPhone to iPhone over a carrier network Note pwnat defaults source and destination ports to Most NAT would change source port to another number while by monitoring data out NAT we can watch that So to get the real source port out NAT we need a third server to monitor that maybe like N N does Hi I have a web server accessed with port behind NAT and there is no way to port forwarding since the ISP itself block the port So I hope this will help to to solve the problem I started pwnat s on the webserver machine Then on a client want to connect to the server I run pwnat c is the public ip address of the web server Then I open browser and navigate to localhost But it failed with error Bind failed What does it mean Thank you so much As usual great work I am facing an issue when trying to run pwnat When trying this command sudo pwnat c adobecom and trying to access the local port in the browser browser shows connection reset And pwnat outputs as below Client disconnected Client disconnected Client disconnected Thanks in advance Hello I have started a server with this command pwnat s accessible with port Client A with pwnat c is the public ip of the server Another client B with pwnat c I have tried also in client B pwnat c where is the public IP of client A Client B want to telnet client A telnet but it is not working Any help please Using gcc on
