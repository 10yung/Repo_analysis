I use requireJS JQ and JQ Mobile alpha my code like this javascript requireconfig paths jquery jquery jquerymobile jquerymobile alphamin jquerymobileconfig jquerymobileconfig shim jquerymobileconfig jquery jquerymobile jquery jquerymobileconfig require jquery jquerymobile function bodybindkeyup functione if ewhich logintap loginbindtap onLoginTap I didnt know why throw err tap is not a function Example code documentonswipeleft functione consolelogSwipe left detected documentonswiperight functione consolelogSwipe right detected And the viewport metatag in the html meta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth initialscale Steps to reproduce On a real mobile device pinchzoom ignore issue if it happens at this stage Use one finger to drag and move the visual viewport around left and right Make sure that the zoom is high enough ie the layout viewport is much bigger than the visual viewport and that you test all three scenarios a Make one single dragging motion eg to the left such that during the whole motion from beginning to end you are dragging the visual viewport b Make one single dragging motion such that when you start you are dragging the viewport then while you are moving the visual viewport reaches the limit that it cant move past eg if you are dragging left the right border of the visual viewport comes to touch the right border of the layout viewport and any further movement of your finger cant move the viewport further so it stops but you keep dragging so the second half of your dragging motion has no effect c After that when the layout viewport is moved all the way to the left or in other words the visual viewport is all the way to the right do one other whole drag motion with the finger towards the left as if to attempt to move the layout further which you cant do so the whole of your movement is actually a swipe that doesnt move anything Expected a should NEVER trigger a swipe event b should NEVER trigger a swipe event c should trigger a swipe event Observed b systematically trigger a swipe event at least when you get past the point where you cant keep dragging the viewport but your dragging motion continues Thats understandable meaning an understandable mistake yet a mistake a sometimes triggers a swipe event Id say most of the time it doesnt It seems utterly random Thats complete nonsense c triggers a swipe event thats as expected Overall the swipe events are pathetically unreliable and effectively unusable Example code documentonswipeleft functione consolelogSwipe left detected documentonswiperight functione consolelogSwipe right detected And the viewport metatag in the html meta nameviewport contentwidthdevicewidth initialscale Steps to reproduce On a real mobile device pinchzoom Expected shouldnt ever trigger a swipe left or right event because you are using TWO fingers That makes it obvious that it is not a swipe gesture Observed sometimes randomly triggers a swipe event while you are pinchzooming Im under the impression that youre just testing for a touch event doing a drag motion of a length andor speed above a certain threshold regardless of whether there are other touch points at the same time Instead you should add the condition that the finger touching and dragging is the only finger present Steps to reproduce Go to The first thing it says is we RECOMMEND using our Download Builder links to it so Follow the link to Expected Should be able to use the fucking download builder Observed The spinning icon keeps spinning forever and theres nothing you can build or download I think
