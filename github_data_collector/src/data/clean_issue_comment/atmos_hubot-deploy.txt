Ive moved away from using this in my projects and Im redirecting people over to something new This is a prerelease version that I can use to deprecate behavior for our usage at heroku I dont know where thatll leave this project going forward As per GitHubs blog and documentation there are now new options for deployments transient production autoinactive This PR implements support for those options Note that although the samples in configfilemd dont show entries such as herokutestname those are still carried over in the payload They would now better fit in the providerenvname entry slackcoffee and hipchatcoffee are unused and burried in the docs folder They could be useful just as they are With this new HUBOTDEPLOYADAPTER env var it is easier to leverage them
