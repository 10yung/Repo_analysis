First off I want to say that finding this project was very exciting and is functionality that Ive been itching for Itd be nice if we could provide this inside notebooks themselves Heres what Im envisioning python mynotebookipynb cell defaults MODEL asdsadfasfd DATASET asdfasdfcsv cell nbrun sometest MODEL adfasdfasf cell nbrun sometest MODEL qwerqwerer DATASET qwerwqercsv rest of notebook Then to run nbrun mynotebookipynb results Writing to resultssometest pdf Writing to resultssometest pdf So the nbrun script would branch off for each nbrun id it encounters and write that to its own file Only cells that match the current nbrun branch id would be run This would actually remove the limitations because it wouldnt require objects to have a literal representation One thing that would require thought is if we would need to enforce these cells to exist only at the top of the file And if not if we allow branching in the middle or at the end how would we deal with cloning objects for each branch Hey thank you very much for nbrun Everything works fine except when I use hineinputTrue it doesnt have any effect and I get a notebook or html file with visible input cells Thanks again Stephan
