dietpi update but not sure i have zerotier installed and i tried to acess other lan devices through raspberry pi on my local network when im outside in tutorial it is written that i need to add this to etcnetworkinterfaces auto eth iface eth inet manual auto br iface br inet manual bridgeports eth zt bridgefd bridgemaxage after that i restarted and after few hours i was unable to do what i wanted so i deleted those lines in etcnetworkinterfaces and now i notice that restart is much slower then before what can be issue Edit about second question i uninstalled zerotier and now rpi reboot fine
