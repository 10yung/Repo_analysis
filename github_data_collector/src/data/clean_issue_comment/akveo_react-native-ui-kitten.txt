Proposal When the last item in the list or anyone below the cutoff is selected and then the select list displayed again itd be really useful for the selected item to be scrolled into view Motivation User request Example Added support for manually specifying the date format on thhe Please read and mark the following check list before creating a pull request X I read and followed the CONTRIBUTINGmd guide X I read and followed the New Feature Checklist guide Short description of what this resolves Previously date formats were hardcoded into the DDMMYYYY format which is a huge PITA if youre an american who uses backwards ass date formats You can now specify what format you would like your date to display in by passing the dateFormat property into the component as follows Datepicker datethisstatedate onSelectdate thisselectDatedate dateFormatMMDDYYYY Ive built the project and ran it myself to confirm it works Closes Love UI Kitten Please leave feedback Feature Proposal Currently only DDMMYYYY format is supported to be displayed on the datepicker component with no way to override this or set a custom localization string Motivation This is just super inconvenient for anyone living in America Please add support for specifying any datestring Example Add a property to the datePicker components of localizationString Please read and mark the following check list before creating a pull request x I read and followed the CONTRIBUTINGmd guide x I read and followed the New Feature Checklist guide Short description of what this resolves Whenever using a Button and a Text component with ReactJS v even though elements are rendered and they work as expected an error message is displayed with the text Warning Invalid value for prop dispatch on div tag Either remove it from the element or pass a string or number value to keep it in the DOM For details see Is it possible to disable or change the animation of tabview Please add an option to add additional props to the Text component of TopNavigation used for title description Our current use case is that we need to truncate the text there and show ellipsis chars after This could be achived by setting the numberOfLines prop on the Text numberOfLines Some long texText component Ref
