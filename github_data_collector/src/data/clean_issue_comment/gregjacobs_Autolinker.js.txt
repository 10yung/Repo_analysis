gulpheader version produces a dependency on eventstream package that has some known vulnerabilities Even this is a devDepedency it will be nice to remove this dependency and the warnings in audit tools Newer versions of gulpheader solves this issue customq will link custom will not link Granted this is a niche case but its not uncommon to see these types of URLs in intranets or other nonpublic tooling I think this is because urlMatchDoesNotHaveAtLeastOneWordChar uses hasWordCharAfterProtocolRegex which matches letters but not numbers I believe this check should be loosened to allow numbers if the protocol includes For example custom should link while custom should not This is related to in that its an issue with getDomainNameStr in regexlibts Subdomain names are treated pretty lax out in the wild Its common to see subdomains with underscores but autolinker wont identify these links For example will identify fooexamplecom as the link And will identify two links and barexamplecom gregjacobs Do you have any general hints on how to target subdomains separately from the normal domain name in getDomainNameStr I can make the changes and write tests but Im having some trouble

repo from the Security Alerts page details text But it works well in this github message Since you asked for it in the breaking changes section Please support different prefixes and notations Germany zeroprefixed with hyphen France zeroprefixed with spaces Poland xx xxx xx xx any zwodigit number as prefix and spaces There are probably many many more notations and prefix systems Basically to support them all I see two possibilities Introduce an flexible API for matchers I saw a kind of announcement for that in the release notes breaking changes section Write a separate matcher for every possible notation and prefix system and provide finegrained control which ones get activated or not The actual matchers could actually be contributed by others if there is a good API see Anyways thanks for this awesome utility library When a link includes usernamepassword inside the URL see userinfo in the automatic linking is wrong For example given the following URL Expected behavior The link is marked as link as it is Link to Actual behavior There are two links one http link and one mailto link and some unlinked text Link Unlinked text Link mailtobarexamplecom Unlinked text foobar Apparently the autolinker doesnt match any phone numbers listed like this or or I have tested the following scenarios None of these work is the only one that seems to work by the way in front of is wrong so is without In the netherlands its either or with numbers behind it I just wanted to test these in case it did pick it up incorrectly Notation can differ some people tend to write while others would write it as while others write I would like to see support for these types of dutch phonenumbers Take a look here for a regular expression that could possibly do the job For now my current solution in my usecase is creating a regular expression in my backend to alter the format to work with Ive already tried adding this functionality myself for this module but I couldnt find a way of altering the recognition of the phone number The replacefn is only meant to change the output not necessarily the recognition function Perhaps its a good idea to allow people to put in custom recognition function replacements as well in case their usecase varies Or the recognition function should work for every type of phone number email address url etc around the globe This could just be scratching the surface for specific countries Hello Thanks for this great library its very useful I wanted to add my own custom matcher to the matchers list I tried this code and it works great let autolinker new Autolinker let tagBuilder anyautolinkergetTagBuilder anyautolinkergetMatcherspushnew CustomMatcher tagBuilder So could you make the getTagBuilder and getMatchers methods public With these two public methods it will be easy to add a custom matcher Or is there another easy way to add a custom matcher Cordially Stephane Expected Behaviour IG usernames which have dots in a row should
