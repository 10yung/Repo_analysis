 I plan to provide a PR that will cover the following functionality If you use the commandlet InvokeD AzureStorageUpload to upload a file to Azure storage which is not yet present in Azure storage the Content type property of the file will always be set to applicationoctetstream If you compare that with what Azure Storage Explorer does when uploading the same file you will see that Azure Storage Explorer will in many cases figure out the correct content type for uploaded files and set the property accordingly Some examples jpg jpeg files should result in content type imagejpeg png files should result in content type imagepng pdf files should result in content type applicationpdf docx files should result in content type applicationvndopenxmlformatsofficedocumentwordprocessingmldocument etc A list of valid media types can be found here As a minimum a parameter should be added to the current commandlet to allow to pass a specific content type to the function which then should be used as the content type property when uploading to Azure storage If no value for the new parameter is provided it would be nice if function tried to figure out the content type based on the file extension NET framework methods can be leveraged to accomplish that Hi good d fotools people The module requirement AzureStorage is the one line that keeps giving me a headache in this otherwise awesome Powershell module AzureStorage itself has been superseded by AzStorage from my understanding I was hoping that in the required modules section the line ModuleName AzureStorage ModuleVersion could be replaced with this line ModuleName AzStorage ModuleVersion without things to break ideally The problem were facing is that AzureStorage itself relies on AzureRmProfile So whenever the module d fotools is loaded AzureRmProfile will get loaded as well This will then make it impossible in the same Powershell session to load AzProfile which is the sucessor of AzureRmProfile As our own Powershell tools have been migrated from AzureRM module to the Az module were being in constant conflict with the d fotools module requirements I would appreciate if you could have a look at this issue and consider if the module requirement could either be swapped out or removed so that people like us could choose to use AzStorageAzProfile instead of AzureStorageAzureRmProfile modules Thanks a lot New enhancement I had faced a minor issue when Batch service doesnt start after StartD Environment All And the issue was that Batch service was Disabled Could you add new column StartType to the following commands GetD Environment StartD Environment StopD Environment Hint Instead of the following GetService ComputerName server Name Services ErrorAction SilentlyContinue SelectObject Name Server Expression Server Name Status DisplayName Should be something like this GetService ComputerName server Name Services ErrorAction SilentlyContinue SelectObject Name Server Expression Server Name Status StartType DisplayName Ie the new parameter StartType Hi I am trying to create a bacpac using NewD Backpac NewD Bacpac ExportModeTier xxxx SqlUser xxxxx BacpacFile D DBbackup update devdbbacpac DatabaseName xxxxxxaxdb b fc xxxxxx DatabaseServer xxxxxxdatabasewindowsnet EnableException NewDatabaseName update devdb ShowOriginalProgress Verbose I am ending up with this message all the time InvokeClearAzureSpecificObjects Something went wrong while clearing the Azure specific objects in the database Exception calling ExecuteNonQuery with arguments The database principal owns a schema in the database and cannot be dropped WARNING InvokeClearAzureSpecificObjects Stopping because of errors Something went wrong while clearing the Azure specific objects in the database We are testing with version D fotools D FO is Version A and P Update Best regards Kai This is not a mistake and I dont know if its the best place for this kind of suggestion I am using D FOTools for many things This library is amazing but you would like to make a suggestion Could you create a PowerShell to configure Development Environment to debug UAT environments like this Microsoft documentation Thanks for this channel
