Hi Hable tone mapping operator produces darker output when used correctly to tonemap to nits comparable with the tm curve at nits A dirty trick would be multiply by the exposure bias For example for hdr nits the values in range have to be multiplied by and the W parameter has to be set to I noticed an oversight when using ytdlhook if the path is a URL we try to stat it which obviously doesnt work To mitigate that dont check or update mtimes for URLs This will ensure that we dont discard watchlater information if playback cannot resume due to the file not existing yet or network issues Fixes

Desired feature I want a function that copies a string containing unicode text to the clipboard including newlines This can of course be used to implement in a script much more gracefully than the solution the responses to it came up with but Im not asking for whats described in just a function for scripts to use I last looked for a function like this several months ago If one was silently added in the meantime without an issue being created for it then this feature request doesnt really mean anything I guess Motivation I wrote a script that automatically copies subtitles to the clipboard so that they can be access more easily by clipboard grabbers Copying text to the clipboard automatically not after a hotkey press is an accessibility design pattern thats started appearing in games having options to copy onscreen text to the clipboard so that screen readers can verbalize it This idea is not limited to disability accessibility though its also used when consuming media that uses very difficult vocabulary or is in foreign languages Having access to plain text on the clipboard makes looking up words that you dont know extremely easy to the point where its becoming increasingly common for people who start learning Japanese to set up clipboard reading systems and mouseover dictionaries when playing games in Japanese just so that they never have to worry about manually looking up kanji In turn thats the motivation for my script I dont personally need it but some of my friends did and they found it helpful It has a few problems though It only works on Windows entirely different scripts are needed on different platforms Its laggy because it involves invoking a new process and AV software including windows defender can block it for several seconds Its locale sensitive because it involves invoking a shell Its incredibly hacky because safely invoking processes through the shell containing arbitrary strings for arguments is hard on windows The third point is the biggest problem The script doesnt just work and its not possible for it to just work It needs to be edited if the user is using certain locales for nonunicode programs and using strange locales is very common among people who are learning Japanese It would be much much simpler more stable and more reliable if there were just a function for copying text to the clipboard made available to scripts Hello please supports abloopNinfno So I have a Samsung LC HG monitor that apparently supports up to cdm In Windows I want to be able to watch HDR content at optimized settings I have searched with mpv hdr multiple results including github issues came up from few years back And the more I read the more I got confused I tried applying each different setting they were all okay in a different fashion so I was not sure if I was doing it right I have noticed if I enable Windows HDR mode and maximize my monitors brightness and finally set targetpeak to HDR seems to be okay But then everything on video overlay gets grayed out So it obviously seems like a hack instead of a proper fix I have a icc profile that was generated in SDR mode and some people suggest enabling it in mpv config some people suggest playing with hdrpeak and targetx options etc Its just confusing And manual only lists each option as a reference it doesnt tell you what to do Can you write what one needs to do watch HDR content from scratch with stepbystep instructions along with assumptions eg Your monitors brightness must be set at mpv should be fullscreen Windows HDR should be enabled and calibrated to this etc you make for those instructions How you do it and test it out in your environment Important Information Provide following Information mpv version Linux Distribution and Version
