The following code causes a SA csharp End The analyzer then suggests removing the unnecessary parenthesis img width altrangeBug src Which then breaks the code img width altrangeBug src Is there already a support for not having to use rulesets xml or json configuration files and use modern editorconfig where all rules from multiple analyzers including vs ide settings can be stored If not is it in the plan In a C switch expression SA Use stringEmpty for empty strings fires inappropriately if an empty string constant is used For example var reaction thisLootType switch Bard Friendly stringEmpty Left side triggers SA null stringEmpty Justice Neutral StyleCop version Visual Studio version Projects NET Framework version StyleCop is reporting syntax error when there is a fully qualified type names used in a tuple declaration Aliased namespaces dont work as well This is global issue ie it is reproducible when tuple with fully qualified type name appears as a variable method argument or method return type Code snippet to reproduce an issue C using System using MySystemAlias System namespace StyleCopTupleIssueRepro public class Foo public String int Case SystemString a int b Hello throw new NotImplementedException public MySystemAliasString int Case SystemString int args throw new NotImplementedException The workaround is to create an alias for type C using System using MySystemStringAlias SystemString namespace StyleCopTupleIssueRepro public class Foo public MySystemStringAlias int Case throw new NotImplementedException private string SizeClass Size switch SizeSmall btnsm SizeNormal SizeLarge btnlg We use StyleCopConsole to analyze our sourc code Style Cop analysis takes ms while of them is spent in method StyleCopSpellingNamingServiceAddDictionaryFolderString The trace is as follows Start ms StyleCopStyleCopConsoleStartIList Boolean FullAnalyze ms StyleCopStyleCopCoreFullAnalyzeIList Analyze ms StyleCopStyleCopCoreAnalyzeIList Boolean String RunWorkerThreads ms StyleCopStyleCopCoreRunWorkerThreadsData Int DoWork ms StyleCopStyleCopThreadDoWorkObject ParseAndAnalyzeDocument ms StyleCopStyleCopThreadParseAndAnalyzeDocumentSourceCode DocumentAnalysisStatus TestAndRunAnalyzers ms StyleCopStyleCopThreadTestAndRunAnalyzersCodeDocument SourceParser IEnumerable Int RunAnalyzers ms StyleCopStyleCopThreadRunAnalyzersCodeDocument SourceParser IEnumerable AnalyzeDocument ms StyleCopCSharpDocumentationRulesAnalyzeDocumentCodeDocument AddDictionaryFolder ms StyleCopSpellingNamingServiceAddDictionaryFolderString In our case we dont need to search for dictionaries when analyzing each document weve got only one dictionary that is used in the whole solution So the opportunity to disable searching of custom dictionaries for each file will be great If you rely on the implicit values when removing a value from the middle the code will start behaving differently because the meanings have changed For example if we have an Enum for storing Virtual Machine states Not Ready Dirty Ready Leased Completed and we remove the Dirty value all VMs that were Ready are now Leased and all the ones that are Leased are now in Completed state is possible write in setting file a whitelist of the file for stylecop analysis now im working on a very old project and is impossible apply the analysis rule to all the project I want to apply it just on the new file internal static ref bool Methodin this char value this line causes SA error Is it planned to also produce an extension that can work in VS Code One that results in a similar formatting as in VS Thanks eric
