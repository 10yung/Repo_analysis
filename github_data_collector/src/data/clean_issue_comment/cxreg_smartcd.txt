Place the following in your bashrc alias helloecho hello world Then setup an enter script for any directory containing the following autostash alias helloecho hello gophers Then cd into that directory you will see the following error cd homemyitcvblah smartcd running homemyitcvsmartcdscriptshomemyitcvblahbashenter Command world not found did you mean command world from snap world See snap info snapname for additional versions I suspect this is not something that can feasibly be fixed however I figured Id better report it anyway After installing smartcd in my Windows Subsystem for Linux the Ubuntu LTS flavor changing directories even ones without enter scripts began taking multiple seconds to complete Before installing smartcd and after uninstalling smartcd changing directories takes somewhere between a tenth of a second and half a second I believe it is a known shortcoming with WSL that filesystem actions can take significantly longer than what youd expect if for no other reason than NTFS is frequently not optimized for the same kinds of activities that Linux filesystems are However I suspect in this case the problem is more due to inefficiencies in WSLs bash possibly in the implementation of functions than any filesystemhardware shenanigans For now Ive uninstalled the tool rather than look into it further If you want me to help debug Im willing but if youre inclined to will not fix this Id understand that as well Hi I like to organize all my dotfiles outside of my home directory and split up application data from user configuration The XDG directories help do that scripts would probably be under XDGCONFIGHOME while the other application stuff would be under XDGDATAHOME and any caches would be under XDGCACHEHOME It would also be good to allow a user to set a simple environment variable to move the entire directory somewhere else thats a simpler thing than splitting stuff up Something like SMARTCDHOME In this case I used this to get my configuration scripts into my dotfiles rm rf smartcdscripts ln s dotfilesconfigsmartcdscripts smartcdscripts I would prefer to set an environment variable to avoid doing that Would you be open to a PR Not sure if
