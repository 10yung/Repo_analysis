I made this reference in the cmakelistes But an error occurred in CMAKE as shown below Boost version CMake Error at CMakeListstxt findpackage By not providing FindGlogcmake in CMAKEMODULEPATH this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by Glog but CMake did not find one Could not find a package configuration file provided by Glog with any of the following names GlogConfigcmake glogconfigcmake Add the installation prefix of Glog to CMAKEPREFIXPATH or set GlogDIR to a directory containing one of the above files If Glog provides a separate development package or SDK be sure it has been installed But Im sure glog has installed My English is not very good but I really need your help Glog is available as a port in vcpkg a C library manager that simplifies installation for glog and other project dependencies Documenting the install process here will help users get started by providing a single set of commands to build glog ready to be included in their projects We also test whether our library ports build in various configurations dynamic static on various platforms OSX Linux Windows x x UWP ARM to keep a wide coverage for users Im a maintainer for vcpkg and here is what the port script looks like We try to keep the library maintained as close as possible to the original library Hello There seems to be an edge case that occurs when the year switches while we are in the midst of writing glogs For instance if we are writing glogs at pm on and the year switches to the mmdd timestamp written on each line of the glog will not capture this year difference Therefore it looks like the glogs jump from to if we are only extrapolating the year from the file name or the file creation date written at the top of each glog file I think some possible solutions include Appending the year to each glog line in the format of IWEF yyyymmdd hhmmssuuuuuu threadid fileline msg Splitting the glog file when the year changes Was there a reason for not including the year in the linebyline output format We should give users of the library some guidance on the difference of the log levels especially between WARNING and ERROR Incompatible flag incompatiblenoimplicitfileexport will be enabled by default in a future Bazel release thus breaking Google Logging The flag is documented here Please check the following CI builds for build and test

you dont want to receive any future issues for Google Logging or if you have any questions please file an issue in Important Please do NOT modify the issue title since that might break our tools The
