Seems like a great AI framework for iOS I wish to use your framework on macOS My podfile looks something like this swiftversion platform osx pod MetalBender git commit ea d ab b cf fbfc e Doing install says that MetalBender is not available for macOS PROMPT pod install Analyzing dependencies Predownloading MetalBender from commit ea d ab b cf fbfc e The platform of the target FreeHongKong macOS is not compatible with MetalBender which does not support macOS Best of luck Thank you for open sourcing your project styleNet Networkdevice device inputSize inputSize parameterLoader loader styleNetstart Convolutionsize ConvSizeoutputChannels kernelSize stride id conv Convolutionsize ConvSizeoutputChannels kernelSize stride id conv Convolutionsize ConvSizeoutputChannels kernelSize stride id conv Residualsize ConvSizeoutputChannels kernelSize stride id resblock Residualsize ConvSizeoutputChannels kernelSize stride id resblock Residualsize ConvSizeoutputChannels kernelSize stride id resblock Residualsize ConvSizeoutputChannels kernelSize stride id resblock ConvTransposesize ConvSizeoutputChannles kernelSize stride id convt ConvTransposesize ConvSizeoutputChannles kernelSize stride id convt Convolutionsize ConvSizeoutputChannels kernelSize stride neuron tanh id convFinal I want to do two pool layers for the add operation How to get the weight of each layer of neural network Modelrun the self network Run is going to be returned to tensor I need to take care of it dont return the label Im not sure why it shows all the commits the real changes start with trimmed whitespace including that one Cloning the repo with checkout on tag Example has seven errors after pod installation Seems to be removed at compile but all three frameworks installed by cocoapods are not found at compil time PBXCp UsersthibautnoahLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataExamplefheatxxixelckdgltxeulpnuyhruBuildProductsDebugiphoneosMetalBenderframework UsersthibautnoahLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataExamplefheatxxixelckdgltxeulpnuyhruBuildProductsDebugiphoneosExampleappFrameworksMetalBenderframework cd UsersthibautnoahtestingBenderExample export PATHApplicationsXcodeappContentsDeveloperPlatformsiPhoneOSplatformDeveloperusrbinApplicationsXcodeappContentsDeveloperusrbinusrlocalbinusrbinbinusrsbinsbin builtincopy exclude DSStore exclude CVS exclude svn exclude git exclude hg exclude Headers exclude PrivateHeaders exclude Modules exclude tbd bitcodestrip replacewithmarker bitcodestriptool ApplicationsXcodeappContentsDeveloperToolchainsXcodeDefaultxctoolchainusrbinbitcodestrip resolvesrcsymlinks UsersthibautnoahLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataExamplefheatxxixelckdgltxeulpnuyhruBuildProductsDebugiphoneosMetalBenderframework UsersthibautnoahLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataExamplefheatxxixelckdgltxeulpnuyhruBuildProductsDebugiphoneosExampleappFrameworks error UsersthibautnoahLibraryDeveloperXcodeDerivedDataExamplefheatxxixelckdgltxeulpnuyhruBuildProductsDebugiphoneosMetalBenderframework No such file or directory Is there a batch inference API available In our use case we need to perform inference on several up to cropped parts of an image A batch inference API would make this operation efficient Thanks I had met a problem using blender for load some models data from training frameworklike pytorch I need to convert them from float into float half in Metal kernel for processing but I found it is very slow so is any way to speed up for this I get the following error when converting the graph containing a concat node with axis intvalue greater than fatal error Cannot create ConcatV Missing or invalid attribute axis file omitedPodsMetalBenderSourcesAdaptersTensorflowTFConverterMappersswift line And the node in question from the pbtxt node name fire concatconcataxis op Const attr key dtype value type DTINT attr key value value tensor dtype DTINT tensorshape intval And if I follow correctly the code it executes the LayerConverterMappersswift calls the LayerSizefromTf with the value which in return is as follow swift static func fromTFindex Int LayerSizeAxis switch index case return w case return h case return f default return nil This evaluates as nil and throws an error Is there an error with the graph Im trying to convert or is a bug in the Bender that it does not support concat indexes beyond axis on a concat layer Environment Xcode iOS SDK version Hello I need upsample layer to implement Unet for segmentation Is there one Will it be implemented Only when the image aspect ratio is not the expected The scaledH scaledW seem to be calculated wrong Ive seen some race conditions between the resize encode and the crop encode Maybe something related to the MPSTemporaryImage The image after the start node looks noisy
