Dear Alboukadel Kassambara Thanks for your awesome package to visualize results of cluster analysis I have suggestion for enhancement for the fvizdend method At the moment you can only label the records and color them by cluster It would be nice if one could change the shape and other aspects of the leafs in de dendritic tree according to other factors For instance coloring by cluster and shape by a second feature Kind regards Hanne Hi I would like to know how would it be possible to use a distance matrix as the only input for the different functions of factoextra package such as fviznbclust fvizsilhouette etc Indeed considering my data I can not have a classical matrix with samples and descriptors Thanks a lot for your answer Best regards Simon Hi I used the function fvizpcabiplot and was wondering if it is possible to change the color of my variable names to be different from the arrows For example I would like have my arrows to be orange but the names in black Is it feasable Thank you very much Im reporting different representations for my clustering colored dendrogram PCA scatterplot and silhouette thanks to fvizcluster fvizdend and fvizsilhouette respectively Im facing the following issue the clusters arent colored with the same colors across the plots More specifically it seems that the both the PCA and the silhouette plots follow the same colorcluster mapping but not the dendrogram Ive been digging in the source code a bit appears that the dendrogram plot is produced by dendextend while the others by ggplot I guess the difference of mapping originates from there I perform my cut using the hcut function the same hcut object is then passed to the three visualization functions Here is an example screenshot of my output As you can see the smaller cluster is colored red in the dendrogram and blue in the silhouette and scatterplot Factoextra is fantastic Im trying to draw insight from the meanpoint calculation feature when using a grouping variable with fvizpcaind I want to be able to extract the dim and dim values of the mean point that is calculated for each group shown in the plot below And from there Id like to work backwards to see what the average values would then be for my original variables Essentially based on the mock data Ive provided below I want to get a snapshot of the average university for group and for group as calculated below but express it in my original variables Any assistance in doing so would be greatly appreciated Create some mock data r set up uni data unidata tibbleinstitution cUni A

Please advice to me Please add the possibility to make variable name labels aligned at the tips of the arrows and rotated according to the angle of the arrows in fvizvar and fvizbiplot type functions eg in fvizpcavar Here are several examples of how the result should look like example supsource example supsource I was trying to figure out why these two functions from the factoextra package run with seemingly similar parameters eg kmeans gapstat kmaxandB were yielding different results I initially posed this question on Stack Overflow however the response seems to suggest a bugissue
