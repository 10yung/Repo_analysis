With on the base models the lifecycle callbacks use the parent keyword However there isnt a parent class Cannot use parent when current class scope has no parent Im unsure if Propel is doing anything fancy thatd allow this code to actually execute properly Why is this written the way it is Can it be safely removed Is it possible to refactor this without being a huge rewrite After a recent composer update my Propel validation behaviors began failing Error message given include In Inlinephp line Colons must be followed by a space or an indication character ie at line near column perfirstname validator Length options min max In Inlinephp line Colons must be followed by a space or an indication character ie at line near column linkname validator Length opt ions min max It looks like symfonyyaml updated since its not specified in Propel s composerjson file from to which introduced a breaking change to Propel s reliance on it for the validate behavior I resolved it by specifying symfonyyaml in my projects composerjson Using aliases in joins results in an additional CROSS JOIN being added to the query I see that this was originally raised in back in and marked as a bug but was closed by the OP shortly after before any fix was released Maybe the premature closing of that issue is the reason this bug fix never got to the development stage Doesnt look like theres much movement with Propel updates these days but I still wanted to bring this issue back for the record Propel has the ability to create config values from environment variables During development its much easier to load these variables from the env file Refs package should be bumped to in composer and docs as well no point maintaining anymore here Lots of fails though still in Travis that require fixing There seem to now surface more severe issues as well Class Symfony Component Translation IdentityTranslator not found We have found several issues in our pretrial of PHP in Travis Currently the test matrix here fails and does not yet include this new version Maybe we can share and create a required patch here to make it compatible with the new soon to be released PHP minor dec Hello I just add in the list the config component which is referenced in composerjson Is this good for you Cheers Code sniffer is not happy about the additional unneeded newline in the docblocks This solves it Similar to I used the easy mode to init the schema and model from an existing postgresql database which all worked fine barring invalid PHP names being generated thats another issue However since the schema generation did not add identifierQuotingtrue to the database node each query dies with a SQLSTATE Undefined column error Manually adding the setting and rebuilding the model seems to work fine but why is it missing in the first place Or rather if the default is intended to be enabled why is it not working I think there is a bug in the file srcPropelGeneratorBuilderOmObjectBuilderphp line if reloadOnInsert reloadOnUpdate script if reloadObject thisreload con reload function has a connection as second parameter first is deep and in this case inside reload connection will be null
