have the above error message I installed Directus from the Git installation guide here I tried to upgrade from to the latest and I keep getting merge conflicts and the upgrade fails I thought that the Directus upgrade process was setup so I could just git pull to upgrade or atleast that was my assumption I havent personally modified any of these files and so not sure if I can discard changes and pull or if it will damage my data if I do so How should I proceed Heres a dump of the terminal output when I run the git command directus git pull origin Updating bcc b c e error Your local changes to

tryed yesterday for first time to install directus The first thing is that the documentation is not working well Some menu entries dont load Then i find over google I tryed first the manual web installer But it shows Failed to load resource the server responded with a status of TypeError Cannot read property server of undefined so in did the manuall config thing I copy all from examplephp to testphp and edited name username and password When o try to open now i get redirected to adminlogin so far so good but here i see a error Request failed with status code And in the Console i see VM

superadmintoken What i did wrong I get logged out from the app after some minutes although my auto sign out value is set to Im not even signed out correctly so that I get redirected to the login screen I stay in the app but nothing works anymore which is quite bad if you work on a record for some minutes get signed out in the meanwhile hit save and it fails because you got logged out If i then try to login again i get the message could not reach API although the API is still working After some minutes I am able to login again Could you also tell me which unit the auto sign out value has Really minutes Is it possible to get never signed out Or if I get signed out after a longer time that I get redirected to the login screen Technical Details Web Server Apache PHP Version MySQL

selecting an element whose primary key contains characters Directus App displays the Sign In page and the error Unauthorized Request Steps to Reproduce Create a Collection test with just the primary key as a field named ID by default Update the ID field select String as Field TypeVARCHAR as MySQL Datatype and switch off the Hidden on Detail option Add an item to the test collection with the value of ID field set to ab Save the newly created item In the test collection page click on the newly created item Expected Behavior The item with ID set to ab is shown Actual Behavior The Sign in page is displayed and the error Unauthorized request appears below Something is wrong with this project see screenshot Other Context Screenshots Screenshot error I think the issue is related to how links for items are generated In many sections of the Directus App source I see code similar to this thiscurrentProjectKeycollectionsthiscollectionpk A character in a primary key is directly injected in the URL thus tricking the router which will consider the generated URL as a bad route I tried to replicate the issue in A when clicking on the ab item I received the error Item not found and on the top of the screen the breadcrumb was Collections Test A B confirming that the URL was not interpreted correctly Any other relevant information screenshots or schema files to help explain your problem Technical Details Device Desktop OS Windows Web Server Apache PHP Version Database MySQL Directus Release Version v rc Install Method cloned master branch Directus Files is a little special Its the only collection that will receive multipartformdata its the only collection that has a field where the input is different from the output data and its the only collection right now where we actively need a separate field to present the data preview The current flow in the application of creating a new file is as follows User clicks A modal comes up with a drop zone User drops file File gets uploaded with the multipartformdata enctype in a field called data The user gets send to the item detail page for files The preview interface reads the value thats returned by the API in data and renders the file preview The user can edit the other data of a file This is all a bit cumbersome The main issue here is the fact that the data has a totally different input multipartformdata binary string for the file than the output JSON object representing the file data Ideally the user can hit and get send to the regular create item page eg files where the file can be dropped and all the other meta fields can be entered Only when the user hits save everything gets saved up to the API This will allow files to operate like any other collection in places like modals for relationships too The main issue here still is that only the directusfiles collection should POST in the alternate enctype formdata vs JSON I think the application has most things in place in order to make this happen I do have a couple of questions for directusapiteam though Does the API support POSTing in multipartformdata for multiple fields at the same time eg data filename description etc Can we add a file field type for data that supports and validates INPUT as a string file content and OUTPUTs as JSON like we have right now Once those two things are confirmed I believe we should be able to create a custom interface that will render a file dropzone when theres no value and the file preview when there is a value This will also allow us to get rid of the ALIAS preview field that currently kinda hacky reads from the data key on the same page Do not delete this template or the issue will be closed Ensure youre using the latest version of Directus Post to the correct repo App API YOU ARE HERE Docs Feature Request We have a table where records must be linked to other records from the same table Currently weve added a M M relationship for that Problem is that direction matters so the results differ from where you place the link If you have a record A and you link it to record B and you do this action on the detailpage for A it will show up in the detail from A in the linked list it will not be visibible in the linked list from detail B In our case the desired behavior is that it would be visible on both details A en B only be making this reference once Is there any way of achieving this in directus A selfreferential relation should be perfect What problem does this feature solve You could reference records from the same table without the direction matters How do you think this should be implemented A new kind of relation Would you be willing to work on this Could try to if it would make it to the official release
