Instead of instantiating its dependencies in each class we are going to switch to dependency injection We will declare the dependencies using typehinted constructor arguments and pass already instantiated dependency objects to the constructor This will loosen the coupling between classes and allow us to pass mock objects for testing Rather than creating and passing instances of dependencies manually we will let Dice dependency injection container library instantiate them for us We are setting CONTAINER value in fatfree s Hive to a function wrapping around Dicecreate method Dice does not support PSR which will make fatfree ask Dice to instantiate controllers Dice will recursively instantiate all of the controller s dependencies and then instantiate the controller itself At the moment only a small fraction of selfoss was converted but more is coming soon Added the docker support original credit goes to squatica I updated it to work with the selfoss repo regardless of the local changes and also tweaked some things Dockerfile for Selfoss RSS aggregator is bundled with the repository Selfoss config is mounted in a separate volume so your custom settings should survive reboot To run the latest stable tag use dockercompose up Then find the web interface at To run the latest master version use dockercompose f dockercomposemasteryml up Then find the web interface at To rebuild the master version with the latest code from git use dockercompose f dockercomposemasteryml build nocache I want to dockerize selfoss but Im unable to identify that how exactly I do it since it uses PHP and nodejs both If I require to use dockercompose then can someone please help me with the exact proper script Screenshot from This is what my Selfoss looks like All it took was entrytoolbar display inherit padding px paddingbottom px background inherit border margintop px in selfossusercss But it doesnt work Clicking mark or star does nothing I have spent hours messing with the the jquery with no success I cannot understand why it does not work What would it take to make it work Some video platform like Youtube or Peertube use the MediaRSS extension to provide metadata about the videos They generally do not use the whole tags available but provide tags for the video description the thumbnail and the number of views It would be amazing if selfoss could at least display the thumbnail and the description for videos An extract of a Youtube feed xml mediagroup mediatitleCan You Observe a Typical Universemediatitle mediacontent url

logo is great but its age is apparent on it Selfoss logo We also do not have a vector source which makes handling it a pain It would be nice if we found a designer that could come up with something great like Now that we have made it work using AJAX in it should be trivial to move the page to the settings page allowing us to translate the page The titles of above said pages are not getting inheritid from the configurations Ive tried modifying somethings in selfossuijs but it didnt worked For example if bodyishashpasswordbody opmlbody we do not want to create UI for nonapp pages but we want to inherit the title of those pages from the configurations documentattrtitle selfosshtmlTitle return But it is not working Ive tried various more things but no luck as of now jtojnar Can you please look into this
