Im wondering about compatibility The only feature I would like to see added to GraphSketcher is support for TeX math expressions Perhaps using for the implementation While it is possible to pick a color BEFORE creating an object like a line curve or text it is no longer possible to change an objects color or to pick a color other than black for the canvas Any attempts to change colors of objects or the canvas immediately revert to black GraphSketcher fills a needed space for presentation graphs so Im hopeful this can be easily corrected First thanks for working on this I use it a ton I updated to OS X last night and now graphsketcher is hanging and I have to force quit Im getting the hang anytime I try to modify a graph a previously created graph Possibly at other times as well I have not investigated very much yet This is also happening with the last release from Omni I have not been experiencing other issues since the OS update Im a math teacher and not a programmer sorry if thats a lame description This is hands down the best graphing utility for economics graphs Im not sure how much overlap there is between windows and mac software but Ill put a bounty out for someone to create this for windows The alternatives are just so poor Adding data with oscillations of extremeish points renders the line to be below the axis even though the values represented on the Yaxis are Verified this to be the same on the old Omni version as well Is this a bug or is it functioning as designed given the smoothing extrapolation carried out by the line algorithm Thank you Seems that the defaults make it impossible to configure a graph of descending positive values as you go up the Yaxis Am I missing a tweak that would fix it When GraphSketcher was still OmniGraphSketcher it was set up to handle automatic software updates using our open source OmniSoftwareUpdate framework We didnt want the open source app to be dependent on Omnis software update feeds at updateomnigroupcom so we pulled that integration before we published the app to this github repository If anyone does start working on GraphSketcher here though it would sure be nice if people using the app could get notified of those updates without having to check a webpage So here are some possibilities If someone were to take on the work of publishing GraphSketcher builds in the App Store then the App Store will automatically update those builds for anyone who downloads it that way This is the only way that the iPad app can ever make it into the hands of the general public again but setting up an App Store developer account and going through the submission and review cycle for each update does involve some work and expense Alternatively for the Mac app we could simply reintegrate OmniSoftwareUpdate The code side of integrating this would be fairly easy since we pulled it out in a single commit that we could reverse for those at Omni see r But thats not the complete solution someone would also need to do some sysadmin work to publish an appcast RSS feed somewhere to advertise those updates We have a script which updates Omnis feeds for nightly builds which Id be happy to donate Of course all of this only really matters if GraphSketcher actually has some updates worth publishing So this isnt an immediate priority just something to consider once we get to that point Id really like to know if someone is going to accept commits to the master branch if any Or can just everybody just work on their features and commit back Im just curious at this time About the organization of this rather large project I havent played around with it enough to know if there are any features I miss Thanks And I am very grateful for the opportunity to look into the codebase of the Pros Third Christmas this year Following up on a Twitter message now that I found the GitHub project page The current build of GraphSketcher doesnt have any resources for languages other than English Now the current build is localizable editable nib yeah so I took the opportunity to work on an update for the old French localization All strings and nib are now ready but the HTML files are not done yet There is also a PDF file with a list of shortcut I cant currently localize it without having the source document that has been used to generate it Now Im not too familiar with GitHub and especially when it comes to committing a localization Any suggestion
