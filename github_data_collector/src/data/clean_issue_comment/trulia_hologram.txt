Hello I am creating the styleguide and I have many similar css classes for color I dont want to type a lot of similar text in the the example block is there a way to create a loop in the markdown Adding a reference to the Ruby Hologram Webpack Plugin Is it possible I dug around and it appears that this can only be done with html Signedoffby Tom Chen tochenpivotalio See This ensures the text inside of the pre section of the gh page is wrapped around See the result img width altscreen shot at pm src Compared to previous img width altscreen shot at pm src I wasnt sure if I should overflowx auto or wrap line but figured wrapping was a bit cleaner overflowing didnt make it obvious that text was available past the scroll point Also wasnt sure if I should be updating both stylessass and stylescss or if theres a compile SASS CSS step somewhere so I covered both For the main nav there is currently no way to set their orderpriority If they were classed with their name this could be one method to accomplish it For sub sections we currently have to prefix their name with an index number or letter to force the order we want This gets messy when we need to move sections around or add new ones into the order having to update the naming for all the others Note by primary menu I dont mean the top level nav I mean the top level menu for the sections in the content It renders as an unclassed ul without any sub ul hierarchy I end up doing display none on the primary menu as it contains no hierarchy within the lists all sections and subsections are at the same first level There are no classes generated to differentiate as well unlike sectionnav As a result all of the top level sections below the fold are unknown without a proper primary menu Multiple members of my team were distracted by this emoticon which is backwards from the traditional version in this country anyway somehow it always looks like a frown as it slides by on the console Also took the opportunity to add Hologram since in our situation where youre scanning a lot of build output its helpful to be specific about what just finished Remove distracting backwards emoticon Add Hologram which is helpful messaging in a multiplebuild situation gem install hologram stopped working for me when run with a V flag the output just stops I noticed there was an update to rouge dated th June when I specify version things progress as normal havent tried or But I thought I should give you the heads up
