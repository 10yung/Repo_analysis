make on mock objects this is working example php thiscustomerRepository expectsthisat methodsave withnewTemporaryCustomerFirst thiscustomerRepository expectsthisat methodsave withnewTemporaryCustomerSecond This is error exaple php thiscustomerRepository expectsthisat methodsave withnewTemporaryCustomerFirst thiscustomerRepository expectsthisat methodsave withnewTemporaryCustomerSecond In this case he expects newTemporaryCustomerSecond on index Debuger is showing we iterate on object object and make saves but phpunit mock object is counting save method on not In other case i must start counting from and next use at at etc Current behavior Counting index on mock object How to reproduce I think its problem when you got mocked object what iniject other services and other services made save he shouldnt count other methods inside iniject services Expected behavior Fix index on mock objects This can happen when referring to an integer class constant eg expectedExceptionCode SomeClassINTEGERCONSTANT this file has stricttypes constant will return a class constant which can be of type nullboolintfloatstringarrayresource The type hint was added in c e f c PHPUnit wasnt affected I didnt see any tests for DocBlock or expectedExceptionCode to base new tests off of EDIT testsendtoend seems to be the most appropriate This pull request removes the class name as CLI option as stated in Hello there with we deprecated calling PHPUnit with a class name This deprecation was released with PHPUnit v and we can remove calling with a class name in the upcoming PHPUnit v This Issue is about removing calling PHPUnit with a class name I will create a pull request in the next few days Flo Q A PHPUnit version PHP version Installation Method Composer Summary I am trying to run Functional Test from Drupal using PHPStorm but cant get the HTML files output to work It seems to be related to the teamcity option that PHPStorm always adds when running the tests from the IDE When using the IDE the printer option can be added to the test runner options but it will appear before the teamcity option After trying to run the tests from the CLI I have found that it might be related to the order in which the teamcity and the printer option appear when trying to run the tests I thought that the order in which the options appear shouldnt matter but my testing suggests that it does Current behavior No HTML is created when teamcity appears before printer How to reproduce Run a functional test that should generate HTML output from the CLI specifying the printer option before teamcity option The test runs but no HTML should be created In my specific case I used the following command direct copy from PHPStorm php varwwwvendorphpunitphpunitphpunit

has become a defacto standard way to deal with deprecations and it would be nice if PHPUnit had a convenient way to report them It doesnt happen due to this which seems to be perfectly reasonable in general eg theres no other good way to make mkdir work safely other than calling it with and PHPUnit definitely shouldnt raise such errors so I propose to add a configuration option that makes error handler handle an error of EUSER type regardless of errorreporting ie without respect to whether silencing has been used or not Symfony implemented this in their phpunitbridge they gather deprecations then run matching against an expectation however its not a symfonyspecific thing Doctrine does it too and I think it makes sense to add possibility for PHPUnit to be more strict towards such deprecations and user defined errors in general Also the Symfony bridge itself is a controversial thing that Id personally avoid while its possible I volunteer to work on it if such addition is welcome sebastianbergmann what do you think My original plan was to introduce a new configuration option unsilenceUserDefinedErrors and make EUSER fall below this check as long as the option is set to true while letting it be false by default Hello Running PHPUnit and Symfony i got deprecation warning on running php unit tests Other deprecation notices x The PHPUnit DeepCopy TypeFilter Spl SplDoublyLinkedListFilter class is considered final It may change without further notice as of its next major version You should not extend it from PHPUnit DeepCopy TypeFilter Spl SplDoublyLinkedList Should i ignore that If i ignore this warning my pipeline fails on unittest stage Any help would be appreciate One thing that ReturnValueMap lacked was flexibility regarding the arguments the method was invoked with It works only with exact match As a side effect if you have floats as arguments it may fail As a solution support has been added for FrameworkConstraint objects
