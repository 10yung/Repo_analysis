im to keep track of chains like this chains EAAnimationFuture so i can call like this chainsmap cancelAnimationChain but it saying Use of unresolved identifier EAAnimationFuture Hi thanks for this very great library However the enable function is no more accessible from objective c while the class is marked objc Or am I missing something Regards Added a few convenience methods UIViewanimateAndChain without the delay and options parameters for brevity in situations where those parameters arent needed EAAnimationFuturewait waits a specified duration before moving on to the next part of the chain EAAnimationFuturedo executes the input block instantly without animating After the recent upgrade I see the following errors at EasyAnimation building img width altscreen shot at src I used it and apparently a view that you chain animations on retains those When you later trigger animations on the same view the previously chained animations get triggered again Maybe there is a cleanup I don t know about Reproduce Add a view and chain some animations Animate the chain When it is finished add some other animations in code Start that animation Bug The chained animations in are added to the new animations I dont feel this is the expected behaviour I just installed and ran my app without doing any changes to my code EasyAnimation still swizzles without having called EasyAnimationenable Hey everyone I recently got a beautiful newborn at home and it feels itll be a bit difficult to add some new and fresh features to EasyAnimation Should anyone feel like digging into the code and maybe add some new stuff folks would find cool let me know best Marin I think there is some small bug with the spring animation The completion block its never been called swift var newFrame viewframe newFramesizeheight UIViewanimate withDuration delay usingSpringWithDamping initialSpringVelocity options animations selftestLayerframe newFrame in printTralala
