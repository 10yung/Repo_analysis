When directly building by buildsh it finally shows When building with RUSTSTATIC it shows When building in containers it shows I am new to Rust so I have not got any idea of how to fix them Just want to run the NF successfully any suggestions are highly appreciated on Ubuntu LTS using Rust nightly error E packed type cannot transitively contain a repralign type frameworksrcsharedstatedirectoryrs pub struct DirectoryHeader entries AtomicUsize Used to signal that snapshotting is in progress currentversion AtomicUsize committedversion AtomicUsize length usize I am new for rust when I run netbricks test cases these cases are just receive and send on the same phy port But I have tow phy ports I want to receive packages on one phy port and send these packages out from the other phy port just like the real router or NAT do Can NetBricks do this Can you gave me one example Thanks I use clang on Ubuntu when compiling e d there are errors like following SCTP library found NetBricksframework NetBricks Compiling e d v filehomeluoNetBricksframework error E unresolved import stdallocAlloc frameworksrcallocatorscachealignedrs use stdallocself Alloc Global Layout Opaque no Alloc in alloc error E unresolved import stdallocGlobal frameworksrcallocatorscachealignedrs use stdallocself Alloc Global Layout Opaque no Global in alloc error E unresolved import stdallocLayout frameworksrcallocatorscachealignedrs use stdallocself Alloc Global Layout Opaque no Layout in alloc error E unresolved import stdallocOpaque frameworksrcallocatorscachealignedrs use stdallocself Alloc Global Layout Opaque no Opaque in alloc error E module alloc is private frameworksrcallocatorscachealignedrs use stdallocself Alloc Global Layout Opaque error E module alloc is private frameworksrcallocatorscachealignedrs use stdallocself Alloc Global Layout Opaque error E module alloc is private frameworksrcallocatorscachealignedrs use stdallocself Alloc Global Layout Opaque error E module alloc is private frameworksrcallocatorscachealignedrs use stdallocself Alloc Global Layout Opaque error E module alloc is private frameworksrcallocatorscachealignedrs use stdallocself Alloc Global Layout Opaque error E feature may not be used on the stable release channel frameworksrclibrs featureasm error E feature may not be used on the stable release channel frameworksrclibrs featurelogsyntax error E feature may not be used on the stable release channel frameworksrclibrs featureboxsyntax error E feature may not be used on the stable release channel frameworksrclibrs featurespecialization error E feature may not be used on the stable release channel frameworksrclibrs featuresliceconcatext error E feature may not be used on the stable release channel frameworksrclibrs featurefnbox error E feature may not be used on the stable release channel frameworksrclibrs featurealloc error E feature may not be used on the stable release channel frameworksrclibrs featureheapapi error E feature may not be used on the stable release channel frameworksrclibrs featureunique error E feature may not be used on the stable release channel frameworksrclibrs featureconstfn error E feature may not be used on the stable release channel frameworksrclibrs featureptrinternals error E feature may not be used on the stable release channel frameworksrclibrs featureallocatorapi error E feature may not be used on the stable release channel frameworksrclibrs featureintegeratomics error aborting due to previous errors error Could not compile e d To learn more run the command again with verbose According to the rustlangrust and rustlangrustf ab b e efed c b f f ebd c Opaque struct has been removed from stdalloc and u can be used here for the replacement Hi all Just a question Im trying to understand the inner working of the window stream UDF combined with the packetize abstraction to modify flows on the fly as suggested in the paper Is there an example of this How will the repacketization will be made regarding eg SEQ and ACKs Will it redo a way handshake etc One example would be rewriting URLs in HTTP flows to use different CDNs Thanks for the light Tom Hi I wanted to know if it is possible to use dpdks EAL arguments with these functions For example I want to use socketmem b blacklist ports n memory channels and xendom I experimented a little bit but couldnt find anything I think the f config command does not allow for these parameters either correct I am looking for alternate to Seastar in Rust lang and seems NetBricks can be used for developing highperformance network applications Any plans to integrate with tokiars
