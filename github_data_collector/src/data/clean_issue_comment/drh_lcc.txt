Hello I just wanted to try this project out and made me a clone and attempted a build with mkdir out make all BUILDDIRout This is what essentially happened cc g c Icpp o outgetopto cppgetoptc

should also work but was not tested yet Hey were having a discussion over at Atariage about the possibility of getting a C compiler to target the CP CPU Ref Its a bit CPU where sizeofchar sizeofint sizeofvoid Is retargeting for this CPU possible and if so are there any good docs or reference for what parts need to be changed in LCC to make this happen Hi David I was wondering if you could share the history of the cpp C preprocessor Was this written specifically for lcc Thanks and Regards Dibyendu As I mentioned in the title I want to do my own compilation using your compiler and is it my programming language by playing in c libraries Ive tried Java proactively from you but my programming language is not compatible with the slogan of slogan C as powerful as python is so easy according to the information Ive read on the internet your compiler is not borrowed like borland c right Not compatible with all operating systems is not the c compiler we know Now why do I order them Because of the question sordum wikipedia is licensed For saying The question on the link to ask you about the question is Due to the fact that the sordium has been called the processor programming compiler for some sites c programming language I apologize for writing so long A quick internet search found which is from Id like to get a feeling for how much faster LCC compiles compared to GCC and how much slower the executables run Obviously this is application specific but Id like to set some expectations of what might be possible Another comparison of interest would be TCC do you havs a plan to support lcc run on macOS Hi Dave In srcstmtc line no Type rty definition should be at top in statement function for C Type rty freturncfunctype Warm Regards Daipayan Bhowal i j After the simplify at simpc the expression i will be simplified to i which is an INDIR tree thus the assignment check will be OK The same problem can be found in other identity simplification mainc has an incorrect length for the mulopscalls option string on lines and else if strncmpargv i mulopscalls IRmulopscalls argv i should be else if strncmpargv i mulopscalls IRmulopscalls argv i if Im counting correctly
