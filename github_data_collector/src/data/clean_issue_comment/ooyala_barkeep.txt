security fix PRs for this repo from the Security Alerts page details Among your future plans are we going to use checklists for code reviews and evaluate them accordingly First of all Id like to thank the Barkeep developers for their wonderful tool Weve started doing daily code reviews with it in early and had really positive results However since Barkeep is obviously no longer maintained I quickly started to develop our own continuous code review tool which has been in use at my current employer since November Ive just open sourced it so other teams might make use of it and find a living alternative to Barkeep Its available on We also held a talk about it at a conference in Germany with our Continuous Code Review Process explained in more detail its in German only though It looks like OpenId server is not reachable from my barkeep server Unable to contact OpenID server Error fetching execution expired It looks like openid is no more supported Can anyone help me with this error
