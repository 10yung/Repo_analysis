This PR has a set of changes which make ocl build without warnings The imagessafeclamp example specifies as the version for the time crate Update the example to the v API and pin the version there When compiling em I get the following error from Cargo on arch error E the trait bound synExpr stdconvertFromquotertTokenStream is not satisfied homeritobancargoregistrysrcgithubcom ecc db ec emumacro srcpassingrs iargsinsert gpuident the trait stdconvertFromquotertTokenStream is not implemented for synExpr help the following implementations were found synExpr as stdconvertFromsynExprArray synExpr as stdconvertFromsynExprAssign synExpr as stdconvertFromsynExprAssignOp synExpr as stdconvertFromsynExprAsync and others note required because of the requirements on the impl of stdconvertIntosynExpr for quotertTokenStream Hi Just an FYI on Debian Buster I had to add the following to be able to use this library bash ln s usrlibx linuxgnulibOpenCLso usrlibx linuxgnulibOpenCLso Not sure if thats the right way of solving this Changes rtry memuninitialized memMaybeUninituninitassumeinit Dear rustopencl folk Ive encountered an error in the oclinterop crate while building for mac I know it is untested and Im not quite sure what I expected but please hear me out If you try to set up things as the README shows building crashes buildrs with the message that the crate glgenerator can not be found This is red flag AFAIK because glgenerator shouldnt even be included in mac builds In my local copy of the crate I removed the extern crate and the use line in librs To properly fix this Im confident that some well placed pre compile flags would do the trick but on my end I just ended up deleting most of the file involving glgenerator On my end this lets me move past buildrs and consequently it crashes in librs in the following bit which is line of oclinteroplibrs cfgtargetos macos unsafe let glcontext cglCGLGetCurrentContext let sharegroup cglCGLGetShareGroupglcontext propertiescglsharegroupsharegroup because properties is moved by the cglsharegroup call it cannot be returned at the end of the function Im unsure why it is moved as when we dive in cglsharegroup it seems to give ownership back by returning self So thats what I found out Sorry if I made some error and this is an incoherent rambling mess Im willing to fix this but I am unsure where to continue Thanks for reading and looking forward to any responses Currently PRs cannot be built on Travis CI due to console sudo E aptget yq noinstallsuggests noinstallrecommends travisaptgetoptions install intelopencl oclicdopencldev Reading package lists Building dependency tree Reading state information Some packages could not be installed This may mean that you have requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or been moved out of Incoming The following information may help to resolve the situation The following packages have unmet dependencies intelopencl Depends inteligcopencl but it is not installable E Unable to correct problems you have held broken packages Using ppaocldevintelopencl instead of ppaintelopenclintelopencl would fix that problem but Im unsure if that would be the right thing to do It is really unfortunate in the current api as this will create a panic if no compatible gpu can be found This fixes that issue Fix a buffer fill event assertion to allow for the usage of those events when using the BufferBuilder The fix should allow for the fill event to be setretrieved Error before the fix thread testsbufferfillfillwithevent panicked at Bufferfillevent Fill event already set oclsrcstandardbufferrs This assertion will now only trigger when calling the fillevent method twice or more
