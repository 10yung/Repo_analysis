no matter stylizeimagesh or use python neuralstylepy it run in few seconds but the output without no magic there are some trigger arguements Is there an option to save every X number of variation If there isnt can you please implement it or provide a viable workaround Thanks you so much Would I have to segment the video first into the foreground and background and then run the script on each and then mesh the two style videos together Ref cc cysmith njordsir Hello when I run the code ex python neuralstylepy contentimg lionjpg contentimgdir imageinput styleimgs kandinskyjpg styleimgsdir styles device gpu verbose initimgtype style and i display the value of Lcontent it always I dont know why any help please I am trying to stylizing video frames which are in videoinput folder and used advanced bash command on your github for the same but i dont know how to generate flow files using makeoptflowsh can you tell me the steps Screenshot from i guess makeoptflowsh file is run using makeoptflowsh worldvideoframes frameppm videooutput my frames are in format frame ppm There is a script tfupgradev to convert neuralstylepy from TensorFlow X to TensorFlow but the result script do not runs Ive used jcjohnsons implementation of Neural Style Transfer before and got great results but wasnt satisfied with the memory usage and number of parameters With your implementation everythings running great and with lots of settings but Im wondering what settings I have to change to get the result as close to jcjohnsons one as possible Is there any way to get this working with ROCm I have both rocm and rocmtensorflow installed but when I try to do an image transfer I get this output Is neuralstyletf not compatible with rocm Or am I simply doing something wrong homesamuellocallibpython
