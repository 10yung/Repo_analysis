 can be takeover from Heroku because there is no app on it I followed the setup instructions but am getting this error even though the Heroku instance has this dir Any suggestions Dont break the Ruby support added in but also support Ruby This is true for builds triggered by GitHub webhooks and hubot mkantor hubot ci build jankyv hubot Unknown branch v Push again I was surprised by this since I my git experience tells me that annotated tags are just another kind of named ref and should be treated similarly to branches in general The particular issue that caused me to realize this was that release tags for a project configured with Janky were not being CId If anything needs to be builttested its releases Im able to work around this by telling hubot to hubot ci build projectmaster immediately after tagging but this is kind of silly Janky also doesnt understand how to build SHAs which is unfortunate but a bit more understandable EDIT It looks like fixed this Allow for the purpose of some Dashboards for example to do something similar to the hubot status request for a branch but for a project returning the status of all known branches or all current branches on Github I currently have to poll this via the Github API for each individual branch grab branches get shas request build status for each sha Doing this via janky would be preferable so as to not overload github and to have it all in a single request If the repo already has a hook in place you get this irbmain JankyRepositorysetuplibgit rugged ruggedcontinuous JankyError Failed to create hook from datajankyvendorgemsruby bundlergemsjanky f cf ae libjankygithubrb in hookcreate from datajankyvendorgemsruby bundlergemsjanky f cf ae libjankyrepositoryrb in setuphook from datajankyvendorgemsruby bundlergemsjanky f cf ae libjankyrepositoryrb in setup from datajankyvendorgemsruby bundlergemsjanky f cf ae libjankyrepositoryrb in setup from irb from usrsharerbenvversions p tcsgithubbinirb in main This should handle removingupdating it properly or maybe at least a more descriptive error message Foldingfiltering compilesetc to allow you to see just the compilertest errors but reveal the rest on demand would be lovely I am only reporting this as an undesired behavior issue and not necessarily a bug Wanted to make note though for those debugging later joshaber pingd today in Ops asking about Janky behavior Basically Janky wouldnt see builds as actually completed After looking at the output Jenkins claimed SUCCESS BUILD SUCCEEDED Finished SUCCESS Looking further it seems that our output column in Janky is set to mediumtext which has a character limit of characters The output for these particular tests were much higher wc m DownloadsconsoleTexttxt UsersasenchiDownloadsconsoleTexttxt Something to keep in mind if we see this again cc githubops I have a project I want to build on both Mac and Windows To do this Ive created two jobs projectosxxmlerb and projectwinxmlerb Setting up the first one works just fine ci setup ownerrepo projectosx But setting up the second one fails because the GitHub Hooks API recently changed to disallow duplicate hooks on repositories ci setup ownerrepo projectwin js message Validation Failed errors resource Hook code custom message Hook already exists on this repository datajankyvendorgemsruby bundlergemsjanky fb e e libjankygithubrb in hookcreate datajankyvendorgemsruby bundlergemsjanky fb e e libjankyrepositoryrb in setuphook datajankyvendorgemsruby bundlergemsjanky fb e e libjankyrepositoryrb in setup datajankyvendorgemsruby bundlergemsjanky fb e e libjankyrepositoryrb in setup datajankyvendorgemsruby bundlergemsjanky fb e e libjankyhubotrb in block in cc technoweenie Im trying to add a personal repo arobenlibchromiumcontent to an existing Janky instance But every time I do it throws an exception in Repositoryhookcreate Were getting a response from apigithubcom when trying to create the service hook This is happening because the user that Janky is authenticating as is not an admin on the repo Of course it isnt since its a personal repo only I am an admin on the repo Its quite easy for me to set up the service hook manually of course But theres no way for Janky to know that Ive done so since only admins can list hooks on repos Id love for there to be a way to get this working Maybe Janky could say Hey you need to add SOMEURL as service hook to your repo
