 I saw in the description that this library is suitable as a transport protocol for Orleans as I understand it How exactly to launch silo to be able to use MS Orleans with this library under Unity mobile platforms Could there be a Unity templates for both the server and the client in Unity Is it possible atleast It seems that the unitypackage of MagicOnion x has no UnsafeDirectBlitResolver class so it causes compile error when the project using that class to resolve types Is there a way for a client to send a message to the server or another client The sample code provides only oneway communication with no message streaming How to write a code for server and client that supports bidirectional message streaming with NET Core using gRPC I want to verify Telemetry in my environment Im currently testing with CentOS not docker The readme example code did not work Is there any sample code that works I would be very happy if I could see how it works with samplesChatApp I think MagicOnion is a great framework Thank you add interceptor in IService but not work public class TestService ServiceBaseITestService ITestService Webhook public async UnaryResultstring Hello return hellworld public class WebhookInterceptor IInterceptor public void InterceptIInvocation invocation var webhookAttribute invocation MethodInvocationTarget GetCustomAttributestypeofWebhookAttribute false CastWebhookAttribute FirstOrDefault invocationProceed if webhookAttribute null var result invocationReturnValue I implemented a custom client filter public class AppendIdentifierFilter IClientFilter public async ValueTaskResponseContext SendAsyncRequestContext context FuncRequestContext ValueTaskResponseContext next contextItemsAddtest foo return await nextcontext and tried to access it in my service on the serverside public async UnaryResultNil Test LoggerInfowe have the items stringJoin ContextItemsKeys But the items dictionary appears to be empty To initialize the service I used the following way MagicOnionClientCreateITestServicechannel new IClientFilter new AppendIdentifierFilteridentifier From the documentation I could not figure out what part was still missing Thank you for any help Hello I keep getting this when trying to connect to a StreamingHubClient Cannot access a disposed object Object name StreamingHubClient at MagicOnionClientStreamingHubClientBase ThrowIfDisposed at MagicOnionClientStreamingHubClientBase WriteMessageWithResponseAsync TRequestTResponse Int metthodId TRequest message at MatchmakingServerTestsClientTestInitialize my client connection code cs public async void Initialize Channel channel new Channel ChannelCredentialsInsecure try IMatchmaker client StreamingHubClientConnectIMatchmaker IMatchmakerReceiverchannel this await clientRegisterTicket catch Exception e ConsoleWriteLineeMessage n neStackTrace my serverside code cs setup MagicOnion and option ServerPort port new ServerPort ServerCredentialsInsecure var service MagicOnionEngineBuildServerServiceDefinitionisReturnExceptionStackTraceInErrorDetail true var server new globalGrpcCoreServer Services service Ports port try launch gRPC Server serverStart catch Exception e ConsoleWriteLineeSource neMessage n neStackTrace MagicOnionEnginecs var interfaceMap classTypeGetInterfaceMapinheritInterface var interfaceMaps GetAllInterfaceMapsclassTypeWherexxTargetMethodsLength foreach var interfaceMap in interfaceMaps for int i i interfaceMapTargetMethodsLength i static IEnumerableInterfaceMapping GetAllInterfaceMapsthis Type type typeGetTypeInfo ImplementedInterfaces Selecti typeGetInterfaceMapi
