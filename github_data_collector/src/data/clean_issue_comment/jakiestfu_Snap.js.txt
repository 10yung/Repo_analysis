I am trying to make the hamburger menu sticky I see where this was asked and answered some time ago but the answer is no longer a functioning link Does anyone have any info on doing that Can we get an update to the state of the library Its got a lot of stars but it also hasnt been updated in a while Does it still work Perhaps there could be a list of the most common issues in the readme Otherwise can someone please recommend an alternative Ive been searching for a responsive gesture swipeable side menu for days now On the default demo if I start dragging the hamburger menu and move my pointer over the sidebar the drag breaks Im guessing youre listening to mousemove on the wrong element or forgot to capture the pointer if youre using pointer events Incidentally the drag element demo doesnt seem to have the same problem Hi there I noticed a super strange behaviour when my modal will jump up and down if I have my mouse over some buttons Check out the quick video I made of it It uses TextAngular in my modal grey buttons are not using positionrelative so they dont trigger this behaviour for some reason If the modal is not scrolled or if button have not position relative then no jumping happens If I disable snapjs then the behaviour stops Any idea what the problem could be Seems like a rendering bug as nothing seems to change in the DOM nor any event is fired I originally posted this on TextAngular as I think this was something done by their code fixing typos Hello I got a problem with adding a bootstrap dropdown menu to the snap menu The area expanded flag of the menu is always set to false Is this compatible I there a way to add collapsable submenus ty jakiestfu Would you be open to adding more collaborators to this repo Its a great piece of software would love to see it live on These two forks have some enhancements eg around ES modules perhaps one of them or both would be interested cc omichelsen JoeyAndres kosssi Is there a way to manually trigger the startevent I have an horizontal scrolling div and Im trying to drag the snapper out when the scrollLeft is but disable the snapper if the div is scrolled this way I can slide through my div normally unless I reach scrollLeft I though of triggering the startevent when trying to swipe when reaching scrollLeft ZIndeces ZIndices Hi Snap is not closing in ie Windows when we click on snap content area Regards Arun Prasad
