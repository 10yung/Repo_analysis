The filesystem driver vmhgfs module is used only for the shared folder feature The rest of the software provided by VMware Tools is designed to work independently of this feature If you wish to have the shared folders feature you can install the driver by running vmwareconfigtoolspl again after making sure that gcc binutils make and the kernel sources for your running kernel are installed on your machine These packages are available on your distributions installation CD Press Enter key to continue Any help or suggest is grateful Its a minor issue since Fedora will still accept the yum command and redirect to usrbindnf install but it would still be nice I wanted to have Unity support so I need to use VMware Workstation but Ive encountered two issues related to unity and shared folders during the installation First of all the default installation vmwaretoolspatches simply installed the newest vmwaretools so unfortunately no unity support and the one supplied with VMware workstation could not build vmhgfs correctly so unity works fine but no shared folders To solve vmhgfs compilation issue I had to revert to ac e c a a edda ea ac dc a f commit because with the last commit patchsh simply skips the patch for kernels for vmhgfs then patchsh successfully applied vmhgfsinodeunlocklinkopscachemacrocleanup patch compilesh correctly buildt and installed everything except vmhgfs module could not be loaded so shared folders still did not work However because in newer kernels legacy vmhgfs is not needed anymore I simply downloaded and installed the newest version downloadtoolssh latest the one without Unity support then copied cp usrbinvmhgfsfuse cp usrlibvmwaretoolslib libvmhgfsfusesolibvmhgfsfuseso libvmhgfsfuseso cp usrlibvmwaretoolslib libvmhgfsfusesolibvmhgfsfuseso libvmhgfsfuseso Reinstalled the version with unity support the one supplied with VMware which duriing uninstall removed fuserelated stuff and then I moved copied files to the same locations Now both unity and shared folders works fine If there is anyone who can make it more elegant do no hesitate to answer here Hello how we can support symlink in shared folder i get always permission error using Ubuntu Karnel version On Ubuntu with the latest updates I can chown mnthgfsshare to a different group But after about seconds it reverts back to rootroot Literally hour ago the group would stick There were no changes to the system Ive tried this on ubuntu VMsall show the same issue
