Doesn t work yet build fails because the binaries can t initialize the platform plugin successfully debugandrelease builds are also broken upstream haven t tried to build static at all yet Removes the previous static plugins support from CMake and Qt in favor of their new upstream implementation Qt s configure step wants assimp which doesn t build without patches but master does so this is a git package for now Suggesting we offer the world a truly alternative PC browser that could even one day become a standard a long way from that although when rn cant even click edit my post The browser already compiles with MinGW and offers a functional qtwebkit target Caveat qtwebkit struggles with compilers newer than x Packaging request for JACK audio Many audio apps use it Hello I found that any ldexe from binutils v is broken and returns ld returned exit status error code So I have tried to download mingww i binutils anypkgtarxz from msys repo and replaced the installed ldexe with the downloaded one this times it compiled and linked without problems My code is very big to share it so you can reproduce it yourself My code requires at least wxWidgets v to build What can I do make you believe that any version v is really broken Because it is working without problems for small projects and makes you believe it is working properly Thank you in advance I wanted to use Googles API and using mingww grpc produced this kind of error during authentication this isnt the exact one as Ive recompiled grpc myself here E sslutilscc loadfile created descriptionFailed to load filefileE

compiled grpc from source from version and had to change things so it would build patched aeadtestcc x testccbsslshimccdigestcctransportcommon and loadfilecc I used the cmake build and changed some of the cmake settings However for some reason the package configs files grpcpc and grpcpc werent created with a mingw make install so I created them by hand I dont know how to use PKGBUILD so copied each file over manually its going to be a hassle to uninstall it Has anyone here actually been able to browse content in the MINGW release of VLC using Universal Plug n Play The console will give you a

the following packages besides obvious libxml libxslt that are used in PostgreSQL to build documentation mingw mingww x docbookxsl mingw mingww x docbookxml I had errors during the build mingw binxsltproc path stringparam pgversion stylesheetmanxsl postgressgml Note namesp add added namespace before processing PostgreSQL Documentation Element div in namespace encountered in td but no template matches and no result files were genearted Investigating docbook installation in my msys env I found that needed styles for successfuyl build docbook are installed in the wrong directories The current installation directory is mingw sharexmldocbookxslstylesheetsnons nons The last nons suffix seems wrong Why is it needed Also it seems that references from etcxmldocbookxsl are pointed on wrong catalog content with ns or without ns I checked style contents from cdndocbookorg docbooksourceforgenet and found misalignes between releasexsl releasexslns on these sites and references in etcxmldocbookxsl from this package References on NS and NoNS versions are mixed up I try to correct these errors in the following patch and made pull request for discution these misalignes Hope it helps to improve docbook and msys With correction proposed in this patch the PostgreSQL documentation build is finished successfully I tried to fix these errors in the patch and made a pull request to review and discuss these misalignes Hope this helps improve docbook and msys With the fixes proposed in the patch the PostgreSQL documentation builds successfully Hi Ive started working on Rust support here A few notes When bootstrapno the bootstrappy errors out very early on when rust is already installed on the system possibly due to this issue Certainly the symptom is the same When bootstrapyes it gets pretty far into the build it successfully compiles the std package and quite a bit of librustcs dependencies but compiling the librustcllvm crate fails with tons of linker errors like this one Cmsys mingw binlibgccx w mingw x w mingw binldexe C msys tmp rustcwpVt F librustcllvm cacb b affrlibZ SolvercppobjtextZNK llvm SMTExprltERKS ZNK llvm SMTExprltERKS x e undefined reference to Z getastid collect exe error ld returned exit status There are approximately of these mostly referring to different functions The GPG key appears to be invalid and Im not sure how to get a correct one So I grabbed the sha sum based on my download but I dont know what to put in validpgpkeys to get it to work without passing skippgpcheck to the package build command MINGWINSTALLSmingw makepkgmingw sLf skippgpcheck cmake pre doesnt find boost already packaged properly see this cmake upstream issue Please package cmake
