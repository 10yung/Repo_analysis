Fix for minor typo Fixes some small typos Hope its okay that I didnt create issues first slightlysmilingface Im runing SimpleDockerUI on Ubuntu and all of my running containers were started in a standard terminal not with the SDUI app My host is Ubuntu with Docker version ce build be from the latest release build When I select a container and then click the terminal tag I can see the output but then at the bottom in red it shows Disconnected Clicking the attach or exec copypaste icons copies the command but I cant seem to figure out how to actually paste it into the UI Is this a bug or am I misunderstanding something The wiki shows using unixvarrundockersock but I dont understand the syntax to enter this Im using this remotely obviously from a Linux laptop So how should I connect by a direct IP address Im new to Docker this may be an obvious answer It is not issue SimpledockerUI is bery useful ang great GUI but it can not build up Nvidiadocker container fromNvidia docker images Could you tell me the the way to build up Nvidiadocker container from Nvidiadocker images There is a typo Contaner exposed ports tcp tcp On the image view Hi just to let you know theres some crash on windows hope it helps thanks I wonder whether this trouble is issue it will be the specification of your Docker Ui I built one image by nvidiadocker hence I used CUDAtool kit and CUDA driver I used you dockeui to deploy container of this image I select the image and clicked Deploy containerbut there was no reaction I tried other images without nvididocker ubuntu dockerhello world etc Depoy Container is worked correctly I guessed that we ca not use your Docker UI for nvidiadocker image Is it right I need your opinion Regards
