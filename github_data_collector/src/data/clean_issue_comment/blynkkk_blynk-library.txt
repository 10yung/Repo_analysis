Description My use case is using a selfsigned certificate and its fingerprint for validation This PR makes the following code use the fingerprint and work as expected Blynkbeginauth ssid pass ip port fingerprint otherwise the WiFiClientSecureconnect method fails to validate the SSL connection and returns the following error if debug messages are enabled or silently fails otherwise BSSLCouldnt connect Error Chain could not be linked to a trust anchor A workaround without applying this PR is blynkWifiClientsetFingerprintfingerprint Blynkbeginauth ssid pass ip port fingerprint Issues Resolved Using the fingerprint fails to establish an SSL connection Blynk library version IDE Arduino and gcc in linux Raspberry pi IDE version Arduino gcc Raspbian rpi Board type Arduini Pro Mini Adruino Nano Raspberry Pi Zero v Additional modules enc j for Arduino fe ICS Advent DM Fast Ethernet Adapter for Raspberry Pi Zero Scenario steps to reproduce For Adruino I have done simple sketch to send heart beat to widget For Raspberry Pi I have used your example from linux folder Im using my own blynk server When I reboot the blynk server the application does not try to connect to the server again Expected Result The application continues to try to connect to the server until the connection is restored Actual Result Arduino loses its connection The application in the Linux ends without any messages Thanks for contributing to Blynk library Please provide the following information for all PRs Replace brackets and placeholder text with your responses Description I made odroidseries arduino core I want to write blynk code on the Arduino platform even if on the embedded Linux Issues Resolved Until now for using blynk the code with blynk was compiled using command line tools on the embedded Linux If you merge BlynkSimpleLinuxSocketh to use blynk is much easier on the embedded Linux with Arduino Blynk library version IDE platformio clion android Blynk app IDE version platformio Board type DFRobot Bluno Beetle BLE ATMEGA P CC Trying to connect BLE to use in Arduino app Added widget for connect BLE it scans and sees Bluno clicking OK says Connecting then fails with Cant connect Retry or choose another device I have retried multiple times I have tried doing it from multiple Android devices Expected Result Connection Actual Result Cant connect Retry or choose another device The latest ESP Arduino core has switched to BearSSL as the default SSL implementation and deprecated the axTLS based implementation The WiFiClientSecure API differs between the BearSSL and axTLS implementations which means BlynkSimpleEsp SSLh no longer compiles properly out of the box It is unable now to use setTimeout or any other blynk timer functions with lambdas like this int testParameter timersetTimeout L SerialprintlnLambda gets StringtestParameter Getting an error no matching function for call to BlynkTimersetTimeoutlong int setuplambda This issue was also disscussed at blynk community forum Supposedly BlynkTimer does not support lambda as far as the way it should be because it is a fork of Marcello Romani s Simple timer that neither does But there is another fork on github where the support of lambdas stated as a feature Some changes with timercallback timercallbackp typedefs and style of calling passed functions needed As a result of fix supporting stdfunction or lambdaexpressions known from C will get an ability to pass local vars to lambda and thanks to it use deffered actions with fixed values in lambdamanner hi vshymanskyy Description Implemented the support file required to make works Blynk with WizFi Implemented the the header file BlynkSimpleWizFi h Implemented the the header file src Adapters BlynkWizFi h Implemented the example examples BoardsWiFi WizFi WizFi ino WizFi is a lower version module of the WizFi BylnkWizFi is almost the same as the WizFi WizFi library is available download from the library manager reference There was nothing wrong with the test thanks Hi guys Im having a problem with the BlynkApp on IOS with the Arduino MKR over USB connection Blynk library version v IDE Arduino IDE version web based IDE Board type MKR GSM Additional modules transmission over USB not GSM Scenario steps to reproduce Sending float numbers from Arduino to Value Display on specified virtual pin Expected Result Seeing the float number in the Value display Actual Result No data is displayed When I change the value to integer typ the value is transmitted The exact same code works with float numbers when an Arduino UNO is used instead of an mkr that is samd based Here is the simple code include BlynkSimpleStreamh You should get Auth Token in the Blynk App Go to the Project Settings nut icon char auth BlynkTimer timer float duration This function sends Arduinos up time every second to Virtual Pin In the app Widgets reading frequency should be set to PUSH This means that you define how often to send data to Blynk App void myTimerEvent You can send any value at any time Please dont send more that values per second BlynkvirtualWriteV duration void setup Debug console Blynk will work through Serial

my terminal pings to the static IP Works fine without Blynkrun code and DHCP I get a login timeout As you can see it works initially for a few seconds and then the ping starts to go higher and times
