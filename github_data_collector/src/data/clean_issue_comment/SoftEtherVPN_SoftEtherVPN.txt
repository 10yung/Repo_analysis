Architecture bit Processor Surface Pro Intel i G CPU Description When establishing a VPN connection with the SoftEther VPN Client Manager there is no connection to the Internet ie after activating the connection when hovering over the connection details it is displayed that the VPN user userWindows cannot connect to the Wifi network TPLinkXYZ TPLinkXYZ Internet access userWindows No Internet access Expected behavior Establishing VPN connection maintains the Internet connection and websites can be accessed Actual behavior VPN connection fails to connect to the Internet and websites cannot be

Follow the steps described in a YouTube Video by Aman Juman starting from minute to setup the SoftEther Server and Client Connect to VPN with SoftEther client on Surface laptop with Windows Guys I was thinking into a build a webapp to admin the server by the new API but the docker images that I found its for the RTM versions but not for the beta Its possible to get docker image for the beta so I can try to make the web ui for it Prerequisites X Can you reproduce X Are you running the latest version of SoftEtherVPN SoftEther version Build Component Server Operating system Linux Architecture ARM Processor Broadcom BCM The server is running on a Raspberry Pi Model B Description When the VPN server has no security log files and the file switch cycle is disabled they are not automatically created Expected behavior From my observation a log file with no timestamp in its name ie seclog should be created initially after an event Actual behavior No security log files are created Steps to reproduce Delete any log files in your security log folder Enable Security Logs if not done so already and have the Log File Switch Cycle setting set to No Switching Execute an action that would trigger a security event eg toggle the virtual hub status etc Observe the log file list dont forget to refresh and repeat a few times to be sure SoftEther version ComponentClient Operating system macOS Architecture bit bug macos softethervpnclient can connect server but but virtual network adapter not getting IP address from server I can see a session in my server I cannot access my Internal server but windows softethervpnclient can access my Internal server pull tuntap driver and install reboot install client uncompress file cd dir make vpnclient start vpncmd cmd niccreate vpnnic accountcreate accountpasswordset accountconnect There is any bug in softethervpnclient macos Or What have I forgotten Hi as far as I understand uploaddownload bandwidth limit is restricted to bps This is about Gbps In M G era Gbps limit was high enough because physical bandwidth limit was Mbps Gbps Now G era is coming The Gbps limit is a little bit low Of course SoftEthers throughput might not be fast enough to configure bandwidth limit more than Gbps However software limit should not be lower than hardware limit What about starting thinking about expanding these bit uint limit I know SoftEther both supports bit bit architecture the expansion would be available only on bit environment SoftEther version all Component both Client Server Operating system all Architecture bit Hello Though the WebUI feature on the latest version of SoftEther is marvelous such feature prevents me from setting up a web server as SoftEther allocates port for management Could anyone please tell me how I can disable the WebUI I cannot find a way to disable it on the latest version of the SoftEther VPN Server Manager Hope to get your reply soon Thanks Much appreciated Regards Andy Prerequisites yes Can you reproduce yes Are you running the latest version of SoftEtherVPN SoftEther version Build Component Server Operating system Linux Architecture bit Description Its found that support of TLS is disabled in Developer Edition of SoftEther VPN This causes some Windows clients to fail when connecting via SSTP protocol Same clients work fine with stable version I found cSslAcceptSettingsTlsDisable CfgGetBoolf TlsDisable in srcCedarServerc and expected to enable support of TLS by adding bool TlsDisable false but server silently ignores this option and even doesnt write it back to config Expected behavior bool TlsDisable false should work as expected Actual behavior Server silently ignores this option Steps to reproduce Try to connect from Windows client to SSTP using TLS only with disabled TLS in registry failed Try to connect from Windows client to SSTP using TLS worked Try to add config option mentioned above to vpnserverconfg server silently ignores it Hello I have installed SoftEther on DigitalOcean droplet by following this guide Droplet Ubuntu GB RAM SoftEther beta x Clients Windows x and Android If not connected to VPN my throughput is around Mbps When connected to VPN it is around Mbps I have tried both SSTP and SoftEther client DigitalOcean graphs shows that the CPU utilization has never reached above and Bandwidth utilization is kbps max RAM usage by vpnserver is less than My PC and phone are connected to ADSL mode I am not behind any firewall or NAT I have a paid VPN account too and the provider is using SoftEther as server When I connect to that there is no significant impact on throughput Please help User sometimes neednt to save the log especially in client the log in client sometimes have an issue of leak such as WHEN connected to a VPN WHAT the IP is and usually waste lots of storage space Could also encrypt the log AES only several person such as administration know the password could visit it and make a configuration to clear them easily Hello Especially for certificatebased VPN connections I think it would be useful to add as functionality the possibility to choose when creating these connections whether it is exportable or not Or an option checkbox at the Setting locker that would prevent the export of all connections would be also welcome Or another way to protect the unauthorized export of connections from SoftEther Client Kind regards Bogdan
