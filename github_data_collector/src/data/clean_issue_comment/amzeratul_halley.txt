This engine looks really promising just surprised theres so little documentation Is it just stored here for you to use or do you plan on writing that out OS Windows Compiler VS CMake version included with MSVC Boost SDL Freetype I dont think I have the Win SDK installed I get a bunch of errors like the following when compiling C Program Files x Windows Kits Include um combaseapih error C syntax error unexpected token identifier expected type specifier compiling source file H src halley src engine utils src support StackWalker StackWalkercpp H src halley build src engine utils halleyutilsvcxproj C Program Files x Windows Kits Include um wbemdisph error C default argument cannot convert from const wchart to BSTR compiling source file H src halley src engine utils src os oscpp H src halley build src engine utils halleyutilsvcxproj This looks to be a Windows bug when permissive is passed to the compiler The BSTR stuff mostly leads me to StackOverflow answers where people dont seem to be able to spot that the compiler is complaining about a default argument it looks like a similar issue though Fixed issue with asio on linux the callback forasyncreadsome never gets called on the client side I think it might be a problem with asio on linux Created work object to keep the service alive This caused an issue where DevConClient never hot reloaded resources cling based C as scripting language hot code reload Why Able to run C script in runtime or compile it for max speed as in example HOT code reload possible approaches store app state fix cling undo for files execute cling code to change callbacks variables nested clingInterpreter with multiple clingMetaProcessor IDK how to do it but you can create child clingInterpreter This is really hard to see with the default number of entities but halleytestentity example renders the whole spritesheet instead of an animation Here is a screenshot with a single entity Screenshot Tested on current master archlinux GCC CMake boost freetype SDL Hey I did cmake then make to compile Halley but with the make command I have Importing ubuntubttf and it takes a very long time Im using Arch Linux This should fix a small bug in the family code namely one that occurs whenever the following is given A family contains or more entities or more of those entities are deleted and added in the same frame This bug then lead to only one of the entities to be properly updated The steps within the code that lead to this problem are as following toRemove entities old old new new During the first iteration it picks entities old and finds it in toRemove deletes it from there and swaps it with entities new leading to the following situation toRemove entities new old new old During the second iteration it picks entities new and finds it in toRemove deletes it from there and swaps it with entities new leading to the final situation toRemove entities new old new old Which then leads to new and old to be deleted This change buffers the swaps in a vector before executing them all at once ensuring that the swaps already executed dont change the result of later forward scans through entities Im useing Window VS successfully compile halleytemplate example But while run the appIt says Unhandled exception Unable to load resource halleytemplateassetsgamedat I checked folder there is no gamedat file thereso what should I do to run a success example Been going through the code and noticed if you run halleyeditor without a path it does void EditorRootStagecreateLoadProjectUI The editor runs fine but Im not seeing any of the ui thats in the config file and the console outputs Starting main loop Input buttons binding not found list N Halley Vector DIfEE not found in UI style buttonlabelBorder Am I doing something wrong
