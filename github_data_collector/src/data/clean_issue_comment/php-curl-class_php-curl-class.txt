able to get the downloaded data so for example if I want to get only the first bytes of a remote file I will be able to get them in a new variablefield ie curldownloadeddata or we can still get it on curlresponse What is the actual behavior Actually when the downloaded bytes reach the setMaxFileSize limit we get error Curl Curl Object curl Resource id id dc f dab a error errorCode errorMessage

just get error now I try to fetch a json data from a url but it always return the http code at first and then it will go to the url automatically to get the real data the http code is at this time

a decoded name expect the return value to be decoded getCookies expect decoded namesvalues responseCookies public property expect decoded namesvalues What is the actual behavior must pass an encoded name to getCookie and it returns a rawencoded value What steps will reproduce the problem response headers include SetCookie dingusfoo Bbar path SetCookie a Bbfoo Bbar path Code php curlgetCookiedingus returns foo Bbar I would expect foobar curlgetCookieab returns null I would expect foobar curlgetCookiea Bb returns foo Bbar ugh likewise I would expect getCookies and public responseCookies property to return array of decoded keysvalues feature or bug The expectedException annotations will be removed in PHPUnit Replace with expectException expectExceptionCode expectExceptionMessage or expectExceptionMessageRegExp instead Warning messages CurlTest CurlTesttestJsonEncode The expectedException expectedExceptionCode expectedExceptionMessage and expectedExceptionMessageRegExp annotations are deprecated They will be removed in PHPUnit Refactor your test to use expectException expectExceptionCode expectExceptionMessage or

badge i dont know if releases are automated at least i dont see that in travis i would like to propose using please for managing release which automatically does all the things with just one simple command disclaimer i authored please
