Searching the forum I found a comment about an issue that refers to the difference of bytes in Fully loaded Bytes In and Content Breakdown summary I have setup my private Instance of Webpage Test and I have the same problem Can somebody give me an explanation or solution to this issue I would greatly appreciate your help Laura Couple of questions on this Is the cache time accurate For example this run shows a cache time of minutes when actually they are served with cache headers of hours What is the grade based on Dont like that big red F and while I dont expect a big green A for a hour cache policy the F seems a big harsh Id reserve that for those that dont return cache headers or perhaps those that either explicitly return or both Thanks Barry Hi all since mi Dec tests complete correctly but randomly shows Error Code with some metrics reported as and others with values Heres an example It seems like SpeedIndex Start Render and Visually Complete Time metrics fail to compute while others may Any idea what is going on here Trying to setup a private instance of webpagetest It is mentioned that the Server AMI can automatically instantiate and terminate agents on EC There is an EC AMI available for the WebPageTest server that provides a lot of benefits No configuration required up and running in minutes Automatically starts and stops EC test agents in all of the EC regions as needed Automatically updates to the latest server and agent code On this page though there is a list of agent AMIs Does it mean that there is a way to disable the auto instantiation behavior and setup an agent EC separately What benefits would it have Is there a separate server AMI for this use case or the same AMI has some configuration options to not let it control the agent instantiation and termination Dear pmeenan We have configured a Private instance in Redhat RHEL for WPT Server We have added and New Location agent WPTAgentwindows up and running We are stuck in Location not showing in WPT UI There is no error log in Nginx Initially location docroottmp files are created with the location name was created Next we are unable to find the way to troubleshoot Please provide some detail flow of instruction to troubleshoot this issue Thanks in advance Im testing with this script that adds a preconnect to imgixnet function var entries href var fragment documentcreateDocumentFragment forentry of entries var link documentcreateElementlink linkrel preconnect linkhref entryhref ifentryhasOwnPropertycrossOrigin linkcrossOrigin entrycrossOrigin fragmentappendChildlink documentheadappendChildfragment performancemarkwptinjectEnd Not essential For some runs the script seems to execute but for others it doesnt In this test it executed on the T in Dulles for every run runs were across multiple test agents On this EC Dublin test the script executes on some runs but not others Also doesnt appear to be tester related as run script didnt execute and run script executed were both on i b d d d be de In this London test script didnt execute at all but I have seen it work If I strip down the script it appears to run consistently performancemarkwptinjectEnd I know the script behaviour is a bit racey but any ideas what might have changed lately to make it less reliable I was recently trying out the weppagetest API and noticed when checking the result json that out of two URL parameters only one was passed So for example the URL I want to test looks like this And when using the webpagetest api like this var testurl ajax url dataType json But even when encoding the test URL in the result the second parameter always gets lost The result page shows as tested URL Is there any parameter restriction when using the api or does it need to be masked somehow Does anyone have an idea what went wrong Thanks in advance I am always confused by the page getTestersphpfhtml on our private instance connected to EC agents In fact most active agents in EC are missing in getTestersphp list After digging into this bug I discovered that the reason was the fact that most active agents were marked as offline and getTestersphp doesnt show offline agents I understand that offline means that the agent is an excess instance that will eventually go idle and terminate Could we change this page to see offline agents and add a column mentioning if the agent will be terminated Script Example with both absolute and rel URL block swjs navigate Expected result swjs to be blocked Actual result swjs is not blocked and triggered correctly Screenshot at Script
