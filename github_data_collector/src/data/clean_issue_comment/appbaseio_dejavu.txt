Describe the bug Dejavu uses doc as the type replacement for v However the search endpoint indextypesearch has been removed starting v which is used by Dejavu for exporting causing the export to break Dejavu Version Web latest To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Use ES Connect Dejavu with an index Export Data Expected behavior It should export data as it exists in the index or current view if selected by the user Recommendation If ES dont use the type path variable Search request should instead use the indexsearch pattern The Document Type dropdown shouldnt be shown starting v in the Export Data modal Screenshots Network tab output showing that zero results match when doc is used for the type Desktop please complete the following information NA Additional context Add any other context about the problem here Is there a way to look up a specific document by its id in the data explorer This could help me speed up manual edits of documents a lot quicker my documents are sorted by a unique text ID not randomly generated Even if I could search only the id column instead of globally it would really help narrow down potential document matches Is that possible instead Thanks again Dejavu is awesome and badly needed for the ES community Getting this error while importing the data into DejaVu UI Uncaught TypeError Cannot read property Text of undefined at tEsTypes appjsv at

a local development server without https I got a mixed content error in query explorer The regular data browser works Since I dont use any https locally I found out that this error came from and was wondering why its a remote url In the network requests I saw a horrible bunch of requests to remote requests to opensourceappbaseio and also others like stackpathbootstrapcdncom Because this js file got loaded from https its not possible to use my local host without https Thats a problem since I dont have any certificate I dont see any reason for this locally since self signed certificates causes extra work and trouble And fetching so much ressources over the internet from third party systems is also a privacy issue thats not expected from a onprem hosted software I use this with Docker on the same machine where Elasticsearch is hosted So please move those remote ressources locally for the on prem version This would fix both problems with privacysecurity and also mixed content issues because when they got remoted locally I dont have https enabled so firefox wouldnt expect https for the elasticsearch connection Workaround Disabling mixed content could be a workaround but its just a workaround Dejavu which itself seems pretty nice still relys on external ressources and expose me to them by those requests This ticket is for a reasonable long term solution I am trying to install dejavu locally i cloned it and when i try to run yarn i get the error error sourcemap The engine node is incompatible with this module Expected version Got error Found incompatible module the post request pass a wrong header to the server Basic xxxx the correct one is Basic xxxx my dejavu docker image is appbaseiodejavu latest fd e b Export CSV doesnt work export JSON downloads a text file with undefined I want to develop the Importer Data modulebut i cant find where is the sourcecodeAt present What I am seeing is the compiled js file located in the package directoryThank you very much I cloned the repo and changed to the cloned folder using dockercompose d I then created a new index called geostates using curl curl X PUT I was able to navigate to However when I upload a CSV file and set the server url and app name as shown in the screenshot However I have no way to proceed further since Configure data mappings is disabled and there are no buttons to proceed in the modal dialog How to resolve this situation Please help
