Worked on patternlabphp with standard edition for mustache by following steps in the command mentionedbut it escalate only errorsThe file is not installed correctlyi worked correctly on following steps I using PHP Version But it causes some files missing screen Curious if theres an agreed way to adding these into a project since theres a package for React Does anyone have tips or thoughts on what might be the best approach on integrating these sort of frameworkslibraries into a PL project Hi I want to be able to add a favicon along with all of the various touch icons etc to a pattern lab site Is there a way to reference these without editing the generalheadertwig file of the patternlab in the vendor folder Thanks in advance When I try composer install I get the following error PHP Fatal error Class PatternLab TwigNamespaces PatternLabListener not found Whenever i try to use Gulp with gulpfilejs in the project root to serve patternlab whose folder is placed at first level inside the project ie in project folder styleguide i manage to generate build the patterns but not to serve them gulp plserve Using gulpfile foldername gulpfilejs Starting plserve eventsjs throw er Unhandled

the expression for consecutive commands ie execcd styleguidephp coreconsole s withwatch with and without round brackets replacing s with server using the currently deprecated gulpshell extension instead of gulpexec changing styleguide with styleguide or styleguide build the project under Windows and Ubuntu Linux currently developing under the second one if I use the terminal to move inside styleguide folder and type php coreconsole s withwatch the site is generated and served on the local host and patternlab seems able to correctly detect changes in twig files This works instead and builds the site if called by typing gulp pl from the cmd line gulptaskpl function var options continueOnError false default false true means dont emit error event pipeStdout false default false true

something wrong I used PL both in node and php versions and now I cant get it to work from there It is not mandatory but it could be useful Any help would be appreciated Thanks in advance The documentation currently specifies typing php coreconsole serverto view patterns Would it be possible to include the additional options for specifying changing the host and port number Additionally it seems the socket created defaults to listening via ipV which doesnt work well for machines that have ipV enabled but no address configured and accessed from other computers on the LAN A workaround I found involves disabling ipV on the server and specifying the address so that the web server created listens on something other than just localhost and doesnt result in a connection refused error when trying to access from other computers on the network eg php coreconsole server withwatch host port I am using PatternLab PHP Twig I have a pattern that using some custom data specifically a dir attribute on the html tag to support righttoleft languages When I render that pattern directly it works a treat When I render that pattern as part of the builtin View All menu it it doesnt get the data I have tried two suggested inheritance plugin to no avail I also redid my RTL version as a psuedopattern also no luck Am I doing something wrong or is this just something PatternLab doesnt quite support yet If anyone has any other ways to demonstrate a pattern in both lefttoright and righttoleft that would help too Thank you Hello in the issues of this project I see a lot of questions how we deploy integrate the code in our cms years ago the answers say that PL is only for frontend devs and not for backend devs Now the things changed we are able to integrate it directly in a backend Mustache Twig Ive a Project based on laravel what is now the best practice integrating the template of a PL project Is it still the best to export the template via gulp as static resources and embedd then in our page Please note that laravel has the blade template engine by default Thanks looks super useful Id like to display CSSSCSS partials in my UI but theres no corresponding plugin for the PHP version Is there any existing way to do this on the PHP side of things or any easy way to integrate that existing plugin into a PHPbased project All of the instructions in documentation and across the internet say to set up the Gruntfile with command php labcorebuilderphp gp but this results in an error img width altscreen shot at pm src Unless Im missing something there is no builderphp file in this folder Perhaps its from an older version of PL At any rate changing builderphp to console which is a file in the folder works perfectly command php labcoreconsole gp
