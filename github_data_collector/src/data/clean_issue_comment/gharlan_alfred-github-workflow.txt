This workflow worked nicely in Alfred but with Alfred I cant login gh login show no option to log inn Pressing Update does nothing either Add in two additional workflows for handling Gitflow pull request types Makes it super easy to jump into creating a new pull request for merging dev into staging and production into master respectively The Workflow doesnt show me private repositories of my organisation I am contributing to Is this an expected behaviour or a bug It would be handy if you could initialize a new repository from Alfred Default settings public gitignore would be applied to the new repo Command could be like the following gh my new repo name Would you accept a pull request adding this feature of the time Im just opening my own repos or those of organizations Im apart of And while they do get bubbled to the top after a while itd be great if it wouldnt do the search across GH for any other matching repos This would make it faster and give me more confidence visually that Im selecting the right one the list would only be one or two items long and I wouldnt need to read it In the case that I do want to search globally adding an additional attribute seems easy enough such as gh g query for global search Id also be okay with this being a preference thing that you can choose to turn on or off You could keep it simple too and ignore the global search open such that if this preference option is turned on then you just couldnt do global searches Id be okay with that too Like I said of the time Im just quickly opening my own repos Thanks for your tool I love it Is it possible to copy the URL in the SSH format rather then HTTPS Many thanks I work on a large repo and from time to time I want to open a file by using Alfred Per the lines below As I understand the workflow will only add results to the screen after the whole tree has been scanned This is either taking ages or not working at all and will likely be a truncated response Could we perhaps have a way to disable that so that the repo gets scanned faster Something like gh einpraegsampowermail comparereleases would be nice which does link to GHserverUserOrOrgRepocompare expected gh userrepo clone eg gh clone should clone repo actual typing in gh clone and hitting enter seems to have no effect
