already be a solution or there may be a way to solve it that you hadnt considered Hi all though one of my issues might not be a bug i am hoping to find a solution here I am on SBA nonreactive server I have caches in my spring boot app I have two issues When on page insightsdetails where all the nice graphs are drawn there are also graphs for my caches Because of that the app gets literally overwhelmed with requests for current hitmiss numbers I see a huge cpu usage when on that details page Otherwise not Can i increase the interval those request are done All requests for cache size instancesactuatormetricscachesizetagname get a from SBA server as i can see in browser console Thanx alot Cheers JJ springboot RELEASE springbootadmin SNAPSHOT I try to add my own customview cc I
