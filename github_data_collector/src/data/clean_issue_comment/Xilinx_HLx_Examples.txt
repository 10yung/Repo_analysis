longer defines gmpconst As a workaround I removed libgmpdev so it does not shadow the version included in vivadohls See this link for more details Context I was trying to compile the source code of the Memcached part of this example into an executable that can run on CPU Yea I know this is a HLS example and the codes are supposed to be compiled into netlists and run on FPGA but we would like to do both of them and find out how much speedup the hardware version gives us over the software version Unfortunately the compilation failed due to multiple critical syntax errors So far I got stuck at the errors in responseFormattercpp Environment g on Ubuntu Errors The compilation failed due to multiple critical type errors Some of them can be easily fixable by correcting the spellingcasing the others can be much more complex For example in responseFormatter in responseFormattercpp the types of the two queues rfbin sel and rfascii sel lead to type errors mismatches at function calls in the following places responseFormatterresponseFormattercpp error invalid initialization of reference of type hlsstreamextendedAxiWord from expression of type hlsstreamioWord responseFormatterresponseFormattercpp error invalid initialization of reference of type hlsstreamextendedAxiWord from expression of type hlsstreamioWord asciiResponserfsel ascii rfascii sel I tried to fix it by changing the type of the arguments of the functions after playing with it for a while I found unfortunately any changes to these function arguments will involve other changes that are levels deeper in the call graph Questions Have this version of Memcached been compiled into a software executable or tested in similar manner What are the suggested ways to get the aforementioned errors fixed Since I anticipate there will be more similar errors I would like to request for suggestion about the best approach to get this version of Memcached compiled to a software executable Any help is much appreciated
