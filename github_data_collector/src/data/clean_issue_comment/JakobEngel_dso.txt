Recently I carefully reviewed your code and found the following code very confusing could you please explain why you accumulate E rather than EAlpha During the accumulation of energy from depth estimation you looped all points and just updated E in the loop and later on use the unchanged EAlpha to calculate alphaEnergy Hi Thanks for your contribution It works wonderful for our use case However I need to keep track only of trajectory for short distance around meter Instruction says to refer IOWrapperOutput DWrapperh and IOWrapperOutputWrapperSampleOutputWrapperh to get data we need However I havent figured it all out could you please share any insight on how i can get only trajectory information nothing else for short distance Thanks Madhu Greetings im trying to gather rotation in Euler angles by collecting quaternions from publishCamPose method and than converting it to Euler void publishCamPoseFrameShell frame CalibHessian HCalib override EigenQuaterniond

return asinstdsqrtstdpowx stdpowy stdpowz MPI But than plots shows some very strange angles Its not normal cause azimuth from gnss is ok and ive never tried to do a barrel roll gnss Need some hints what am i doing wrong Might it be because of z axis is depth NikolausDemmel AlexandrGraschenkov israelshirk JakobEngel Yelen how to make every frame as a keyframe and exclude all poses in resultstxt file Why is the saved D point coordinates so much noise that it is impossible to display the point cloud information completely in software such as meshlab JakobEngel NikolausDemmel AlexandrGraschenkov israelshirk Yelen I gave images as input to DSO algo and got only poses as output in text file I dont know why this algo missed the images poses so I am not sure these poses are of which images how to get the poses for every corresponding images same problem on TUM dataset and custom dataset Thanx in advance Regards JakobEngel error while type make j ib build directory error
