We should add more refactoring techniques So far we just have one best practice for pure Ruby Looking forward to see more best practices In Idiomatic Ruby Combine the first statement is extraneous hash not needed even misleading valuesinject do hash value hashmergevalue value end In older versions of ruby the hash var would collide with the block arg in modern ruby theyre scoped so the hash being injected is the arg to inject not the variable A more idiomatic version might be result valuesinject do hash value hashmergevalue value end It would also be useful to note that the use of merge with inject is a bit tricky and only works because merge returns the hash itself If the last expression in the block doesnt return the injected value the inject will fail in weird ways A less errorprone way to code it is to always return the injected value result valuesinject do hash value hash value value hash end or as a oneliner result valuesinject hash value hash value value hash The chapter on combining objects suggests that reduce and inject are different methods for different tasks As started here We should probably have categories for a bunch of tricks We may start using some categories such as Probably add a description in the file
