Hello peiyunh thank you for an amazing paper I want to know more about foveal descriptor in your paper Also it would be helpful for me if you can indicate the foveal descriptor part in your code Thanks Hi Im new to training a model and Im trying to train a using a resnet but realise that theres no model for resnet in cnninit Can I get help with this Thank you in advance And I face problem to train with alexnet too Is it because AlexNet is not using dagnn peiyunh Hi there im new to the whole computer vision scene and i was wondering if you or anyone else could help by releasing a step by step tutorial on how to train your model on other data sets it would be very helpful Thanks in advance thank you very much I try to train using my own dataset but i am confused about here my dataset is images and XML annotated result I do not know how to convert my dataset to the mat file can anyone tell me Very appreciate for your help The bounding ellipse linear regression is a powerful method to improve the ContROC result But I cant find the code in this project Do you mind sharing it Thinks peiyunh Hello analogously to other approaches which layer can be used to perform a face recognition params vector Thank you Hi I two questions about the code and paper The first one is the termtemplates used in the paper It seems to be some features extracted from a trained Resnet But in which part of the code this extraction is implemented The second one is that if I train a new networkeg Mobilenets how can I get the new templates Thanks for answering my questions Hi Peiyun My query is regarding certain parts of cnngetbatchhardminem which is hard to understand and thus hard to port to other frameworks In particular I am not sure what is happening in the section from line Similarly the transformation from line isnt well documented It would be immensely helpful if you could elaborate on what is going on in those sections Your working is very nice Do you have any plans to use tensorflow or caffe to implement this paper
