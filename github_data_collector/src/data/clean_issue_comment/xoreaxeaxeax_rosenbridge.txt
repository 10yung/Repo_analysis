link to whitepaper got from there last page reference is down fixes building utilcheckc in Arch Linux fix Using nopie for compiling the utils since the assembly isnt written position independent Newer GCC versions default to PIE so this should be set explicitly Signedoffby benaryorg binarybenaryorg I encountered the following error when tried to build the util usrbinld tmpccAKVV Do relocation RX S against data can not be used when making a shared object recompile with fPIC usrbinld final link failed Nonrepresentable section on output collect error ld returned exit status Details The solution is in the pull request It was pointed out on Hacker News that alternate instruction execution is a known feature of VIA C processors page I think this is the penultimate question on everyones minds right now Okay so sandsifter did the heavy lifting but that just firehoses random instructions at the CPU and looks for interesting results That sounds like it would generate a nontrivial amount of noise not so much so as to make the whole process overly tedious or simply unviable but enough that skill and experience would be paramount to figure out whats worth following up on and what can be safely discarded But sandsifter just deals in discovery and in this case to a very rudimentary extent sandsifter was designed to find oddness in x CPUs not entirely new processor architectures I am very interested to find out how you went from hmm thats weird to pinpointingestablishing the very existence of the coprocessor to identifying of its instructions and the x wrappings Also in the same way a fighter pilot might share how to start up and fly an F would you mind sharing how work on the assembler could be furthered by anyone with a VIA C whos interested in playing with this beyond going huh its vulnerable Please tell us that research papers andor indepth blog posts are in the pipeline And thanks too This is really awesome ME eat your heart out I get the error after this gcc democ o demo democ Error bound is not supported in bit mode I tested the backdoor and I can confirm that it doesnt work on VIA C CPU PS Sorry for the picture with my smartphone I cant install a screenrecorder because the space on the flash memory is limited I wonder if we can get FreeBSD and maybe other BSD too
