rate limit with some leeway to h Bursting is disabled for Twitter so its ms between requests detailssummaryHidden wrong detours in my thought processsummaryp Are all proper requests rate limited As you can see Timeliner is digging some considerable reply chains My first instinct was are replies counted against the quota or are only my own tweets counted Upon further digging rate limiter is implemented in httpRoundTripper level for a HTTP client so thats not the issue Nice approach BTW I might use that idea later in my own projects Upon making the ezhttp HTTP suggestion in my other PR I remembered theres a plain resp err httpGetmediaURL call in twittertwittergo that bypasses the rate limiting HTTP client That is used for fetching media and some or most media are fetched from which is Twitters domain are those counted against the quota Probably not because if the quotas are tied to the user or the app API key and requests for that domain would not count against API quotas Does the ratelimiter work properly I had a hard time using the ratelimiter standalone so I just plopped a fmtPrintf in the RoundTrip and watched the dots appear on the screen as Timeliner chugged along The dots were appearing calmly so the ratelimiter is working pdetails What I think is the problem twitterapigo use three API endpoints Endpoint User limit min App limit min usersshowjson statusesshowjson statusesusertimelinejson Source for limits Timeliners ratelimit is shared across all of those endpoints Timeliner theoretically lets me do reqs min to statusesshowjson pushing it over the limit of Now I dont know for real what the ratios of the endpoint call rates are but if we were to avoid going over the limit with this current all endpoints have same rate limit design the limit should be recalculated based on the number Another thought is the correct even for usertimelinejson This depends on the authorization model if Timeliner a uses only the apps credentials to read public data and doesnt get authorization from the user b gets authorization from the user and operates on behalf of the user I dont remember seeing any authorization screen but that might be because I had an API key laying around which I had authorized way back A few quotes Rate limiting of the standard API is primarily on a peruser basis or more accurately described per user access token When using applicationonly authentication rate limits are determined globally for the entire application If a method allows for requests per rate limit window then it allows you to make requests per window on behalf of your application This limit is considered completely separately from peruser limits Source If I understand correctly Timeliner is not using When using applicationonly authentication so shouldnt the limit be based on the anyway Im not sure of this WDYT Workaround This is not a serious issue since after throttling I can wait a while and continue later Code suggestions I dont know if youre interested in code suggestions but a couple came to mind while kicking the tires I came across timelinerFakeCloser just in case youre not aware theres a stdlib implementation for that ratelimitgo youre chucking empty structs struct on the token channel Usually when a channel is only used for signalling Ive seen interface used so one can just chuck nils down the channel Im not sure if its more performant but I think its more semantic This might be subjective though OS macOS latest GO go version go darwinamd I am getting this error Everything is done as per READMEmd ERROR googlephotosxxxxxxgmailcom Processing item graph processing node of item graph downloading data file syncing file sync timelinerrepodata googlephotosIMG JPG operation not supported itemid Another error ERROR googlephotosxxxxxxgmailcom Processing item graph processing node of item graph storing item in database disk IO error itemidXXXXXXX Hi all Just came across this project In the wiki it mentions that location data is stripped when using the Google Photos API I am currently using rclone to pull and backup my Google Photos account to my personal server through Google Drive All of my media pulled using rclone retains the GPS data latlonalt Two thoughts I would rather use my own script or some other program to sync my Google Photos account Would it be easy for timeliner to import from a local folder I am not familiar with the Google Photos API but location data is pretty important especially if you dont have Location History It seems alternative methods to import photos with the location data would be of high importance Type Should it have a web interface or a desktop one Maybe both Possibly add an API to make it easier to create different types of interfaces Should it be available from other devices For example through the web or a phone app Should import be available through the interface and if you have external interfaces phone web etc should you be able to import it from there I think an API and a local only interface for import Import and other modification shouldnt be available on other devices unless password protection is added Design for a graphical interface A timeline sounds like a good idea based of name Should you be able to sort it by type video audio image place etc Separate more detailed views for each month while only providing a overview on the timeline I think a timeline with general month views and then a more detailed monthly view would be good since its supposed to be a long term collection then a general yearly view might be good too Any more suggestions Possible data source in the future I get the following error message and timeliner consistently doesnt download all pictures ERROR googlephotosxxxxxx Processing item graph processing node of item graph assembling item for storage getting item metadata parsing width as int strconvAtoi parsing invalid syntax width Test data and db with all available features used images videos posts relationships etc would be useful for development of an interface as it would allow for development of features even if you dont have your own data with all features This template is specifically for requesting the addition of a new data source a way to add items to the timeline Please answer all the questions as completely as possible Put some effort into it since any implementation is going to require even more effort If questions are not answered sufficiently the issue may be closed PLEASE NOTE This project is a community effort We hope that after posting this issue you will take the time to implement it and submit a pull request for everyone to use What is the data source you want to add Facebook data exports Currently theres a date source for data from the API but a Timeliner user might have already closed their account leaving behind only their data How are items obtained from the data source Data must be manually imported It may be sourced from some or all of Facebooks different offerings Documentation is here a If authentication is required how does a user create or obtain credentials for Timeliner to access the data NA b If an API is available what are its rate limits NA c If a file is imported how is the file obtained Documentation here d If a file is imported how do we read the file Is the file a compressed archive How do we get the items out Is the content and metadata separate Please link to any documentation or provide a sample file Exports are a ZIP file containing a structure of folders JSON files and various media files The media files have their EXIF data but additional metadata from Facebook corresponding to each one is in the associated JSON file What constitutes an item from this data source An item is an entry on the timeline Some data sources have multiple things that are items for example photos blog posts or text messages can all be items An item must make sense to put on a timeline and items must have unique IDs It depends how much of the export is considered useful but photos posts milestones etc should all be considered How can items from this data source be related Often items form relationships with other items for example an item might be a reply to another item or an item might contain another item Think of relationships as uniorbidirectional arrows between items with a label on the arrow Relationships enrich the data obtained from this source What kinds of useful relationships can be expressed from this data source Do the relationships work both ways or just one way Talk about this This should be looked into more closely by someone who actually uses Facebook my memory for it isnt great as I type this What constitutes a collection from this data source A collection is a group of items like a photo album Note that collections are different from item relationships Some data sources dont have collections please explain Facebook has the concept of photo albums so theyd constitute a collection Other than that I doubt there are many others What might not be trivial obvious or straightforward when implementing this data source Most data sources have nuances or caveats some of which might not be obvious Please think hard about this and use your experience with this data source to think of things that need special consideration For example a data source might only allow the most recent items to be obtained how could we overcome that maybe via a data export See our wiki for Writing a Data Source to get ideas about what might be tricky Ask unanswered questions here start a discussion Data sources cant be implemented successfully until these details are figured out Im not sure how easy it would be to make the relationship between data from the JSON files and actual media files themselves clearer Bonus How do you like Timeliner How much data are you preserving with it Which existing data sources do you use I want to know I havent started using it yet but I figure a Facebook data export would serve as the foundation for my starting to use this on my VPS Im closing my Facebook account as I type this but itd be good to hang on to the backedup data in a way I might be able to browse in future Ive observed from the wiki that theres not yet support for loading from a full backup taken from Facebook whether HTML or JSON Id hope theres some support for this thanks
