I wanted to implement the regularizer modules available in Sonnet but this seems to be built on top of Tensorflow Does the current version of graphnets supports Sonnet thanks Mara Hi It would be great if Graphnet people can comment on the new Tensorflow NeuralStructuredLearning project Would be helpful for future direction decisions in our projects Thanks Hi I am training fasterrcnninceptionv coco I have the following configuration in conda env tensorflow python cuda I am training on HPC when I run modelmainpy I get the following error but training is still progressing but it is too slow Any suggestions on solving the issue are much welcome I tensorflowcorecommonruntimegpugpudevicecc Adding visible gpu devices I tensorflowcorecommonruntimegpugpudevicecc Device interconnect StreamExecutor

project If I wanted to learn a graph framework should I invest time to learn this or others like last commit was months ago The PR includes two fixes Update incorrect links to documentation for utilsnpdatadictstographstuple in the How to represent graphs as a graphsGraphsTuple section and the other for utilstfdatadictstographtuple in the Creating a constant tensor GraphsTuple from data dicts section of the notebook The final cell Block Compositionality calls the attribute graphnetworkvariables which throws an AttributeError and is replaced with the getvariables method Im not sure if the goal is to just print the name and shape of the tfVariables here but that is what it currently does after training model with Networkx geo random graphs now I want to test my model with real data I created a graph from that real data Now I dont know I must add solution feature and other features to my graph nodes or no because in shortest path example testing and training both use same method createfeeddict I removed a misleading index from the documentation in utilsnp utilstf and the doc itself The docstring now reflects what fields of the networkx graph are used to build the GraphsTuple structures I could also add a minimal example of creating a graph with networkx and converting it into a GraphsTuple just tell me where to add it This PR proposes the addition of Dockerfiles to create an option for consistent demo and dev builds Reduce the risk of users mixing up dependencies and provide access to Graph Nets demos with a single command Ex Running demos image with default Dockerfile CMD as below will run Jupyter on port with notebookdir pointed at an ephemeral demos directory bash Run demos image GPU docker run runtimenvidia u id uid g p it imburbankgraphnetslatestgpudemos Paste Jupyter serving address from console into browser and get started Images use the official Tensorflow CPU and GPU images Tensorflow Docker Hub as a base and add Graph Nets dependencies I currently have four images hosted on Docker Hub Graph Nets Docker Hub CPU image available as imburbankgraphnets GPU image available as imburbankgraphnetslatestgpu CPUdemo image available as imburbankgraphnetslatestdemos GPUdemo image available as imburbankgraphnetslatestgpudemos I also believe that these Docker Hub images would be more appropriately hosted under your deepmind or graphnets Docker Hub username I could update the readme instructions to pull from for example deepmindgraphnetslatestgpu The current Docker Hub Automated Build Settings are pretty simple Heres a screenshot that covers the bulk of it graphnetsdockerhubbuildsettings I would of course be happy to assist with any image hosting setup Please see dockerfilesREADMEmd for additional use details
