The RAC x ObjectiveC APIs have been moved to their own repo so that the main ReactiveCocoa repo can focus on Cocoa bindings We should update our DSL subspec to point to the new repo After installing pods i am getting following compilation error In file included from TestProjectPodsARAnalyticsProvidersFirebaseProviderm TestProjectPodsHeadersPrivateFirebaseFirebaseh fatal error FirebaseAnalyticsFirebaseAnalyticsh file not found import FirebaseAnalyticsFirebaseAnalyticsh My podfile looks like this platform ios target TestProject do source useframeworks pod ARAnalyticsFirebase end After installing cocoapods ends with warning AppsFlyerSDK has been deprecated in favor of AppsFlyerFramework Currently it seems that localizedFailureReason localizedDescription localizedRecoverySuggestion and localizedRecoveryOptions are being logged Curiously error domain and error code arent logged Often this is the most pertinent information Case in point I have some logged errors which only contains the description The operation couldnt be completed and no other information This makes them hard to track I had my own category for ARAnalytics to extend it for my project but was limited by not having access to superProperties since sharedInstance is not exposed either For now Im using this fork in my Podfile but thought this could go in the main project

with Cocopods but after configuring it with ARAnalytics setupWithAnalytics ARHockeyAppBetaID appKeyHere if I log the current list of providers its empty It didnt add the provider Any idea of what is going on here Thanks in advance I havent dug into this fully yet wondering if anyone here has come across this When using both NewRelic and screen tracking via DSL the app crashes when the first

uncaught exception of type NSException lldb Note Im installing NewRelic via its own pod rather than via subspec because I run into a dynamic frameworks compatible issue Is there any other info I can give Thanks Would be great to have support for the aspectoriented DSL style tracking in Swift I can get tracked screens and some events to come through but for events some selectors dont seem to work and cant figure out how to properly type the Properties callback The following is working for me for now let trackedEvents ARAnalyticsClass AccountEditVCself ARAnalyticsDetails ARAnalyticsEventName Account Edit Save Button ARAnalyticsSelectorName saveChangesBtnTapped let trackedScreens ARAnalyticsClass FeaturesVCself ARAnalyticsDetails ARAnalyticsPageName Slideshow Cant figure out how to do properties though And sometimes selectors that arent IBOutlets are never called
