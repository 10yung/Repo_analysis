Adds description parameters and return values for the requested functions in This module has a few module functions well want to document GitReflowConfigadd GitReflowConfigget GitReflowConfigset GitReflowConfigunset For details on what all needs documented see the inchci suggestions for each method There are times when a legacy user of gitreflow goes to rerun setup only to find themselves with blank configurations Since we are only validating presence of the githuboauthtoken theres an edgecase where the user could have only the oauthtoken configuration with missing user This causes some authentication failures and a bad userexperience This ensures that the user is asked for all required information that the information is fully persisted to gitconfig and gracefully handles authentication errors from GitHub in a more userfriendly way Oh and more tests Fixes This should add a new Workflow to our current list of custom Workflows See our wiki on Custom Workflows for more details on how to implement Ideally anyone could add Pivotal Tracker support to their workflow by just adding use PivotalTracker at the top of their Workflow file Adds documentation for how to contribute to gitreflow Resolves This should add a new Workflow to our current list of custom Workflows See our wiki on Custom Workflows for more details on how to implement Ideally anyone could add Trello support to their workflow by just adding use Trello at the top of their Workflow file Im having issues with GitHub authentication Whenever I run a reflow command it fails and gives the message below If I delete the token from my GitHub account it works one time but then will come with the same error the next time Using two step authentication with GitHub so not sure if that has anything to do with it Any ideas Thanks Using Ubuntu with reflow version reillyreillyDocumentsGitHubcampuskudosapi git reflow status Please enter your GitHub username reillydavis Please enter your GitHub password we do NOT store this Please enter your twofactor authentication code error You have previously setup gitreflow on this machine but we can no longer find the stored token notice Please visit and delete the token for gitreflow reilly error We were unable to authenticate with Github Consider adding git aliases to the setup command Maybe setup subcommand git reflow setup aliases that could just add them to the users config file automatically See for prior discussion As embarrassing as it may sound This repo is the first time I got to hear about LGTM reviews But the point is I am always trying to improve on things like my workflows Which is why I am requesting a WIKI document that explains how does your workflow work Nothing too complex just one example where you would use Git Reflow and show us how it will work with LGTM in an explicit example It will help a lot Considering using something like Docbase or if just the standard GH wiki would work
