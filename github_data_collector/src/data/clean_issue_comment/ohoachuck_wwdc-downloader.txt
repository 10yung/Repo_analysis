I downloaded every WWDC videos to an external HDD before abandoning unlimited high speed internet Ive only checked the keynote while downloading and it looked perfect However now that Im trying to watch any other video Im noticing that there is no audio at all Not even in the mp part files Do you happen to have any idea why that is Environment sh xcodeselect v xcodeselect version swiftc version Apple Swift version swiftlang clang Target x appledarwin Ive had the same crashif I remember correctly as so I first compiled the script with swiftc sh swiftc o wwdcDownloader wwdcDownloaderswift After that this was the command I used while the pwd was my external HDD sh pathtocompiledscriptwwdcDownloader hd pdf sample Any help is greatly appreciated Can we use it to download subtitles OK so for some reason when I run the downloader script wwdcDownloaderswift it tries to download the WWDC Keynote video which then fails presumably because it isnt available But I cant figure out why its trying to do this For extra strange points I popped the code into an Xcode command line project and it works fine downloads them to whatever DerivedData directory the thing outputs to I notice when it fails from the command line its trying to download a p keynote video but in Xcode its just downloading p everything In Xcode where it succeeds Downloading HD videos in current directory Let me ask Apple about currently available sessions This can take some times to sec Session Keynote Video Video is not yet available On the command line where it fails Downloading p videos in current directory Let me ask Apple about currently available sessions This can take some times to sec Session Keynote Video pkeynotemp Session Getting pkeynotemp Stack dump Program arguments

script works for folks so Im not sure what Im doing wrong Consider to add HomeBrew integration in order to make it easy to install Add ability to get URL of content only Fix narrative when nonvideo content is downloaded as it bugged me Im trying to compile and run wwdc swift on OSX Apple Swift version swiftlang clang Target x applemacosx The code fails to compile errorstxt I think theres been some changes to the session pages I had to adjust the regex for it to detect any sessions from let pat b videos play wwdc h b to let pat b videos play wwdc Not sure if the regex could be better First thanks for the years of providing this tool Its been very handy I commend you diving in to use Swift and Cocoa for this years iteration An unfortunate consuquence I guess of the way that NSURLSession works is when you run the tool on an external volume the process is slowed down by the fact that NSURLSession downloads the file first to a temporary folder on the boot volume and then the script copies the download to the destination folder With each video comprising multiple GB of data this causes a several minute delay on my Mac between the download of a video and the beginning of downloading the next one It sure seems like an oversight that NSURLSession doesnt support specifying a volume on which the temporary download file should be saved I dont really expect a fix just wanted to share my observation here in case somebody thinks of a clevereasy solution I think that the right fix might unfortunately be moving away from NSURLSessions default downloader task Now that Xcode Swift have been released I want to download all the WWDC Content but the wwdc swift script doesnt work with Swift and the Grand Renaming I know all the serious developers downloaded this content a long time ago but Im a NOOB with Swift so it would really help to have access to all the WWDC content Thanks Russell Examples of errors output when I run the script wwdc swift error
