Bug Sometimes the main window loses focus which causes it to scroll when the spacebar is hit even in insert mode Really annoying because you hit the spacebar a lot when typing a sentence How to reproduce Start with more bullets than can be displayed in the main window so that scrolling is enabled Scroll to the middle of the page such that the scroll bar indicates there is room to scroll up and down Create a new bullet with a few words Go to the beginning of any word in the new bullet and do the motion c e to delete to end of word and go to insert mode Type another word and go back to command mode Press spacebar This should cause scrolling Expected behavior When pressing spacebar in step above no scroll occurs I was using vimflowy through a local docker instance on Chrome Version Hi Great work with this cool tool but Im missing it on my phone I think this could be quite easily supported with the export to org file which app like orgzly can take What do you think guys First oflove this nice workplease dont stop working on it This has potential for folks who are security conscious I am a CISSP and work with sensitive data and for regulatory or other reasons cannot store certain things in workflowy or other online note tools running this in docker on a laptopvery fast and niceAlso I have been a heavy spacemacs org user so many of these keybinding are naturalnice secondly I have a simple text block question I know that you can Shiftenter text under a bullet to add notes in a similar way to workflowy But how about a code block or just pasting text It seems when pasting it just makes a bunch of blocks and does not keep the text inside the block but makes several siblings essentially with each line I presume its related to line breaks and may be something simple but so far I have not found a quick way to preserve a text block under a bullet admittedly I am still new and exploring Any tips appreciated I like to keep my KB if possible in one source for quick search Hello again Im trying to use a zapier integration to add new items under my inbox bullet every time a google spreadsheet row is added This as a round about way of implementing gtd capture IFTTT for add to my inbox to google assistant puts into a google spreadsheet Zapier notices the new row and pulls and creates a new bullet under inbox Thats the idea anyways I cant really get it to work Where I am stuck is Zapier wants a path The example they give is foobarhere Ive done my best googling and tried to find somewhere to lookup on the firebase website what the file path could be No luck Is there a way to pull the file path from the firebase website Im at a loss here If I can figure this out Vimflowy gains a huge amount of power though D Running docker image behind apache server I get the error Socket connection closed Error Socket connection closed at WebSocketwsonclose running the docker on port and then doing a proxypass and proxypassreverse etc using following ProxyPreserveHost On ProxyPass ProxyPassReverse ProxyPass websocket wslocalhost websocket ProxyPass websocket wsslocalhost websocket I have tried variations to above configuration by commenting line and or removing websocket in end of and but no joy I am certain it is the Apache config that is causing this issue but I dont know how what do i need to change I have to use Apache and cannot use Caddy as shown in the example see Error Socket connection closed Error Socket connection closed at WebSocketwsonclose Features Create a node anywhere with GTD text in it and started adding your gtd tags next today soon Adding tags like today next soon gets automatically cloned in GTD node with their topics on calling the trigger keyboard shortcut default ctrlt Demo Hi Thank all the contributors for the great project its awesome Im using system default input method in win and found I could input Chinese characters normally but got nothing when I trying to input any punctuation in Chinese input mode I hit keys like or and nothing happened It means I have to switch to English mode enter English punctuation and switch back to Chinese mode to continue and I just cant input any Chinese punctuation I tried Japanese input method it failed as well Its ok to copy paste Chinese punctuation from outside Any suggestions Thanks Set up Vimflowy docker image e b eb f SQlite storage backend I host my own vimflowy server with the SQlite backend When I transition from being online to offline vimflowy encounters an error Socket connection closed gtprototypeinitthiswsonclose Which makes sense the websocket connection to the server is closed Whatd be great is if Vimflowy transitions to local storage and then sync changes when it comes back online The more general case of conflict resolution of multiple edits using something like operational transforms or CRDTs is probably out of scope and overkill a simple latest edit wins might be sufficient to implement the desired functionality PS cheers for Vimflowy its an awesome project merging two things I love
