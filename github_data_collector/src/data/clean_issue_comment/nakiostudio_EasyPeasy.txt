For some reason activateConstraints and deactivateConstraints might contain same constraints That requires further investigation but deactivating after activating solves the consequences of the issue in my case Bumps excon from to details summaryChangelogsummary Sourced from excons changelog fix for leftover data with interrupted persistent connections Update bundled certificates Fix mistake in proxy connection error handling Raise better proxy connection errors details details summaryCommitssummary d v ccb d fix for leftover data with interrupted persistent connections f de cf v f a v e bbb Merge pull request from jasquatfixresponsestatuscheck fixed response status check when making a request with a valid proxy is set f v c define ProxyConnectionError f a raise on failed proxy connect d ed fe be thorough in unsubscribing to notifications in instrumentation tests Additional commits viewable in compare view details br Dependabot compatibility score Dependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you dont alter it yourself You can also trigger a rebase manually by commenting dependabot rebase dependabotautomergestart dependabotautomergeend details summaryDependabot commands and optionssummary br You can trigger Dependabot actions by commenting on this PR dependabot rebase will rebase this PR dependabot recreate will recreate this PR overwriting any edits that have been made to it dependabot merge will merge this PR after your CI passes on it dependabot squash and merge will squash and merge this PR after your CI passes on it dependabot cancel merge will cancel a previously requested merge and block automerging dependabot reopen will reopen this PR if it is closed dependabot ignore this patchminormajor version will close this PR and stop Dependabot creating any more for this minormajor version unless you reopen the PR or upgrade to it yourself dependabot ignore this dependency will close this PR and stop Dependabot creating any more for this dependency unless you reopen the PR or upgrade to it yourself dependabot use these labels will set the current labels as the default for future PRs for this repo and language dependabot use these reviewers will set the current reviewers as the default for future PRs for this repo and language dependabot use these assignees will set the current assignees as the default for future PRs for this repo and language dependabot use this milestone will set the current milestone as the default for future PRs for this repo and language You can disable automated security fix PRs for this repo from the Security Alerts page details It would be really nice to have a Swift Package Manager version of EasyPeasy Trying to start some projects without Cocoapods and cant live without EasyPeasy anymore haha vieweasylayout Top Left Right Bottom its just we can define layout without Sometimes I want to add constraints edges of a view to other edges of a view But now Edges only allows adding constraints to its superview I tried to use EasyPeasy to add percentage margins but EasyPeasy treats it as a constant not multiplier subvieweasylayout Top toguide top Left incorrectly set the left margin to be pixel Right Height likesuperview correctly set the height to be of superview What is the correct syntax to apply multipliers to margins Weve found an issue in one of the project that is using EasyPeasy When you create a constraint using operator eg Width it would set not just the multiplier to but also the constant As a workaround were currently always explicitly providing a constant Width I think it will be better if EasyPeasy has methodchain API let view UIView view easy bottom top But I cant think all of the cases Can we add that API Carthage version xcodebuild version Xcode Are you using nobuild No Are you using nousebinaries Yes Are you using usesubmodules No Are you using cachebuilds Yes Cartfile contains github nakiostudioEasyPeasy Skipped building EasyPeasy due to the error Dependency EasyPeasy has no shared framework schemes for any of the platforms Mac Feature request I sometimes wish there was a way to drop one of the constraints of an element Like for example I have a dynamic screen where the last elements Bottom constraint is always set to scrollViews Bottom When I add more elements to it I wish to remove the Bottom constraint of current last element so I can set the newer elements Bottom to scrollView Hope this makes sense
