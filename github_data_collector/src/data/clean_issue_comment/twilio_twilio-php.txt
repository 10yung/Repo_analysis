documentation says we should use string array as permission argument Create a Role resource php role twiliochatv servicesISXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX roles createfriendlyname friendlyName channel type arraypermission permission But in the code we have string param annotation calling is working can you please tell me how can i enable the Emergency call in php PHP version is at end of life and on December only PHP versions will be officially supported by the PHP community On January Twilio will no longer support PHP version via this helper library In order by Twig to correctly use dynamic object properties the magic method isset must be defined on the class Example Given a Twilio Rest Api V Account AvailablePhoneNumberCountry LocalInstance to a Twig template localInstancefriendlyName This will not work unless the following is added to LocalInstance public function issetname return arraykeyexistsname thisproperties We am using both SMS and Voice call features both are working fine but now we are in a situation to support multi countries We know that go to this url and allow what counties should have access but is there any way that I can pull permitted counties list from API to list in UI I am not worried about giving permission from API but I want at least fetch the permittedallowed by my accountcompany countries list for both SMS and Voice so that I can make a dropdown in my View Which means I should never hit these codes The variable buffer is not defined in this scope To me this looks like a refactoring gone wrong It is used but never freed in public function options Hello I am facing problem for send invitation for join room for Video Call I am creating createLocalTrack for waiting Joining room But i need for send invitation
