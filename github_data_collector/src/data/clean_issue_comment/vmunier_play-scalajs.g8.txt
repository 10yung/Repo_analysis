Hi would it be possible to update this template to recent versions of play scala an sbt When I try installing the project from the command line by typing sbt new vmunierplayscalajsg I get following error error javaioIOException Unable to delete file D Users xxxx AppData Local Temp giter src main g gitignore I have confirmed the file exists and my user account has full access rights to it I was able to delete it from the explorer without any issues The project seems to be create fine This is on Windows x pro I have git command line and TortoiseGit installed on my machine I define a new Xyz controller and add some actions such as all create update save and so on The GET route and samples is work However when I try add an POST action and add form in the views the compiler does not recognize routesXyzControllersave helperformaction routesXyzControllersave It show error value XyzController is not a member of object controllersroutes Can you advise the solution Thanks To reproduce Download the project mv clientsrcmainscalaexampleScalaJSExamplescala client This is totally valid in sbt rm r clientsrc sbt run Open localhost Looks good right FastOpJS runs fine Modify the message in clientsrc Reload the page Expected behavior It should recompile the Scalajs code and show the new message Actual behavior It shows the old message and doesnt bother to recompile Is it possible to include static assets namely images served from Play and referenced from Scalajs code Tricky because when for example using sbtdigest to fingerprint assets the final asset name isnt known Soliciting ideas or guidance here since reverse Assets routes and AssetsFinder cant be used and little on this topic turned up in my searches Reposted from ochronsscalajsspatutorial to gather a larger audience That would be great if this sample project had a few integration tests That way it will be easier for people adopting Scalajs Play SBT combo There are some caveats I believe because the way sbtweb works But it would be nice to mention the best workaround here
