AWESOME tool just doesnt work with the PageLines DMS theme which I use Its free at or at Thanks Ive been using the bookmarklet for a while but today when I tried it out it wasnt working properly It turns out that some of the CSS on the site specifically a height and width set on anchor tags was bleeding on to the bookmarklet styles Perhaps the CSS for the bookmarklet should setreset some more properties The select box is way too long Use or or something
