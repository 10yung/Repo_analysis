receive only lockfile updates if desired Security updates receive only security updates if desired details WIP WIP Since we frequently use Bootstrapesque rowscolumns for content we frequently see styling bugs that result when one rows height exceeds nearby rows pushing content further down the page than wed like We actually have CSS in several places specifically setting heights to prevent this from happening Itd probably be better to use something like Masonry or masonryrails to do this naturally This will prevent the bugs were already seeing while also allowing us to have content of varying heights in grids Expected behavior A user should be able to complete all the linking fields theyd like and have their page save how they expect Actual behavior If a user completes more than linking field per page save the links duplicate on each field Steps to reproduce the behavior Edit a character Link Alice as a Mother and Bob as a Father View that character Alice will be listed twice under Mothers and Bob will be listed twice under Fathers Expected behavior Reordering fieldscategories should always work If fieldscategories dont have an internal sortorder value they should initialize a sort order and then perform the sort Actual behavior It seems that if a user creates a custom fieldcategory and then sorts it it applies a sortorder value but doesnt always initialize the values for the other fieldscategories its sorting again Not sure if this is all the time or if it only gets into this bad state in some cases The issue can be fixed by reordering any other fieldcategory which initializes sort order for all other fields We should be initializing sort order for all categoriesfields upon creation of those objects so this never happens
