 intersperse is a function with two parameters an array and a separator that would be inserted between the elements ramda version I think that its a very useful function I needed this in my work and I thought I would found it in Lodash I didnt but I saw that Im not the only one who thinks like that I found a very popular issue about this function This PR add support to ArrayBuffer and SharedArrayBuffer instances and avoid unexpected behaviour to isEmpty and size methods Added new test cases This PR was create based on issue It flattens the paths and uses hasPathIn to support nested deep paths This fixes all tests As a side note i suggest to not support nested path in pick making it smaller This feature still could be achieved with pickBy Add tests for newly added hasPath and hasPathIn Removes tests for deep path for has and hasIn Removes sparseString variable since this line delete sparseString fails in modern node Two tests for has hasIn still fails should return true for indexes of sparse values should coerce path to a string Seems that those features were removed purposedly Should i remove those tests HTML entities may have leading zeros so in this case both refer to the same character We noticed this while fixing this issue I ran into trouble building and running tests locally so Im happy to follow up if there are more detailed instructions elsewhere for running this locally Testing Instructions Verify that tests still pass No other regressions Seems IsEqual function was removed accidentally Those functions are not present in current code base and does not make sense at all in a modularized package Adjust tests accordingly so it can run Enable tests that check for the correct behavior
