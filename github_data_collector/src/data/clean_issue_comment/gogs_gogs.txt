email collisions when updating the entire user information not when the username is being changed Changing a users email address through usersettings to an email address thats already taken shows an internal server error instead of the appropriate error message The ErrEmailAlreadyUsed error type was incorrectly checked for during the username update in the same function when it is impossible for that error to occur This PR performs the check after the dbUpdateUser call which can return the email already used error and renders the error message on the form accordingly instead of failing with an internal server error Fixes First of all please read If you dont want to read its up to you But dont waste your time continue reporting The issue will be closed without any explanation if it does not satisfy any of following requirements Please speak English we have forum in Please post any questions configuration or deploy problems on our forum Please do not end your title with a question mark or period Please take a moment to search and make sure the issue doesnt already exist Please give all relevant information below for bug reports incomplete details are considered invalid report Describe the bug When changing email address in usersettings if the new email already exists for another user an error page is displayed instead of the proper error message Gogs version or commit b b bbd dcbb adf b fea Git version git version git version Operating system Alpine in Docker on Arch Linux Database sqlite To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Go to Change Email address to one thats already taken Click Update Profile See error page Can you reproduce the bug at Yes See repro instructions above Expected behavior The message Email address has already been used should appear above the form in a red box Actual behavior internal server error page Additional context The email conflict error is incorrectly checked during the username change dbChangeUserName instead of when

Expected behavior Regardless of what attributes I want gogs to check on for authentication if the user already exists should check Username Attribute andor email and the associated User Filter is
