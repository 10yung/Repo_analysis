Given the conversion matrix it would be nice to have a feature within the kompose utility to be able to validate a dockercompose file to see what attributes defined in that yaml will be converted versus which attributes will not be supported As an example if a dockercompose file has the attribute securityopt defined the matrix says Kubernetes uses its own container naming scheme the command might be kompose validate f dockercomposeyaml And when it reaches the attribute securityopt it might error with FAIL the option securityopt is not supported additional metadata here potentially The use case for this is using kompose within a GitOps pipeline we are taking users compose files and converting them on their behalf so they dont need to know kubernetes however there currently is no way to easily relay to them what is a supported element within the compose file If we had the ability to validate the compose file with kompose we could potentially write our own wrapper around the output of the kompose validate command to be able to tell the user Hey you used securityopt which is something we dont support Thoughts and discussion are welcome surrounding this and if I can help in anyway please let me know I am mainly a Python user but know some Golang Thanks This is generating apiVersion extensionsv beta kind Deployment This Deployment version was deprecated and no longer works in recent versions of k s eg Now you have to specify apiVersion appsv and modify slightly the template labelSelector field needed when convert kompose convert f dockercomposeyaml it is error FATA Version of Docker Compose is not supported Please use version or The follow is my yaml file version services registry environment CONFIGSERVICEPASSWORD CONFIGSERVICEPASSWORD image librarysqshqpiggymetricsregistry restart always dependson config condition servicehealthy ports logging options maxsize m maxfile thanks for your answer Hello I am seeing files being created for a single docker run command in my file for example the first set called reverseproxy shown created files the next webapp created more files My question is how do I start a pod with all my images running in it version networks app driver overlay services reverseproxy image ngnixlatest healthcheck test service nginx status grep running exit interval s retries startperiod s timeout s ports volumes reverseproxynginxconfetcnginxnginxconf networks app webapp image somewebapplatest healthcheck test curl fail s k exit interval s retries startperiod s timeout s ports networks app so on reverseproxyclaim persistentvolumeclaimyaml reverseproxydeploymentyaml reverseproxyserviceyaml Latest build of kompose This is for an Openshift cluster Hi first time ever creating an github issue on public forum Please be forgiving I am trying to convert dockercomposeyml to openshift yml configuration files When I specified port and label komposeserviceexposetrue the route that is being created has a target port as an integer The openshift complains about not seeing the port exposed on the service When I manually change the port on openshift route configuration to string the route finds the port on the service It would be super awesome if we could have this port to be transformed into a string I attached pictures showing some of my configuration Screen Shot at PM Screen Shot at PM Screen Shot at PM Hi is there a way to specify init containers for pods in dockercomposeyml I want to upgrade k s vendor to a newer version I change githubcomopenshiftorigin version from v rc to v then run glide update stripvendor Therere many errors message ERROR Error looking for k sioapiappsv beta Unable to get repository Cloning into rootglidecachesrcgitgithubcomopenshiftkubernetesapi ERROR Error scanning k sioapiautoscalingv cannot find package in rootglidecachesrcgitgithubcomopenshiftkubernetesapiautoscalingv ERROR Error scanning k sioapibatchv cannot find package in rootglidecachesrcgitgithubcomopenshiftkubernetesapibatchv ERROR Error scanning k sioapibatchv beta cannot find package in rootglidecachesrcgitgithubcomopenshiftkubernetesapibatchv beta ERROR Error scanning k sioapibatchv alpha cannot find package in rootglidecachesrcgitgithubcomopenshiftkubernetesapibatchv alpha ERROR Error scanning k sioapicorev cannot find package in rootglidecachesrcgitgithubcomopenshiftkubernetesapicorev So I cant upgrade k s vendor to a newer version I find a issue when I clean all glide cache and vendor folder it always show above error message cdrage hangyan Do you have some suggestion about this Need help Bug Acknowledgement ITP Kompose conversion tool for all things compose namely Docker Compose to container ochestrators Kubernetes or Openshift For example importPolicy is added to each OpenShift output Within Kubernetes there are also other useless keys that are either null or Lets remove them
