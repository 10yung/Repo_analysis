maaa chudao Getting this when trying to Export AVD I use different groups for forward and reverse animations So I want to hide one of the groups Export and vice versa for the other one This worked a few days ago Same error in Chrome and Firefox bugsnagjsprebuildoptimizerjs ERROR TypeError Cannot read property name of undefined at AvdSerializerts at MapforEach anonymous at ModuleZT AvdSerializerts at texportAnimatedVectorDrawable fileexportservicets at eonExportAnimatedVectorDrawableClick layertimelinecomponentts at ObjecthandleEvent layertimelinecomponentngfactoryjsprebuildoptimizerjs at ObjecthandleEvent corejsprebuildoptimizerjs at ObjecthandleEvent corejsprebuildoptimizerjs at Ta corejsprebuildoptimizerjs at corejsprebuildoptimizerjs Starting from API it is possible to use PropertyValuesHolder and Keyframe in resource files to create more complex animations Using PropertyValuesHolders allows animators to animate several properties in parallel as shown in this sample Im trying to animate my friends logo and the shapeshifter beta editor cant handle the shape so its reshaping some of the curves and stuffing it up Is there any update on how to integrate in swiftobjc code This Readme says it can be used with iOS but I cant find a single source telling how to do that We could use a clarification in readme As we know to convert an object to clip path we can do it by clicking more options dots icon on the right side of the layer The issue is whenever I try to put animation to any layer the more options or the dot icon button disappears and Im unable to convert other objects to clip path Whenever I delete the animations on the timeline The Dot More Option Icon appears again Am I just missing something or is this a bug Thanks in advance as i love this tool and it even saved me a few times i wish i could duplicate a svg shape i imported or made i just tested the beta and love it so far but wish i could click a button to duplicate what i have selected also a option to snap to a grid square would also be amazing to use love the project and keep it up Clicking on any of the Export options doesnt download anything when on Edge in Windows Switching to Google Chrome allows me to download Internet Explorer doesnt show the site at all
