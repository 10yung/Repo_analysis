 This repo contains the pytorch version of ICnet which point higher than origin paper hello I want to train ICNet with pascal voc dataset in caffe I have changed the number of class in prototxt and written the solverpototxt according to the paper But the loss also around and the accuracy is too low Because my GPU is G memory I can only set minibatchsize to but by setting itersize to So the batch size is Can you help me Looking forward to your reply How do you set the weights for different classes when calculating loss I train the model using the weights I give But the model still learn the detect the background Can you introduce the method you use Hi I once used this script to test the speed of ICNet in Matlab tic score netforwardinputdata temp toc But I got the result of fps on ti without other programs running the result provided by the author is more than fps then I used the scripts provided by the author in Caffe the result is fps on ti which is lager than the original result I was confused about it Can you help me tensorflow Does your Cityscapes test dataset have labelsI have downloaded a label without a test data set from the official websiteSo I cant get the test mean IOU Hello could you porvide me the training parameters set beacause I train the model I found it can not reach the paper performance Thank you why the input image size of cityscapes is x Shouldnt be x The original image size is x in cityscapes dataset The performance of icnetcityscapestrain kcaffemodel is better than icnetcityscapestrain kbnnomergecaffemodel however the trained model is supposed to output the latter model file How is the conversion done between the two model weights and whats the reason behind it I couldnt get it from the information in the note provided Thanks
