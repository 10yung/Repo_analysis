It seems that the Rails and specific code removal has been shipped with Is this correct If so was this intentional or a mistake Ideally even if Rails and are EOL such removal would have been released as a instead Disclaimer I read this from the changelog and did not tested this with code Maybe I am wrong here but the changelog tells it that way Previously Polyamorous was a separate gem It has been moved into the Ransack repo which is a great step forward However it is still a gem inside the Ransack repo What needs to be done is to convert this code purely into a module A later refactoring can more closely merge the code but for now the work needed is Remove the Polyamorous gemspecific code Add any dependencies needed into the Ransack gemspec Move everything under the main libpolyamorous folder Remove the Polyamorous dependency from Ransack Add the Polyamorous tests into the Ransack repo and get them to pass A job has been posted on Upwork to fix the urgent Ransack issues Update Travis configuration with support under sqlite postgres and mysql for stable stable Remove allowed to fail for stable from CI configuration Having the following models ruby class Post def selfmyscopeargs wherefoo args end end class User hasmany posts end It is possible to use ransack with myscope directly on the Post model ruby Postransackmyscope fooresult works But it doesnt work if I try to use the same scope from the User model ruby Userransackpostsmyscope foo ArgumentError Invalid search term postsmyscope Are scopes limited only to be usable with the same model Or am I missing something This is an attempt at redoing the functionality added in this PR but adding tests to the feature will be accepted I would love some help understanding where the best place to add tests for this would be Thanks CI is broken against stable since Needs to be investigated and fixed Hi there I have a three tables named auditlogs users adminusers whose corresponding ActiveRecord classes are AuditLog User AdminUser Table userss id is integer type and table adminuserss id is string type AND BOTH adminusers and users has username field The table auditlogs has useridstring and usertype two columns and AuditLog has a belongsto relationship belongsto user polymorphic true AND when I use ransack to search AuditLogransackuserofUsertypeusernameeq test I got the following error ActiveRecordStatementInvalid PGUndefinedFunction ERROR operator does not exist integer character varying it occurred when LEFT OUTER JOIN users ON usersid auditlogid I dont know if it is a correct behavior to raise error OR it is more reasonable to do a type cast in background in this case Thank you Fixes inspired on PhilCogginss investigation in but being initially more aggressive
