 New and improved version of Skor is now part of Hasura GraphQL Engine A few months ago we built the open source GraphQL Engine that gives you instant GraphQL APIs over any Postgres database We have added all of Skors existing features and even more to make it production ready Reliable We capture every relevant action on the database as an event even when Hasura is down The events are delivered to your webhook as soon as possible with an atleastonce guarantee Scalable What more it even scales horizontally If you are processing millions of events just add more instances of GraphQL engine Use with Serverless If you are using Skor then avoid the pain of managing your webhook by moving to Serverless infrastructure Check out these blog posts to get started Use Hasura GraphQL Engine for production use cases issue talks about adding retries for webhook calls We maybe interested in changes to a specific column or columns in a specific table and not all db events See the discussion at For example it is necessary with tables with large rows
