DocOnce encourages using sudo pip install Although sudo pip install is still used in many guides it is regarded as bad practice due to security risks and possible issues for your system see eg What are the risks of running sudo pip he most recommended installation methods for Python packages is using virtual environments Using pip install package of pip install package user is also recommended see Installing Python Modules Notice that sudo pip install fails on Python virtual environments An example is in the docsrcmanualinstalldoconcesh file which was throwing an error on my virtual environment All files using sudo pip install can easily found by using this regular expression on the DocOnce installation directory grep r sudo pip install Issue Add answersatend option and review behavior for solutionsatend help users to move all solutionsanswer to exercises to a separate section in the end of the document When dealing with documents that have to be regularly updated such as course material DocOnce users would need new functionality to control only part of the solutionsanswers by hiding or moving them to the end of the document A user could add a DocOnce command that modifies how exercises write out solutionsanswers from its place in the code until a new command brings back the normal behavior for solutionsanswers This comand should be allowed to be placed anywhere in the DocOnce text See this example Week Electric field labelchweek anshide soldocend This is the text for chapter include chaptersweek week dotxt split These are some exercises Answers will be suppressed Solutions will be moved to end of document include chaptersweek exerweek week ex dotxt Restore normal behaviour for Solutions and Answers soloff ansoff Week Gauss law labelchweek This is the text for chapter include chaptersweek week dotxt split These are some exercises for week include chaptersweek exerweek week ex dotxt The example above introduces new commands sol or ansbehavior where behavior can be hide docend and off to restore the default behaviour The six commands I proposed are solhide soldocend soloff anshide ansdocend ansoff quickrefhtml hplgitgithubiodoconcedocpubquickrefquickrefhtml shows under the Section Types paragraph that exercises can be surrounded by characters When I try this I get a compilation error not shown The documentation is probably wrongobsolete on this point In fact according to manualhtml Exercises Problems Projects and Examples are subsections and should be surrounded by characters Also bookpdf defines exercises as a subsections Broken links in documentation In docpubquickrefquickrefhtml the example document points to a Page In the same section the reference to docsrcmakesh does not seem to be valid the file does not exist The link to Mako in the last chapter of mainmakopdf is broken Of course these corrections should be applied to the corresponding dotxt files and can apply to other document formats In addition I noticed a couple of typos In docpubmanualmanualhtml the eg should probably be removed line as MYVARmytext eg In the same file Different pieces of Python code in Mako is placed should be are placed Dear Doconce Users For some time the command doconce sphinxdir themetheme name causes errors I need to run it twice to obtain automatesphinxpy in my work dir It seems that sphinxbuild has been changed and path variables behave different Has someone experienced similar behaviour Shall I track this inside the relevant doconce class Regards Mirco Meiners Some of the raw strings in doconce have unknown escapes such as c They should be c Please give support for Portuguese PT and Brazillian Portuguese PTBR Add the new feature mentioned in into the manual at least I cant find it and I really likeneed it I am not a regex pro It seems to me that is better than because it allows for apostrophes within the quotes I hope Im not missing anything obvious I see that Revealjs had a major update in Nov whereas docOnce had its last release in Oct I cant figure out why but lots of things are broken when generating revealjs presentations out of docOnce now It would be nice if DocOnce can be updated to match the latest revealjs release
