review until related PR is merged before Spark after Spark added description of the commandline and examples Im considering about incorporate the official templates with main repository to reduce maintenance costs of them My idea is Check versions of PredictionIOScalaSparketc by TravisCI using a shell script and if these versions are not same among PredictionIO and templates test will fail Include the official templates and examples in the distribution which is made by makedistributionsh Documentations which refer these templates or examples will be fixed to be started from cd PIOHOMEtemplatestemplatescalaparallelrecommendation pio build instead of git clone cd predictioniotemplaterecommender pio build Currently for every release we have to update versions of PredictionIOScalaSparketc then create tag for each template repository by hand If the official templates are in the same repository with PredictionIO itself we will be able to finish this boring operation at once Also it will ensure that all official templates is synchronized with the latest PredictionIO version Adds missing articles and tweaks grammar Adds missing articles and tweaks the grammar I tried to leverage the already present async interface of elasticsearch and armouring the HBase and JDBC call with blocking constructs which will tell the standard scala ExecutionContext to use a separate thread for that Let me know what you think See and and also for more details See also for corresponding UR PR Fixes PIO Switches batch query processing from Spark RDD to a Scala parallel collection As a result the pio batchpredict command changes in the following ways querypartitions option is no longer available parallelism is now managed by Scalas parallel collections input option is now read as a plain local file output option is now written as a plain local file because the input output files are no longer parallelized through Spark memory limits may require that large batch jobs be split into multiple command runs This solves the root problem that certain custom PersistentModels such as ALS Recommendation template may themselves contain RDDs which cannot be nested inside the batch queries RDD See SPARK
