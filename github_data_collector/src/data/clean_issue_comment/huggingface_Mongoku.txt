Hi Thank you for the great UI Small question is it possible to skip the servers page if there is only one server Bumps handlebars from to details summaryChangelogsummary Sourced from handlebarss changelog v November th Bugfixes fix add noprototypebuiltins eslintrule and fix all occurences f f d fix add more properties required to be enumerable Chores Build fix use instead of c b f add chai and dirtychai and sinon for cleaner testassertions and spies deprecate old assertionmethods e e ba dad a Security The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th Bugfixes fix use Stringfield in lookup when checking for constructor d test add

like mongoku Mongoku seems to resolve the ip of the host and replace it in the connection string As we restart our docker it will retrieve a new internal docker ip so the connection string is invalid I would suggest to resolve the ip while connecting and not by replacing the connction string Using dockercompose and starting both mongoku and mongo provokes a permanent error message in the UI If mongoku exited with code if its unable to connect to the database we could add a restart onfailure and then the next time it will connect Is it possible to add an environment variable to exit if its unable to connect I can PR if needed Thanks you I m looking for a mongo webui and found your module looks promising I cannot see any button to create collection or document inside a collection is there something I m missing or is it planned in the future When I run Mongoku on it works When I try to set it to run on eg it do not work It shows a blank page Inspecting it I could find out that css and js resources are not available because it try to load it on root absolute path I am trying to use the app for allowing normal usersnon administrators to browse the collections and documents within a particular database But the application is throwing error as it is trying to listDatabases since the user doesnt have admin rights that would allow himher to list the databases Is there any workaround to resolve this I dont want the users to be admins in order to just browse the documents within a database I have sslenabled mongo v and I want its graphical interface for client but I didnt find any sslca or sslkey option in mongoku however it works really fine without ssl Currently Im logging in mongo via terminal ie mongo ssl host localhost sslCAFile etcsslcapem sslPEMKeyFile etcsslkeypem Any help appreciated First of all congrats for this lib its amazing Is there a way to start Mongoku programatically not with a npm install g and define the connection string as a parameter Regads Sylvain I would love to create PR if there isnt and is this possible
