From I ran sshcode ssh alias and I was asked for my password times I cant set up passwordless ssh because of the way Kerberos and AFS are set up on the remote server It would be great if there was somehow a way to only ask for the password once However this would probably sacrifice some security This issue came back Yesterday December I reran go get u gocodercomsshcode to update the package

macOS Beta sshcode version prints a newline but I installed sshcode via go get sshcode sshflags o ControlPathtmptest o ControlMasterauto o ControlPersist m tj works fine but I still think should be fixed because the SSH connection will be kept after sshcode is quit This adds the electron binary into the commandExists check switch in sshcodego and if electron is found use it This idea works because that means that certain extenstions such as adblockers or in braves case the built in blocker which is enabled even when extenstions are not This allows users running googlechromebeta to still open the app inside electron instead of inside a browser tab Why arent you guys using or better yet I feel like it would probably allow for native Windows support no Using the current version of sshcode built from source version does not reveal the version number I am getting frequent unrecoverable disconnections despite having a strong connection MBps Clicking on reconnect in the popup never reconnects and moreover the local terminal from which I am connecting locks up and must be manually closed Ive gotten this behavior multiple times now on multiple different network connections so I am satisfied the network is not the issue The remote session I am connecting to is a GCS VM instance which I use reliably for other remote computing tasks eg Jupyter notebook hosting Please add ability to specify extra options for gcloud for example localip Without this its impossible to use sshcode in some gcloud configurations Example i run sshcode developerarchlinux Workspace it will open normally but if i come back later and open optWorkspace it will open the previous directory instead Workspace the only fix i have for this is changing something in settingsjson but that is not a good idea as it may sync back and mess up someones actual config on their personal PC as stated this line go sshCmdStr fmtSprintfssh tt q L vlocalhostv v v cd v v host auth none portv obindAddr oremotePort osshFlags host dir codeServerPath oremotePort should be go sshCmdStr fmtSprintfssh tt q L vlocalhostv v v v host auth none portv v obindAddr oremotePort osshFlags host codeServerPath oremotePort dir as codeserver is no longer opening atleast for me in the users PWD when they call it This edit tells codeserver to open that path DIRECTLY from codeserver same concept as upstream vscode I have already implemented this in my fork not yet pushed as i am still fixing it up I installed sshcode via go get u gocodercomsshcode and when I run sshcode version I dont get any version info piraspberrypi sshcode version piraspberrypi the bastion server in question is sshPortal something in this chunk of code in sshcodego errors out with Error Code Dont know exactly what is causing it but my therory is it is trying to do things on the bastionserver before it is proxied across to the target To reproduce do the following install sshportal invite a new user and add a host create invite email can be false read the readme of the program for how to do so host create userhostport name hostname can be anything then ssh through sshportal to the host to verify it is configured properly ssh hostnameportal p Then test sshcode to verify this issue sshcode skipsync sshflags p hostnameportal If you are unable to reproduce this issue go ahead and close this go if ouploadCodeServer
