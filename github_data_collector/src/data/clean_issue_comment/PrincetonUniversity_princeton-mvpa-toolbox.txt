Hiii First of all I want to know or see the expected output as the code doesnt run with me so i can know where is the problem also i have this error if anyone can help me Error in sumastitch line e em lst zglobbsprintfs imaname and this is the code function A sumastitchimaname A function to put together a series of suma recorder images Very crude only for the intrepid Example A sumastitchimageseries The would be the images as spat out by the recorder window after a suma r key stroke with SUMASnapshotOverSampling figure clf e em lst zglobbsprintfs imaname Nim lengthlst N roundsqrtNim k figure clf for i N for j N k i j N lstkname a imreadlstkname sizea if k A zerosN sizea N sizea sizea uint end istrt N isizea istp istrt sizea jstrt j sizea jstp jstrt sizea istrt istpistrt jstrt jstpjstrt Aistrtistpjstrtjstp a subplot N N k imagea titlelstkname drawnow k k end end figure clf imageA axis square drawnow info imfinfolst nameinfoFormat imwriteA sprintfsstitchs imaname infoFormat infoFormat What steps will reproduce the problem In MATLAB b run initsubj The function datetimetrue is called in initsubjm line What is the expected output What do you see instead The builtin function datetime is used instead of the MVPA function datetime Even if you are in the directory core util running which datetime will still point to the builtin function The solution is to rename the MVPA version of datetime What version of the product are you using On what operating system MATLAB b Windows Please provide any additional information below No additional information The solution is to rename the MVPA function Original issue reported on codegooglecom by markbruugmailcom on Feb at What steps will reproduce the problem subj loadafnimasksubjwholebrainwholebrainorig classargstrainfunctname traingnb classargstestfunctname testgnb classargsnHidden What is the expected output What do you see instead The output I see is Perf Perftotal and I noticed the value of acts is all NaN please see the attachment What version of the product are you using On what operating system Matlab R a Windows bit Please provide any additional information below I just simply modify the tutorialeasym as follows I change the mask to the intracranialwholebrain mask I change the Backprop Classifier to Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier Then I run the code and find that MVPA toolbox did not account for the possibility of underflow I paste part of the result here Please take a look at it Original issue reported on codegooglecom by smithli gmailcom on Jan at Attachments Capturejpg Capture JPG The number of hidden neurons should be defined Changing the activation functions to linear A layer NN with linear activation units is equivalent to a layer NN with nonlinear activation units My tests has shown better accuracy with linear activation units than logistic activation units Another addition is a random seed so that different NN weights are generated at each run I am not sure if netlab handles this but it seems that netlab does not have this feature Finally we need few hidden neuronsunits The value nHidden is a good choice I would also suggest to reduce the defaultsepochs from to to speedup the training I am using now and it works pretty fine With very best regards Mohammed S AlRawi Visual neuroscience lab IBILI University of Coimbra Portugal alrawiaaatttucdddoootttpt With very best regards Mohammed S AlRawi Original issue reported on codegooglecom by msalrgmailcom on Jan at Attachments trainbpnetlabmpatch Hey after adding the paths to my matlab installation I got a warning that isrow has the same name as the built in isrow Also the behavior of the two functions is slightly different This might produce some errors when using the toolbox and other scripts that rely on the original isrow I usually add a prefix prisrow in front of my scripts to avoid such problems Did you consider doing that or is there a more elegant solution What version of the product are you using On what operating system Latest mvpa release MATLAB R a Windows bit Please provide any additional information below Original issue reported on codegooglecom by juliankgooglemailcom on Jan at
