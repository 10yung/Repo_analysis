 line the string m why throw Error m is a common string Without this patch spaces and newlines are added to elements that contain CDATA This was a problem for our application Without this patch pretty printed elements which contain CDATA are output as elemName CDATA some data here elemName With this patch the output is elemName CDATA some data here elemName Im not seeing any way to validate xml generated using a xsd this would really come in handy Is there an output option that will sort the order of attributes by their alphabetical order for nodes Regardless of order of insertion This arbitrary and merely a curiosity Thanks For what I can see there is no support for using namespaces Maybe that could be a feature worth implementing
