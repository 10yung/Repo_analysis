I do understand that Anorm builds on top of JDBC which is inherently synchronous just like most of the underlying drivers and protocols However there are some databases that natively support asynchronous queries such as the postgresql and there are new database APIs like jasyncsql coming up that try to support this I like the simplicity Anorm but Id also like to use the asynchronous query support of the postgresql Are there any plans for supporting asychronous querying Writes an optional json as NULL if the value is None Pull Request Checklist Have you read How to write the perfect pull request Have you read through the contributor guidelines Have you signed the Lightbend CLA Have you squashed your commits Have you added copyright headers to new files Have you checked that both Scala and Java APIs are updated Have you updated the documentation for both Scala and Java sections Have you added tests for any changed functionality Fixes Fixes xxxx Purpose What does this PR do Background Context Why did you take this approach References Are there any relevant issues PRs mailing lists discussions Either by field annotations or other way allows to alias the columns from nested parsers used from the one created by the macros Specially useful for parser of type with self reference
