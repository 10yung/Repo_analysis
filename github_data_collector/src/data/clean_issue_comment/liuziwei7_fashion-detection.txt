hello liuziwei I have been reading your paper Deepfashion It is a bit confused about the loss function of attribute classification in the paper The paper says wpos and wneg are two coefficients determined by the ratio of the numbers of positive and negative samples in the dataset My understanding is like this wpos numpositve numdataset wneg wpos Is my understanding wrong Looking forward to your reply thank you very much Hi authors Can you please explain what was your methodology of training DARN network DARN has nbranches for each attribute group and expects to have one label per class but in deep fashion data many a times multiple attributes belonging to same group get activated multilabel per class How are training DARN in that case can we detect labels of multiple people in image How can we extend model for same Hi Ziwei Thanks for your excellent idea and code along with the great contribution to the fashion field I meet a question after running your code and caffemodel It seems that the tests on Maxi Dress sets such as on Painted Floral Maxi Dress doesnt goes well You can refer to the following figure fashiondetectionerror Are you doing a further research or having an newer code for upgrading the performance I m very interested in this project Thanks Hello liuziwei I had looked through the paper DeepFashion Powering Robust Clothes Recognition and Retrieval with Rich Annotations but I could not find any experiments about bounding box detection So I would like to ask something about training facts of your network It seems that you used bounding box annotations not the landmarks ones and trained the public fast rcnn I mean a noncustomized version with the boxes Am I on the right track Could you explain some details about trainingtesting data training data type only inshopor consumer images or both of them the number of images training and testing respectively Could you share your evaluation methods and results By the way thanks for your sharing the models and the codes It is really awesome and helpful
