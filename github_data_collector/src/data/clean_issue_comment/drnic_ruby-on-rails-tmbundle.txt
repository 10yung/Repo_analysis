 Hello It is Picabot an automatic GitHub image optimizer Your repository cointains some images and I compressed them for you Do not worry the compression is lossless and uses ImageOptim toolkit This bot exists to make the Internet faster There are people whove got a fast internet connection but there are countries where additional KBs take a reasonable time to download like additional minutes Additionally this PR is going to save some precious disk space and decrease your server load Picabot saves approximately of space Still if you do not need your images optimized feel free to close this pull request If I have enough money Ill build a server which will send these precious pull requests much faster And if I had monthly donations I would dedicate all my work time to opensource so donations are very appreciated Donate Pull requests forks and favs are welcome HI I am new to textmate but I am having some issues getting create partial from selection working here is the error I am having UsersjeremyLibraryApplication SupportTextMateManagedBundlesBundle SupporttmbundleSupportsharedlibuirb in toplist An object in the argument tree could not be converted ArgumentError from UsersjeremyLibraryApplication SupportTextMateManagedBundlesBundle SupporttmbundleSupportsharedlibuirb inrequeststringcore from UsersjeremyLibraryApplication SupportTextMateManagedBundlesBundle SupporttmbundleSupportsharedlibuirb in requeststring from UsersjeremyLibraryApplication SupportTextMateManagedBundlesRuby on RailstmbundleSupportbincreatepartialfromselectionrb inmain I have been spending the last hour trying to fix it without any luck I am running TextMate with Ruby and OS X Thanks in advance I get the following error dialog when trying to use Quick Migration UserszachmillmanLibraryApplication SupportTextMateManagedBundlesRuby on RailstmbundleSupportlibrailstextmaterb in methodmissing undefined method filepath for TextMateModule NoMethodError from UserszachmillmanLibraryApplication SupportTextMateManagedBundlesRuby on RailstmbundleSupportlibrailsrailspathrb in initialize from UserszachmillmanLibraryApplication SupportTextMateManagedBundlesRuby on RailstmbundleSupportbingeneratequickmigrationrb in new from UserszachmillmanLibraryApplication SupportTextMateManagedBundlesRuby on RailstmbundleSupportbingeneratequickmigrationrb Hi I have followed to install with Git instructions when i run osascript e tell app TextMate to reload bundles i get this error syntax error A identifier can t go after this identifier I am using Ruby Rails MAC OS Any idea According to my evaluation class is unnecessary Please check it before mergingi dont have apple textmate so i didnt tried it Hi Ive added json to the create resources controller snippet Cheers Bruno With this patch haml also try to determine by searching in Gemfile Rails now default to JSON instead XML
