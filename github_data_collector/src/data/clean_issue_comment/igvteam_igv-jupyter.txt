Hey Jim I stumbled upon igvjupyter and tried it out on this Gen Jupyter environment Im working on I have this odd issue which might not be an igvjupyter issue more likely a problem with my use of it When I open a notebook and run it IGV does not bshow and I get an IGV Browser not ready message from bloadtrack with a Could not open comm Error Class igvcomm not found in registry error in the console However if I open a new browser window and reopen the running notebook and run it again it works just fine What am I doing wrong Screen Shot at PM Screen Shot at PM When a feature is clicked this event would report the start and end position of the feature Here are a few remarks and suggestions to improve the tracks display The Embedded Features option is a great idea Nothing to say it is very convenient and works well Bam files rendering improved a lot in the last version but for some reason displayMode SQUISHED or COLLAPSED do not seem to work whereas it does for vcf files It would be great to have a possibility to reorder the tracks The track settings menu right cog is still a little buggy In particular the tick is massive for the displayMode for instance Thanks a lot
