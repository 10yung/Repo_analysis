from the package Composer info longmantelegrambot Good Morning I will surely be missing some configuration that I cannot find I have created a command that simply returns to the channel from which any message was issued it is only to see if it works From the bots own channel it works correctly but from a channel where the bot is an administrator it doesnt work I have validated that telegram sends the messages but they do not reach the code of my command Any idea what it could be Thank you Feature Request Summary Please add the possibility to hook own checks to the pre execution function where needmysql and privateonly are already checked Use Case I want to log the user into a service and have commands that should be only executable when the user is already signed in So the easiest way to check this would be to add a protected variable needsignedin true to the class Hello guys I started my telegram bot yesterday and he works good without any problems but the bot got blocked or something like that after one day so now my question is i dont use the bot for spam or something like a spam and i still got blocked I readed that the bot can get blocked if he send requests per minute and my bot do only requests per minutes so what is the problem here Thanks you guys hey guys I try to implement telegram bot that behave like imdb but unfortunately when I get the

everyone How can I use this library in Symfony Project So is it hard to make it Feature Request Limit the growth of the database Summary Setting the days to save in logs of the tables in webhook Provide a summary of the feature you would like to see implemented If the bot exceeds a number of users that any server service can handle the tables begin to grow exponentially It would be good if for example the requestlimiter table does not store more than what is previously configured in the bot initialization With thousands of records in the db cleanup is almost impossible A possible solution would be to find an appropriate key in the tables so that you can do insert ignore into on duplicate key update If not compare the preset number of records in initialization with the amount in the table and clean them automatically
