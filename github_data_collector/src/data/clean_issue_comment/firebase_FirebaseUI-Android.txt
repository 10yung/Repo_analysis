templatepathgithubISSUETEMPLATEmd FirebaseUI version Problem Description When creating an AuthMethodPickerLayout object to make a custom layout for the login screen you have to set button ids of the auth providers that you chose When you choose EmailBuilder as a provider but without providing a button id for it while creating the AuthMethodPickerLayout object the app crashes and shows this error in log cat Caused by javalangIllegalStateException No button found for auth provider password So the problem here is the password word it should say email or EmailBuilder I thought that this could be misleading to some people so I created this issue Steps to reproduce Create an AuthMethodPickerLayout object to make a custom layout Choose EmailBuilder as a provider but without providing a button id

the calling code will have a good idea what email address the user is going to use to sign in with for example when resuming after sending a verification email It would make things smoother for the
