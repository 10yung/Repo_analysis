Added the method for Unblocking the ps files Expected behavior Prompt should remain unchanged and reject the action entirely Actual behavior Prompt prefix changes despite the message of an env not existing Reproduce Activate an env that you know exists Then attempt to activate one that doesnt exist I discovered by mistake that the bug exists when using a system I didnt setup It doesnt appear to have changed any actual behavior but the only way to correct the prompt is to deactivate and reactivate the desired target env Can you make the activatedeactivate work when the environment is in users app data folder like this AppData Local conda conda envs py When I activate the active environment is not changed from None Here is my conda info active environment None user config file C Users micha condarc populated config files C Users micha condarc conda version condabuild version python version final base environment C Users micha Anaconda writable channel URLs package cache C Users micha Anaconda pkgs C Users micha AppData Local conda conda pkgs envs directories C Users micha Anaconda envs C Users micha AppData Local conda conda envs C Users micha conda envs platform win useragent conda requests CPython Windows Windows administrator False netrc file None offline mode False Thank you and I appreciate the help Hey not sure but for me it fixed the issue that I had to add ps to the deactivate in order to make it works This does not work on Conda Is there any workaround According to issue add one line that copy deactivateps to condaEnvName Scripts when run the activateps to solve the issue The process of trying to deactivate an env or activate a different one after activating the first one doesnt successfully complete There are no errors that show up in the console it just refuses to switch
