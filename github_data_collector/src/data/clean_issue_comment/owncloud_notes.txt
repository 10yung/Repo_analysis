changelog Task system changes replaced x task system orchestrator with new task system bach removed gulpreset removed argument syntax for gulptask gulptask should only be used when you will call the task with the CLI added gulpseries and gulpparallel methods for composing tasks Everything must use these now added single argument syntax for gulptask which allows a named function to be used as the name of the task and task function added gulptree method for retrieving the task tree Pass deep true for an archy compatible node list added gulpregistry for setting custom registries CLI changes split CLI out into a module if you want to save bandwidthdisk space you can install the gulp CLI using either npm install gulp g or npm install gulpcli g where gulpcli is the smaller one no module code included add tasksjson flag to CLI to dump the whole tree out for other tools to consume added verify flag to check the dependencies in packagejson against the plugin blacklist vinylvinylfs changes added gulpsymlink which functions exactly like gulpdest but symlinks instead added dirMode param to gulpdest and gulpsymlink which allows better control over the mode of the destination folder that is created globs passed to gulpsrc will be evaluated in order which means this is possible gulpsrc js bjs badjs exclude every JS file that starts with a b except badjs performance for gulpsrc has improved massively gulpsrc bjs will no longer eat CPU since negations happen during walking now added since option to gulpsrc which lets you only match files that have been modified since a certain
