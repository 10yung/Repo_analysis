Hi Professor Darren Engwirda I have a narrow region and I hope to get the mesh as that in the picture My way in other mesher might be specifying the mesh nodes on the edge and the mesh size for that region I understand the quality in the region is not very good but thats just I hope to have is it possiblewhat is the good way to do this with mesh d sorry it is not an issue but I dont know where to ask Thanks George mesh dask It seems that when a region has a very high aspect ratio eg a triangle with a very small angle nodes are inserted into the border even when I have ref set to preserve Is this the expected behavior Is there anything I can do to be more strict about preserving edge nodes
