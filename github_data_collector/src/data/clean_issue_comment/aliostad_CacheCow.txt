Hi I have a question is there a way to disable CacheCow I would like to disable the cache whenever I am working on my local environment my current workaround is to force chrome to disable caching Is there a better way to do this Also this is an awesome project It seems the three assemblies CacheCowCommonsn CacheCowServersn CacheCowClientsn were one time releases and were left in version Any chances to update them to their latest version Thanks in advance On NET Core Ive tested and calling DeserializeToResponseAsync on MessageContentHttpMessageSerializer will crash with certain http responses googlecom being one of them Ive tested this on and the crash does not occur Im guessing this may be a framework issue but Im not sure Ive attached a project that reproduces the problem Exception backtrace SystemInvalidOperationException Error parsing HTTP message header byte of message SystemByte at SystemNetHttpHttpContentMessageExtensionsReadAsHttpResponseMessageAsyncCoreHttpContent content Int bufferSize Int maxHeaderSize CancellationToken cancellationToken at CacheCowClientMessageContentHttpMessageSerializerDeserializeToResponseAsyncStream stream at CacheCowCrashReproTestCacheStoreAddOrUpdateAsyncCacheKey key HttpResponseMessage response in C Users james Documents Projects CacheCowCrashRepro CacheCowCrashRepro Programcsline at CacheCowClientCachingHandlerSendAsyncHttpRequestMessage request CancellationToken cancellationToken at SystemNetHttpHttpClientFinishSendAsyncBufferedTask sendTask HttpRequestMessage request CancellationTokenSource cts Boolean disposeCts at CacheCowCrashReproProgramMainString args in C Users james Documents Projects CacheCowCrashRepro CacheCowCrashRepro Programcsline SystemException SystemInvalidOperationException CacheCowCrashReprozip Thanks it would be nice to have a way of adding hook for POST Action and other custom HTTP verb
