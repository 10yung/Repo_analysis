Describe the bug Not working filter reset To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Goto users page Set filter by name Try to reset filter by click on badge Expected behavior Page reloaded without filtration Screenshots If applicable add screenshots to help explain your problem Server please complete the following information Platfrom Version Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Im always frustrated when colors must be specified Because constants are scattered across base classes For instance php Notification new Orchid Platform Notifications DashboardNotification title Hello Word message New post action type DashboardNotificationINFO Alert AlertmessageWelcome Aboard AlertINFO Notice ToastmessageWelcome Aboard ToastINFO Button ButtonmakeDeletetypeButtonDANGER This is repeated too many times Describe the solution youd like Create a single class containing all colors as constants Which I could indicate in any objects php class Color Visual style public const INFO info public const SUCCESS success public const WARNING warning public const DEFAULT default public const DANGER danger public const PRIMARY primary public const SECONDARY secondary public const LIGHT light public const DARK dark public const LINK link public const ERROR selfDANGER Proposed Changes Add more freedom to published migrations for example renaming Right now on the mobile tables looks very bad One other suggestion add more responsive design to the tables As example One other solution have ability to fix one of the column and add horizontal scrolls to the tables At the moment I am working on the media library functionality for orchid based on vuejs I would like to know what functionality you would like to see in the implementation As a starting point I use wordpress media library and Laravel Media Manager plugin The media library should support the basic functionality of downloading cropping resizing previewing etc If the community has suggestions or implementation questions let me know Just FYI this will be additional package and not included to the base platform Sometimes we have a lot of columns on the table list but we not needed to show it for all of the users and it will be good dynamically without reload page and without saving this in the database show or hide columns Nice example I think we can do something like this Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe I added a class mt to a checkbox like this CheckBoxmakefieldtitleAllow downloadclassmt When the field was rendered only the class I added was in the class attribute I think the class I added should have been added to the already existing classes for the field Describe the solution youd like The new class is appended to the existing class for the field or html element when rendered OR The new class is appended by default but there is an option to specify if it should override the existing class Now all kinds of fields layers are built for editing by the user and making any changes But when I need to display data I have to use my own blade templates They are quite flexible and convenient to use But we could provide some set for displaying data I see this as a subset of the layer For example card code php namespace Orchid Screen Contents use Illuminate Support Arr use Orchid Screen Repository use Orchid Screen Layouts Base use Orchid Access UserInterface use Orchid Platform Models User use Orchid Screen Actions Button use Illuminate Support Facades Auth use Orchid Screen Contracts ActionContract class CardContent extends Base return stringnull protected function title string return thisquerygetproductname return stringnull protected function descriptions string return thisquerygetproductdescriptions return stringnull protected function image string return thisquerygetproductimage return mixed protected function status return thisquerygetproductstatus return UserUser Illuminate Contracts Auth Authenticatablenull protected function users return Authuser Authuser Authuser param UserInterface user return string protected function linkForUserUserInterface user return routeplatformsystemsusersedit user return array protected function commandBar array return ButtonmakeExample Button methodexample iconiconbag ButtonmakeExample Button methodexample iconiconbag Cons or cons All options do not have such flexibility as their own blade templates but provide the user with examples of construction and operation Lets try to decide if we need this and whether they will be useful in building the application For example comments We can take it out as a separate package But I am not ready to support him Therefore I propose to implement this in the platform Lets vote and leave your thoughts and comments here
