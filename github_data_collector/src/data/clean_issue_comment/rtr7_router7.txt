This would be an amazing feature in situations where you need a mobile link backup especially when you have unlimited data or at least a reasonable data cap We could implement a visualization of network activity eg colored squares to represent a network if we had persource IP network traffic counters This would also make it easy to attribute unexpected large transfers to individual IPs Out of curiosity I figured I d see what would be necessary to make tv work with router Running a statically compiled igmpproxy via breakglass with the following config phyint uplink upstream altnet phyint lan downstream results in a working SRF stream curl vlc udp With regards to what we d need to do listen to IGMP packets when a client joins an IGMP group make the router join it install a multicast route see linuxmrouteh for the API to tell the kernel to forward multicast packets from uplink to lan for the specific IGMP group looks like the mroute API needs to be added to xsysunix first This all seems feasible but since I don t consume TV I don t have a lot of motivation to get this done Help welcome It might be prudent to only allow incoming IPv connections to IP addresses which are explicitly listed and default to not allowing incoming connections to other IPs In terms of configuration the feature will be enabled as soon as a nonempty array of allowed IP addresses is defined blocking all incoming connections can be achieved by allowing an unused IP address These are the nftables commands I used for prototyping nft add chain ip filter forward type filter hook forward priority nft add chain ip filter blockincoming nft add rule ip filter forward jump blockincoming nft add rule ip filter blockincoming oifname lan tcp flags syn ip daddr accept nft add rule ip filter blockincoming oifname lan tcp flags syn reject Hi we updated an exported function comment based on best practices from Effective Go It s admittedly a relatively minor fix up Does this help you From the stdout NextPacket interrupted system call NextPacket interrupted system call When attaching wireshark I see packets before and after when I attached From my most recent boot listenersgo now listening on The time being way off resulted in an update not succeeding unhealthy after s unhealthy dhcp lease expired at CET Note that the expiration timestamp is in the future Not sure what s happening here We re setting the RTC in Filing this for tracking the ongoing work Current status x include WireGuard kernel patch in x WireGuard netlink package x make netconfigd read a config file and createconfigure WireGuard interfaces
