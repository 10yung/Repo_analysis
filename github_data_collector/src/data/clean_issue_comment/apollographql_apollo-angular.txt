Thanks for filing a pull request on Apollo Angular A few automated bots may chime in on your PR They are here to help with reviewing and ensuring Apollo Angular is production ready after each pull request merge meteorbot will respond asking you to sign the CLA if this is your first PR It may also respond with warnings messages or fail the build if something is off Dont worry itll help you to fix what is broken GitHub Actions will run tests checking style of code and generally make sure everything is working as expected Please look at the following checklist to ensure that your PR can be accepted quickly Checklist If this PR is a new feature please reference an issue where a consensus about the design was reached not necessary for small changes Make sure all of the significant new logic is covered by tests Try to include the Pull Request inside of CHANGELOGmd I have a query that returns a union In my case I have two classes Organization and User which extend Account When I do a query I have to return the base class in my mutation and query objects when I would prefer to have returned the Organization and User objects directly This would then allow me to be able to use the instanceof operator Is it possible to inject what object instance I would like to use for each of the returned values If not it would be great if there was some kind of factory function that let you return whatever object instance you want based on the incoming data For example I could read the typename and then return the corresponding instance Alternatively is there another preferred way of handling this Intended outcome angular app with apolloangular and graphql client working in IE in production modeproduction build Actual outcome blank screen error in mainjs script object required

sure that you include the following information to ensure that your issue is actionable If you dont follow the template your issue may end up being closed without anyone looking at it carefully because it is not actionable for us without the information in this template Intended outcome What you were trying to accomplish when the bug occurred and as much code as possible related to the source of the problem Using bazel to compile an angular app using AngualrApollo Actual outcome A description of what actually happened including a screenshot or copypaste of any related error messages logs or other output that might be related Places to look for information include your browser console server console and network logs Please avoid nonspecific phrases like didn t work or broke During bazel build process How to reproduce the issue If possible please create a reproduction using and link to it here Instructions for how the issue can be reproduced by a maintainer or contributor Be as specific as possible and only mention what is necessary to reproduce the bug If possible try to isolate the exact circumstances in which the bug occurs and avoid speculation over what the cause might be Create new app add bazel Add ApolloModule to a module AppModule for example run ng build using bazel Youll see the following error Unexpected value ApolloModule in privatevartmpbazelagustinvinao

execrootprojectsrcpackagesinvoicessrcinvoicemodulets Please add a NgModule annotation Versions Provide versions of apolloangular apolloclient and all related apollo packages Try to also include versions of TypeScript Angular and graphql version angular x typecript Some info about this issue This is expected right now with the current interaction between rd party angular components and angular under Bazel For rd party components after pulling them from npm ngc needs to be run on them to generate the angular metadata files Did you received any complains about this or did you tried to use bazel
