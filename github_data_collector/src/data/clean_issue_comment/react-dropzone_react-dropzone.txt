bug Please ask questions on StackOverflow Questions will be closed x I found a bug I want to propose a feature What is the current behavior If the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce You can use to get started and illustrate the issue youre experiencing Use bulmas upload html structure Use label as root Element eg label getRootProps className dropzone Safari Upload per click rerender will not trigger either the onDrop function is not called Drag Drop works correct Chrome Upload per click opens dialog select File opens dialog again select file than it works like expected What is the expected behavior On Safari rerender to access updated acceptedFiles On Chrome only one file select dialog should appear On Firefox works normal Workaround rename label to div It semes that a label element is not working as root The Documentation tells The root properties can be applied to whatever element you want Simplified example to test Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version Operating System and reactdropzone version OS MacOS React ReactDom React Dropzone Safari Chrome Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of reactdropzone Do you want to request a feature or report a bug Please ask questions on StackOverflow Questions will be closed x I found a bug I want to propose a feature What is the current behavior isDragActive returns false when dragging over text This bug is reproducible on Firefox but seems to be working properly on Chrome If the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce You can use to get started and illustrate the issue youre experiencing The codesandbox example displays this behaviour Simply drag a file over the text in the example and the border will turn white instead of green in some places especially right above the words What is the expected behavior isDragActive should be true when dragging over any children If this is a feature request what is motivation or use case for changing the behavior Please mention other relevant information such as the browser version Operating System and reactdropzone version Before creating an issue please make sure you are using the latest version of reactdropzone Do you want to request a feature or report a bug Please ask questions on StackOverflow Questions will be closed I found a bug X I want to propose a feature Id like to get a reason for rejection in the onDropRejected callback currently I only get the file that was rejected There was a request opened up previously but it was closed I am not sure why because the request was valid one and the response didnt really help the reporter From what I can see there can be reasons you dragged multiple files to multiplefalse dropzone bad mime type file too big Sure I can have a series of if statements in my callback to recognize what was the reason for rejection but why do this work again when reactdropzone already done it Also it would be nice to have default error messages for those scenarios Id propose File filename is not supported Only accepts a single file File filename is bytesfilesize the upper limit for file size is bytesmaxFileSize x I want to propose a feature What is the current behavior Does not specify which browsers are fullypartially supported If this is a feature request what is motivation or use case for changing the behavior Before integrating users would like to know if their desired browser support is available Would also help to build support if we know which browsers need it Ive been maintaining this repository for quite some time already and Id like to slowly step down as the main maintainer I could remain on board for discussions and code reviews though The reason for that is that I try to spend more time with my and OSS work takes quite some time of it OpenCollective campaign doesnt show any interest in this project from people who use this software so I decided to give up on this project and concentrate on other projects like lintstaged If youre interested in helping out please step out and let me know UPDATE This issuemessage is by no means reason for concern the lib is still being maintained The issuemessage is here to encourage more ppl to contribute and help with arising issues There is no need to add more comments to this topic instead if you feel like something needs to be fixed or changed feel free to make a PR
