Not able to find that function Observed on iOS JGProgressHUD v If hideHUD waits for async task to be finished and user leaves the viewController before In my case Im able to tap on back button on navigation bar the JGProgressHUD isnt dismissed and blocks user from interaction with current screen One solution is to call hideHUDin viewWillDisappear or viewDidDisappear But I believe this wasnt happening in previous versions of JGProgressHUD Please add a completion callback to dismiss functions in order to avoid strange behaviour during dismissal animation It should be easier to interact with JGProgressHUD during UI tests I added a very basic sample Swift UI test project and some basics accessibilityIdentifier to some relevant things of JGProgressHUD Its just a basic proof of concept Im really not an expert of ObjectiveC in order to make you understand the idea Im sure there is plenty of space for improvement Could you support dark by default if the user turn Dark mode off the style be light but when turn Dark mode on the style change to dark Trying to get this to work in SwiftUI is impossible I have code that wraps it in a UIView that can be displayed in a View import SwiftUI import UIKit import JGProgressHUD struct ProgressHUD UIViewControllerRepresentable func makeUIViewControllercontext UIViewControllerRepresentableContextProgressHUD ProgressHUDUIViewControllerType let hud JGProgressHUDstyle dark hudtextLabeltext Loading huddismissafterDelay return hud func updateUIViewController uiViewController ProgressHUD context UIViewControllerRepresentableContextProgressHUD print If you could consider adding some basic SwiftUI compatibility that would be very much appreciated
