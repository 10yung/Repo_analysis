 wangzheallen Thanks for sharing your interesting work I have a little question about the feature dimension of the final SVM classifier According to your paper and code the dimension of vsad code ie the features for SVM classifier is lenflenp where f denotes descriptors from your scenePatchNets feature layerwith dimension of reduced from and p denotes codewords from objectPatchNets softmax layerie probabilities with dimension of reduced from Even if dimension reduction is employed the feature dimensions for SVM are still very highsay according to your paper Will this cause some problems to the final classification What do you think Let me know if i was wrong somewhere Thanks in advance Thank you very much for providing the model and codeBut I have a questionwill the caffe installed under the bit operating system can run the program
