I removed all the ways to create a project other than using startspringio since we have been pushing that way of making projects Josh Long standing on the S P stage repeaging start dot spring dot io dsyer Hi Dave My project structure is Eureka Server API Gateway It has its own ui built in along with Zuul proxy enabled SampleMicroservice with its own UI and serving another backend microservices My main gateway is hosted on port When i try to open it loads properly all my user interface is enabled to me My problem is when i click on button displayed to nevigate to SampleMicroservice then it loads and immediately comes backs with an error corejs ERROR Error Uncaught in promise Error Cannot match any routes URL Segment My idea is it keep on looking the route in gateway angular code whereas the expectation is user should completely navigate to SampleMicroservice user interface i am able to obtain token from auth server using zuul but im when i try to use the token it says token not valid Hi Sorry for weak English and for reviving the topic but come on I have a situation very similar to the one you presented but with some peculiarities See if you can help me with any suggestions I have UI applications in angular and today all authenticate separately I want to change this Today authentication is done using the grant flow password I want to implement a single sign on for these applications I started a study that can be analyzed in reposit where I created a client a resource and an authentication server The idea is to create one more client one resource server and both to authenticate in the oauth server with SSO starting with the principle that if it was first logged in one while accessing the other client it will not have to log in again I thought of using the Zuul proxy to do this somehow but I confess Im lost My client already has a configured proxy that will point to some server that I imagined would be responsible for the single sing on with zuul but I caught on that part As you have practically gone through the same situation can you give any tips on how I can go on One important note is that my client is javascript with angular in most cases the situation is different Thank you This commit updates URLs to prefer the https protocol Redirects are not followed to avoid accidentally expanding intentionally shortened URLs ie if using a URL
