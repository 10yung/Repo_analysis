Using set x in TAP mode breaks bats scripts if the test fails The cause of the failure is that the set x debug output interleaves with the regular output and breaks bats parsing for extraction of the failure reason This problem can be fixed without modifications to bats Bash allows setting the file descriptor written to by set x with the variable BASHXTRACEFD To get the set x debug output visible within a TAP mode bats test set BASHXTRACEFD to file descriptor For example testbats usrbinenv bats test foo BASHXTRACEFD set x ls HOME and execute this with bats t testbats Please document this somewhere the technique is very useful for troubleshooting bats scripts in favor of batscore sstephenson Can you also archive this repository as well Reassigning IFS breaks things like when the test suite then attempts to check if output list See I use bats with the other maintainers and mentors on the bash track at exercismio We include skips on our tests to encourage TDD but when checking work it is often desirable to ignore the skips Most of us handle this with sed but we are hoping to add a noskip flag option to bats Looking at your source it doesnt seem like it will be a big deal Add an agreed upon flag and option to the bats file Add a simple check inside the skip function If you all like this idea then one of us can make the PR Thank you all for your hard work I am just started to learn the Docker technology Using book Docker on Amazon Web Services by Justin Menga There is an example using the acceptancebats file with the script setup urlAPPURLlocalhost itemtitle Wash the car order locationLocation space curl X DELETE urltodos test create todo item run curl i X POST H ContentType applicationjson urltodos d item status output Created false output location false curl BASHREMATCH jq title echo item jq title this gives the error While run I get error message acceptance in test file acceptancebats line acceptance curl BASHREMATCH jq title Wash the car failed with status acceptance Total Received Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current acceptance Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed acceptance Total Received Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current acceptance Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed acceptance tmpbats src line too many arguments Other tests run OK Can someone help to understand what is the bug in the script I am using Mac OSx Thanks in advance Ive spent the last week using this library and only realized last night that I should be using batscore as this one is no longer maintained Could you change the status of this repo to mark it as no longer maintained please Thanks Very often tests have prerequisites This may be services to be on packages to be installed or others When these prerequisites are not present depending tests fail with cryptic messages generally causing a bunch of errors to be displayed forcing the user to decrypt that all these errors have the same root cause The change proposed here adds a mechanism to check whether one or more previous tests succeeded The idea is to skip depending tests when one or more prerequisite tests fail In such case you will get only significant failures and avoid a cascade of useless and disturbing error messages More details in the READMEmd file This looks like trouble Is it possible to use printf q instead I can make a PR when I have a better understanding of your code Bats allows for setup and teardown functions inside individual test cases Is there a way to have a setup script sourced at the start of the test run to establish convenience functions and the like Its a pain to have to remember to load such a script at the top of every test script Thanks
