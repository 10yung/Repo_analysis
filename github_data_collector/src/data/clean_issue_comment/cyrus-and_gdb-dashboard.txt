Hi I love the extension keep up the awesome work A couple thoughts Is it possible to make the Outputmessages into a module that can be customized In particular the possibility of the preallocating N lines for output akin to height in assembly and source as well as the option of scrolling it again akin to assembly and source would be great since it can be quite distracting if the line count changes during stepping since it will push the rest ouf the dashboard up or down Being able to redirect the Outputmessages to a separate TTY would work as well In that case I can just make a separate tmux pane that I can resize and scroll so for me that would solve my other issue as well PS If either of these things are possible already and Ive somehow missed them I apologize in advance DS As briefly discussed in and the unsteadiness of the output due to dynamically resized panes and the unavoidable output of gdb is a PITA when singlestepping and staring at eg variable numbers while they are jumping up and down a few lines The only known way to get rid of the Outputmessages pane where messages from GDBs interactive console are printed without patching GDB directly is to use a separate terminal window for dashboards output via the dashboard output command Setting this up for every session is tedious so I automated it An additional GDB init script launches a dedicated terminal window automatically by GDB at startup and cleaned up when it shuts down too This window is resized to my taste resized to half the monitor width and snapped to the right and focus is given back to the window where GDB was launched initially In a more generic solution the window geometry should probably be configurable including the actual terminal application to use The latter is not as easy as one would hope for The implementation relies on the wmctrl binary for some of the X related operations that I could not implement via xlib or GDK I tried but this hack took me already waaaaay longer than I would have liked Additionally the script sets a GDB convenience variable named tty to the pty slave aka PTS of the new terminal This variable can then be used as argument to the dashboard output command which I do in my themedashboard customization script A small change is needed to gdbinit itself to make this working because the current gdbdashboard code cannot handle GDB convenience variables In my hack this functionality is added to the output command only but it might prove beneficial in other commands as well if there is the need to communicate between scripts thus I have not submitted it as merge request All of the above allows us to keep interacting with GDBs console as before but shows the dashboard output in a distinct window where all the other panes reside All remaining jumpiness of these panes is due to the lack of fixed or minimumsized gdbdashboard panes whose implementation I hope to motivate a bit with this report Would it be possible to change the color of watch expression lines that have changed since the last update
