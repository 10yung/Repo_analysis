How about make minify cache template how like this possible This is fix for Hey I think entityflags option should be ENTQUOTES by default Or maybe worth to mention this option in examples or in other visible places Otherwise it could lead to XSS in cases like php m new MustacheEngine echo mrendera hrefuseridnamea array name User id onmouseoveralert WDYT Is it possible to use filters pragma with additional argument of the value of the variable Like this php php M new MustacheEngine MaddHelpercurrency functionValue Precision return numberformatValue Precision T TPL FILTERS SubTotal subtotal currency Total total currency TPL echo MrenderT subtotal total SubTotal Total Hi I was wondering if its possible for the mustache loader to load any files in a templates directory instead of having to define exactly which folders With GulpWebpack Handlebars setups it simply finds all hbs files and gives access to them This kind of behaviour is what Im thinking with return new MustacheEnginearray loader new MustacheLoaderFilesystemLoadergettemplatedirectory components This isnt really an issue but I thought it could be a neat feature if its possible with php Cheers Log level is documented to accept int but the actual code passes string constants For the record upstream PSR interface declares mixed Small thing but static code analysis catches type mismatch for me downstream Hi I am just wondering if youve already thought about FILTERS for templates that would work the same way like for rendering values Filter would look like like this stripcomments functioncontent return pregreplaceUis content Solving the problem of no anonymous reference for objects Example php abc foobarbaz echo mrender n t ulliliul n abc works fine with anonymous reference for array But when using a dictionary like associative array php abc afoobbarcbaz it is impossible with Mustache A workaround is to use a function that transforms the abc dictionary into keys and vals php abcugly keya valfoo keyb valbar keyc valbaz echo mrender n t ullikeyvalliul n abcugly ideal will be objs listabc instead abcugly Another problem is to transform not the full rootdictionary but only the object pointed by a path example php echo mrender n t xxxx ulyylikeyvalliyyul n objs list xx yyabc yy and ideal is to add it as a internal method to call in standard way mobjs list So this is the suggestion Suggested helper php Transforns objects into array of key and val objects The object can be pointed by a path array of referencelabels function objs listobjpathNULL l flag path countpath foreachflag arrayPathobj path obj as kv l keykvalv if flag arrayPathobj path l return obj else return l setreturn a nested array value param array array the array to modify param array path the path to the value param mixed value optional value to set return mixed previous value see function arrayPath array path array value null args funcgetargs ref array foreach path as key if isarrayref ref array ref ref key prev ref if arraykeyexists args value param was passed were setting ref value set the value return prev What are the minimum access requirements for the moustache cache Files are currently created as which seems fine but I have had problems in the past with PHP worms getting into cache files this was with Twig but I assume the principal is the same due to PHP files being writeable Sorry I know this a ramble but I am uncomfortable with having writeable PHP files on my server evenespecially by the web server user and I wondered what your thoughts are regarding best practice Hi I currently use an IF block to see if a values been determined But in some cases a distance is determined but is simply Its hidden How can I make sure Mustache displays this variable when it equals I tried casting it explicitly as a string before passing it but that doesnt work either Whats the work around or where could I look to accept a variable which is Is the following chance acceptable havent created a pull request It adds value empty value so comparing it to string private function sectionsMustacheContext context indent value buffer if s source s result calluserfuncvalue source s if strposresult false buffer result else buffer thismustache loadLambdastring results renderInternalcontext elseif emptyvalue value values thisisIterablevalue value arrayvalue foreach values as value contextpushvalue s contextpop return buffer
