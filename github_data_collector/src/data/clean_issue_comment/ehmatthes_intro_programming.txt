Since py files had incorrect folder path when executing buildhtmlpagessh after fixing this issue another issue codec charmap error was identified reading filereadlines which was solved specifying encoding parameter with fileopen Rendering Before Fix Rendering After Fix If there end up being different sections consider a selector at the top that people can select their OS or the OS theyre focusing on and only show those sections Dont just detect the OS and use that because someone might be reading on one OS to learn about another People should be able to fork the project run the script and start working on a similar project for a different language It should also help someone write their own introtopython site with a different set of introductory notebooks This script and some others should be refactored and tests will help that process There are also some new features that could be added and again tests would be really helpful Testing is good The script can certainly be cleaned up Some improvements would be inscript refactoring work some would involve modifying notebooks and templates Instead of manually specifying which notebooks get showhide all output buttons either set a notebook metadata property and check for that in the template or examine the notebook and look for any output blocks If no output blocks dont include the showhide all output buttons See Approach to deleting and rebuilding htmlsite has five levels of nesting That can be simplified or refactored into functions The script currently calls nbconvert from the command line from within a python script I did this because I first learned to use nbconvert from the command line Since were using a python script it would be better to use nbconvert as a library See here This might reduce the need for separate files like scriptsmyconfigpy and would eliminate the use of environment variables Right now this is done manually in buildhtmlsitepy But this could be automated either in buildhtmlsitepy or in a template by checking whether the template has any output blocks Or this could be a setting in the notebook metadata from buildhtmlpy This is manually determining which notebooks get showhide all output buttons Might be better to scrape the files look for output cells and only place showhide all buttons on notebooks with output cells Can this be done in the template In introductory materials remove references to Python This project is about helping people learn new skills not deal with legacy codebases Maybe include a single notebook about Python but references sprinkled throughout the notebooks especially the introductory sections just clutter the site The documentation will be much cleaner after this overall update Separate sections for contributing notebooks and helping with overall site project features Contributing notebooks is much simpler than developing features Issue tag projectproposal Note not to write anything into htmlsite directly as its destroyed and rebuilt on every conversion Right now buildhtmlpy is going to delete the folder htmlsite and rebuild it Is this done safely Im wondering if the script might ever be run from a context where the cwd is not the project root It will look for a folder called htmlsite and delete it and rebuild it That would be terrible if the user had a different directory of that name and lost it by running this script Would it be better to build an absolute path to this projects htmlsite and use that path Maybe get the absolute path to buildhtmlpy and use that to build the absolute path to htmlsite Here are the relevant lines from buildhtmlpy python print nDeleting current htmlsite directory try rmtreehtmlsite print Deleted htmlsite except FileNotFoundError print No htmlsite directory found Moving a comment from buildhtmlpy to here python This could be made more efficient with a cli argument to only process new or modified notebooks For now it usually needs to process all because the conversion script itself is changing often But once the conversion process is stable that kind of flag might be useful move this to an issue This is not a particularly high priority For my development work I just limit buildhtmlpy to convert a few notebooks and then set it to run all notebooks again
