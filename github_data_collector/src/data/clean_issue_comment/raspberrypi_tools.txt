Id like to submit this sample file for a new updated toolchain based on gcc v It is built over the latest trunk of crosstoolsng I cannot add new debugger unknown Raspberry Pi B toolsarmbcm armrpi linuxgnueabihfbinarmlinuxgnueabihfgdb p Any plan to upgrade raspberrypis cross compile tool to gcc Some times its seriously slow to compile the source code on raspberry pi directly Hi trying to crosscompile toybox and failing No armlinuxgnueabihfcc found Is there a missing symbolic link in toolsarmbcm gcclinaroarmlinuxgnueabihfraspbianx bin Im trying to cross compile a QT based application that depends on a few libraries vsomeIP CommonAPI CommonAPISomeIP These libraries are cmake based and depends on boost I Initially downloaded boost by aptget and mounted my PI rootfs at mnt as mntrpirootfs This however had problems when I tried to link them to the application as the toolchain had a different gcc version from that used to compile boost I downloaded boost source and cross compiled it with the toolchain I compiled the above libs by linking boost I could also compile my QT application At runtime however Im now getting this strange error Starting

for linking not sure as the toolchain also provides a libstdcso and libcso Added a tutorial with instructions found on Stack Overflow I think giving a link to the origina post is mandatory If you think I should write my own tutorial and do not link to stack overflow I apologize for wasting your time It moves x ff into cptrel Cortex A TRM lists all bits except and as RES Luckily x ff is a value where those bits are and the ON bits in the value are RES in the register thus resulting in disabling of fpsimd traps to el as expected Storing a zero into or readmodifywrite of cptrel would be proper The number x ff fits more appropriately into cptrel given the intention of disabling fpsimd traps to el Hi all I faced a problem while using this toolchain for my raspberry pi with paho cpp library Detailed explanation can be found in this issue Long story short I need newer version of toolchain to compile my project Is there a way to update this toolchain or are there any newer version of this
