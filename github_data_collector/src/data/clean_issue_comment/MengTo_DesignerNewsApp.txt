 It seems that this project has not yet been updated in awhile Are there plans to convert this to Swift This issue is especially frustrating when trying to follow along with the tutorial in designcode Yes its weird too but the truth I found is the app crashes just at webViewdelegate nil in WebViewController because webView has been destroyed If you click on a cell with a multiline header label they wildly resize itself If you open the app most headlines are single line and shorted by At these shortened cells appears the bug As you can see on the GIF below after clicking the cell label resizes and keeps so after closing the WebView If you click again the label shrinks again but this time only in the animation GIF animation Would be nice to use the iOS SafariViewController instead of the WebView to benefit from the new features of it At least a small option to use it would be great PS Is the app still maintained Weve seen no commit for a long time Please update this repo Hi are there any plans to support iOS and Xcode My builds using iOS and Xcode are breaking especially in Alamofire Just wanted to know before I delve into further Thanks in advance img width altscreen shot at am src The build fail for Swift because external library already uptodate to Swift and using cocoaPod as module dependence get latest version
