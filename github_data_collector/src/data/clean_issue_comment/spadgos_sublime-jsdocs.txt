Is it possible to add support for parsing entire files or even folders and automatically inserting the DocBlock for all functions and classes While it is obviously better to document as one writes code some code bases do not have DocBlocks at all Unfortunately these code bases include thousands of functions so manually using this plugin would take a great deal of time My idea would be to have something similar to This Project where multiple files can be parsed and automatically DocBlocked at once The problem with the project listed above is that it only supports old versions of PHP versions before it looks like which is very out of date As u add comment in php on top of function Like that add comment on tag close div classxyz idpqr div xyz pqr xyz pqr This line will be auto generated on shortcut key press return is being added to functions that dont have a return eg void We practice not documenting return unless it actually returns something sanitizefrontendvalue description author Aubrey Portwood aubreywebdevstudioscom since NEXT return type description public function sanitizefrontendvalue wpsendjsonsuccess thissanitize filterinput INPUTPOST to I often have to delete the two lines the return and the one above it on these which makes for more work Is there a way to configure jsdoc to not add a return unless it returns something PHP Base Filesublimesettings User json midlinetabs true alignmentspacechars Hi when do you support the documentation for SassDoc This scss documentation library is growing and I would like your plugin to support this Ref I have an instance method like this class C m foo any bar any do things what I get with the DocBlockr is this class C param any param any m foo any bar any do things that is no param names foo and bar Am I doing something wrong qq Traceback most recent call last File D Program Files Sublime Text sublimepluginpy line in run return selfrunedit File D Program Files Sublime Text Data Installed Packages DocBlockrsublimepackage jsdocspy line in run File D Program Files Sublime Text Data Installed Packages DocBlockrsublimepackage jsdocspy line in parse File D Program Files Sublime Text Data Installed Packages DocBlockrsublimepackage jsdocspy line in formatFunction File D Program Files Sublime Text Data Installed Packages DocBlockrsublimepackage jsdocspy line in parseArgs File D Program Files Sublime Text Data Installed Packages DocBlockrsublimepackage jsdocspy line in getArgInfo File D Program Files Sublime Text Data Installed Packages DocBlockrsublimepackage jsdocspy line in getArgType TypeError Cant convert NoneType object to str implicitly JavaScript ES classes have constructor which seems to get a return this tag isnt needed on the constructor js class Foo constructor I have change user setting in Base Filesublimesettings jsdocsextratagsgoafter true jsdocsextratags Author AuthorDateTime datetime but when i opened any cpp file and type Enter it only shows who can tell me how to fix it PS I have tried to reinstall sublime and docblockr
