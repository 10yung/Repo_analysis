Hi Im fairly new to coding and using mice on a large observations data set Im trying to conduct an ordinal logistic regression on a variable with levels which I imputed using the polr method against a multitude of other numeric and binomial variables Ive gotten as far as trying to use the polr function from the MASS package with the mice with function and get the following error I get the same error regardless of including the argument for Hess TRUE which I assume is needed when planning to use the summary function I tried searching for similar errors but didnt find any that were helpful to this situation Thanks in advance olr withimputed polr levelfactor var var var varN Hess TRUE Error in optims fmin gmin method BFGS initial value in vmmin is not finite In addition Warning message glmfit fitted probabilities numerically or occurred Since the tidyr package also contains the complete function I would suggest to add an S method for completemids so it wouldnt make a difference if tidyr is loaded after mice Something like not tested myself r exportMethod completemids importFrom tidyr complete export noRd completemids function data action L include FALSE mild FALSE micecompletedata data action action include include mild mild This could collide with your existing complete function but that can be solved to define your own completedefault and use UseMethodcomplete in your current complete function Many thanks for your work the last decades Its awesome Running mice on a data frame with about rows and columns of which have missing values ranging to of the observations After running multiple tests I consistently have a longer time running parlmice and cores vs just mice and it is not clear to me why I am wondering if this is a known behavior I understand that in cases where the size of the job and computation time is low that parallelization can slow down overall computation but in this case even using cltype FORK the speed is about half when I use multiple cores For instance parallelclusterEvalQcl librarymice librarymiceadds It seems some strange things happen with environments when parlmice is wrapped in a function eg R librarymice testparlmice function dat nhanes parlmicedat cltypeFORK maxit ncore nimpcore Calling testparlmice results in Error in getname envir envir object dat not found The environment is still broken even after the parlmice call eg R testparlmice functionsomeVal T parlmicenhanes cltypeFORK maxit ncore nimpcore printsomeVal Result Error in getname envir envir object someVal not found Session info R

following way mdf parlMice isNotConvergedanyRhatsmdf while isNotConverged mdf parlMicemdf isNotConvergedanyRhatsmdf Is there any way this could be done As far as I can see I would have export the micemids interface imp micenhanes maxit seed imp micemidsimp yields the same result as imp micenhanes maxit seed verification identicalimpimp imp imp from I would like to use some functions in the package miceadds while running mice in parallel but parlmice returns an error because they are not being exported I can see that the code for parlmice calls parallelclusterEvalQcl librarymice Would it be possible to change the function so that wrapper packages to mice such as miceadds or micemd are also exported and loaded in each cluster Thank you K mice overwrites the basecbind and baserbind functions This is not elegant and it throws a warning when the package is loaded I am looking for a better way to implement dispatch See For more background see Martin Maechler suggested a solution Does anyone have time to dive in When using mice multiple imputation to generate multiple imputed sets and then running a model on each one of them like elasticnet from the glmnet package and then pooling the estimates to a single set its not possible to use predictglmnet or predict on the object that comes out of micepool The prediction functions expect a fitted model object while micepool returns An object of class mipo which stands for multiple imputation pooled outcome Is it possible to add the ability to make predictions from the return object of micepool Dear Stef Another problem I encountered today showed itself when I was trying to reproduce some of your code from your book Flexible Imputation of Missing Data fantastic book At page you present two codesolutions to the same postprocessing setting librarymice ini miceairquality maxit post inipost post Ozone imp j i squeezeimp j i c imp miceairquality method normnob m maxit seed post post Alternative to line post Ozone ifdocOzone Ozone c The former works fine but the latter gives the OzoneFunction ifdo not yet implemented Has the ifdo function been withdrawn from the package Best regards Mikkel
