I know this isnt an issue but I wanted to provide some information that may help others in the same position as myself I had relied upon Cupertino to handle provisioning profiles in my CI setup for building iOS apps simulator and device In House Enterprise Debug AdHoc App Store As we know Apple made changes to how the website worked which caused Cupertino to stop functioning The workaround suggested by many was to move to Fastlane specifically the sigh tool Sigh is very powerful and useful dont get me wrong The repair feature is fantastic However I could not replicte Cupertinos operation I simply cannot provide a profile name and download that profile You have to provide a bundle ID as well For the vast majority that likely isnt a problem and it just works but for me thats not the case After asking on Faslane wether I was missing something and if not will they add functionality to Sigh to replicate Cupertinos behaviour it was suggested I look at the Spaceship component of Fastlane It took me a fair few hours as Ive never used Ruby before but I believe Ive come up with code that will allow me to download a specific profile by name I also added the ability to repair just that specified profile and not all of them which is the behaviour of Sighs repair function Theres obviously no check as to wether you have the code signing identity keys to actually use the profile you downloaded But hey if were looking at sigh we likely know the pitfalls of provisioning and code signing Below is the code I came up with I execute it by calling the appropriate rb file within my Execute Shell build phase of a Jenkins job I hope that this might prove useful to other people Code to repair a specific provisioning profile Usage repairspecificprovisioningprofilerb

Im seeing login failures when requesting the device list It looks like for some reason we are being redirected to a different login page This is what I see in my browser This is what Im seeing in the failed login attempts From looking at the other PageLinks returned it looks like this is the Apple ID login page instead of the Apple Developer login page Here is the command that Im running sh ios devices Any ideas How is it possible to select a team when same email address is linked to different developer accounts I think this should be supported if possible With cupertino LibraryRubyGems
