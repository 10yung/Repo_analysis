In the implement there are almost no comments It is hard to read and learn It is known that C codes is harder to read than python lang That there are no comments make learner much harder All in all the implement is unfriendly Please add necessary comments At least the members of structs would be commented Thank you on behalf of everyone for learning ffm I would like to find a tf version of ffm How to output AUCROC on console Hello Im about to finish a generalised wrapper for predict and ffmloadmodel function in Java It would be great if you will review my code and then add it to your library if you deem it fit Thank You g Wall O stdc x marchnative fopenmp DUSESSE DUSEOMP c o ffmo ffmcpp tmpcc xJsits Assembler messages tmpcc xJsits Error no such instruction vinserti x xmm ymm ymm tmpcc xJsits Error suffix or operands invalid for vpaddd tmpcc xJsits Error no such instruction vinserti x xmm ymm ymm tmpcc xJsits Error suffix or operands invalid for vpaddd tmpcc xJsits Error no such instruction vinserti x xmm ymm ymm tmpcc xJsits Error suffix or operands invalid for vpaddd tmpcc xJsits Error no such instruction vinserti x xmm ymm ymm tmpcc xJsits Error suffix or operands invalid for vpaddd Are there any plans of incorporating bias and linear terms in this new refactored version I know theyre included in v on the website but if Im not mistaken theyre still not on master I think Thanks Hi guestwalk Thanks a lot for the awesome library Its certainly made my life a lot easier Since we get a segfault for files that are too large is there a way to learn from chunks of data In other words can an existing model be updated with new data Thanks again Sorry for being ignorant can I put float type value in the input data Can two field have the same feature id which means the feature id is associated with field
