It will be awesome to be able to register to more types events on my repository The main ones im thinking about scheduled job lambda have this kind of triggers docker image published new version of it published to a registry via webhook new version of npm package is available via webhook Using scheduled job you can get the behaviour of by running every minutes and query for it Hi guys First thanks a lot for this great project Solved a lot of confusions and headaches for me and team around AWS Lambda We are building and deploying python projects in AWS Lambda and one of the dependencies in Pystan Installing the latest version of pystan requires gcc compared to gcc on the lambci python images Is there a way to prep a build image with say gcc Im happy to do the legwork but need some guidance Proposed fix for This PR contains the following changes Properly end loguploader after ecs build has started to prevent lambda timeouts Subscribe to status event of github needs to be enabled in webhook to fix badges and logs after ecs build has finished This works but it is sort of hack Triggering the build lambda from ecs directly might be cleaner than going through github MOCHACOLORS is deprecated as redundant and will be removed from Mocha FORCECOLOR already provides this same functionality Updates to Lambda limits allow us to increase memory to mb and timeout to seconds These should be parameterized in the cloudformation template to allow configuring that setting while deploying Tested in my account and everything looks good Amazon ECS is very efficient but it imposes limits on what environment your tests can run in It would be awesome if lambci could spin up a full VM for tests While slower than ECS it would still be more efficient than leaving a VM running x Hi mhart In the interest of helping out with the project is there a contributing guide that I can see If not then could someone bullet point the process here Cheers Niall The GitHub Checks API is a new integration for CI tools Its only supported by GitHub Apps so is a prerequisite Can you provide the makefile or build instructions that you used to create the archive Being able to reproduce the archive locally and checksum it would allow the S version to be validated or possibly replaced with other versions more easily GitHub is perpetually showing the orange pending icon rather than a failure red cross for builds that have failed Strangely the green success tick is coming through correctly though I have checked the DynamoDB table and the failed builds have a status of failure and success correctly and the build log page is also correctly showing if a build has failed rather than showing it perpetually pending When first installing lambci the red crosses were working I think the only thing I changed since then is to manually edit the lambciconfig DynamoDB table to change the slack notification room from one room to another Any ideas
