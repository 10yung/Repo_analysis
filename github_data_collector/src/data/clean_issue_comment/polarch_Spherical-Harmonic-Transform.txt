Hi I like your code very much However I obtained NAN while using inverseSHT when the spherical harmonic order reaches What is the upper bound of the order Can you also compute higher order transform Many thanks Jia There is no information what version of MATLAB is suitable for running the library and demo Ive found that MATLAB demo run OK for b but fails for release b b In version b the source of problems is expression hPosition present in demo If I comment all of those expressions demo is run OK in b There is no information what MATLAB packages are required to run the library and demo At least one required package is Symbolic Math Toolbox which is referenced in w jm module Octave works for most of the demo but fails at the code that uses Symbolic Math Toolbox
