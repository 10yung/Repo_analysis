Ill bet you never thought of this Neither did I We use a physical token key generator at work Apparently it types very fast less than milliseconds I would like to be able to disable Unshaky during the token generation and reenable it afterward I envision this as a menu item that toggles between Disable and Enable Perhaps a then I could assign a global OSwide key command for it Language English to Hebrew Can you help with the translation YesNo Yes Describe the bug Unshaky appears to have stopped working It shows a static number of shaky keypresses stopped and the debug window is empty I am on OSX I was on Unshaky and just updated to The same issue remains Whats odd is that even though I thought I completely uninstalled Unshaky it remembered my preferences so there must be something I missed I tried restarting and sleeping the mac but no joy Help please When configuring Unshaky on macOS Catalina Beta Beta A h the checkbox to allow accessibility access for Unshaky in System Preferences Security Privacy Accessibility Allow the apps below to control your computer cannot be marked to grant accessibility control permissions Steps to reproduce the behavior Open Unshakyapp for the first time and acknowledge the message about granting accessibility permissions The System Preference pane for Security Privacy Accessibility opens Trying to tick the checkbox for Unshakyapp to grant permissions has no effect checkbox does not tick and permissions are not granted for Unshaky Reopening Unshaky results in the notification about permissions confirming that permissions were not granted Unshaky cannot operate as a result Workaround In the System Preference pane for Security Privacy Accessibility select Unshakyapp from the list and click the button to remove the app from the list Click the button to browse for a new app to add to the list Navigate to the install location for Unshaky Applications in my case and select Unshaky to be added back to the list of apps After selecting Unshaky from the browse window and adding it back to the list the checkbox for granting permissions is properly ticked Unshaky works as expected after following these workaround steps this resolved the issue for me It seems like the issue happened when Unshaky populated itself in the System Preference pane for Security Privacy Accessibility apps list Manually removing and adding the app back worked without issues Not sure if this is an issue with Unshaky or macOS Catalina Beta but since the other checkboxes for other apps worked without issue I thought it was worth filing a bug Unshaky is working great to address the key doubling issues Im having on my MacBook Pro Ive already taken advantage of the keyboard service program and the issues still persist for certain keys so Unshaky is a godsend Describe the bug When a key is configured with a timeout it delays the key down event until key up To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Set up a key delay space bar in my case Press the space bar key wait momentarily and then release Youll notice that the space doesnt show up until the key is released Its hard to time exactly right but I notice that I end up typinga lotl iket his no matter what the configured debounce timeout is Expected behavior If its not within the double press window dont delay the key down event I use this app from a long time now and I just noticed maybe from the last update that after a few minutes Unshaky stop working The app is still running but I still have the keyboard problems and the debug window do not display anything I was able to make it work again after using Onyx but again still not working after a few minutes No idea if its coming from my mac or the app PS sorry for the double spaces but without Unshaky this butterfly keyboard is a nightmare Language PersianFarsi Can you help with the translation Yes YesNo I use Punto Switcher because I have keyboard layouts This application helps me by hotkey change keyboard layout of the latest word like from en to ru and otherwise Very convenient if you forgot to change the layout I have ms in Unshaky for spacebar and it deletes spacebar after when Im using Punto Only spacebar with others everything is fine Its not a big deal but I always have to add additional spacebar thats so annoying To Reproduce Set ms in Unshaky for the space bar Install Punto Switcher Write the word with the spacebar after Hit the puntos hotkey macOS version Unshaky version This is related to feel free to close it and handle it as a duplicate Dash sometimes relies on sending keystroke events repeatedly when expanding snippets These events are only backspaces and arrow keys When these events happen the pasteboard has the orgnspasteboardTransientType maker see Could you maybe check the pasteboard for this marker and disable Unshaky temporarily while that marker is present Alternatively could you think of any way I could prevent Unshaky from dropping my events Or maybe just check if Dash is installed and show a warning that Dash snippet expansion might not work when the user enables Unshaky for the arrow andor backspace keys Describe the bug debug window cannot capture events
