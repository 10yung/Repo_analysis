 Oh hi there To expedite issue processing please search open and closed issues before submitting a new one Existing issues often contain information about workarounds resolution or progress updates Bug report Command Can you pinpoint the command or commands that are effected by this bug edit new x build x serve test e e generate add update lint xi n run config help version doc Is this a regression It started happening in the same version without any version upgrade of any sort Description There are parts of the BUG during serve and during build creation Description During Serve If I need to tell this clearly it can only be said that this bug occurred while doing development And no changes to AppModule was made during that time You hit npm start and you get the following error ERROR in No NgModule metadata found for AppModule You save any file again and it will start compiling again and compile successfully Description during build It runs the build and fails with the following error ERROR in membershasOwnProperty is not a function Minimal Reproduction I dont know how to reproduce it It has occurred during development and without any upgrade to any packages Exception or Error Exception on SERVE No exception can be found except for the above error as told in the description Exception on BUILD No exception could be found except for the above error But I

minimal reproduction of the issue starting with this template If StackBlitz is not suitable for reproduction of your issue please create a minimal GitHub repository with the reproduction of the issue A good way to make a minimal reproduction is to create a new app via ng new reproapp and add the minimum possible code to show the problem Share the link to the repo below along with stepbystep instructions to reproduce the problem as well as expected and actual behavior Issues that dont have enough info and cant be reproduced will be closed You can read more about issue submission

tried webpackPrefetch Feature request Command mark with an x x config Description Im quite surprised by this move which enables TypeScript skipLibCheck by default From what I know its usually considered as a temporary workaround for issues that should be correctly resolved While it may have performances and compatibility advantages it degrades types strictness ie some real errors may not be reported anymore It goes in an opposite way than the new strict option in v that finally enables strict mode Describe the solution youd like I wont argue on your choice to make skipLibCheck the default I suppose it comes from some issues Im not aware of but is it possible to not enable it when the strict option has been provided for people who wants to work with strict types
