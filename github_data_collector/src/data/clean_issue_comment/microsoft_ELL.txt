Hi we are trying to integrate Azsure Sphere MCU as IoT edge and wondering if ELL can be applied to Sphere MCU as edge side AI analysis if yes is there any instruction or sample Thanks Ken Hi while following steps Win from on Win x machine C azsphere ELLmaster build hostpython callmodelpy Traceback most recent call last File callmodelpy line in module import model File C azsphere ELLmaster build host modelpy line in module import model ModuleNotFoundError No module named model my built files under host folder are uploaded to please help Thanks Ken Hello I followed all the instructions put aside the fact that the tutorials are not updated trained a GRU model for and epochs from scratch however during the test phase the accuracy is around Sample output is as follows FAILED expected stop got bird in stope nohash wav FAILED expected bed got up in bedcc nohash wav FAILED expected left got up in leftd ca c nohash wav FAILED expected wow got nine in wowbed facnohash wav FAILED expected cat got up in catb c f nohash wav During training the accuracy is good Epoch Loss Validation Accuracy Learning Rate Epoch Loss Validation Accuracy Learning Rate Epoch Loss Validation Accuracy Learning Rate Epoch Loss Validation Accuracy Learning Rate Epoch Loss Validation Accuracy Learning Rate Epoch Loss Validation Accuracy Learning Rate Epoch Loss Validation Accuracy Learning Rate Epoch Loss Validation Accuracy Learning Rate Epoch Loss Validation Accuracy Learning Rate The script I used is train python toolsutilitiespythonlibsaudiotrainingtrainclassifierpy architecture GRU usegpu outdirout datasetaudio epochs import python ELLROOTtoolsimportersonnxonnximportpy outGRU KeywordSpotteronnx generate ell python toolswrapwrappy modelfile outGRU KeywordSpotterell outdir KeywordSpotter modulename model compile and make spotter cd KeywordSpotter mkdir build cd build cmake make cd cd python toolsutilitiespythonlibsaudiotrainingtrainclassifierpy architecture GRU usegpu outdirout datasetaudio epochs test buildtoolsutilitiespythonlibsaudiotrainingtestellmodelpy classifier KeywordSpottermodel featurizer compiledfeaturizermfcc samplerate Thanks Hi I am trying to get my own model to the mxchip following the instructions from When I try to use the llvm opt tool under ubuntu I get tutorial opt featurizerbc o featurizeroptbc O Intrinsic has incorrect argument type void i i i i llvmmemcpyp i p i i Intrinsic has incorrect argument type void i i i i llvmmemcpyp i p i i opt featurizerbc error input module is broken I have no idea how to solve that Is that an issue with the llvm version Best Nils General Question Can we reconstruct the PyTorch models from the ELL models Specific Question Can I get the PyTorch models for the Image Classification ELL models provided in ILSVRC gallery on the Microsoft ELLs website This will be helpful for colab users and people who are not able to compile ELL on their system lovettchris I have one more tutorial planned of Key Word Spotting in which I have taken care of adding background noise and mixing silent noise with the audio You can find the colab notebook on this link I need to format and comment it properly Which can help people generate KWS models using ELL and deploy it on microcontrollers I have followed the Training an audio keyword spotter with PyTorch tutorial on a clean install of Ubuntu I have found the following minor issues The tutorial did not mention to install pyaudio The tutorial did not mention to install onnx I used the following command conda install c condaforge onnx The tutorial has a few typos and other mistakes but I could easily navigate around them eg GRUKeywordSpotterell in the tutorial is actually GRU KeywordSpotterell Goal Import a MobileNet reference model from the ONNX Model Zoo Repro Steps Download the mobilenetv onnx model from the ONNX Model Zoo Run the onnximportpy tool python E ELL tools importers onnx onnximportpy mobilenetv onnx Result ValueError cannot reshape array of size into shape newaxis Updates Same error observed with SqueezeNet Goal import an ONNX model exported from CustomVisionai Repro Steps NOTE Pretrained ONNX model attached if you want to skip training your own Train a new model Go to Create an image classifier mobile model Train the model From the Perfomance tab click the download button captioned export selected iteration Choose ONNX and version download the model to a local folder Import ONNX model Run ELLs onnximportpy script python E ELL tools importers onnx onnximportpy cvmodelonnx Result Exception Unimplemented node type ImageScaler cvmodelzip
