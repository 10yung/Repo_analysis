Mish is a novel activation function proposed in this paper It has shown promising results so far and has been adopted in several packages including TensorFlowAddons Tok Vec Layer SpaCys official NLP based ML library Eclipses deeplearning j AI CNTKX Extension of Microsofts CNTK Yolov Library in C dnet DL S Transformers OpenCV DNN Efficient Segmentation Networks Semantic Segmentation DLib PyWick All benchmarks analysis and links to official package implementations can be found in this repository Mish also was recently used for a submission on the Stanford DAWN Cifar Training Time Benchmark where it obtained accuracy in just seconds which is the current best score on GPU and second fastest overall Additionally Mish has shown to improve convergence rate by requiring less epochs Reference Mish also has shown consistent improved ImageNet scores and is more robust Reference Additional ImageNet benchmarks along with Network architectures and weights are avilable on my repository Summary of Vision related results Capture It would be nice to have Mish as an option within the activation function group This is the comparison of Mish with other conventional activation functions in a SEResNet for CIFAR se php laravelframework phpaiphpml Use case Trying to create some estimations predictions based on existing database grouped by year month day samples targets regression new LeastSquares regressiontrainsamples targets regressionpredict Expected result is but throws Matrix exception instead I debugged it and seems that when a column is the same it does not count it If I append a value with different year will work fine for example but I will not always have older data to train it I got it done using an workaround date Carbonparse datediffInDaysCarbonparse In this way I reduce the samples to days differences but I hope it could be done in a cleaner way After using the example code from phpmlexamples the code stops to work right after function train was called use Phpml SupportVectorMachine Kernel use Phpml Classification SVC samples labels a a a b b b svcClassifier new SVC KernelLINEAR kernel cost degree null gamma coef tolerance cacheSize true shrinking true probabilityEstimates set to true svcClassifiertrainsamples labels After this part of code nothing works and webpage is sent to client only with stuff written before this part of code No error is displayed How can I use SVC without this error How can I predict using a label instead of using samples My code php includeonce vendorautoloadphp includeonce Portuguesephp source use Phpml Classification NaiveBayes use Phpml FeatureExtraction StopWords Portuguese use Phpml FeatureExtraction TfIdfTransformer use Phpml FeatureExtraction TokenCountVectorizer use Phpml Tokenization WordTokenizer use Phpml ModelManager arrtext London bridge is falling down japan samurai Universal Studio spider man china beijing thai Chiangmai Universal Studio Hollywood Olympic games arrtext Olympic games arrlabel London Japan China Thailand USA Japan arrlabel Japan tokenize new WordTokenizer vectorizer new TokenCountVectorizertokenize new Portuguese vectorizerfitarrtext vocabulary vectorizergetVocabulary vardumpvocabulary arrtransform arrtext vectorizertransformarrtransform transformer new TfIdfTransformerarrtransform transformertransformarrtransform vectorizer new TokenCountVectorizertokenize new Portuguese vectorizer fitarrtext vocabulary vectorizer getVocabulary vardumpvocabulary arrtransform arrtext vectorizer transformarrtransform transformer new TfIdfTransformerarrtransform transformer transformarrtransform classifier new NaiveBayes classifiertrainarrtransform arrlabel classifiertrainarrtransform arrlabel arrtestset Hello Chiangmai I am Siam I want to go Universal Studio I want to go Universal Studio because I want to watch spider man Sonic in vectorizertransformarrtestset transformertransformarrtestset result classifierpredictarrtestset vardumpresult modelManager new ModelManager modelManagersaveToFileclassifier bbcphpml Stack errors Call Stack main testephp Phpml FeatureExtraction TfIdfTransformerconstruct testephp Phpml FeatureExtraction TfIdfTransformerfit TfIdfTransformerphp Seems a method getRandomPoint uses values to randomize points but need to be used indexes of an array of values to get values by random chosen index point n randomintmin n max n need to be replaced with something like this point n dataarray n randomintminvalindex n maxvalindex n because a randomint now limits usage only integer data values Is their a way to get a percentage of how certain the classifier is based on the input and the labels My dataset consist of target class both have data data total While using StratifiedRandomSplit to split it into random traintest samples i found that there is two same data in the test samples i already check the original data and the data is just one
