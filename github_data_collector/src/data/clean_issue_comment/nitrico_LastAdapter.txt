For those who want to use new architecture comonent and PageableList I created I just migrated whole project to Android Studio gradle Kotlin I cant build project due to error with generated binding class Do you have any idea what might be the cause Cleaning project does not help here Im using databinding compiler from androidx reference but i doubt that this have any impact on this Since version Android Studio supports databinding to LiveData But in order to track changes of a LiveData field ViewDataBinding object must be provided with LifecycleOwner which LastAdapter does not So binding to LiveData via LastAdapter is efficiently onetime binding Please add possibility to pass LifecycleOwner into LastAdapter probably constructor argument will do fine orggradleapitasksTaskExecutionException Execution failed for task appkaptGenerateStubsDebugKotlin Just tried to update my project to AndroidX and LastAdapter took issue with the change despite the Refactoring Tool claiming to use dependency translation to enable compatibility with Supportlibrarybased libraries There is a problem with LayoutHandlerAdapter I want to use it in my project when LastAdapter with Layout is loader Ive got KotlinNullPointerException Here is my code LastAdapterviewModelconversation BRitemlayout item whenitem is ContactItem if itemisCustomer Rlayoutitemclient else Rlayoutitemservice else Rlayoutitemservice intoclaimContactRv When I use normal LastAdapter without LayoutHandling everything works well I also run example project and get the same error I paste it

used your library its save my work time but how can i use more LastAdapter Are each BR must be item variabel or must same name BRitem Thanks before i hope you understand what i ask Android studio Canary introduces Databinding compiler which introduces new changes which are breaking for library consumers As per Release Notes binding code is generated and packaged in AAR and dependent modules are no longer regenerating library bindings Also as per documentation this changes are backward incompatible means consumers of Databinding v cant use library or code generated against Databinding v Another change as stated here data binding inflation methods inflate and setContentView etc will return nullable bindings Null in case of layout is not binding layout Which is breaking change for consumers This pull request facilitates both above stated changes but I suggest be cautious as the changes are for alpha release of plugin here is a item which include image and text now i want to use adapter notifyItemChangedposition payload method to just refresh the text not the image but in the codejust holderbindingexecutePendingBindings still will refresh the image so how to refresh item special element in databinding
