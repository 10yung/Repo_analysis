Ive been trying to build Dust D with Raspbian OS but I seem to be missing some files usrbinld cannot find linstantmeshes usrbinld cannot find ltbbstatic I followed the tutorial from I try to import obj to try the software to use it in our photogrammetry workflow cause some options are very interesting in the post treatment but never found how to do it is it possible Love what you guys did Dust D is absolutely perfect to work from an IPAD PRO would you consider releasing it on app store As soon as I open any example it appears on the screen then immediately closes the window crashes The terminal from which the app is executed writes userhostAppImage dust d beta x AppImage An exception in floating point operation RAM stack was dumped to disk Ive tried versions dust d beta x AppImage dust d beta x AppImage this is something I have noticed with models I was practicing with dust d id send the actual files but it crashed when I was about to send this originally but this second time I did get a screen shot am quite confused as to why the model has its left leg on the right hand side its really odd so when I then put in the right armleg it will go to the left hand side im not sure what im doing wrong since im just testing things out right away plus looked at how you had set things up in a video thanks img width altScreenshot at src again great software fantastic fast but extra export options would be nice I had to use blender for a simple tutorial I was making in which I needed several different file formats to show them loading into a project but it would be nice if dust d had extra export options such as these ones from blender screenshot below im not saying all of these would be nice but some extra formats would be great more so because of peoples preferences though I do know fbx is in the options already if not thats fine but just more so asking img width altScreenshot at src thanks again for this great software cant wait to dive in further get some nice models made for my own projects even teachings I have had issues with Dust D UI scaling on both Windows and Linux The screenshot below shows the parts window with the UI too small to be usable and it does not scale to fill the space when I drag the separator between d workspace and the side menu Screenshot from This screenshot was taken from a p monitor but the same issue occurs for me on p monitors I am not sure if this is a duplicate of a previous issue regarding UI sizing Hi Would be great for d printing to have the ability to export to stl Following are examples of why a coordinate system orientation display would help with modeling frontside Without it lots of mental load and management on the brain ensues topside Thank you Satish At the moment I need to go find older files from the file system It will be very beneficial to add a menu in the File menu that will let us load recently usedloaded files Thank you Satish
