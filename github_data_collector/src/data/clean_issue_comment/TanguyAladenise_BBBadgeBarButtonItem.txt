I am not able to resize badgeSize using badgeMinSize I inserted a property to change the corner radius of the badge It includes a constant called BadgeCornerRadiusAutomatic that if you set the corner radius to that constant the badge will always be round if not it uses the value on the property When in use I found it was hard to tap on the configured BBBarButtonItem whilst it was showing a badge Therefore theres added an property to configure userInteractionEnabled for the badge label Settings userInteractionEnabled to false will result in a visible view but taps will be redirected to the barButton NSInteger count listOfUnread count listOfUnread count BBBadgeBarButtonItem barButton BBBadgeBarButtonItem alloc initWithCustomUIButtonshow barButtonbadgeValue NSString stringWithFormatlu count barButtonbadgeBGColor colorBadgeColor barButtonshouldHideBadgeAtZero YES barButtonshouldAnimateBadge YES this is how im using your framework but when listOfUnreadcount is the badge doesnt disappear it stays there with a Hi guys I tried to do an animation on the BarButton while a Badge was displayed Since the Badge is attached to the Button both will rotate I only want the button image to rotate without the badge Couldnt find a way to do that Any inputs Badge label just disappeared after adding a UISearchBar to navigation bars title view I could not even put it back to work after UISearchBar was removed from navigation bar Tried many hacky ways as well but neither did work so Im puzzled Thank you TanguyAladenise for your effort When the application is RTL mode i need to change alignment badge to left Thank you again Adding configuration to allow the integration of the BBBadgeBarButtonItem to set the duration of the animation between badge count changes and to set whether the animation should be ran on the initial creation of the badge indicator eg go from to with an animation I have just upgraded one of my Apps under development to iOS and I have found that all navigationbar UIBarButtons have just disappeared and are not shown on the navigation bar
