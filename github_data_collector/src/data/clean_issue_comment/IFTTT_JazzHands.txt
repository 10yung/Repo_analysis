Please add support for swift package manager as soon as possible Thank you iPhone X safeAero Fix code style Previously I had this code voidsetViewUIView view hiddenAtEndOfAnimationBOOLhidden atPagePagepage IFTTTHideAnimation hideAnimation IFTTTHideAnimation alloc initWithViewview hideAnimation addKeyFrame IFTTTAnimationKeyFrame alloc initWithTimepageleft andHiddenhidden hideAnimation addKeyFrame IFTTTAnimationKeyFrame alloc initWithTimepageright andHiddenhidden hideAnimation addKeyFrame IFTTTAnimationKeyFrame alloc initWithTimepageright andHiddenhidden selfcontentAnimator addAnimationhideAnimation but with the latest version this is impossible as there is no simple init that only sets the view Highly dissapointed I apologize if this question seems basic to some but I am a bit of a newbie I have tried for hours to tweak the demo code to make the animation execute on a normal uiviewcontroller not the scrollview that they provide I would really appreciate any feedback Is this possible Thank you Hi I used your JazzHands to build a app guide page and found a little issue about position of animation issue in iOS while in other version of iOS is fine I made a demo about how that issue appears here is the repo here is the incorrect position after animation iOS here is the correct position after animation iOS Hope you can help me to solve it Thanks Any really simple way to get a callback when specific page is shown If not trivial do you think it make sense to add it on voidanimateCurrentFrame super animateCurrentFrame iffloorfselfpageOffset selfpageOffset did scroll to page selfpageOffset should it be implemented directly in the lib as a method to subclass or even a delegate what do you think
