Hi Thanks for this great package Is it possible to use themecombmatrix to fill different points with different colors I currently can only figure out how to change all points to a single color I have tried giving multiple colors here but it doesnt seem to work ggplotresglia aesxCelltype geombarfillcrepblack red repblack themepubr scalexupsetnintersections themecombmatrix combmatrixpanelpointcolorfill crepblack red repblack Thanks Dylan I am sure that this is something someone will want but I currently dont have the capacity to implement this But this would a great issue for somebody to try and make a pull request Thus if you want to learn more about the internals of ggplot writing an extension and contribute to an open source just comment with any questions you have and I will try to help you as good as I can A good place to start is to look at the renderaxish and the makecombinationmatrixplot function in axiscombmatrixR file In addition it probably is also a good idea to use the debugger to understand how ggplot step by step builds up the plot by calling debugonceggplot ggplotbuildggplot
