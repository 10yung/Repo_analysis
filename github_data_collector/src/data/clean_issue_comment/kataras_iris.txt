for work with specific archive files compression encryption etc And i want to publish my web server under BSD Clause license In my project i use Iris and Iris logger as basement Im not going to use the name of your project to promote my project Can I publish my project under the BSD Clause license Thanks Hey again Our developers are developed by Aiarron of the frontend developer Desmond and ZRothschild and Yusn of the backend developer We have jointly developed the Go Web Iris Chinese community using the go Iris framework And for this document is translated from English to Chinese and we will also translate other documents and promote it in the go development community in China so that more people Its easier to learn Iris and we hope that more people will use it than it is to be good with Iris We are considering using Iris for a product in my company and I would like to know if it is ready for production and to scale in a cluser of dozens of servers Dear fellow gophers Iris users and lurkers we are all lucky to be here and use this wonderful go framework called Iris I am glad to see that Iris has grown into a mature software that is used and trusted by many of us in our projects from small individual developers to large teams There have been a lot of good changes lately that made Iris more powerful than ever before and this is just the start easy to use but in the same time and with very good performance But in my opinion the most important thing what makes Iris truly different from other frameworks is its documentation which is very important for the our user base especially for newcomers And Iris docs are doing a tremendous job explaining all the aspects of the framework with its documentation by using a big variety of examples Now having all that said lets move to the issue part for this ticket I already mentioned that the documentations are plain awesome but only if you understand english Now lets point out the second most used spoken language by Golang devs well I think you already know of whom I am talking about you probably already guessed its the Chinese users I have also noticed myself that more and more Chinese users are opening different issues here and probably many of them looking around trying to grasp and get a hold of using Iris but unfortunately the language barrier stops them from achieving that since we all know that a very small percentage of Chinas population actually speaks english But we dont stop here All Iris users from all over the world can give a hand by helping with translation in there native language So by all means I am making a call to all Iris users here that know English different language and want to help and make Iris a more welcoming place for there fellow compatriots by translating as much as they can of the Iris project Now lets get down to business and see what exactly I mean by that These are the main things that need to be translated ordered by priority there areo two md files that need to be translated READMEmd and HISTORYmd please submit a PR for this with the following file naming READMELanguageCodemd and HISTORYLanguageCodemd ie READMEZHmd HISTORYZHmd a list of language codes by country there is one md file here that needs to be translated READMEmd please submit a PR for this with the following file naming READMELanguageCodemd here I decided to make a new website using the cn TLD so the final domain name will be irisgocn where we will be adding the same information from irisgocom but translated in Chinese Also a good thing to keep in mind if you want take part to this is to check also the English version for mistakes doing the translation process Lets all build a better web together thats what opensource its all about Translations to do x Chinese ZH x Greek
