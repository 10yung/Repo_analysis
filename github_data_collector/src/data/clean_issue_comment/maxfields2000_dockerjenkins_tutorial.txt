Not sure what I am doing wrong but in the step where I try to connect to http data source for the graphite it says http error not found I followed the directions exactly and tried to modify troubleshoot but I am not getting very far I wonder if something changed since years ago Hi Max I know you are super busy and really hope you even just glimpse at my issue Im having issues with the Jenkins container Its behind my NGINX proxy I access it as you do on After I log in I get kicked to Some links on Jenkins also does the same and removes the port which brakes the screen My NGINX conf file is like so server listen servername accesslog off location proxypass proxysetheader Host host proxysetheader XRealIP remoteaddr proxysetheader XForwardedFor proxyaddxforwardedfor proxysetheader XForwardedProto http proxymaxtempfilesize proxyconnecttimeout proxysendtimeout proxyreadtimeout proxybuffersize k proxybuffers k proxybusybufferssize k proxytempfilewritesize k Ive googled tried adding a new listener to port like you mentioned on your tutorial Trying to set this up to convince containers for work Thanks for any help you can Thanks Kieran Have you considered including an initgroovyd script to automate the setup of dockerplugin Going through the frontend is good for the tutorial but it is tedious to perform those steps more than once The dockerplugin docs has a rough template for the setup script but it excludes the pull strategy and connect method moreover it seems like the docs are still showing deprecated usage I understand that configuring Jenkins falls outside the scope of your guide which is excellent by the way thank you but including the groovy script will expose another important aspect of automating Jenkins Do you find that reasoning sound The readme says Rebuild without blowing away local data make stop make clean make build make run But the makefile doesnt content the clean target It does cleandata and cleanimages so I suppose that make clean should be make cleandata Also Rebuild AND blow away local data make stop make cleandata make build make run That I suppose should be make cleanimages instead of make cleandata Hi maxfields Im so thankful for this tutorial I just a few inquiry Is it possible to deploy this to ECS Also if i use this for Production what would you recommend changing Thanks Newbie for Jenkins and Docker Hey maxfields Max this is more a question around YADP but I was wondering whether you had a come across it and maybe have a successful implementation and b think its a good idea or not to assign multiple docker hosts to a single YADP Cloud under a load balancer I have also asked this question on the YADP issues log here What I want to do is provide a cluster of docker hosts assigned to a YADP Cloud that are available to spin up ephemeral slaves to provide both scalability and resilience I seem to recall that amongst your blog posts you suggested you were running a farm of hosts for that purpose but I could be making a leap here So what I did was to use a value for the Docker URL property in the YADP Cloud specification to point to a load balancer in my case and AWS ELB under which there are multiple docker host instances My observed behaviour If I have a SINGLE instance under the ELB slave containers launch successfully and run whatever job you ask them to harvest the results and then terminate cleanly If I attach a second host to the ELB and execute a Jenkins job multiple containers launch on BOTH hosts and continue to do so until you abort the job In the Jenkins log you see lots of exception messages like this with differing container ids Error during callback comgithubkostyashayaddockerjavacomgithubdockerjavaapiexceptionNotFoundException messageNo such container f ea e d bb a d fbc b f d d d bf fd When you abort the job you have a bunch of containers to clean up on both hosts as well as a failed job So Im not sure if this plugin only works with single docker hosts or it can be configured to a load balanced cluster I prefer the latter Do you think this is a reasonable approach or would you suggest that a YADP Cloud should only ever refer to a single docker host I had some further thoughts about defining my docker hosts within a docker swarm cluster since the swarm master know where all the containers are and should be able to route to them given a container or service id However in reading over the YADP issues log it appears that the plugin doesnt support swarm mode I havent tried it yet but swarms unit of deployment is a service rather than an individual container Any thoughts much appreciated Regards Fraser
