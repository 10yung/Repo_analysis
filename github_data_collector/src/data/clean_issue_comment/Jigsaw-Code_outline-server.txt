 Implements the user interface to configure access key data transfer limits on the Outline Manager app The feature is currently an experiment which is why we have a new section in the server settings

to see if we can help you Hello All is there anyway even third party solution to restrict access key per device or to have one session per access key The error message comes after trying to start the app from inside Finder Outline Manager cannot be opened since Apple cannot scan for malware This software needs to be updated get in touch with the developers or others with comcenturylinklabswatchtowerenabletrue label Might fix issue Same as in happened to me after installation many running containers got upgraded automatically but thankfully nothing broke After this change installed server again and seems to be working just fine non of the other images have been pulled automatically and containers upgraded Hi i have configured a centos server in linux and connected API key of outline setup to my outline manager however the thing is when you connect with my outline key no webpage or any ports are available let say you connect to a server with no outgoing ports But i have allowed all the ports and ips in my server here is my UFW rules Status active To Action From SSH ALLOW Anywhere mDNS ALLOW Anywhere tcp ALLOW Anywhere udp ALLOW Anywhere

gives standardinitlinuxgo exec user process caused exec format error repeatedely i am running this in Raspberry Pi and i am assuming this has to with that ie it being ARM pretty strange even running from docker will create this issue my docker is running fine otherwise
