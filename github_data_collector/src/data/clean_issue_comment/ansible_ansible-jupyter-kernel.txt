 Status READY Description I am trying to integrate some ipython magics with ansible on SOS kernel I am able to set ansiblerunner directory and use defined var and hosts files But using ansiblekernel I am not able to achieve the same I tried going through the code where inside ansibleconfigbaseyml DEFAULTHOSTLIST has etcansiblehosts as default But adding any inventory there doesnt seem to work Is there any existing method to control inventory Having a method to control inventory and play storage files can help share common resources across notebooks without having to rewrite common code Thankyou for any help in advance Describe the bug ansible kernel hangs under MacOSX and python To Reproduce Create a fresh conda environent and ansible kernel does not work conda create n ansible

a chat room You can visit it here This pullrequest adds this badge to your READMEmd Gitter If my aim is a little off please let me know Happy chatting PS Click here if you would prefer not to receive automatic pullrequests from Gitter in future Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Currently the play context does not end under normal operation Describe the solution youd like Ansibleplaybook command provides a summary at the end of the run Provide the same functionality in the Jupyter Notebook It would be nice to have a well designed HTML summary for the tasks Describe alternatives youve considered Not providing a summary This is the current state of the tool The tests in tests should be run and verified from an automated process This could be done by running them through jupyter console using nightwatch to run them in the browser or both
