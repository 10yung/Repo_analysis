workarounds resolution or progress updates Bug report Description webhint VSCode plugin shows error for ulli if lis are generated with code img width altimage src Environment hint version v Nodejs version v OS macOS Mojave URL for which webhint failed na webhint configuration Default configuration Bug report I was running the browser extension against a subgrid demo and display subgrid isnt being flagged as not supported in browsers except firefox its supported there Bug report Description webhint VS Code extension hangs if hint is present in nodemodules ie hint is in packagejson and npm install is run in project folder Repro steps Open web project that has hint in packagejson before running npm install to see feedback from webhint Run npm install in project folder Output shows the following message webhint feedback does not appear in Problems pane Deleting hint and hint from nodemodules and reloading VS Code restores functionality Environment hint version webhint VS Code

proposals up my sleeve yet just some searches on noun project img width altimage src This is what I have running the latest version of webhint on the website We are getting an Error because we are missing webkitfilter and webkitsticky even though those browsers are not in the default browser support matrix I believe this should only be an Error if adding the missing property helps somehow the browsers that we target warning otherwise antross Malvoz digitarald thoughts about this This is part of the work requested by the OpenJS Foundation in and needs approval from the maintainers and maybe
