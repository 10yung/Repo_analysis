Using Xcode GM with Swift tells me to convert APNGKit to support Swift I can see only one line of code needs to be changed will we see an update for that Thanks MSStickers object expects an URL How do I use this with the iMessage Stickers Sometimes my app crashes when removing APNGImageView in ObjectiveC coded UIViewController In case of Swift thats not happen I think this workaround is not enough for ObjectiveC In ObjectiveC sometimes deinit is not called when removing the APNGImageView from the parent view because of AutoreleasePool So this workaround dose not affect and crash it commit f e b ac cced a a de a c bc causes this issue if an image is hidden and the app enters background when entering foreground again the image appears and animates This commit does not covers the case if isHidden true In my app I have a looping animation One thing Ive notice is the animation will start from index when all I want is the animation to resume from where it left off This adds the ability to pause the animation Ive updated the WillResignActive so that when it resumes it keeps the same index and resumes the animation instead of starting from again This results in a cleaner app and less jaring when the animation resets itself demo timer The repeat count info is not working The repleatCount in png metadata means that repeat animation after end of the last play So means that time animation from first frame means that times repeat means that time repeat REF numplays indicates the number of times that this animation should play if it is the animation should play indefinitely If nonzero the animation should come to rest on the final frame at the end of the last play Hello Ive been using the library for quite a long time and its great Recently I found an issue with specific apng files which leads to and unexpected output when loading the file with the library There is no different method when loading apng files it just happen sometimes to specific files Here you have a video of the glitch look at the vertical line created between the letter t and y actualresult And here the expected result expectedresult Here you can download all the related files apngbugreportzip Thanks Hey Im trying to use APNGKit with Carthage in ObjectiveC context I cant use Swift because its an Unity project Is this combination possible I imported APNGKitAPNGKitSwifth but the header file does only expose the default init and initWithDecoder methods I tried APNGImage alloc contentsOfFile wich throws No visible interface for APNGImage declares the selector contentsOfFile
