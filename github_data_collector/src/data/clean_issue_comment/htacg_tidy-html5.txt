documentation says MSCVER Only ENABLEDEBUGLOG is automatically enabled in the Debug build unless DISABLEDEBUGLOG is defined See tidyplatformh And there seems to be no way to disable other than defining DISABLEDEBUGLOG This seems bizarre Why shouldnt ENABLEDEBUGLOGOFF be honored on all platforms While working on I found this problematic statement in READMEOPTIONSmd In tidyenumh the TidyOptionId can be in any order but please try to keep things alphabetical When adding an option in the middle all other option ids get pushed down effectively incremented by one This would break binary compatibility and expectations of existing programs for example when such a program invokes tidyGetOptiontd TidyCSSPrefix If I were to add a a TidyAaaargh option and retaining alphabetical order TidyCSSPrefix would become and the program would receive from tidyGetOption the option for TidyCoerceEndTags new I therefore seek reaffirmation that removing the do it alphabetical clause is the right thing to do lest the SO version of the library must be bumped almost everytime such a new option is added The same holds true for any other enum that is publicly exposed including but not

generally does not get held up by size limits of MTAs Hello What about package For Sublime Text slot was added to the WHATWG HTML Living Standard on April On tidy man page before Configuration options can be specified there is a missing header causing this to still be part of the XML discussion REChtml says A successful control must be defined within a FORM element and must have a control name Alas tidy allowed me to forget that I needed a name in input typefile multiple causing it not to append the selected files in the browser So at least for typefile do catch it when people forget a name
