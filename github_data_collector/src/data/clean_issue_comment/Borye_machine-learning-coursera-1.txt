 This code runs slightly faster as it does not need to iterate through all rows just through the positive values Optimized the code in the cost function of the multi variable cost function file for better performance Changed the value of alpha in the Multi variable ex multim file for better results Also earlier number of iterations required were greater than but the value of numiters was Now the number of iterations can also be changed to a lesser value smaller than simplified solution without a for loop more elegant way to solve the exercise
