The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

security fix PRs for this repo from the Security Alerts page details Hello guys I want to send an event When user clicked on Add to home Screen button any help Im using angular Im submitting a x feature request What is the motivation use case for changing the behavior For URLs including matrix parameters it would be great to have a feature to clear these params as we do this with pageTrackingclearQueryParams true Example with pageTrackingclearMatrixParams true becomes For support questions please consider using Gitter Chat Im submitting a x bug report feature request question about the decisions made in the repository If the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem At the moment the All Pages section under the site content Site Content All Pages on google analytics is empty It doesnt send any information Here some pictures However I receive under the Events Pages the visited pages by the user Here is a fraction of the code appcomponentts export class AppComponent implements OnInit constructorprivate router Router private fbTrackingAnalyticsAngulartics Facebook private googleTrackingAnalytics

End Google Tag Manager I have the following tags in google tag manager I think it is not the problem of the library but a misconfiguration on my side What is the expected behavior The library should send the correct information to the google analytics website What is the motivation use case for changing the behavior Environment please run the following and copy the output sh nodemodulesbinng version What kind of change does this PR introduce Adds additional properties to Page Track and also add ability within Adobe Omniture provider to override page name and not be forced to use the site URL What is the current behavior Link to open issue Not able to add additional parameters to page tracking What is the new behavior page tracking allows passing of additional parameters and adobe can override page name from the url Note I am using Angular and Angulartics v but those are only tags and not branches so it would be nice if the previous major release versions could have an updated branch so that they can have this feature to Im submitting a bug report feature request x question about the decisions made in the repository If the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem Importing Angulartics Module into approutingmodulets allows page tracking to work but not event tracking Moving the import to appmodulets allows both features to work This should be explained in the documentation as its confusing some features work and others dont by import location When running Angulatics locally you enable developerMode but theres no way to debug that the events are being sent Expecting that to be highlighted more in the documentation and if developerMode is set to true why doesnt it consolelog the events for debugging What is the expected behavior Documentation to explain correct location appmodulets to import Angulartics Module and that event tracking doesnt work if imported into approutingmodulets Documentation to explain developerMode options and how to debug events locally What is the motivation use case for changing the behavior Confusing to someone trying to use the

steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem Summary When any nondefault pageTracking is configured for Angulartics page views the corresponding clearUrl page handling is not applied when processing eventTrack triggers As a result GA events report the simple hash substring URL if an explicit page property has not been set on the event binding which overrides the originally configured page view report in Google Analytics Content dashboard This results in cleared IDs and QueryParams still appearing in GA whenever events are fired Reproduction info and code points App module provider config typescript providers provide ANGULARTICS TOKEN useValue settings pageTracking clearIds true clearQueryParams true as Angulartics Settings Configure an angulartics Onclick button in the app Observe the GA PageView request args t pageview dl dp exampleroute Observe the GA Event request args t event dl dp exampleroute queryArgexample Related code points GA page metadata fallbacks page metadata config with browser hash fallback when not explicitly set default pageview behavior when not customized angulartics core trackUrlChanges URL clearing logic executed for page view requests angulartics On eventTrack What is the expected behavior GA events page information dp param should be reported in the same fashion as the pageview page information otherwise default format page views are erroneously reported in GA What is the motivation use case for changing the behavior Proper GA content page view reporting so that stripped ID and customized URLs are not reported when firing page events Environment sh Angular CLI Node OS win x Angular animations compiler compilercli core forms languageservice platformbrowser platformbrowserdynamic router Package
