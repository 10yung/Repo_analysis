Hi there I am wandering if the rest API is safe to expose publicly documenting it in OpenAPI format and extending it with application specific code Has anybody done this I have noticed a few issues with paswordless auth are these to be considered bugs User joins via paswordless it says on the user screen that they signed up via google If user doesnt have a photo thier name doesnt display on the team members list if a user is invited to join a team then signs in paswordless with the same email it assumes they are creating a new account If they then sign in using google they have lost access to that old team and now join that newly created account phrdetails summaryClick to see bHill for issue bsummary divimg src altSingle issue hill classs image width divdetails detailssummaryClick to
