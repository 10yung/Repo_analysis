Since the context package is part of standard library I think we should support it And webgo had a struct called Context and is used to passing values to handler I think we can reuse it as a contextContext interface The easist way to do it is embed the contextContext from httpRequestContext to webgos Context Since go module is the official package management tool its better to support it Fix the format error and let latest go compile can compile it Bumped the go version in travis file also dropped old version go support because some dependency package is not supported and cant compiled on this versions Every exported function in a program should have a doc comment The first sentence should be a summary that starts with the name being declared From effective go PR generated by CodeLingo Install here to drive Continuous Higher Standards Windows x go version go windowsamd go get githubcomhoisieweb results in githubcom hoisie web ttycolorsgo cannot use syscallStdout type syscallHandle as type int in argument to terminalIsTerminal Hi Firstly thank you for your great work Since HTTPClient in Angular forces a cors preflight request it would be great if webgo would handle this natively See Thanks THX a lot diff git attycolorsgo bttycolorsgo index fe c aa b attycolorsgo bttycolorsgo package web import golangorgxcryptosshterminal syscall os var ttyCodes struct func ttyBoldcode string string func ttyEscapecode string string if terminalIsTerminalsyscallStdout if terminalIsTerminalintosStdoutFd return x b code m else return
