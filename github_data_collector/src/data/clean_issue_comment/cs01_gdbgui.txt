When I am using gdbgui to debug Linux kernel remotely I noticed that gdbgui will cause some exceptions pasted at the end of this issue for some reason And looks like the reason is that those artifact commands are causing the issue Hence I am requesting raw mode when this mode is enabled no artificial commands will be sent This mode may prevent some features working properly those need artificial commands to work and it is acceptable Pasted Log No gdb response received after seconds Possible reasons include gdbgui gdb or the debugged process is not running gdb or the inferior process is busy running and needs to be interrupted press the pause button up top Something is just taking a long time to finish and respond back to this browser window in which case you can just keep waiting Bumps

properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th Bugfixes fix use

easier to connect to a gdbserver on a remote target You can not specify to connect to targetipport You always have to use the drop down list The command line arguments always look for a local program It would be nice to use something like gdbgui target targetipport I have tried adding the target remote to a gdb script that I use target remote The downside to this is that gdbgui doesnt stop at main but at for me dlstart It also mandates creating a gdb init script so the command line would be something like gdbgui g GDB gdbargs ix gdbscript Python error error under cygwin ERROR Traceback most

is like Once I open gdbgui the font changes automatically and looks very ugly How can I solve the issue Thanks Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe The frontend terminal is not truly interactive gdb behaves differently when it is connected to a terminal and will prompt and wait for user responses rather than assume things and carry on Describe the solution youd like A fully interactive terminal with gdb in the frontend xtermjs can be used to render the terminal and Python ptys can be used on the backend One will be created for the user to interact with and another for the UI to sendreceive gdbs mi messages Describe alternatives youve considered A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features youve considered Additional context can be used to render the terminal in the frontend The newui command can be used to split IO between the UI for the gui and the terminal for the user Describe the bug In the command prompt of the tool I am debugging it uses a csh shell as its prompt every time I run any command some extra gdb related commands are executed along with it Screenshots toolprompt Error unknown command threadinfo toolprompt
