 What is this Python project Pybotics is an opensource Python toolbox for robot kinematics and calibration It was designed to provide a simple clear and concise interface to quickly simulate and evaluate common robot concepts such as kinematics dynamics trajectory generations and calibration The toolbox is specifically designed for use with the Modified Denavit Hartenberg parameters convention Applications Examples Basic Usage examplesbasicusagepy Kinematics exampleskinematicsipynb Calibration examplescalibrationipynb Trajectory and Path Planning examplestrajectorygenerationipynb Machine Learning examplesmachinelearningipynb Dynamics examplesdynamicsipynb This toolbox was featured in the Journal of Open Source Software Whats the difference between this Python project and similar ones As MATLAB is not necessarily readily available outside of academia Pybotics was originally developed as a fully opensource alternative to the Robotics Toolbox by Peter Corke rospy is a client for the ROS framework and performs a different function PythonRobotics is a repository of code samples primarily focusing on trajectory planning for mobile robotics Pybotics focuses more on industrial robots and is a framework for modelling robots Pybotics can be integrated with the above two packages as the modelling component Anyone who agrees with this pull request could vote for it

code and suggests improvements which you can then apply instantly It is currently available as a PyCharm plugin with VS Code and Github integrations coming soon Whats the difference between this Python project and similar ones Sourcery is completely automated unlike other tools it both identifies the problems and suggests the code changes It can suggest complex refactorings that dramatically improve code readability in one step It is also safe it uses static code analysis to check that all refactoring suggestions wont change the existing functionality Anyone who agrees with this pull

it is changed unless a transaction is active Transactions may use a context manager and be nested and discard changes if the transaction manager is exited with an exception Whats the difference between this Python project and similar ones compared to pickleDB pythonsonstore has transactions appears to have better documentation of use Anyone who agrees with this pull request could vote for it

popular desktop downloader program Whats the difference between this Python project and similar ones Not aware of other downloader Desktop applications that are Python based Anyone who agrees with

standard libs used to the point no bells and whistles Microsoft Excel readerwritercoming soon python library Whats the difference between this Python project and similar ones compatability small lib pylightxl has no external dependencies only uses python builtin standard libs compatability pylightxl was written to be compatible for python it does not impose rules on users to switch versions small lib pylightxl was written to simply readwrite thereby making the library small without any bells or whiles which makes it easy to compile with pyinstaller and other packagers user friendly pylightxl was written to be as pythonic and easy to use as possible Core developers actively survey stackoverflow questions on working with excel files to tailor the API for most common problems see xlrd before pylightxl Note that xlrd library is very similar in values to pylightxl but with much more functionality Please take a look at xlrd to see if it is a good fit for your project So why pick pylightxl over xlrd that has much more to offer Currently xlrd does not have any active developers Pylightxl is a new library aimed to help solve current excel data issues as surveyed by stackoverflow please submit your suggestions to help improve this library together Anyone who agrees with this pull request could vote for it by adding a to it and usually the maintainer will merge it when votes reach added nosqlmodels What is this Python project nosqlmodel is a first nonrelational NoSql ORM framework Easy way to create models with a nosql backend Whats the difference between this Python project and similar ones There is no smilar nosql ORM frameworks with multi backends Anyone who agrees with this pull request could vote for it by adding a to it and usually the maintainer will merge it when votes reach What is this Python project Buildbot is the Continuous Integration Framework Configuration as Code Whats the difference between this Python project and similar ones I havent seen any other projects written in Python that do these same tasks that worked as well Anyone who agrees with this pull request could vote for it by adding a to it and usually the maintainer will merge it when votes reach Other notes There have been other attempts to add this to the Awesome list before These just hadnt got the number of votes required to be merged What is this Python project Quart is a Python ASGI web microframework It is intended to provide the easiest way to use asyncio functionality in a web context especially with existing Flask apps This is possible as the Quart API is a superset of the Flask API Quart aims to be a complete web microframework as it supports HTTP HTTP and websockets Quart is very extendable and has a number of known extensions and works with many of the Flask extensions Whats the difference between this Python project and similar ones Quart supports the full ASGI specification as well as the websocket response and HTTP server push extensions For those of you familiar with Flask Quart extends the FlaskAPI by adding support for HTTP request streaming Websockets HTTP server push Anyone who agrees with this pull request could vote for it by adding a to it
