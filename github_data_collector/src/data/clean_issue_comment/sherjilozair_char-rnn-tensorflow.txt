 Thank you very much for your contribution but I have a question I need to train the RNN model for digital data A time series in numerical formFinally I need to classify or predict the data But I dont know how to change the database and what parameters to modify First of all Im confused as of how the savedir works if I train a network pointing to a directory and then eventually train another one pointing to that same one it seems like it overwrites properly the older data but does not clear the extradata from the older model I think this is what caused the assert savedchars dataloaderchars Data and loaded model disagree on character set to trigger Secondly is this a correct way of using the command python samplepy n savedirtestSave Thirdly what is the prime attribute of the sample And why does python samplepy take so long to execute Lastly Im wondering if Im using the code properly since I have only downloaded the CPU version of TensorFlow However your documentation mentions that I we are supposed to add some lines of code but not where would you mind explaining a bit more the process if I want to use the CPU way Thank you so much This is pretty neat Currently teaching the Network to come up with fake laws haha sorrythis is a test Is it possible to export this model into TFlite Would i have to convert the model into a TFLite flatbuffer This PR is the same as but merge conflicts are fixed I also got rid of the assignment to selfprobs in the constructor because its overwritten and moved the calculation out of the loop in sample Someone did comment here about not wanting to overwrite the default temperature probs Not sure if this is still a concern I created a route localhost predict to run the model with the given statement statement You helped the customer in troubleshooting the Cable issue and you asked but It gives error below error File C Users surinderkumar AppData Local conda conda envs tia lib sitepackages flaskrestful initpy line in dispatchrequest resp methargs kwargs File D surinder ds test textclassificationprojects charrnntensorflow wordpredictpy line in post saver tftrainSaver File C Users surinderkumar AppData Local conda conda envs tia lib sitepackages tensorflow python training saverpy line in init selfbuild File C Users surinderkumar AppData Local conda conda envs tia lib sitepackages tensorflow python training saverpy line in build selfbuildselffilename buildsaveTrue buildrestoreTrue File C Users surinderkumar AppData Local conda conda envs tia lib sitepackages tensorflow python training saverpy line in build raise ValueErrorNo variables to save ValueError No variables to save Here is the code from future import printfunction import os from sixmoves import cPickle import tensorflow as tf from model import Model from flask import Flask request from flaskrestful import Resource Api app Flaskname api Apiapp params savedir save prime n sample def getmodel with openospathjoinparams savedir configpkl rb as f savedargs cPickleloadf with openospathjoinparams savedir charsvocabpkl rb as f chars vocab cPickleloadf return chars vocab Modelsavedargs trainingFalse class predictResource chars vocab model getmodel def sampleself statement args chars vocab model saver ckpt with tfSession as sess if ckpt and ckptmodelcheckpointpath saverrestoresess ckptmodelcheckpointpath result modelsamplesess chars vocab args n statement args sample encodeutf return result def postself statement requestgetjsonsilentTrue statement result None tfglobalvariablesinitializerrun saver tftrainSaver ckpt tftraingetcheckpointstateparams savedir with tfSession as sess result selfsample statement params predictchars predictvocab predictmodel saver ckpt decodeutf split return statement statement fullstatement result apiaddresourcepredict if name main apprundebugTrue Please help I changed network size from layers to layers and I changed batch size to now after about epochs I see pelpxerity starting to increase which is I think unexpected First about epochs it decreases but then it starts behaving weirdly and resulting model is worse than before epochs Is this a bug Here is my tensorboard plot As you can see at the botton graphs perlexilty is fluctuating bottom right plot Why is that happening I used the program all the day and it worked great but with my last experiment I got the following error message Traceback most recent call last File samplepy line in module main File samplepy line in main sampleargs File samplepy line in sample argssampleencodeutf File C Daten Programmierung Python JokeGenerator charrnntensorflowmaster charrnntensorflowmaster modelpy line in sample x vocab char KeyError Seems like anything is wrong with the arguments but I havent changed anything BTW really nice program fun to use Thank you when generating texts from shakespeares text as input text a lot of n are present Any solution for this
