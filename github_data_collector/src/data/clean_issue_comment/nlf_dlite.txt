without being ask interactively like passing options with flag or something bash dlite init Virtual machine hostname localdocker Disk size in gigabytes CPU cores to allocate to VM Memory to allocate to VM in gigabytes DNS server Docker version latest ce Extra flags to pass to the docker daemon Allow direct connections to containers yes Bug Reports dlite version beta dliteos version beta expected behavior The time should be kept in sync with the MacOS time also when the Mac has been in sleep mode actual behavior If you let your Mac sleep the time inside the dlite os will not be insync when the Mac comes back from sleep steps to reproduce Start dlite Put you Mac to sleep Wake it up after a noticeable time and observe the time When you keep dlite running for days or weeks and you put your MacBook to sleep during nights or weekends the time will be increasingly more off Today the time in dlite was only at Containers inherit the date from dliteos and I ran into problems a container contacted a webservice but failed because it was presented with a TLScertificate from the future I am trying to run ELK from the sebpelk image but I am having trouble setting sysctl w vmmapmaxcount in dlite It works with release but not with beta Bug Reports dlite version in use run dlite version dlite version beta expected behavior vmmaxmapcount should equal in the container actual behavior vmmaxmapcount equals in the container steps to reproduce Init dlite with g memory the memory is strictly not necessary ssh localdocker sudo sysctl w vmmaxmapcount vmmaxmapcount Or set vmmaxmapcount in etcsysctlconf and run sysctl p git clone gitgithubcomCarstenHoyerdliteissuegit cd dliteissue dockercompose up Notice vmmaxmapcount in the output from the container Feature Requests If possible please

vmtty doesnt exist when chown is run causing dlite start to exit with an error steps to reproduce dlite start this is random caused by a race condition opening this issue for myself need to add some code to make sure that vmtty exists before attempting to change permissions on it Bug Reports dlite version in use run dlite version dlite installed on Mac OS X El Capitan expected behavior within docker expecting curl googlecom to return results also getting connection refused when running docker pull or docker import actual behavior curlgooglecom hangs then cant resolve host same for directly curling the IP steps to reproduce docker run rm it container bash then trying to curl Docker image is a modified Ubuntu LTS This is my etcresolvconf within the container nameserver nameserver eth If I run this with regular Docker aka not dlite it works fine It also works fine on a nd machine that has both dlite and regular Docker installed Is there some dlite config that somehow got modified or is missing Has anyone else experienced this Bug Reports dlite version in use run dlite version dlite version beta expected behavior dlite ssh lsmod grep fuse echo has fuse echo no fuse has fuse actual behavior dlite ssh lsmod grep fuse echo has fuse echo no fuse no fuse steps to reproduce dlite ssh lsmod grep fuse echo has fuse echo no fuse Feature Requests Allow the use of fuse kernel extensions in container This seems to be the only way to enable usage of images like xueshanfs fs Please let me know if there are other ways to go about it Bug Reports dlite version in use run dlite version dlite version beta expected behavior Be able to pull docker images actual behavior Error response from daemon Get dial tcp lookup registry dockerio on read udp read connection refused steps to reproduce While dnsmasq is active run dlite start When you execute eg docker pull nginx you will get the error message above I know this issue came up briefly in but that thread was closed Is there a known solution for this so that I can use dnsmasq together with dlite Because dlite seems to work a lot faster and easier than most other solutions I already tried on macOS Things I already tried When I stop dnsmasq and restart dlite the problem goes away Docker starts pulling in the images as it should Great And it seems like it keeps working when I restart dnsmasq after I started dlite Already tried updating my dnsmasqconf for binding to ip restricting it to en WiFi and en ethernet excluding en an interface which only seems to exists when dlite is running
