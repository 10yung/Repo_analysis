If the subset argument is specified then it would be good to include that information in the print output Id like to contribute a vignette that outlines how to do AB testing inference postexperiment with rstanarm functions As discussed here I think it would be useful if it was part of the Additional tutorials on specific modeling techniques and applications section on the vignette page of the rstanarm site jgabry Ive left your comments in and have changed the content based on some of them Also regarding Appendix B I dont fully understand how priors are specified on group specific intercepts when using stanglmer so I just said something to the effect of default priors are used Summary I havent been able to install rstanarm after several attempts R keeps crashing during installation Description and reproducible examples I managed to install rstan by running installpackagesrstan repos dependencies TRUE When I want to install rstanarm everything out there seems to fail Ive tried the following installpackagesrstanarm R crashes and installs a folder called LOCKrstanarm plus the corresponding rstanarm folder When I open R rstanarm is there but after running libraryrstanarm I get Error package or namespace load failed for rstanarm in librarydynamlib package packagelib shared object rstanarmso not found By running installpackagesrstanarm again I get ERROR failed to lock directory homenaleriveRx pclinuxgnulibrary for modifying Try removing homenaleriveRx pclinuxgnulibrary LOCKrstanarm Warning in installpackages installation of package rstanarm had nonzero exit status Deleting that folder has not helped so far From here running if requiredevtools installpackagesdevtools librarydevtools installgithubstandevrstanarm buildvignettes FALSE leads to R crashing again and the same folders as in are installed I also get the same error as in by running libraryrstanarm namely Error package or namespace load failed for rstanarm in librarydynamlib package

Currently the stanjm code ignores offset terms in the longitudinal submodel formula However offset terms can be essential when using nonGaussian distributions such as the negative binomial I have implemented code locally that addresses this issue by including the offset term in the longitudinal submodel The offset term is not included in the linear equation for the event submodel as this would negate the purpose of the offset To address small longitudinal model values that occur by excluding the offset term from the event submodel I have also introduced a scaling parameter for the longitudinal model values in the event submodel Running the following code gives me error r Error in sestanmvregx Not currently implemented Reprex r libraryrstanarm Loading required package Rcpp Registered S method overwritten by xts method from aszooxts zoo rstanarm Version packaged UTC Do not expect the default priors to remain the same in future rstanarm versions Thus R scripts should

models where we may not want a longtailed prior on the sigmas for the random effects it could be nice to allow a halfnormal or something like that instead of requiring a gamma distribution on tau in the decov prior Summary It appears that in stanlm singularok does the opposite of what it is supposed to do I think the logic is backwards somewhere Description In the example below I deleted a cell

slowly in rstanarm Description Its a regression model with collinear predictors and a proper and reasonably strong prior The posterior is fine and well behaved but rstanarm mistakenly does some computations with the likelihood rather than the posterior or prioraugmented likelihood causing major problems Reproducible Steps Heres the R code Ilibraryrstanarm libraryrstan librarycmdstanr x x y c
