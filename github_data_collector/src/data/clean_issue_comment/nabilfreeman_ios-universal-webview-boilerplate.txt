Add a license file please its propietary as far as I know right know When I open the xcodeproject it says I need to migrate Mi webapp has links like sharerphpurlhttps I want the native app to intercept this links and make something like actionsend on android Any idea The webview doesnt seem to resize when rotating to landscape mode Even opening the app in landscape mode doesnt seem to do the trick Am I missing something Any smart way to do a redirect eg meta httpequivrefresh content url Im not sure if webpush would work makes sense here but itd be awesome to incorporate native push broadcast style notifications into the boilerplate Im not super familiar with AppleGCMetc but Id be happy to help implement it with some guidance This is a problem as there are no browser controls Ideal solution would be to instruct the webview to open nonlocal links or whatever in Safari dont know how to do this yet
