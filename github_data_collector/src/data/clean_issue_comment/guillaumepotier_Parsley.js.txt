There should be an easy way to bypass validation Currently the return value of the formvalidate and fieldvalidate are ignored but it could be nice to allow skipping validation Create date comparison validator I find a problem when I use parsleyjs to compare between two inputs with type month or date html input typemonth idfrom namefrom or html input typedate idfrom namefrom the problem is that parsleyjs compares just between years but it doesnt take into consideration days or months when it compares for example I want to make sure that the date in the input from must be near than the input to html input typemonth idfrom namefrom input typemonth idto nameto so I write these two functions to try to fix this problem What kind of issue is this put x between the square brackets Question This

consider asking on first Hello I want to use a group validation Correctly fill at least one of these blocks as But when i submit the form empty nothing is validate Can you reproduce this problem on the official documentation Best regards I have a multistep form with most of the code based on the multistep example on the site and when pressing enter on the first field group shows the validation errors on the next group of fields too Any insights on how to work around this Demo of the issue here TIA What kind of issue is this put x between the square brackets Question This issue tracker is

first Hello I am using Flatpickr as my date UI Everything is working fine on a desktop application however when I test my site on a mobile browser I get a bug Steps Pick a date Hit the submit form this validates all inputs The date input html is as follows input classinput datepickerdob placeholderSelect Date typetext namedateOfBirth dataparsleydate dataparsleyvalidateifempty dataparsleyrequiredtrue datepickerdob is simply the class to which Flatpickr attaches I get the below error even if I remove the dataparsley attributes IMG Flatpickr is set up as below const currDate new Date const newdate new DatecurrDate newdatesetYearcurrDategetFullYear flatpickrdatepickerdob dateFormat dMY maxDate newdate This error goes away when I request the mobile site so I am not sure what is going on here I have recreated this issue on safari and chrome both on an iphone device Any ideas on what could cause this issue Thanks Hi my page does have a fixed header Therefore when there is a wrong entry in a field of the form or a mandatory field not filled page scrolls to the first field with an error Unfortunately this field is covered by my fixed header and therefore not visible Is there a way to change this with some kind of offset to this scroll function Please let me know if you have any idea BR J rgen What kind of issue is this put x between the square brackets Question

consider asking on first In Internet Explorer Parsley only accepts dates in ISO format If youre using an other format for the date like eg the German s default parsley will not accept the date in IE you have to type in Because CodePen blocks IE I have to paste the example here input typedate iddateofbirth namedateofbirth placeholder value Actually if you add for example a dataparsleylength the message is very odd I propose to add these two new validators for a better messaging
