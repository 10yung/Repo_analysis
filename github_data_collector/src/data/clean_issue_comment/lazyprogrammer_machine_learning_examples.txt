Hi In the code cnntoxicpy shouldnt the the condition be if i numwords instead of if i MAXVOCABSIZE prepare embedding matrix printFilling pretrained embeddings numwords minMAXVOCABSIZE lenword idx embeddingmatrix npzerosnumwords EMBEDDINGDIM for word i in word idxitems if i MAXVOCABSIZE embeddingvector word vecgetword if embeddingvector is not None words not found in embedding index will be all zeros embeddingmatrix i embeddingvector Regards Hello It would be great if you could add the project requirements requirementstxt or in some other form Installing the required libraries is not enough since we end up not having the correct library versions for running the code Thanks Closes Tests will run automatically on all code changes Screenshot at Iran is one of the most seismic countries of the world It is situated over the HimalayanAlpide seismic belt and is one of those countries which have lost many human lives and a lot of money due to the occurrence of earthquakes Here a model is built using Machine Learning to predict PGA in this region The dataset was split into input part and the PGA value which was supposed to be predicted The input part was standardised using StandardScalar Now the entire dataset was split into test set and training set We trained the model using Logistic Regression KNearest NeighboursKNN and Random Forest Regression using the training set The trained models were tested with the test set to predict the efficiency of the model Finally two Ensemble models were created combining the previous models one is the Averaging technique and the other is Blending technique The efficiency of the models were predicted by calculating the Mean Average Error MAE Mean Squared Error MSE and Root Mean Squared Error R MSE Lower the value the higher is the efficiency Artificial neural networks ANNs are powerful tools for machine learning with applications in many areas including speech recognition image classification medical diagnosis and spam filtering The Backpropagation algorithm which learns the weights for a multilayer network given a network with a fixed set of units and interconnections It employs gradient descent to attempt to minimize the squared error between the network output values and target values for these outputs To Find a specific hypothesis in a set of hypothesis which is consistent with positive training example I have used Tennis Dataset with one of the most simplest Algorithm Added envenvclose in order to remove the error Traceback most recent call last File homeekeleanaconda envsgpurllibpython sitepackagesgymenvsclassiccontrolrenderingpy line in del File homeekeleanaconda envsgpurllibpython sitepackagesgymenvsclassiccontrolrenderingpy line in close File homeekeleanaconda envsgpurllibpython sitepackagespygletwindowxlibinitpy line in close File homeekeleanaconda envsgpurllibpython sitepackagespygletglxlibpy line in destroy File homeekeleanaconda envsgpurllibpython sitepackagespygletglbasepy line in destroy File homeekeleanaconda envsgpurllibpython sitepackagespygletglxlibpy line in detach File homeekeleanaconda envsgpurllibpython sitepackagespygletgllibpy line in errcheck ImportError sysmetapath is None Python is likely shutting down Hi I use the code DQN I can run the code successfully but I find the GPU utilization is really low about I use the Ti and I use the GPU by adding the code at the begining of the DQN file import os osenviron CUDADEVICEORDER PCIBUSID osenviron CUDAVISIBLEDEVICES How can I improve the GPU utilization Thanks Legacy print statements are syntax errors in Python but print function works as expected in both Python and Python A superset of
