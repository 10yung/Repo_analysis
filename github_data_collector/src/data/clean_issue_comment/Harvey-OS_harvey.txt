Not strictly a requirement for a bootable disk but weve now got GO P scripts with a lot of similar code and have been added while working on image creation There are other files in util that look related too We should consolidate them all into a single go script with sensible args If you create the Harvey USB image according to the steps in the wiki below it cant seem to find the fossil filesystem on the USB stick This occurs when Harvey OS Install is chosen as the boot option from the USB stick This needs to be fixed Image creation steps Make drawterm work when booting from a Harvey image Create an image Tweak install scripts so drawterm is set up automatically Document any changes to setup process in above wiki page From alvaro on slack drawterm and I guess anything which needs auth doesnt work against qcow img standalone cpu generated once it boots If you follow the instructions on the wiki it takes a very long time to create the image This issue is to do some high level profiling and see where the slowness of copying files is really coming from I attempted to clone the repository to my Windows computer but was met with the error cannot create directory at binaux Invalid argument Turns out Windows has reserved folder names and aux is one of them It might be a good idea to change the name of this folder to make it easier for windows users to clone the repo Document steps to set up server at a high level these will differ between environments and how to set up the PXE config Document steps required to boot Harvey from a USB stick with all files hosted via ufs server Currently the Go port on Harvey is not a first class port We need to address the following For now we build Go by setting GOOSplan Necessary changes have to be made so that we can use GOOSharvey instead Efforts should be made so GOOSharvey should imply GOOSplan This should in line with the way GOOSandroid implies linux We should be able to attach and detach repeatedly to the same process or to others in the same session without any problems
