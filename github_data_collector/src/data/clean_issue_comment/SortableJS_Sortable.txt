 Problem I was playing around with Sortable a few months ago and it was working great for large rows tables aside from some strange ghosting issues that only appeared in Chrome on Windows when using Windows built in DPI scaling The version I was using back then was rc I updated my project to use the latest release of Sortable so I could check if the ghosting issue is still present Sadly it is Additionally there is now a large pause before the tr leaves one tbody and enters into the other tbody JSBinJSFiddle demonstrating the problem is rc is latest Nested list tree sort how protect root node Each item can only be moved in the current node Can it be done thanks If I want to refresh sortable instance so it can handle new items added dinamically what do I have to do Thanks Problem I used sortable with angular I have applied that to dynamic components sortable is working fine with the list but if I drag the last one on top and add the new dynamic component it added just below the last element before that sortable it was working fine if not changed that last one and other they working fine please anyone can help me out regarding this issue JSBinJSFiddle demonstrating the problem Before you create an issue check it Try master perhaps the problem has been solved Use the search maybe we already have an answer If not found create an example on jsbincom draft and describe the problem Bindings Angular legacy React ES mixin Polymer Knockout Meteor In reactsortablejs users are looking for programmatic use of this plugin so they can command Sortable to move items This sounds great and Im not sure if this is possible using a plugin with the current architecture as many events rely on interactions between mouse events in the DOM example tsx Sortablemovefrom HTMLElement to HTMLElement options Maybe possible with custom option callback handlers for users to input and then using Sortableutils to do the animation Hi Everyone Were looking to rewrite SortableJS in Typescript Recently owenm and I have been working together on the side to try convert the library We found that its pretty big and it cant be written overnight or even in months without incremental adoption So instead were going to merge it into master safely of course Read the process process for how were going to go about it Why Typescript the language brings many benefits Included and automatically up to date type definitions Easier maintenance for contributors Faster learning of architecture for new contributors Self generating API docs Intellisense in IDE for DX Process Initially Were going to copy and rename all files from js to ts With lenient TSConfig settings we wont have any errors on tstojs compilation We can then release it to master without any issues This means the code does not change but the files will be primed for conversion Well keep the original Javascript files for reference Over time We can slowly chip away over the next year of to convert file by file to more modern typescript code There are some really easy places to start like SortabeUtils and then other places that are harder like Sortable itself To ensure quality We will require tests for each file function etc We havent decided any true process for this yet so if you have any isnights or experience wed love to hear what you have to offer Tools These are tools were planning to use Typescript Testcafe for integration testing Jest for unit testing Rollup for bundling Your feedback If you have any recommendations suggestions queries or concerns please comment below No ones an expert but together we can combine and become one big brain Well try our very best to be thorough but there are going to be nuances we accidentally miss Problem When dragging an item from a group to another and back to the original without release the pointer in the process the second onChange event will have the wrong from element it will be the same as to Problem JSBinJSFiddle demonstrating the problem I am facing problem with draggable direction in horizontally scrollable divs I have used swaped true in horizontal list I am trying to prevent the vertical direction but it still dragging in vertical direction how can i prevent its dragging The dragging element is not revert back to its position if drag vertically please see jsfiddle stackoverflow post for the issue I am using the VueDraggable binding for SortableJS to build a draggable tree structure I built the tree and DnD works just fine Now I want to implement nesting a node by dragging it horizontally to the right under the node that I want to nest it into Here is my question about that on Stackoverflow the VueDraggable dev requires such questions to be asked on Stackoverflow but I still havent received any answer there So I ask here since I believe that if that feature would be supported by SortableJS then it would also work in VueDraggable What would be the approach with VueDraggableSortableJS in order to achieve the functionality as shown in this animated gif H U D The default behavior of Sortable for nesting is to drag the element up to the above element until the mouse reaches emptyInsertThreshold pixels from the drop zone of the above element but I would like to be able to nest elements by dragging them to the right Same for unnesting I have set emptyInsertThreshold to to disable the default behavior and now when I drag the element to the right I get the following events fired clone and start in that order But how do I Can get notified when the mouse has traveled the predefined distance to the right Inform VueDraggable that the ghost element should be nested as a child to the element under which I am doing the horizontal movement
