redhatlinuxgnu platform Footnotes inserted using side note are shown in the main body with the superscript in the correct location but no footnote in the margin or anywhere else Referencescitations are correctly rendered as sidenotes and does using marginnote I updated the tufte and tint packages and rmarkdown to the newest versions as well as pandoc I previously rendered the same document on a Rstudiodesktop installation on a windows machine running pandoc at a version below x which produced the expected format for the sidenotes inserted using a footnote Updating Rstudio and pandoc to its most recent release on that windows machine resulted in the document no longer being rendered with correct footnotessidenotes I am not getting an error messages nor am I familiar enough with what is going on under the hood to even know where to start to figure out why the newer pandoc version doesnt seem to render them correctly andor how to fix the issue or create a workaround Any suggestions
