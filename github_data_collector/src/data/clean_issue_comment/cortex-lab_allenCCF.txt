Thanks for making the great tool writing the detailed tutorial I am now using it to help count cells But I have a question about how to generate the roitif in AnalyzeROIsm This is the process I inferred first I generate an ROI channel and combine it into the raw tif image as one single file After the whole process I will obtain the transformed tif file then I split the roi channel out of the transformed tif file This roi channel itself would be roitif Is it correct If so I wonder whether there is available scripts to do this Thank you Hi Thanks again for creating this tool it is working great for me However I was wondering if it would be possible to have other brain templates instead of the wireframebraingrid for instance a see trough brain in which you can highlight different brain areas The package has this option but is coded in R and cannot indicate probe points in the D brain an example that I would like to use would be something like this braindemo I understand if it is to much to ask kind regards Yawende Thank you for this great tool it is awesome It is clear though that its designer bear particular interest in cortical and subcortical recordings in order to make the probe mapping work in the cerebellum the top of the brain has to be recalled CBX Allen alias for cerebellar cortex rather than Isocortex DisplayProbeTrackm l isoCtxId num strstidstrcmpstacronym CBX num strstidstrcmpstacronym Isocortex I guess the universal acronym to use should be grey or root I will let the author decide Thanks again First of all thanks a lot for making this tool available I was wondering if there is a way to make it work with sagittal slices Hi this is very impressive work and tool developed by the authors Thank you We in our lab use Multielectrode arrays to record from awake freely interacting SD rats and ICR mice As I see the brain coordinates for this program are derived from Allen brain atlas which is a C mouse atlas Thus would be useful to find regions using your method for ICR mice and do u have any suggestions on how to use your method for SD Rats Hi Can you give me some insights in how you creaed the brainGridDatanpy file Thanks Currently only hierarchical search of a region is possible which is fine but it would be nicer to have an opportunity to just start typing a name of a region and have the parsed options to choose from Thanks a lot for the great tool It would be amazing to have an opportunity to add multiple probes and also have a possibility to set restrictions for example posed by the shape and height of the headplate used so that the programme would not allow to set probe locations and angles that would not be possible in the real setup
