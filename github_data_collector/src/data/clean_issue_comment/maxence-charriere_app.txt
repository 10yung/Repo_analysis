The FetchEvent for resulted in a network error response the promise was rejected goappjs Uncaught in promise TypeError Failed to fetch It would be nice to add subscription bootstrap into pagejs And callbacks to goappjs Great framework I am amazed by how easy it is to set up I believe there are kinds of docs which are missing Tutorials and concepts explanations Discussion and articles of how its core is designed and implemented This first one is for users to quickly start to write applications It has examples right now but not enough The communities can probably contribute examples slowly I am personally more curious about the second As far as I can tell its compiling CSS and HTML to platform native UI directly to render engine I dont have much native UI experiences therefore I cant tell if this framework is using web technologies or not for rendering at the pixel level As you mentioned here I am also looking for a technology to allow me write native UIs with HTML and CSS for the views but without JS Therefore I wonder where this project is going If the devs can write an article to explain some of the low level tech details and design decisions that will be super helpful and insightful
