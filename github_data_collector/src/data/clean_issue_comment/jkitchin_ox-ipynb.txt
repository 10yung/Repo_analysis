Ipython Notebooks are becoming popular in Clojure world It would be nice if it is supported here The export dispatcher allows one to export either the entire buffer or a subtree by setting Export scope oxipynb doesnt seem to respect this and instead just exports the entire buffer One workflow for me involves putting all my lecture notes into a single file with a toplevel headline for each lecture It would be very convenient to be able to set the relevant scope from the dispatch buffer Thanks for considering I have OPTIONS brokenlinksmark in my header but oxipynb doesnt seem to respect that I get an error saying link xxx could not be resolved
