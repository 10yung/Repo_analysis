Dear Hongteng I have benefited a lot from your open source code but I still need to ask you some questions later Your Time Varying Hawkes Process algorithm is related to your paper Learning Hawkes Processes from Short DoublyCensored Event Sequences i have some question want to confirmed In the paper we are surpposed to calulate the intergtration Gij which is realted to trigger kenel expbeta t and infectivity basic function kmt however in my view the IntKernelCompTVHP function dont utilize the frame of trigger kenel expbeta tti in IntensityTVHP lambda lambda At uiexpwtTimei and infectivity basic function kmt in KernelTVHP gt expdt sigma Could you offer me some favor Sincerely thank you for your generous help Hongteng Learning Hawkes Processes from Short DoublyCensored Event Sequences Gij
