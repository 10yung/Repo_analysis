Hi sorry to open ticket for my question actually I intend to made modular ESC in way that controller gate driver is separated from Mosfets pcb hence I could increase module ampere by adding parallel Mosfet in the Mosfets pcb I really appreciated to have your advise or if you know open HWSW sources let me know The currently used Opamp is the OPA from texas instruments Hopefully we can find something less expensive The requirements for the opamp are probably Low offset voltage Speed faster then the targeted maximum PWM frequency to be able to sample the current on the phases khz Rail to rail Anything else Can anyone help with this search Strip uses currently an SOT v regulator It should be changed to a SOT package as it is cheeper and can handle higher current The regulator is on the same board as the powerstage that will elevate the temperature so we will most likely need more headroom
