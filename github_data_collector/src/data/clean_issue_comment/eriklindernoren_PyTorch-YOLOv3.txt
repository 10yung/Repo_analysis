Hey can the save darknet weights function in modelspy be used to save the weights in pytorch format ie with the extension pt or how is that function used how do we use function to convert the darknet weights to pytorch weights Is it just by passing the path with the model name extension as pt Will images with empty label files will be considered in training Hi everyone I would appreciate if you could help me with some questions related to YOLOv feature maps Sorry if these questions are kind of dumb or naive but Im just getting started in this topic I understand that for a x image we will end up with a x x tensor ie x x x boxes The first of these attributes correspond to the bbox coordinates offsets the th is the objectness score and the remaining are class probabilities Now if I plot the x map related to the th attribute that is the first class I obtain the following image Diez FeatureMapPersona where the original image was body So my questions are Are these x images the maps related to each category referring to the last attributes For example I noticed that the th attribute corresponds to the category person So is the th x map shown in the image associated with the category person What do the pixels with higher values yellow ones refer to Are they pointing to locations where it is more likely to find a person in this case How are the probabilities for each class calculated Ive read that for YOLOv the do not rely on Softmax anymore but they use a regression How does this regression work I really hope you could help me with these issues Thank you in advance PS Sorry if my English is not that good Im trying to do my best Please let me know if you dont understand something Increasingly more unstable as new versions of dependencies come out i did as README but still have this problem ex classes filters classes please help me THANK YOU I met error as below when I try to train the custom data jpg images What is the problem Please review my error message python trainpy modeldef configyolov customcfg dataconfig configcustomdata imgsize Namespacebatchsize checkpointinterval computemapFalse dataconfigconfigcustomdata epochs evaluationinterval gradientaccumulations imgsize modeldefconfig yolov customcfg multiscaletrainingTrue ncpu pretrainedweightsNone Traceback most recent call last File trainpy line in module for batchi imgs targets in enumeratedataloader File optanaconda libpython sitepackagestorchutilsdatadataloaderpy line in next return selfprocessdatadata File optanaconda libpython sitepackagestorchutilsdatadataloaderpy line in processdata datareraise File optanaconda libpython sitepackagestorchutilspy line in reraise raise selfexctypemsg TypeError Caught TypeError in DataLoader worker process Original Traceback most recent call last File optanaconda libpython sitepackagestorchutilsdatautilsworkerpy line in workerloop data fetcherfetchindex File optanaconda libpython sitepackagestorchutilsdatautilsfetchpy line in fetch data selfdataset idx for idx in possiblybatchedindex File optanaconda libpython sitepackagestorchutilsdatautilsfetchpy line in listcomp data selfdataset idx for idx in possiblybatchedindex File homeansebbyPyTorchYOLOv utilsdatasetspy line in getitem img targets horisontalflipimg targets File homeansebbyPyTorchYOLOv utilsaugmentationspy line in horisontalflip targets targets TypeError NoneType object is not subscriptable when i have run the trainpy python detectpy weightspath weightsyolov weightsand then i try to run the detectpyit occurs this bug RuntimeError Given groups weight of size expected input to have channels but got channels instead how can i solve it to detect the sample pictures Traceback most recent call last File detectpy line in module cmap pltgetcmaptab b File homeanaconda envspytorchlibpython sitepackagesmatplotlibcmpy line in getcmap name joinsortedcmapdkeys ValueError Colormap tab b is not recognized Possible values are Accent
