Repeated tasks are limited to the day of week but there is no reminder for the specific time Pomodoro only allows duration based reminder It would be nice to have an alarm clocklike feature for repeated tasks Hello I noticed the following behavior Fist suggestion When I mark as done my task and save the work log to Jira the task goes to the done listIf i pull the task back up again to work on it the work time should be reset to but it continues from where it was left It would be easier to manage the working sessions on that task Also when i want to finish the task by using this approach the Started day of work should be changed to the current day If it is not clear I can provide more info Second suggestion Also it would be a nice feature if you finish a task and move it to review or done you should set the Remaining Time on the task in jira to Hi I could not find a setting thats quite common in similar apps custom day end hour For now it counts a day as finished based on to I quess My schedule is shifted forward in time I wake up late and go to bed late so my day is more like starts at and ends at roughly This messes apps calculations up as it starts counting time towards the next astrological day though logically Id like it to count it to my current logical day if that makes sense Your issue may already be reported Please search the issues before creating one Your

CtrlShifti CmdAlti for mac in the console tab If so please post it here There is no output Your issue may already be reported Please search the issues before creating one THE CASE I noticed that to get the app to log you work time you have to mark the task as done Sometimes there are tasks that take more than one day to finish because of poor planning Therefore i suggest that the app can log you work automatically in Jira after you hit the Finish Day buttonI noticed that it doesnt do this now It would be a very helpful feature If needed I can help on this topic Thank you for the great software and making things easier for all of us Your issue may already be reported Please search the issues before creating one Your Environment Include as many relevant details about the environment

behavior After I fill in my credentials I click test credentials and I receive the message Login successful Welcome user that seems a bit weird I am using Jira v in an offline environment server because the API may differ from version to version I run in Jira the JQL and indeed it is getting al of my issues But when using the app at this method mapToSearchResult in jiraissuemaputilts the resresponse is a html page containing the title BoardJIRA meta data and all of jira plugins looks like its getting Jiras first page Also i ran debug on jira and couldnt seem to get any network trace of the app calling jira but no traffic was detected when searching for issues maybe this would help me debug the process I cant seem to find any network traffic in the console but i get the following message when i try searching for a task To prevent shut out from api access has been blocked by Super Productivity You should probably check you jira setting This is a separate problem that could be connected Also when i try to press CTRLSHIFTJ it says TypeError Cannot read property send of undefined The output on this one is TypeError Cannot read property send of undefined Steps to Reproduce for

Operating System and version Ubuntu LTS Desktop Environment Gnome I totally dig the new task menu for scheduling tasks editing notes and attachments and setting up repeatable tasks heart However I cant find a way to add sub tasks anymore Is this on purpose Current Behavior Currently when selecting a Primary Color for a project some colors will keep the background of the application white but others will give it some colorisation with a fade effect I find the background color very distracting and out of line from what I expect in an application I end up using very pale colors as the projects primary color to avoid this issue Expected Behavior My expectation is to have a a checkbox on the projects theme tab where I can select between automatic background color or white or darkgrey if using dark mode Thanks
