you are wrong using cygwin you can run all the commands and get successful results Hi If I run memdump with st argument omitted I get the following error delldellOptiPlex mtechprojectmeltdown taskset x memdump xffff b Error converting physical to virtual address So to get over this I run the secret binary to get some random physical address That address is x d c Then in one terminal window I keep following command running RAM size GB delldellOptiPlex mtechprojectmeltdown memoryfiller Press any key if you are done reading the secret In other terminal window I run the following command delldellOptiPlex mtechprojectmeltdown taskset x memdump x d c xffff b Physical address x d c Physical offset xffff b Virtual address xffff f d c As can be seen I am not getting any memory dump Am I doing anything wrong Also the reading speed of reliability is around read secs I tried altering various parameters given at the end of the README but it didnt make any significant changes Is this the normal speed My CPU specs are delldellOptiPlex mtechprojectmeltdown lscpu Architecture x CPU opmodes bit bit Byte Order Little Endian CPUs Online CPUs list Threads per core Cores per socket Sockets NUMA nodes Vendor ID GenuineIntel CPU family Model Model name IntelR CoreTM i CPU GHz Stepping CPU MHz CPU max MHz CPU min MHz BogoMIPS Virtualization VTx L d cache K L i cache K L cache K L cache K NUMA node CPUs User applications using libkdump may use memory incorrectly and cause segmentation fault Our handler never checks for the source of segmentation fault and always redirects them into libkdumpreadsignalhandler Signedoffby Pavel Boldin boldinpavelgmailcom GCC MSVC and CLANG provide intrinsics for all the lowlevel assembly operations attempted Additionally the meltdown sequence can be expressed in C code as per the paper with the appropriate volatile statements Finally usage of MFENCE is not needed when using RDTSCP as the latter is already serializing
