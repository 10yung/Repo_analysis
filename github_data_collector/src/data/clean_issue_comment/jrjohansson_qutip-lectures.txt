Hi Im very new to Qutip and still in the process of refreshing my quantum physics knowledge so please forgive me if this is a silly question In the notebook on the Jaynes Cumming model I cannot understand why the hamiltonian is written with the smdagsm for the atomic part in the following H wc adag a wa smdag sm g adag sm a smdag When I look at the description of Jaynes Cumming model that you give and also on Wikipedia it seems like we should be using something like sigmaz instead ie H wc adag a wa tensorqeyeNsigmaz g adag sm a smdag I wondered whether they might be the same but they do not appear to be when I calculate them Thanks for your time Matt When trying to evolve the code mesolveht psi taulist processrho args I get the following error It looks like it is expecting parameters to be passed in but Im not sure which ones to use TypeError Traceback most recent call last ipythoninput d d cfd in module Evolve the system request the solver to call processrho at each time step mesolveht psi taulist processrho args homejhellmersanaconda libpython sitepackagesqutipmesolvepy in mesolveH rho tlist cops eops args options progressbar safemode if safemode solversafetycheckH rho cops eops args if progressbar is None homejhellmersanaconda libpython sitepackagesqutipsolverpy in solversafetycheckH state cops eops args structurecheckHdims Htype tempstate for ii in rangeleneops if isinstanceeops ii Qobj tempstate eops ii TypeError object of type function has no len
