There is a missing dollar sign Line reads b colors but should be b colors Some arrow diagrams are rendered as lt instead of The specification currently states that use declarations bring a name into a scope but thats not exactly true as imports are not available prior to the use declaration php namespace A class C namespace B Same scope A C should be available right c new C use A C Without this restriction an engine could theoretically make an initial pass to import names from all use declarations and therefore prevent a name resolution error from occurring namespacesmd A namespaceusedeclaration imports that is makes available one or more names into a scope optionally giving them each an alias In the grammar the stringvariable production rule is not used Looking at I think it should be a summand of dqchar Split off from Currently arrayelementinitializer specifies that the key and value are both ordinary expressions As specified this is ambiguous with yieldexpression PHP resolves this as follows php yield foo bar is yield foo bar rather than yield foo bar However Im not sure how this can be specified in grammar form Hi it seems use function statement is not tested in testsnamespaces x instanceof y instanceof z is a nonsense expression but is successfully parsed in PHP see This contradicts what is mentioned in the website says its nonassociative However other nonassociative expressions do what would make sense They cause Parse errors eg Either of the following would make sense Mention that this is nonassociative in phplangspec to reflect phpnet It seems like thats probably a consequence of the current CFG so maybe nothing needs to be done Additionally try to make that a syntax error in php x or to reflect the documentation on phpnet Update the specification to allow it and update phpnet it seems like its currently parsed as x instanceof y instanceof z according to ast parsecode Im opposed to that and it seems like the spec in this repo forbids that Im not quite sure what repo to file this in or the process to request the change to php implementations syntax or if this has been mentioned elsewhere It is impossible to claim conformance to an ever evolving language specification without referring to a certain versionedition or whatever it will be called There are open pull request and issues which cannot be sensibly addressed due to this issue unless were claiming this spec is still a draft in which case it is not really helpful for alternative implementations at all See for instance list phpt The test obviously expects a certain error message including a certain message and stack trace format although the spec merely mentions the righthand operand must be an expression that designates an array or object implementing the ArrayAccess interface Furthermore the test uses vardump which is only mentioned but not specified in the langspec particularly its output format may differ If the tests should be useful for language implementations other than the phpnet implementation they should be written with portability in mind Otherwise we could as well get rid of the test suite altogether and merge possibly missing tests to the phpnet test suite
