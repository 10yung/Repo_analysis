Hello John Many thanks for such an amazing package May you help with this confusing issue Ive tried to make a grouped bar plot with error bars classical plot for statistics But Ive got unexpected results I have no idea what parameters should I change to correct plot The reproducible code is below PM libraryecharts r librarydatatable librarybinom function for percent and CI calculation

not add when xAxis is Hi It would be great if the sunburst plots could have a depth of three instead of two When using eband I noticed that the vertical limits of the bands are not located where they should be Below is an example showing bands that are not properly located on the yaxis and errorbars that are in the correct location The expectation here is that the upper limit is and the lower limit is which is where the errorbars end This may be related to I will make an attempt to help myself soon but dont have time at the moment Thanks for all the great packages R df dataframe x y

be great Hello Im trying to export my graphic generated by echarts r to a html version but when its done it doesnt keep the aspect I ordered in the earrange Hallo John st of all thanks for the great work youve done in echarts r I just have a little curious about the output files size I used htmlwidgetsaveWidgeta ahtml selfcontained F to save the bar chart However is it possible to reduce the file size as I found the file produced contained other charts resources like in the afiles echarts r plugins afiles echarts r themes etc which may not necessary for plotting the bar chart This is annoying me because the files are too big and heavy it does take very long time to load It will be very appreciate if you can solve this Hello I would like to customize a treemap in order to use a legend for the parent level instead of the navigation bar below the graph I only have two levels in my dataset I tried with the documentation example but could not find to properly use additional arguments libraryecharts r tm dataframe parent cearth earth earth mars mars child cforest ocean iceberg elon curiosity value ceilingrnorm tm echarts etreemapparent child value etitleTreemap charts I see in several native javascript code like this one that it may be necessary to change options after rendering a first time the graph Am I right More generally maybe I did not find it in documentation but examples with additional arguments and nested list I guess would be useful Hello John great package you have created thank you I was trying to personalise a tooltip for a chart based on your example for the parameter trigger item on etooltip here Here is an example of the type of chart I was fitting where I want the tooltip to show a personalised data value whose column on the grouped data frame I added via the bind argument r setseed iris astibble mutateindex nrow eff samplec replace TRUE prob c tibblecolumntorownamesindex groupbySpecies tibblerownamestocolumnmodel echartsSepalWidth elineSepalLength bind model eeffectscatterSepalLength eff etooltiptrigger item formatter htmlwidgetsJS functionparams returnstrong paramsname strongbr Width paramsvalue br Length paramsvalue However when I use trigger axis I cant manage to pass the values of the grouped variables correctly to the tooltip the tooltip seems to turn off r setseed iris astibble mutateindex nrow eff samplec replace TRUE prob c tibblecolumntorownamesindex groupbySpecies tibblerownamestocolumnmodel echartsSepalWidth elineSepalLength bind model eeffectscatterSepalLength eff etooltiptrigger axis formatter htmlwidgetsJS functionparams returnstrong paramsname strongbr Width paramsvalue br Length paramsvalue join Could you please explain how can I personalise the tooltip when triggeraxis and theres grouping variables over the data jsonlite will quote the function as a string therefore echarts will not parse it is there any way to solve this yAxis typevalue name axisLabel showfalse
