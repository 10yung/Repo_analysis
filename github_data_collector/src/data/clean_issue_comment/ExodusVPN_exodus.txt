latest version details summaryChangelogsummary Sourced from base s changelog Minimum rust version nostd is now supported via the two new features alloc and std Minimum rust version Fix bug in streaming encoding if the underlying writer didnt write all the bytes given to it the remaining bytes would not be retried later See the docs on EncoderWriterwrite Make it configurable whether or not to return an error when decoding detects excess trailing bits Remove line wrapping Line wrapping was never a great conceptual fit in this library and other features streaming encoding etc either couldnt support it or could support only special cases of it with a great increase in complexity Line wrapping has been pulled out into a linewrap crate so its still available if you need it Base Display creation no longer uses a Result because it cant fail which means its helper methods for common configs that unwrap for you are no longer needed Add a streaming encoder Write impl to transparently base as you write Remove the remaining unsafe code Remove whitespace stripping to simplify nostd support No out of the box configs use it and its trivial to do yourself if needed filterb b n t r x b x ccontainsb Detect invalid trailing symbols when decoding and return an error rather than silently ignoring them Update safemem Derive Clone for DecodeError Add support for crypt s base variant decodeconfigslice function for noallocation decoding analogous to encodeconfigslice Decode performance optimization encodeconfigslice function for noallocation encoding STANDARDNOPAD config
