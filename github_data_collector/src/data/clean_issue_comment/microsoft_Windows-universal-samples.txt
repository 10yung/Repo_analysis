Hi Thanks for Developing such amazing Sample App I want to play some m u link so i checked AdaptiveStreaming Sample code but its not working on some m u link I am test AdaptiveStreaming Sample but some m u link is not working on this Player We are also check this link on jwplayer on crome and Android Device also all link are working fine but its not working on this video player I am giving you sample m u link I hope you will check and replay me asap Sample file No need to create Playready container twice when using software DRM path Bumps MicrosoftNETCoreUniversalWindowsPlatform from to

TaskDeferralComplete that background process will exit when BackgroundTaskRun return Otherwise process not exit but cant receive any trigger again In C background project it work normally running and receive trigger My project need loading something when started Loading huge data per trigger is really bad Hi When running the BluetoothLE sample Scenario ServerForeground if a device connects and the service is then stopped by the UWP program the device remains connected The device also remains connected after closing the UWP program The connection has to be terminated by the remote device How can the device be disconnected by the UWP program I am using VS and Windows Thanks The XamlDataVirtualization has a flaw in both scenarios tested so far in the pictures library hosting circa pictures While both scenarios create thumbnails nicely as we scroll scrolling up and down several times throughout the entire grid and then making a pause no scroll whatsoever will at some point drop the process memory to a low value MB in my case after which the GridView displays empty items with seemingly no way to get them back through scrolling Unfortunately I have no clue on a possible solution to provide you In all Holographic C projects there is some sort of error present with Visual Studio the latest build and a target platform of I will cite one example of a flaw which is present in all projects and another example of a flaw present in one specific project although there are many such errors In regards to the issue specific to one project I encountered an error when looking through the HolographicFaceTracking sample In this example in the file HolographicFaceTrackingContentShaderStructuresh which outlines several structures like float matricies VertexColors and VertexTextures In the staticassert call shown above the code is written to try to assert whether the CubeModelConstantBuffer and QuadModelConstantBuffer structures have a size that is a multiple of This assertion should pass as these buffers are float x s with no additional padding added my the compiler and have a size of bytes as found by sizeCubeModelConstantBuffer and sizeQuadModelConstantBuffer Nevertheless as shown in the image Visual Studio shows that the assertion fails This might be due to staticassert failing itself Concerning a flaw present in all projects MS consistently seems to be capturing the values for use in their lambdas incorrectly see the image below This is present in every single Holographic sample project and I am not sure why I find this can often be alleviated by pushing out this and creating a managed reference ie AppView current and pointing it to this Nevertheless there is something quite off about all the Holographic sample projects Has something changed Am I using the wrong SDK Id appreciate any help Fixing these sample projects would be great as all the HL guides direct people here and obviously these samples arent much help to developers if they are not working Ive got a new variation of this issue from back in The repro is the same but the result is slightly different for me Repro Build CameraStarterKit sample for x and run Start a video

canceled Is this not a sample for outofprocess background task or am i missing something I try c SpeechAndTTSsln solution on my windows build when I press the button Dictate in Continuous Dictation session to active the microfone the ContinuousRecognitionSessionCompleted resturn Status unknown and the system doesnt start All privacy configuration in settings are on are there other configuration to use this sample Thank Mat
