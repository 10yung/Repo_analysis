Im utilizing R studio and trying to run report on the following code to summarize the output in plain text lmout lmtime year dataQ Data reportlmout Utilizing this I then see the following error Error in UseMethodformatvalue no applicable method for formatvalue applied to an object of class NULL The data Im utilizing this for is open source as I am experimenting with this package and Ive attached it here for reference olympics copysavzip Let me know if there is something Im doing wrong here Im fairly new to the R world so it could be entirely on my side but I thought if anyone would know it would be you guys parametersmodelparameter when using standardize refit no longer returns nonstandardized coefficients but only coefficients SE and CI based on the refitted model from the standardized data Only when standardizemethod is posthocbasic or so then normal coefficients SE and CI and std coefficients only are returned This breaks the default report method Since standardizing is in package effectsize now I suggest calling modelparameters wo standardizing and then call effectsizestandardizeparameters separately to build the report I can address this issue or you can do it if you like But I think you have a clearer vision of what should be reported in the end Question and context This obviously isnt a bug but Im trying to work out the logic behind why printreporttable requires nested calls to both insight and then parameters Theres something Ive missed along the way in terms of why format table is contained within insight if its used for pretty printing Indeed this could have been discussed in another thread and Ive missed it r export printreporttable functionx table insightformattableparametersparameterstablex cattable If Im not mistaken in effect the final call ends up being something like this within report R catinsightformattableparametersparameterstablereportreportamodelobject I would like better understand this design decision and the history behind it Pending that answer I do think it would be worthwhile documenting some of these processes more explicitly within the functions themselves ie dev notes This is just a suggestion but it certainly makes contributing and debugging a little easier For context the reason I ask this is that I have been experimenting with some Rmarkdown printing but its certainly not trivial to implement within the ecosystem of report I wanted to follow how these tables were generated here I am Hopefully I havent missed something written elsewhere in the project Cheers I noticed that report of an anova object does not provide correctcomplete output for regression models eg lm lmer glm In particular it could be very helpful if report could give an anovalike table of main and interaction effects of lmer or complex multiple lm as coefficients parameters in these cases is sometimes hard to understand or some coefficients do not make sense empirically ie expected difference for a numerical age coefficient of between the levels of a categorical usenonuse of electronic cigarette coefficient for the VD motivation to quit smoking and as reference for categorical comparison is taken without control on experimental or theoretical reasons in R Use of report for these models could be helpful for providing also effect size from sjstats and other relevant parameters of an anova object to be reported in papers This is secondary but might help to report relevant information report does not work for anova of model comparisons Honestly I do not know whether there are guidelines for model comparison reporting in psychologyneuroscience However report could help for picking the right parameters eg AIC BIC or Chi and so on and correct writing Lastly would it be possible to get main and interaction effects for stanlmglmlmer model with report the coefficient parameters output is the same as classic regression models and would be helpful to get the general effect of a predictor instead of its coefficient estimation How could we do it For instance significance for fixed effects in lmer could be done with anovamodellmer dff KenwardRoger Luke or for other regression models as anovamodellm or anovamodelglm test F I am not an expert in R programming and cannot help with actual coding this is just a suggestion that I noticed during practical use of report and R in general I appreciate your work Luke SG Behav Res The clean names from parameters are not transferred to the report tables DO NOT MERGE THIS BRANCH cause its like super broken related to the reorganization with effectsize Once correlation and estimate are on CRAN report will go in with a high priority to make it citeable I think that it makes sense to associate all contributors of easystats to this publication as it heavily relies on all of the easystats dependencies Heres a list of potential journals feel free to complete the list Software Journals Nature toolbox not sure if possibility of submitting ourselves JOSS IF
