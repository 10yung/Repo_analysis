 Name Sonar TIM Homepage or app store url Brand GuidelinesLicensing Free Logo Version Info json dependencies codepush Im currently using Code Push in a deployment pipeline where new application instances are created dynamically This requires the CLI to access the generated appsecret after a call to addApp but that doesnt seem to be possible nor mentioned in the documentation CLI version Hello Ive been experiencing an issue for a while where a releases rollout must be or no devices at all get the update Ive been making new releases to roll out to of devices with appcenter codepush promote app app name mandatory s source deployment d destination deployment t binary version rollout and the AppCenter webapp GUI does reflect that rollout is set to However no devices receive the update no matter how long I wait Even if I manually increase the rollout to any number below no devices get the update Only making it a full rollout will result in any devices installing the update Is it possible to make a build staging codepush config push code to testers staging with codepush push some more after tests promote build to production make the same build use production codepush config It would be so simple if it is possible to do it this way Otherwise correct me if I am wrong I need to have two separate branches with separate configs ex flavours and build from them separately This setup then has to be doubled for ios and android Is this how this is supposed to work Thank you so much Hello I have faced with a problem of installing an update that was delivered via codepush on ios platform works fine on android After and update is identified downloaded and installed app immediately crashes Since then app always instantly crashes when trying to open it again i will attach the crash log from ios at a very bottom We are using codepush cli For example to release an update we do codepush release commarketechappios dist mobile marketech codepushupdate ios www d Test The folder structure of our payload that is sent to codepush is Untitled We use phonegap to generate the content of www folder We were using this approach about month ago and it used to work fine Looks like some things had changed since then and we are unable to do it same way as we used to I would appreciate any assistance Thanks ios app crash log appnameFocustimestamp appversion sliceuuidd bb ef fd c

are using As a user I wish to get the apps code push version to pass it in other appscriptbuild tools Currently I can get the info of my app via something like appcenter codepush deployment list app myAppName That will output something like Name Update Metadata Install Metrics Staging Label v Active of App Version Installed Mandatory No Release Time Nov AM Released By memailcom Whats interesting here is the label v Lets extract the data with JSON appcenter codepush deployment list app myAppName output json And thats where the output is not clean and not parsable JSON Here is the result Staging u b mLabel u b mv n u b mApp Version u b m n u b mMandatory u b mNo n u b mRelease Time u b mNov AM n u b mReleased By u b mmemailcom u b mActive u b m of n u b mInstalled u b m Is there a way to get clean JSON parsable We wish to get this in something like name Production updateMetadata Label v App Version Mandatory No Release Time Nov AM Released by memailcom installMetrics Active of Installed What do you think Edit Similar question Platform React Native Just curious to know if somehow we can code push before the user navigates to intro page in an app ie before splash screen fades Why we want to do AB test on our intro page Problem is if we do it via code push the intro page would appear before the codepush operation takes place in the app Is there any way we can smoothly load codepush operation on splash screen so that user would see A or B build on intro page itself instead of it loading again
