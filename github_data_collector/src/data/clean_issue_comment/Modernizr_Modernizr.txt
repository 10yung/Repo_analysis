 is down Quick note here as I dont have time to write this up into a proper PR yet Hyperlink auditing allows for a parallel background request to be made on a hyperlink click often used for tracking and clickdetection It is currently not supported by modernizr According to this SO post the expression ping in HTMLAnchorElementprototype will return true if the feature is supported false otherwise Empirically we find this to be true Im not sure if this is the expected behavior or if I am simply misunderstanding something The mq function is defined as follows in var mq function var e windowmatchMedia windowmsMatchMedia return e functiont var r et return r rmatches functione var t return injectElementWithStyles media e modernizr position absolute functione t absolute windowgetComputedStyle windowgetComputedStylee null ecurrentStyle position t On the th line in the snippet above it seems like the function is checking whether or not the document matches the MediaQueryList For example on phones it is expected that matchmediahover hover would give matches false because there is no pointer mechanism that would allow hovering But is this testing the right thing Even the official description says Detect support for Hover based media queries If the result of matches is false the query itself is actually supported but device or browser does not meet the condition in said query I was expecting the test to check if the media property is not all which means that the browser does not understand the query itself From w org Unknown media features User agents are to represent a media query as not all when one of the specified media features is not known Isnt this a bug I managed to deploy an updated version of the webpage to newmodernizrcom since patrickkettner doesnt seem to have time or doesnt get any email anymore for updating the old one Maybe this gets the train rolling again Any idea on how to go onward with the page would be highly appreciated Fixes and Providing support to test if openDatabase driver is virtually removed In some cases users would like to test what if openDatabase driver doesnt support by setting openDatabase to null In this case the test applicationmethod will fail to use openDatabase driver and Modernizr must behave same Signedoffby ossdev ossdevpuresoftwarecom Im trying to get a fallback for objectfit working but in all browsers I get not supported in the console from the simplest bit of code javascript if Modernizrobjectfit consolelogsupported else consolelognot supported Im using the latest version of Modernizr Modernizr detects all versions of Edge as supporting css position sticky despite partial support If sticky is used on elements other than th there is a known big with Edge which causes a flicker effect upon scroll I really likes Modernizr library thanks everyone to make it excellent I am requesting a new feature detection in Modernizr According to CSS Align specs the gap property and its rowgap and columngap subproperties are being extended to Flex layout as well As of today only Firefox supports gap properties for flex box I dont see any feature detection in Modernizr for it would it be helpful if we add it Line and of libbuildjs says JavScript remove last return statement and trailing contents contentsreplacereturn return lgtm spotted a duplicate r inside return Should the lines be like this instead JavaScript remove last return statement and trailing contents contentsreplacereturn r e t u r n Completely not tested AV detection code Possible problems AV can be contained by a lot of containers mkv videoxmatroska webm videowebm mp videomp and not sure if any other research is required Right now is only being tested for mp AV could be a problem not completely sure It simply needs some research and testing
