 Is it possible to plot horizontal lines ycte ycte and a series value in the same chart What would be the easiest way to create a density plot using scalachart In jfreechart I found this Im more familiar with R and have been struggling to figure out how to make a simple histogramcategory chart Lets say I have a sequence of probabilities trials represented as a Seq Int in Scala or numeric vector in R Ive tried val chart CategoryCharttrials trials legend false but cant seem to get any results In R I would use histtrials xlabxaxis ylabyaxis Does scalachart provide a wrapper for JFreeChart TimeSeries For X values these types do not work javalangLong javamathBigInteger scala fail to compile val d for i to yield new javalangLongi itoDouble val d for i to yield new javalangLongi i val d for i to yield new javamathBigIntegeritoString itoDouble These work scala compiles val data for i to yield new javalangIntegeri i val data for i to yield new javalangDoublei i val data for i to yield new javalangFloati i val data for i to yield itoDoubleitoDouble val data for i to yield new BigIntnew javamathBigIntegeritoString itoDouble val data for i to yield itoLong i XYLineChartdatashow val data for i to yield new javautilDatenew javalangLongi i Hi wookietreiber It is possible to customize the xaxis values I am generating a XYLineChart with values of a whole week hours values Instead of showing intervals I would like to show hours and ideally also days something like Monday Tuesday Hi wookietreiber It is possible to get data from selected area I found some example in java Cheers Jan
