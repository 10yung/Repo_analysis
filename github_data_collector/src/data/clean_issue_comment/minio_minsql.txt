Following along with the minsql repo documentation and the examples I fail to create a datastore after setting minsql up with a metabucket The below command points to some playground bucket but the response is Unauthorized curl X POST H ContentType applicationjson d bucket playminsql endpoint prefix name minioplay accesskey Q AM UQ SPQQA P F secretkey zuftfteSlswRu BJ wekitnifILbZam KYY TG Trying to point the request to my local minio instance like below yields the same unauthorized response curl X POST H ContentType applicationjson d bucket minsqlmeta endpoint prefix name miniotest accesskey minio secretkey minio My guess was that I needed to get a token first in contrary to the order in which the numbered list of the guide is proposing so I tried to POST to apitokens as below but still only get unauthorized response Tried replacing abcde with minio and minio from the docs but no difference curl X POST H ContentType applicationjson d accesskey abcdefghijklmnop secretkey abcdefghijklmnopabcdefghijklmnop description test isadmin true enabled false Following the documentation on the minsql github repo page the example doesnt work The mc container is supposed to create a minsqlmeta bucket and the output from the conainer is that it succeeds but no bucket is actually created As per the dockercomposeyml below the bucket miniominsqlmeta should be created After the mc container has run no bucket can be found in the local data directory or seen in the web ui version services minio image miniominio volumes datadata environment MINIOACCESSKEY minio MINIOSECRETKEY minio command server data ports mc image miniomc dependson minio entrypoint binsh c echo usrbinmc config host add minio minio minio usrbinmc mb miniominsqlmeta minsql image miniominsql dependson minio mc ports environment MINSQLMETABUCKETNAME minsqlmeta MINSQLMETABUCKETENDPOINT MINSQLACCESSKEY minio MINSQLSECRETKEY minio volumes data The new asyncawait syntax is coming and tokio and hyper already adopted that syntax in their master branches so we should prepare to adopt it as well We are going to move Tokens to UsernamePassword pair and pass them using basic http auth rather than a header If we delete a datastore we need to ensure all logs referencing it are also updated Adding a new Log doesnt auto start an ingest buffer Seed a play log and datastore with each new minsql installation Currently the region of the meta bucket of the server is not configurable Therefore you cannot start MinSQL with a server meta bucket that does not match the somehow hardcoded value in metars Anyway name does not seem to be a good identifier for specifying the region in general We need a component that will render the results on a listing API call and render a table with pagination Render the results of a listing API call Supports pagination Supports displaying only n number of columns Option to support sorting if the API supports it Option to show a column with configurable actions editdelete Support for selection of multiple items sample
