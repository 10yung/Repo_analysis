when I use printgcf dpdfpainters aaapdf I get object transparency img width altPDFXEdit src but when I use exportfig aaapdf q painters I loss transparency img width altPDFXEdit src I read in the description that painters dont support transparency but it seems that when using print it works can this be fixed TLDR copyobj cannot be used to copy UIAxes as of r b As discussed here in Matlab Central forum the changes recently made to support UIFigure UIAxes doesnt work When a UIFigure is supplied as an input the code searches for its children and uses copyobj to copy those components to a legacy figure When a UIAxes is directly supplied as an input it also uses copyobj to copy the UIAxes to the legacy figure The problem is that copyobj is not supported for UIAxes As evidence of that Matlab uax uiaxes fig figure copyobjuaxfig Error using matlabuicontrolUIAxescopyElement Functionality not supported with UIAxes For more information see Graphics Support in App Designer The error is not thrown in exportfig because copyobj is called from a trycatch that rethrows the error as a modified warning Otherwise exportfig is terrific I recently wrote a function copyUIAxes that searches for and copies the children of a UIAxes to a new legacy axes along with the legend and colorbar if they exist I think this is the only workaround to using copyobj with UIAxes Hi It seems that transparent isnt working properly when the figure is created with stackedplot Hi I use your script daily THANKS I updated ghostscript after running exportfig pdf q painters append I get this error Ghostscript

on the linked figure leads to a cropping problem on linux On Windows it works fine I just updated the package and the problem remains It might be related to I tried with figUnits pixels as proposed in this issue but this has no effect here Click on the images to better see the problem toto toto Hi Altmany love the script usually works like a charm First time it fails me though I have a x subplot all four of them are somewhat busy stacked bar plots lines on top text annotations legends etc If each of them is a standalone figure exportfig handles it fine into a pdf When its subplot however I

to using the bar command to plot these histograms I can get the render to generate a PDF if I use histogram for example but of course stacking is so much easier with bar Any insight appreciated For the record I am using Matlab a on windows I get this error exportfig error Please ensure that you are using the latest version of exportfig and that you have Ghostscript installed and that you do not

latest version of exportfig are installed Dear author I plot a figure with three subplot which consists of pcolor and contour plots This figure file is a very large file up to MB Then I use the exportfig to export this figure exportfigfilenamepngr but it cannot export this figure after hours and it is still exporting Is there a method to speed up this process Thanks Hi altmany love the script I have been using it for a while I got in trouble recently trying to get a SURF plot to be exported Matlab just gets busy and crashes finally If I try to do the same on a similar plain PLOT same data overlayed no trouble at all Don t know if this is coming because of the type of plot or if it is coming from a missing extra parameter I should be using Op System Win x Matlab a Im trying to export PDF with OpenGL and transparency on and using Matlab R b The text on left and right axes is being cut off in particular zeros Matlab exportfigfig myfileOpenGLpdfnocrop Ive tried switching fonts adding padding turning off cropping turning off font switching but nothing helps Painters and Zbuffer fixes the issue but I really need to use the transparency option I am using multiple subplots in this which might be the cause
