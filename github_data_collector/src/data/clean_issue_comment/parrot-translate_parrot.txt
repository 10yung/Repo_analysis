Reading the documentation for updating pairs for a locale link Updating the locales pairs and making a request as documented should successfully add a new pair However the documentation is incorrect as well as confusing The documentation seems to imply that adding a single key will either add it or update it as the method uses the PATCH HTTP method In fact it deletes any content for keys that are not specified only leaving the pairs specified by the keys in the request body This is more PUT semantics where the content is overwritten as PATCH should only change content provided by the request body Secondly the documentation shows the request content as being in the following format json key value This is incorrect and effectively causes all keys to be deleted by removing them all as it appears to be interpreted as delete all keys as none were provided The actual format required found by using Chrome Developer tools is json pairs key value Suggestions Update the documentation as appropriate so that following it results in successful requests by an integrator If the APIs current request behaviour is intentional change the HTTP method to PUT If a PATCH behaviour is intended fix unspecified keys being deleted only updating those specified where found and adding those not found Reject the request with an xx error if pairs is not specified at all to prevent accidental data loss For bugs or unexpected behaviors please use the following template Expected Behavior Registering an account succeeding Actual Behavior Registering an account error Steps to Reproduce the Problem Register an account Click submit Get the following error Something went wrong Thats all we know Your description API and Webapp are running but when registering no errors are appearing and it seems like nothing is happening in the background Several features would benefit from a normalized DB schema For example the translation tagging feature or cascading updatesdeletes to project keys Most of this is currently handled in application code and it would be simplified if delegated to relational constraints Show the changes made to a given key over time Hability to tag a set of keys which groups them Currently we automatically create tags for untranslated or unverified keys per locale that are sent to translators and we check the status of those tags Once he translated all of them we mark the task as done and close pay the translator Each key should be able to contain screenshots or a longer description that provides context for the translators When the value of a key changes on the source locale the key should be marked as unverified on the other locales so that they are reviewed and updated or marked as verified Hello there While testing a tool I faced the following bug Add a new key to a project Delete this key Try to perform export for some of the locales Open a document with exported keyvalues there you will find a key that you deleted on step On the other hands this key will be absent on keys page and on pages associated with locales Thanks Andrii When the default setting is exceeded chrome console display error Failed to load resource the server responded with a status of Internal Server Error Update the filenginxparrotconf default settings clientbodybuffersize M
