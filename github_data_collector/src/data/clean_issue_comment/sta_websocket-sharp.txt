Hello I am using Unity f and Configuration is set to Net x and IL CPP i have added websocketsharp to Assets Plugins Folder Everything works fine on editorbut when i run it on deviceAndroid it directly calls OnClose everytime Any Suggestions would be of great help Code file attached for reference Sockettxt When using this websocket library as a client only it seems that IsAlive does return false all the time even though a connection is established I had a look in the code it should definetly work Any ideahelp would be appreciated currently Encountering an issue where we cant get a succesful connection We are using unity webgl and are using a recent version of Unity TSL version once we change your authenticate in websocketcs line sslStreamAuthenticateAsClient host confClientCertificates confEnabledSslProtocols confCheckCertificateRevocation to sslStreamAuthenticateAsClienthost it seems to work perfectly Im wondering what the implications might be of this change as it appears you are always sending null in confClientCertificates regardless and without those it succeeds Maybe we are misusing it somewhere Thanks Hey I didnt know where to post my code to help improve the project I

AuthorizeRoles toto titi protected override void OnMessageMessageEventArgs e Cheers Christophe Add guidline how to change SSL Protocol This WebSocketException The header of a frame cannot be read from the stream is always thrown when closing the web socket client I have an example of a websocket client sending and receiving the same message from the backend WebSocketClient using var ws new WebSocket wsslocalhost ws wsOnMessage sender e ConsoleWriteLine Received Message eData wsConnect wsSend Test Message ConsoleReadKey Backend It is an aspnet core web application which only receive the request from the WebSocketClient and it answers back with the same message It returns the message as expected but then after entered any key to continue with the execution it fails and throws the above exception at the time of closing the web socket client Here is the the code if you would like to take a look There is a READMEtxt file with the instructions to run the example I really appreciate any help you can provide I program a client with websocketsharp and it can connect to my websocket server if the client running on Windows But the client failed to connect to server when the client running on Windows XP The WebSocketSharpCloseEventArgs code is and the reason is An exception has occurred while receiving Does the websocketsharp support Windows XP I need you help Thanks very much Hi Im using Websocketsharp in my Unity game as client that is connecting to a uWebsocket backend server We want to enable Permessage Compression for this connection but the problem is that when I enable compression in client with following line before connect wsCompression CompressionMethodDeflate the server refuses the request from the client for connection We also reproduced this issue with ws library in node js as backend with its provided example configuration but the problem persists When we set serverMaxWindowBits in ws library to default negotiated value the client can connect to the server properly Now my question is Is there any way that we can control this serverMaxWindowBits from WebSocketSharp client Thanks Hi i am using the websocketsharp to connet Unity and ubuntu it works perfect but when i build the project into HoloLens the websocketsharp does not work anymore is there a solution Thanks in advance Im testing reconnection of the websocket client After receiving OnClose event my program calls the following code to reconnect not in the OnClose thread websocketClose websocketConnect After about failure and retries I got exception A series of reconnecting has failed The websocketsharp code does have the logic of maxRetryCountForConnect Anyone knows why this limitation is needed at all And what is the best practice to reconnect except create a new WebSocket object
