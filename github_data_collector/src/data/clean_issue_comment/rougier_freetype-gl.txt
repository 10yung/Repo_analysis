I am using a version of freetypegl from that I noticed is causing a seg fault with certain font sizes The offending font size appears to be So this week I downloaded and compiled the latest freetypegl to see if I could reproduce the issue with one of the existing freetypegl demos markupc I took the markupc source and only modified line I changed the normalsize to normalsize Then I recompiled and ran I do not get a seg fault but any text with that size does not get rendered and I get the following error messages FTError line code x null Unable to load usrsharefontstruetypedejavuDejaVuSansttf size Houston weve got a problem Following is a screenshot of the markupc demo when normalsize is set to ft It appears that the error message is originating from the texturefontloadface function in texturefontc And though not sure the error might be associated with FTSetCharSize Another strange thing is if I set the normalsize value to any of the following values the text gets rendered just fine Do you have any ideas of why this might be happening I am trying to figure out if there are sizes in general that might lead to this problem Greetings freetypegl developers and contributors We re reaching out because your project is an important part of the open source ecosystem and we d like to invite you to integrate with our fuzzing service OSSFuzz OSSFuzz is a free fuzzing infrastructure you can use to identify security vulnerabilities and stability bugs in your project OSSFuzz will Continuously run all the fuzzers you write Alert you when it finds issues Automatically close issues after they ve been fixed by a commit Many widely used open source projects like OpenSSL FFmpeg LibreOffice and ImageMagick are fuzzing via OSSFuzz which helps them find and remediate critical issues Even though typical integrations can be done in LoC we have a reward program in place which aims to recognize folks who are not just contributing to open source but are also working hard to make it more secure We want to stress that anyone who meets the eligibility criteria and integrates a project with OSSFuzz is eligible for a reward To help you getting started we attached our internal fuzzer for your project that you are welcome to use directly or to use it as a starting point If youre not interested in integrating with OSSFuzz it would be helpful for us to understand why lack of interest lack of time or something else so we can better support projects like yours in the future If we ve missed your question in our FAQ feel free to reply or reach out to us at

Program crashed with access violation error when I set texture atlas depth to it worked fine with depth The other depth settings are yet to be checked so I dont know it also works or not I want to use n to display multi line text but it only shows a white rectangle instead of creating a new line Hi I am interested in some articles about font engine I know how to make texture atlas but I could not

includes nonexistent path Einclude in its INTERFACEINCLUDEDIRECTORIES Possible reasons include The path was deleted renamed or moved to another location An install or uninstall procedure did not complete successfully The installation package was faulty and references files it does not provide PS I did build and install glfw How could I do even very long text to be fit from one to another vector For instance DrawStringVector startPos Vector endPos string label and text is properly scaled to start at startPos and end at endPos Is there any brand option
