Would be great if an autosave feature would be implemented I just experienced a crash which meant I lost all my edits to a document Pine crashed while editing a document Not doing anything special not inserting special characters or anything out of the ordinary I can think of crashlogtxt The text on the editor is wrapped at the launch of the app But if the preview panel is closed and open again the editor panels text is no longer wrapped and it creates a horizontal scrolling mode Could be possible to add an option to select if the text should be wrapped and fit to the window width Not Wrapped when adding a local image to a markdown document a space in the filename will break image loading in the preview window would be great if filesfolders added to the sidebar are remembered through quitting and restarting the app For work I often work from the same folders and it would be cool if Pine could remember this It is not clear to me how to add folders or files to the sidebar Ive tried dragging and dropping folders to no avail Any pointers Thanks pine My Setup Pine v macOS I joyfully noticed the Pine supports OSX versioning FileRevert to Unfortunately it doesnt behave as per the expectation I do see the file history UI but it open all or atleast last two revisions in app and dismiss the history view and leave the two different versions of the file open I could not grab the screenshot of the dismissal however attaching the post dismiss two version of document open in Pine screenshots Also attaching the default ui or how it is expected to work using Textedit on same file Thanks once again for open source Im planning to explore the UI testing to implement in my hobby projects img width altpineautodismissafterhistory src img width alttextedithistoryui src I installed the app through Homebrew and GitHub zip release but unfortunately both gave me a broken toolbar Screen Shot at PM Also tried to restart the app for multiple times which doesnt help Have I missed anything here brew cask info pine shows me pine usrlocalCaskroompine B From Name Pine Artifacts Pineapp App Thanks
