Running Linux Containers on Windows has moved towards using WSL LCOW support is still experimental in docker itself and its hard to track For this reason this project has been more or less dormant and I propose to archive it justincormack deitch davetucker please chime in fixes by using the last working kernel Docker info Client Debug Mode false Plugins app Docker Application Docker Inc v buildx

this mean and how does one fix this Plenty of peeps have had this issue over at the comments section at After building the following Dockerfile the container cannot use sudo due to PAM issue Dockerfile FROM opensuseleap RUN zypper noninteractive install sudo fix bug RUN sed i srootnprocunlimitedg etcsecuritylimitsconf CMD sudo ls docker build t leappamissue docker run rm leappamissue sudo pamopensession Permission denied sudo policy plugin failed session initialization This was on OpenSUSE might also affect Centosrhel related images Original Im not sure if the latest merged PR was intended to be consumed publicly but the kernel image resulting from building at that SHA will not launch containers in my environment I left some comments already at with more specifics of my environment build process etc I bring this up because of the problems Im seeing with DNS resolution in LCOW Alpine that I raised in Maybe this is an issue thats been addressed already in the dependency bumps but I cant use it at the moment To recap the linked comments this is what my Docker environment looks like Client Debug Mode false Plugins app Docker Application Docker Inc v beta

concerns over kernel version and slow pulls were no longer relevant Therefore remove the note Looks like is coming to end of support Should if not already consider upgrading to the series Note The latest stable version is the series This is also our Long Term Support LTS version supported until th September Our previous LTS version series will continue to be supported until st December security
