Will it be possible for ggcorrplot to allow users to not only display the correlation coefficients but also asterisks denoting the significance level Like When ggcorrplot is called with hcorderT and a matrix of pvalues is provided it rounds the pvalues to digits significant digits before testing them against the threshold level for significance With the default values digits and siglevel this can cause pvalues as large as to be considered significant They should be tested for significance before any rounding Currently ggcorrplot color codes only the correlation coefficients but not pvalues if a pmatrix is provided A possible way to do this would be to use biscale package with two different scales for r and p Question from a user I am using it for a large plot of variables Would it be possible to enable the correlation coefficient to be in bold Also would it be possible to display it without the initial zero instead of and and I recently updated the ggcorrplot package to Running ggcorrplot on a correlation matrix with the hcorderT option the ordering of the heatmap drastically changed compared to the older version I dont know if this is a bug or intentional but I thought I should point it out to you Between the old vs new version it looks like the only thing updated that could affect this is that you are rounding your correlation matrix At least in my data this is making quite a difference in the final results Ive a large matrix and perhaps I dont need to show the correlations between each and every variable Instead for comparison purposes between groups Id rather have a set of variables on the xaxis and the same on yaxis Something like this figure It looks like an R figure but I have failed to find a nice way of producing something like this Any ideas Im using your excellent correlation plot package with knitr and noticed that depending on the output size of the figure circles are either to small or to large In most cases the default setting is ok but from time to time a little adjustment is needed This commit gives the user some freedom at least in this regard Corrgrams were popularized by Friendly in this paper wwwdataviscapaperscorrgrampdf He used a red negative to blue positive color palette which has since become a sort of standard for corrgram colors I think your reverse color scheme will confuse many people Is it possible for ggcorrplot to support nonsquare correlation matrix Such case is frequently in data analysis for example when we only want to visualize correlation of a group of columns with another group of columns datamtcars df mtcars df mtcars corr cordf df hp drat wt qsec mpg cyl disp ggcorrplot currently can not draw nonsquare correlation matrix Also corpmat only takes single argument and cannot get pvalues for correlation between two dataframe s
