I find myself unable to learn all the keyboard commands by heart especially those i use less frequently A hotkey to bring up a list of commandsshortcuts would be very useful Would it be possible to add volume control from within ncspot itself Hey I really like the project thanks for the nice work Ive been working on creating themes for ncspot and i think i found a strange bug While or eg black provides you with the correct color using leads to a pinkish tone on my system i havent checked other systems yet That seems to be the problem for every color if one of RGB is below and no other value is above or equal B So eg B is working while A is pink Here is the theme used in the above picture theme background primary secondary title playing playingbg highlight highlightbg error errorbg statusbar statusbarprogress statusbarbg cmdline cmdlinebg When I open the context menu on a song the navigation keys that I use in the main screens are not working j k Backspace Is this intentional I stopped using MPD for a while and used MPV instead They have a really great solution to seek quickly From their Wiki LEFT and RIGHT Seek backwardforward seconds Shiftarrow does a second exact seek see hrseek UP and DOWN Seek forwardbackward minute Shiftarrow does a second exact seek see hrseek I think this is a great concept to have a fast seek and slow seek option Using the current seek command jump second ahead can be quite cumbersome especially for long tracks I you dont like the idea with quickfast seek please consider increasing the jump to something like seconds I know you can use the mouse to jump to the exact position but terminal app users try to avoid using the mouse I was thinking about this I have a repeatable pattern I do everymorning open tmux Launch ncspot Open my main playlist put it onto shuffle pause it throw the app into the background in tmux Interact with ncspot throughout the day using my media keys It would be interesting if you could launch ncspot with either cli paramaters or a cfg file to get to this same state We could then autolaunch at startup If you allowed configinteractions via the CLI it would allow custom keyboard shortcuts to a variety of states Query the current song etc Potentially even easy integration to various linux desktop components thinking Just an idea It essentially becomes a spotify backend to many other potential interactions Completely ubnderstood if it is out of scope and what you see for the project nice client but is there a way to force connecting on port i am in an firewalled environment there unfortunately is no way to connect on other ports aplist gew accesspointa t gapspotifycom gew accesspointa gztapspotifycom gew accesspointasln apspotifycom gew accesspointazjshapspotifycom gew accesspointak apspotifycom gew accesspointa djtapspotifycom guc accesspointam ztapspotifycom guc accesspointawz lapspotifycom gae accesspointa zxrapspotifycom I dont want to use ncspot to manage my playlists or anything and I dont want to accidentally delete something which I may have already done considering I pressed s because I thought it was a different key I just want it to be a simple player Even if there were confirmation dialogs for mutating actions a readonly mode is a very good overall safeguard This is an effort to explore how to fix Theres quite a few challenges here but I hope to simplify the Queue interface significantly along the way File with credentials is being deleted in case of failed validation regardless of a reason For example when client does not have a internet connection forcing user to reenter them
