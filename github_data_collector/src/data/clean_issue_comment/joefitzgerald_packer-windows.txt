With this change in all Autounattendxml files the Key element is commented the same description is used The corresponding documentation on the XML schema can be found here Since commit c a b efc the final instead of the technical preview iso is used The latest win config was pulling which is end of life for most people I added an autounattendxml for Not sure if this was intentionally but a

discussion to avoid using tools directly downloaded from sourceforge SourceForge has a history of bundling software packages of unknowing authors with adware The project was called Devshare and once SourceForge was aquired by Bizx they said they stop this programm after massive backlash But the site is stll full of adds and has lost almost all of its reputation The mentioned snipped is for defragging the disk A task that can be easily handled with native windows tools see for example It would be nice if we could find such external tools and reduce their usage where possible avoid them where native alternatives exist and avoid them if they come from sourceforge Any opinions It looks like Microsoft have removed their Windows iso from that location Is there an alternate location or should we use a retail iso
