please feel free to comment and participate to share your views Im trying to use something like this code a classgold dataactionadd Add data point code I always get the NaN error please can you explain how to get this to work Please make a package for use with meteorjs at Meteor has bladejade but coffeescript is better as you say one language to rule them all When using requirejs nodejs to combine scripts The below code in the coffeecupjs does not load the compilerjs file the below code only works for the coffeecup executable coffee coffeecup exports coffee requirecoffeescript compiler requiredirname compiler compilersetupcoffeecup fs requirefs The following valid CoffeeCup throws an error on compilation CoffeeScript script buttontemplate type texthtml menuitem Button data bind text Running the example for Express in examplesexpress only renders the HTML in specific view files eg indexcoffee and doesnt place the rendered view into the layoutcoffee body block as expected Steps Install express coffeecup coffee appcoffee Visit View source shows only the h and p tags from indexcoffee not the entire HTML page coffeecup express Im using CoffeeCup to create SVG content This works great except for one issue SVG has a text element But in CoffeeCup the obvious way of creating such elements doesnt work I want to generate text x y Hellotext text x y Hello This only produces Object as it invokes the text helper function instead of a tag function A workaround I found is to define my own helper function that can create arbitrary elements helpers element tagname args cctagtagname args coffeecuprender myTemplate myData hardcode helpers I use it like this in the template to produce the desired result element text x y Hello Maybe a similar function could be added to the CoffeeCup DSL to deal with this situation as well as any other potential future situation where an element name may clash with a helper or reserved word I could be wrong about this but I cant think of any situation where a person would not want to escape what goes into an HTML attribute Doing for instance span dataequation x x is less than leads to HTML of dubious validity but it will probably still render properly Trying span dataoutcome She said yes He asked if she wanted to will render as span dataoutcomeShe said yesHe asked if she wanted tospan which is definitely invalid So when there is arbitrary data going into an attribute I have to add the h helper around the value every time which is not so neat Id say this should go for attribute names and the ID and class values too even though the characters which would be escaped are likely not ever valid in attribute ID and class names Better to throw warnings or end up with invalid IDclass names than to end up with invalid HTML Even if you dont agree that they should always be escaped I suppose if you happen to have the strings in alreadyescaped format you might not want to it should at least be an option This has been unresolved in a satisfactory manner since June someone first popped the question I believe Could there at least be some discussion on what would be a desirable approach to cleanly implement such a feature if even desired into coffeecup Id like to here what the lot of you think I didnt do a pull request You have a few waiting anyway I suggest something like to stay in line with the rest of the code and conventions to modify clicoffee and append a switch eg i for processing stdin coffeescript i stdin accept input over standard input interface stdin Then add coffeescript codeIn stdin processopenStdin and under run if optionsstdin Buffer streams of data and concat to string until finished stdinon data buffer codeIn buffertoString if buffer stdinon end log coffeecuprender codeIn This will allow for something like sh coffee p b myfilelitcoffee js coffee coffeecup i As a little roundtrip since coffeescript cli tool doesnt really allow a unmangle of the litcoffee files yet
