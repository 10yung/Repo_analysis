This tutorial is one of the few and better resources to pick up some scalajs The modal however doesnt work when upgrading to scalajsreact Perhaps the whole project can be updated to latest versions of everything sbt sbtscalajs play scala scalajsDom scalajsReact react jquery bootstrap updated english gitbook docs this tutorial is awesome thanks Im new to Play and some of the libraries here so some of this is dumb patternmatching InjectedController that may not be the right way to do things I also disabled CSRF checking because it was ing all requests it will probably be good to fix that before merging Moving the Settingsscala into buildsbt to be idiomatic SBT x style is a possible addition as well Korean translation completely rewritten Made a small change on theclientmd to reflect change from the code The Korean translation of the documentation seems to require a lot of fixing overall from simple typos and grammatical mistakes to ambiguous and sometimes downright wrong wording READMEmd SUMMARYmd gettingstartedmd applicationstructuremd theclientmd routingmd mainmenumd dashboardmd cssinscalamd integratingjavascriptcomponentsmd todomoduleanddataflowmd autowireandboopicklemd serversidemd testingmd debuggingmd loggingmd sbtbuilddefinitionmd usingresourcesfromwebjarsmd productionbuildmd faqmd whatnextmd Hi I am new to ScalaJS React Diode etc and trying out this project and am building a search dialog that I want to contain a table of results All is fine I can capture the Keyword represented as a first class model object do the search and map the results to a Results object in the model but I am having trouble nesting the result table in the search dialog as the result table is currently tied to the Results object and I cant initialize the results child table component from the parent search dialog as it looks as if the framework only supports a single model proxy inside a render method def renderp Props PanelPanelPropsSearch div bssformGroup marginTop label for lookupField Keyword inputtextbssformControl width id keyword placeholder type keyword search terms here onBlur findNearbypproxy br ppproxyvaluegetOrElseKeywordid HOW DO I DO THIS SearchResultsTable Do I need to artificially create a new aggregate model object that captures both the query Keyword from the search dialog and the Results from the dialogs table or is there another way that I am completely missing Thanks in advance I did as a documentation said and installed the latest jsdom npm packagev but Ive got an error when running the tests TypeError jsdomcreateVirtualConsole is not a function I had to downgrade to v to make the tests run The documentation should specify the version of jsdom that the app relies onand it probably should be updated I guess If you are ok with adding to the documentation I can do a quick PR Is it possible to include static assets namely images served from Play and referenced from Scalajs code Tricky because when for example using sbtdigest to fingerprint assets the final asset name isnt known and reverse Assets routes and AssetsFinder cant be used Soliciting ideas or guidance here since my searches havent turned up anything scalajsreact is just around the corner Are there any plans to upgrade this tutorial to such release
