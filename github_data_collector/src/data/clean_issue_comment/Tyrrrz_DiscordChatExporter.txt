A more practical way to save messages instead of html or json would be with database format so that the new messages can be added to the old ones instead of remaking the messages files and losing information Is it possible to suppress things like Embedded website previews and Reactions from showing up in the plain text log or is that perhaps a feature that could be added So eg for website previews youd just have the bare link someone sent instead of the preview and for reactions youd just have nothing in the plain text Note that for my purposes Id definitely to keep the discord image link generated when you attach an image So I wouldnt want to suppress all content outside the main body of the message just some selectively Hl Im having an issue with the plain text output format On Discord you can use to indicate a block quote and then all the text after that will have a quote level applied though attachments and embeds will not have a quote level So eg if you write something like this in Discord Line above block quote Line in block quote and a link It will render as something like this within Discord Line above block quote Line in block quote and a link with an embedded website preview following the quote if you have those set to display But the plain text output from DiscordChatExporter looks like this Line above block quote Line in block quote and a link Embed Constitution of the United States We the People A highly accessible easy to use online version of the U S Constitution with the full text including the Bill of Rights and the rest of the Amendments includes both sequential and subject indexes What I would prefer is if the output is was something like this Line above block quote Line in block quote and a link Embed Constitution of the United States We the People A highly accessible easy to use online version of the U S Constitution with the full text including the Bill of Rights and the rest of the Amendments includes both sequential and subject indexes and actually Id like to be able to suppress embedded website previews from the text log but thats a separate request Now interestingly DiscordChatExporter can output what I want if I have Preview emojis mentions and markdown syntax as you type beta feature turned on Discord Heres an example of plain text output with the beta Preview stuff turned on followed by explanation Dec PM JustinCEO Line above block quote Line made a block quote with markdown preview off Line hit shift then then enter then started typing this line then enabled markdown preview before sending So to be clear on Line in the above I had actually input with Markdown Preview off then turned it on before sending my message And the plain text output I got was reasonable and what Id like But Im not a big fan of the beta preview features overall Everyone else doing block quotes in a chat would have to use beta preview features for a whole chat log to not have the problem Im discussing There would still be the issue of past messages having suboptimal quoting Some context for why I care Im on a server that is really into detailed discussions heavy quoting and also posting snippets of Discord logs to markdownsupporting blogs Itd be easier to do this if the output coming out of DiscordChatExporter were refined in the way I discuss above This change would avoid the problem posting a snippet of a Discord log to a blog and of eg the first paragraph in a multiparagraph block quote being rendered as having three levels of quotes and the rest having no quoting So far Ive just been adjusting my chat logs manually but since I noticed that in Markdown preview mode Discord apparently has the ability to output the format I want even when a Discord message in draft was composed with the to indicate a block quote I figured perhaps this change wouldnt be too hard to implement from a technical perspective Thanks for all the work on this program I make serious use of it The CSV export lacks a field for the message ID if this was in the CSV itd make programatically working with the data x easier I know theres a push to replace CSV with JSON but for the time being itd be a useful additional feature to have Thanks And the release page hints that it is supposed to work for bit noting the link to the bit net installer Is there a build in way to specify how partitioned exported logs are numbered I have chat logs that are Chat name chat id of and Id like to drop the of part so that they just read Chat name chat id While using a user account in the client it states whats a group and whats a dm however in the export it counts it all as dms and the only way I was able to differentiate them was TextHtmlCSV looking at the file name and how many people are listen in it if any looking if anyone was added or left Counting how many usernames are in the chat TextHtml Looking at how many people are listed in the channel if any Anyway my point is it would be nice if it would notify the user that its a group and not just a dm If Im wrong and it does say it somewhere Im sorry for wasting your time Thanks in advance It would be amazing to have the option to use unix timestamps This would make it much easier to migrate channel data to slack via csv import The core issue is for users who have large servers a way to organize the output programmatically rather than manually after the export Including the category information in the title csv are the simplest solutions I can think of Related it would be great to not just have a flat hirarchie of channels names but to add the group name those channels are in to the filename ANDOR even better create subfolders so an entire discord server can be backed up with directory tree structure
