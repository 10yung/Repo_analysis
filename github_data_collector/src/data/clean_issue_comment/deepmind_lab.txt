Hi Can someone please tell me how to generate a heat map for a level in deepmind lab effectively Right now I am trying to generate heat map using DEBUGPOSTRANS but the heat maps are not accurate Please do let me know if there is any other way to generate heat map effectively Thanks a lot in advance Regards I am also following macos deep mind as instructed but keep getting SDLopeng h problem I fixed the Pythonh error but am not quite sure if I got it right bazel run pythonrandomagent define graphicssdl length width height INFO Analyzed target pythonrandomagent packages loaded targets configured INFO Found target ERROR UsersongDownloadslabBUILD C compilation of rule gamelibsdl failed Exit wrappedclang failed error executing command externallocalconfigccwrappedclang DFORTIFYSOURCE fstackprotector fcolordiagnostics Wall Wthreadsafety Wselfassign fnoomitframepointer O DDEBUG iquote iquote remaining arguments skipped Use sandboxdebug to see verbose messages from the sandbox In file included from enginecoderenderergl trworldc In file included from enginecoderenderergl trlocalh In file included from enginecoderenderergl renderercommontrcommonh enginecoderenderergl renderercommonqglh fatal error SDLopenglh file not found include SDLopenglh error generated Target pythonrandomagent failed to build Use verbosefailures to see the command lines of failed build steps INFO Elapsed time s Critical Path s INFO processes darwinsandbox FAILED Build did NOT complete successfully FAILED Build did NOT complete successfully While OSX is not officially supported I wanted to point out the issues and solutions I found necessary to get Deepmind lab running on on the macos branch with python for those who are interested Im not sure if any of these should be merged but the documentation could be adapted Issues Or at least those I was able to find RESOLVED AS OF The deepmindsupportrealpath script no longer functions on Fix Install the coreutils brew package which includes a functioning realpath and replace all lines in BUILD of the form ln s location deepmindsupportrealpath with ln s realpath The patch file is here SDL renders the window in only of the screen Fix Use SDL by installing with HEAD on brew This is related to high DPI support in the upstream See and Hi First thanks for providing this great platform I have some question related to the depth buffer as following In depth buffer what is the resolution have I saw the seta rdepthbits in quake config file assetsq configcfg Is it bit by default Can we change the setting to a bit to increase the dynamic range How to convert the values in the depth buffer to real depth in the game world I will be very thankful if anyone can help me Manually compiling the package seems to be quite complicated especially for users not familiar with Bazel Would it be possible to provide prebuilt Python wheel packages for the most common platforms I am trying to get entity layout for the builtin navmaze levels I found that the navmazerandomgoal have hard coded the entity layout strings in their lua scripts while navmazestatic just create map without layout parameters Whats more all debug DEBUGMAZELAYOUT outputs of those levels are empty My question is how to get the layout of static goal map in form of string Hello I want to get object segmentation mask per frame but I notice that there is no such mask in OBSERVATION However in Vizdoom we can get segmentation mask easily How can I figure this out Can you give me some programming guidance Im trying to create an observation that represents a local overhead view of a certain radius around the agent I modified debugobservationslua such that the camera position is set to the agents position function debugobservationssetCameraPos camerapos gameplayerInfopos pos pos desired additional height cameralook look or cameralook end local function topDownInterleavedCamera local buffer gamerenderCustomView width SCREENSHAPEwidth height SCREENSHAPEheight pos camerapos look cameralook return buffer end and commented out the setCameraPos in settingsoverrideslua However this doesnt seem to do anything Not sure what Im missing here or does it require rebuilding or something Any input is appreciated I want to test the Lua scripts in luatests like colorstestlua but I could not find the dmlabsystem modules such as dmlabsystemgame where can I find those modules def preprocessframeself rgbd rgb rgbd d rgbd d d crop d d crop d d subsample d dflatten d nppowerd d npdigitized d return rgb d d or d
