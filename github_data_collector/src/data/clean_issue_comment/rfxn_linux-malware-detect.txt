our CentOS servers for many years but recently enabled inotify support on several of the servers for use with another tool on the server What I didnt realize at the time is the effect that would have on maldetect until one of the servers almost ran out of disk space When I dug into what was using all of the disk space I found that the usrlocalmaldetectlogsinotifylog file was using up Gb of disk space by itself I deleted the file and restarted maldetect and the disk space returned to normal but now that Im watching it I see that it is filling up rapidly again I set up a daily cron job to delete that file and restart maldetect which seems like fixing the issue with a sledgehammer but looking at the file now after only hours the file is already Gb in size So I have the following questions Is the inotifylog file actually needed Is there any way to disable it I couldnt find such a way after an exhaustive search Is there any way to force maldetect to regularly clear the inotifylog file and recreate it I found that the purge option deletes the other log files but not the inotifylog file why If the answers to the above questions dont provide a viable solution what is the best way to keep the inotifylog file from consuming the entire disk Were having problems getting the Maldet emails from the server delivered This is because of the outgoing spamfilter these are shared hosting servers that does not accept email from rootservernaam Is there some way to define a sender int the emails send Thank you in advance Hello We are facing falsepositive result on file indexphp of many websites The file is obfuscated and therefore can be considered as a virus it contains many hexacoded symbols but actually it is not Please check the file example The scanner result is YARAphpmalwarehexinject Is it possible to fix this issue so that the file was not considered as a virus Thanks How to There is literally no documentation to set log path is it not possible Seems

created or modified inside my home folder but when I delete it I dont see any new message alerting about it I think it would be worthy to monitor this event too Thanks
