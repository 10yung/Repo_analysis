Getting error while using DrawingController in swift class Using Swift Xcode How can I fix this build error Build error Method possibly missing a super awakeFromNib call img width altscreen shot at src Override the parent class method Project view implementation files contains awakeFromNib Method Because of a versioning issue this method compilation does not pass without overwriting the parent class add super awakeFromNib Request to have iPad Pro multitasking compatibility added ie have Inkpad run in one window while something else runs in another window Thanks Ed OrigamiEd Hi I do lots of vector animation in browsers and I have a habit of cleaning up my SVG docs and fully understanding whats going on in them Im considering using Inkpad in my workflow but during my initial exploration I found the Inkpad namespace which I cant find any documentation for Why is it there What functionality is added with this Throughout my doc I found inkpadlayername and inkpadmask attributes what are these It seems like I can safely remove these from the doc once they are in the web project but I assume some functionality will be lost if I would open the SVG in Inkpad again A comment on Inkpad namespace would be very much appreciated Thanks Johan Hello Just one question Could I open and compile this project in xCode v Im trying but I find many errors Am I doing anything wrong Regards Please add copy and paste icons For now the user can access them only from the menu but if the user is doing these operations allot its quite inefficient Having icons for all actions and allowing the user to configure what its default visible would greatly increase the usability of the application Thank you Hi It would be very helpful to allow users to configure the visible iconstools Thank you Hi Any plans adding user stencils support eg like OmniGraffle The various users need very different shapes but having an easy way to share this stuff would make Inkpad much more usable Thank you
