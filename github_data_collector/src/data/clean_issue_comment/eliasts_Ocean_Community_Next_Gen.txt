Hi Im trying out oceancommunity on webgl but encouter a few errors in the browser console What is the status of getting it to work on WebGL Should it be possible or is it a dead end for now I noticed just recently that the ocean reflections flicker in the Oceanwithshipsisland Im not sure why but it only seems to happen in that scene I only have one camera in the scene The reflections often lag behind when the camera moves quickly The reflections jump and skip when the camera is stationary With reflections turned off refraction turned on there is still some flickering I run that scene but it looks like the pic below img width alt src I use Unity f and MacOS I am trying to create halo to my lights but they are not rendered when the background is the ocean Is there something that I can do Particularly noticeable when head is tilted sideways Any ideas Hi Im using Unity and working with two Cameras in one Scene I noticed the Oceans mesh kept flashingflickering on the Camera with a lower Depth value ex when compared to the other Camera on top which has a higher Depth value ex that looks normal Both Cameras uses Unitys Post Processing Stack v and removing them doesnt make a difference Ive also tried changing the GameObject I specified in the Follow field and even removed it but the problem persists Has Ocean been tested using Cameras at least and would you have any solution to this issue Hi there Im using your ocean in one of my project Everything works really well in the Editor of Unity However when I built the project It crashes every time a new scene is loaded after the scene with ocean Will you have a future update or anyway to fix this I tried to downgrade my project but everything else other than the ocean was a disaster Would really appreciate if there is anyway I can have this ocean run in Thank you
