Command container flask run python I hope I m not intruding or anything I literally just discovered your project and it s everything I ve always wanted from Docker Anyway if you re ever looking for some inspiration for shell scripting theres this project I ve written a while back and still use such personally every day especially for quickly running hardcoded commands from the horribly verbose AWS CLI that implements an indentation sensitive shell parser Anyway just thought it may interest you also I ve been thinking about rewriting such in rust It doesn t try to replace shell scripting in any way rather the intention was to simply make writing such less verbose and feel more modern ie it supports multiline strings which has been very convenient for CLI based SQL workflows It s crazy that in Docker I have to write scripts like this RUN cd frontendcms npm install bower install allowroot mkdir p distreleasebuild pulp browserify optimise to distreleasebuildappbundlejs browserify p tinyify distreleasebuildappbundlejs outfile distreleasebuildappbundlejs uglifycss assetscsscss distreleasebuildappbundlecss htmlminifier assetsindexhtml collapsewhitespace removecomments removeoptionaltags removeredundantattributes removescripttypeattributes removetagwhitespace cp r dist releasebuild Since I think an indentation sensitive shell parser feels more natural also with some higher order convenience utils ie the from thing not sure what to call it from frontendcms do npm install bower install allowroot mkdir p distreleasebuild pulp browserify optimise to distreleasebuildappbundlejs browserify p tinyify distreleasebuildappbundlejs outfile distreleasebuildappbundlejs uglifycss assetscsscss distreleasebuildappbundlecss htmlminifier assetsindexhtml
