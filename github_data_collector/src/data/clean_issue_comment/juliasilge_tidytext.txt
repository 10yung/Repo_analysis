 is an XML style sheet that Ive put into a ridiculously simple function in my Mercury Postlight API pkg It strips all HTML tags out of a document leaving just the text Only mentioning it as it might be something to consider adding likely after improving to tidytext if an xslt dependency is tolerable I suggest to add a function to bind BM score which is based on a probabilistic term weighting model It is useful in some cases as it gives control over Term frequency saturation DocumentField length normalization It is commonly used as a ranking function by search engines I implemented a function bindbm in the forked repo HERE bindbm is given bare names bindbm functiontbl termcol documentcol ncol k b bindbm tbl colnamesubstitutetermcol colnamesubstitutedocumentcol colnamesubstitutencol k k b b bindbm is given strings bindbm functiontbl termcol documentcol ncol k b terms tbl termcol documents tbl documentcol n tbl ncol doctotals tapplyn documents sum avgdl meandoctotals idf loglengthdoctotals tableterms tbltfbm k nnk bbasnumericdoctotals documents avgdl tblidf asnumericidf terms tblbm tbltfbm tblidf tbl I think it would be fairly easy to add support for the lsa package to tidytext and broom See example below r Put some docs in a vector librarydplyr doc cpets dog cat ferret doc csandwiches turkey ham doc ccat ferret cat bird doc cturkey beef sandwiches myvector cdoc doc doc doc mydf dataframeid text myvector Create a corpus libraryquanteda mycorpus corpusmydf textfield text mytokens tokensmycorpus mydfm dfmmytokens Perform LSA mytdm convertmydfm to lsa mytdmweighted lwlogtfmytdm gwidfmytdm myLSAspace lsamytdmweighted dims Heres how broomaugment could add factor scores back to the original data frame factorscores asdataframemyLSAspacedk augmented bindcolsmydf factorscores Heres how tidytexttidy could tidy the factor loadings librarytidyverse asdataframe is used to maintain row names until rownamestocolumn can get them loadingstidy asdataframemyLSAspacetk rownamestocolumn renameterm rowname gatherfactor loading The new variables startswithV These go into loading term term is not gathered arrangefactor descloading Sort selectfactor term loading Change var order to enhance readablity printloadingstidy Of course this can be achieved with tidyrnest Proposing a wrapper to allow tidytext users to operate within the grammar of the package Do we want to implement a tidy interface to a stemming algorithm I am aware of the one in SnowballC which we are already importing via dependency
