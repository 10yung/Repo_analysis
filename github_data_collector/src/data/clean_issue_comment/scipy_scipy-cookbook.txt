For example fancy indexing for could have been expressed by missing info here but it is not possible to do the same for by means of a slice So this is why an object with a copy of the original data is returned instead ie a new object with a copy remember fancy indexing does not return views of some elements of is created and returned prior to call is there missing information here which call Hint think in terms of the sequence of getitem and setitem calls and what they do on each example Not sure if something else is meant with the triple braces Sorry I would put up a PR if I knew what info to fill in but im learning now Sorry not sending pull request as I am not sure I am correct But I tried returning the slice suggested and had different output length I am not sure of the math and how numpyconvolve works but my correction seems to pull the middle slice Eg for windowlen my suggested slice omits first two and last two elements NOTE lengthoutput lengthinput to correct this return y windowlen windowlen instead of just y be NOTE lengthoutput lengthinput to correct this return y windowlen windowlen instead of just y
