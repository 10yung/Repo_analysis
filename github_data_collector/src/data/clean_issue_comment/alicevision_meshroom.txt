Desktop please complete the following and other pertinent information OS Linux generic Ubuntu SMP Python version Python QtPySide version not sure how to get it Meshroom version Meshroom Binary version if applicable Hello all I am trying to make a d model of my son for D printing I used a DSLR camera and took about pictures All of the pictures were focused on the the upper body since I do not want to make a model of the whole body I loaded these images into Meshroom but when all is processed I end up with a hole where the person should be See screenshot below Do I need to take pictures of the whole body to make this work Ive already unchecked the Keep only the largest mesh setting in MeshFiltering which has been suggested for similar issues but this does seem to have an effect I suppose I could go out and retake the pictures including the whole person this time but if theres another setting Im missing that would be even better Thanks Julio Features list X Fix meshroom i inputFolder X

dimensions info x info Overall maximum dimension x Screenshot this is the first time this has happened and all of my other projects have been successful Im on Windows and I dont know what version of python it is There are some question related to scanning of full human body I have tried some setups but none give satisfying results I started with images with smaller final length larger fov for saving time on photo shooting In FeatureExtraction SIFT and High The result is pretty noisy and the arms and legs are not recognized Then I added AKAZE for extraction matching and SfM which gives a little better result yet the arms and legs are still disconnect I increased to images with the previous large fov and high focal length small fov There are poses are missed in SfM The resulting mesh is still nosie but the arms are better However the legs are still broken I guess there skin cannot be identified well Any suggestion on what parameters are better for human body Say dressed in beachstyle Or photo shooting techniques Angle lighting etc Hello first of all thanks to all contributors of Meshroom This is seriously some great software However i have following problem The Scan I scanned an quite simple object with a sum of images yes that quite takes a while to process I tried to get one perfect scan I fixed the quite big object on a chair with a displacer between chair and object so i can scan it x degrees My plan was to remove the displacer in PostProduction This is stiff so the construction did not move around while taking the images Light was also perfect no shadows at all My images were shot automatically quite tight together like cm distance between each photo on horizontal axis and cm distance on vertical axis see images I dont know if this matters I am using Meshroom on Windows with a RTX The Issue The output of the MeshingNode does not show the object It does also not show the chair and the displacer which isnt a requirement at all Instead it shows the whole room like the object and the steel rodes were never in the room at any time It is like the object was cut out The room looks quite good meshed however but of course that is not what I wanted to do As this took days to process I thought i messed up some settings which are nearly all standard just changed downscale setting I remembered the Keep only the largest Meshsetting in the MeshFilteringNode But the Keep Only the Largest MeshSetting is NOT activated Images struc On this image you can see the output of the StructureFromMotion node I set the camerasize and the pointsize to very low You can even see the object here quite good Everything looks fine meshing This image however shows the output of the Meshingnode from the same perspective You can see that the chair and everything on it is just gone Instead there its a little whole on the floor its actually grass i propably never did a capture of this area both This image shows StructureFromMotion and MeshingNode Output at the same time You can see that there is absolutly no Mesh were the object is Does anyone have any idea on how to avoidsolve this Do I need to make a new scan Is it just a settingthingy Which settings could produce such a result Is it maybe an real issue Thanks for your help Marc Describe the bug Exporting a PNG from darktable results in an image that fails to load metadata in meshroom Exporting to JPG works If I examine in GIMP metadata is present for both images Both images taken with same cameralens Example images Screenshot OS Ubuntu generic Ubuntu SMP Mon Jun UTC x x x GNULinux Python version and QtPySide version Meshroom version please specify if you are using a release version or your own build Binary version Description The purpose of this is to make masks user guided within meshroom with minimal user interaction which when combined with and alicevisionAliceVision will get another option for masking workflow rather than relying on thresholding which will only work for some setups Features list Window overlay accessible from Edit menu Masks generated using the GrabCut algorithm The algorithm is sped up by setting iterations to and lowering image resolution screenshot Implementation remarks Given the structure of meshroom it would probably make more sense to have the mask calculated in c and then the exe ran from python to avoid adding opencv dependency when it is already on AliceVision so I will look into this possibility Describe the problem I wanna edit the GUI with QT creatoris there a qt creator s project for meshroom Screenshots Additional context In other photogrammetry programs I used I was able to export a model Fix ugly missing faces and then import the model back in the photogrammetry application so it could update for the textures Is it possible to do such thing in photogrammetry And if so is there any tutorial availbe online No matter what d modelling application they use for the fixes
