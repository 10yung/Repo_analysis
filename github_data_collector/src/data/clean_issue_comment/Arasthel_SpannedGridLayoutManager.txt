for the main activity CoordinatorLayout AppBarLayout Toolbar AppBarLayout FrameLayout BottomNavigation CoordinatorLayout The FrameLayout holds a fragment and heres how it looks like ConstraintLayout RecyclerView include layoutlayoutbaselistloading include layoutlayoutbaselistempty ConstraintLayout The problem is when using your SpannedGridLayoutManager Im not able to scroll all the way down It Can just scroll for like th of the page I also have Item Types Type SpanSize Type SpanSize Type SpanSize I cant use and as your library changes the sizes and I need to have the layouts at the ratio for the images It works when I use these though but then again I need the sizes to be of that ratio Also In your scrollBy function the canScrollForward flag returns a false even though Im havent fully scrolled down the screen yet Would there be a way that we can define the sizeratio of cell so as a SpanSize can sort of look like a square Thanks firstVisiblePosition I have the following code to

with a full column span return new SpanSizenumColumns Other items are with span width or The number of columns is After collecting the items they are used for the RV adapter The problem is that the order in the rendered RV is not the same as the items Result Pic Could you please fix that I can confirm that the default GridLayoutManager is working with these items I want to change the number of columnsspans when the user rotates the device I was doing this using GridLayoutManagersetSpanCount but dont see a similar method available for SpannedGridLayoutManager Does one exist and Im just missing it I ended up recreating the layout manager after device rotates but at least it seems like this would be good to add if it makes sense The SpannedGridLayoutManageronLayoutChildren method computes the scroll offset with val offset viewtop getTopDecorationHeightview irregardless of the orientation Adds a function for the developer to customize the height of each item Hello here I tried to force the line height in the case of a vertical spanned grid recycler view On creating the ViewHolder I set a new SpanLayoutParams with a computed height here we try to have a specific number of line matching the recycler height But items are drawn with a height matching the width of a onespansized item Is there a way to achieve this with this SpannedGridLayoutManager Thanks by advance Edit just to know the same methos of forcing items line height works fine with a classic GridLayoutManager
