Can you add switch or new tab for album artist because right now its just painful to find music here Instead of seeing for example ATB i need to search through all ATB feat and etc So the thing is that its moving very slow so basicly white my finger is a the bottom of the screen the tab is still halfway through so I need to wait for it till is gets to where I want it to be I want to be in the playlist Also if its at the bottom in a playlist I cant see the tab anymore neither I can touch it So I have to scroll several times within the playlist till that scrollingtab appears again on the bottom right so that I can grab it and use it And if you have a lot of songs just like I do it takes some time to scroll through your music several times with your thumb till that tab appears at the bottom And another thing is that I would really really like you guys to include is an option in the playlist for sorting the music like az within a playlist This would be veryyy helpful Thanks a lot I wish I could send you a Screenshot or a screen video so that you would better unter stand the problem I just described but nether the less I hope you got it right Device info table trtdApp versiontdtd
