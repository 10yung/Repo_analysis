 new line Hi recently Ive been studying your code especially on the conditional DCGAN you made for MNIST dataset I see that you concatenated the condition on every layer right after BatchNorm and ReLu but I still get puzzled with the convcondconcat function that you use to concat the condition into hidden layer On some layer you simply use Tconcatenate to join them but on the other layer you join them using convcondconcat function as described below def convcondconcatx y concatenate conditioning vector on feature map axis return Tconcatenate x yTonesxshape yshape xshape xshape axis My questions are why using this function instead of simple Tconcatenate judging from reshaping of y I assume you are depthconcatenating it Am I correct Hi Im interested in the contents which is in section VISUALIZING THE DISCRIMINATOR FEATURES of DCGAN paper Im not sure I could understanding this part but I failed to implement it I refered to of the following page please give me some tip or implementation code doesnt matter at any code thanks in advance Newmu can you help me with sample code how to make this part I ask about the features of size how can i get this size and how to get features from it to every image Thanks in advance HI new to python so Im just poking around and the initial setup could use some help in the form of a requirementstxt file Would love a pip freeze requirementstxt if youve got a virtual env with the right deps Awesome project This is more of a doubt than an issue Why you dont add batch norm to the last layer of your discriminator and generator Hi Alec I read from the Indico blog that you guys use docker a lot just wondering if you have a docker copy of DCGAN handy to share Thanks Really cool work by the way Xinxin
