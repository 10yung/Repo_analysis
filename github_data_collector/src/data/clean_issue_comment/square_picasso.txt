I wanted to load images from Url into a simple Imageview using Picasso But unfortunately I am facing some issue I have included the logs below and the relevant code I have given Internet permission and using the latest build of Picasso MainActivityjava package comexamplepicassotest import androidxappcompatappAppCompatActivity import androidnetUri import androidosBundle import

use picasso When loading image the network is unstable resulting in incomplete picture display do you know why what should I do Picasso fails in loading pictures where the URL contains colon character Im experiencing such a problem in loading pictures obtained by using Google Knowledge Graph Search API For example by using the API you can get info like these image url contentUrl It would be nice to be able to handle network failures depending on the HTTP status code Currently when image downloading fails Picasso executes Callbacks onErrorException e method and passes a NetworkRequestHandlerResponseException However because this is a packageprivate class we cant cast the generic argument to get the status code I think that throwing a specialized exception when the consumer can only see its generic interface defeats the purpose use picasso load web image to imageview url from aliyun oss server there are two url one is original another is cname url like alias original url is load success but alias url is fail this two url both can visit on browser and have same respose and on same pc same net envboth url can be load on ios project so whats the problem I have same tablets One is having as android for work profile as the application I am currently developing is used for corporate work On the regular tablet this code of showing an image from the internal storage works File img new FileactualMissionLocationgetAbsolutePath locationgetName jpg PicassogetloadimgintoimageView This same code does not work on the device with the AFW It is showing a black screen The jpg image was saved by my application and it is there in the file system I have tried with Uri in the format of file but also did not work on AFW What seems to be the problem here Thanks for your help in advance Image is not loading sometimes so I enabled the Picasso log the log in the case when its not loading is DPicasso Main created R Request circle it should enque and complete that but nothing happens the case when its loading picture successfully is DPicasso Main created R Request circle DPicasso Main completed R from MEMORY the picasso object i am using is java
