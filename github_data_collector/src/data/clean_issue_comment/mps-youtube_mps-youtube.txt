Before merging this PR we need to set up some tokens for Github Actions to be able to push to dockerhub Dockerfile changes We now build the Docker image from the source code in the repository instead of downloading the newest version of pip This way we can release multiple images of different and unreleased versions through dockerhub New mpsyt organization on dockerhub Ive created a new organization for mpsyt on dockerhub Ill have to somehow get in touch with contributors in the mpsyt org in order to add them to the org and sort out owner rights at some point Github actions This PR also adds a few simple workflows that lets us automatically build images when we update the master and develop branch of the repository The images are pushed to the aforementioned newly created org In order to facilitate that we need to set a dockerhub secret to grant push rights However it looks like only ids has access to do that I can add him as owner to the dockerhub org then he can create a security token and add that to the repo secrets and then we can automatically perform changes here We couldshould also set up some schedule based workflows which would check and rebuild the images if youtubedl has been updated As well as building tagged versions of the software as well Not sure if this repo is still maintained but anyway Pulling and running the docker image results in the old version from which doesnt work Version docker run device devsnd it rm name mpsyt rothgarmpsyt version WARNINGrootpafy youtubedl not found falling back to internal backend This is not as well maintained as the youtubedl backend To hide this message set the environmental variable PAFYBACKEND to internal mpsyt version notes released July pafy version internal backend Python version default

Its possible now to allow autobuilds on dockerhub integration with github so that images are up to date automatically The save command when used without any argument will always save the new playlist name using the artist name in the first position chars completely ignoring the lastopened playlist it doesnt matter if it exists or not How to reproduce mpsyt Opening ls List all local playlits Local Playlists ID Name Count Duration AlternativeRock ComedyRock CountryRap DanceElectronic open Opening playlist of index Num Title Length a title another yet another title some fourth title Loaded playlist DanceElectronic as current playlist rm Removing entry of index Num Title Length a title another yet another title tracks removed save Saving with no arguments Num Title Length a title another yet another title Playlist saved as atitle Use ls to list playlists ls Listing playlits again ID Name Count Duration AlternativeRock ComedyRock CountryRap DanceElectronic atitle I dont know if this is the best thing to do or not from where I see it is not because when someone is workingremoving or moving things inside a local playlist the expected behavior would be to save that same playlist not another one with some other name matching the first characters of the first indexed title this doesnt make much sense to me in this context Probably would make sense in other cases like if the list is not a local playlist but a search list for example then the save command would be free to use the first chars of index to save the newly created playlist if none is specified Let me know if my logic is wrong or not from your point of view guys thank you Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above Hi I would gladly add a nocolors option it can be useful if somebody wants to use mpsyoutube with the default terminal color settings What about it j Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above want to watch p videos sending them to an old CRT this used to work but doesnt seem to anymore Now it says maxres is many YouTube videos are still p Issue Suggestion If youre describing a bug tell us what error you are experiencing If youre suggesting a changeimprovement tell us how it should work Your Environment Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in Run mpsyt version and post your version information here What version of the OS are you running any other What music player are you using with mpsyoutube version Provide a general summary of the issue in the Title above Issue Suggestion Is there some list of programs or packages that I must install before mps youtube Your Environment Running on a raspberry pi with raspbian buster Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in Run mpsyt version and post your version information here What version of the OS are you running any other What music player are you using with mpsyoutube version Issue When either launched with mpsyt set showvideo false playurl URL or played using the playurl command inside mpsyt the video is shown anyway as if showvideo was set to true The expected behavior is that the livestream would be played normally with audio only like any other video PS I tried it with mplayer and the livestream didnt play at all showing that the video length is and immediately stopping playback after entering the command Your Environment mpsyt version notes released February pafy version youtubedl backend youtubedl version Python version default Oct GCC Processor Machine type x Architecture bit ELF Platform

are no subtitles when opening videos with mpv through mpsyt Since mpv link does show subtitles the problem is likely in how mpsyt calls mpv but Im not sure exactly where A temporary workaround is to add a new command similar to the copy link to clipboard except that the link goes to opening mpv directly In the video list typing m number will do mpv link and subtitles will now work This isnt the ideal solution it imports os check for whether mpv is installed is not implemented no mplayer support but theres hasnt been any progress on adding subtitle support so this workaround might be useful for people at the meantime Can you build a bit exe please bit OS can run bit apps but bit OS cant run bit apps It doesnt make sense to build only bit instead of bit if you are gonna build for only one platform because bit apps can be run by both but bit apps can only be run by one of them Thanks Cant seem to find a way to perform a search excluding results from specific channels Change Request Improvement If youre describing a bug tell us what error you are experiencing If youre suggesting a changeimprovement tell us how it should work I expected to work similar to how it works on google
