I tried setting my editor to nvim and gojot opens the program alright but I dont see any of my entries just the default splash screen for NeoVim Heres an asciinema of what Im seeing gojot version f b T osx NVIM v vim works fine gojot looks for the pubinggpg file to initialize If the keys were created under gnupg which is now default in Ubuntu and other distro releases the pubringgpg does not exist and instead the new keybox file format is used Is there a workaround for this
