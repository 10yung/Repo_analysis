The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

Security Alerts page details A static webpage would be the best I am not familiar with React Also it is possible to host this offline Meaning no access to the internet As I can see this app relies on avataaarsio is the API there open source too The radio option for Avatar Style will no longer be needed if gets merged This PR removes the radio option as well as any references to Avatar Style that become unnecessary The linked PR removes Avatar Style and moves it into a BackdropStyle option that supports the addition of more backdrop styles as well as changing colors for the backdrop Depends on being merged and built Hello Just a reminder to not forget it Eg as copy pasted from shows Application Error Doing a fresh install of react and the repository The server comes up briefly and crashes
