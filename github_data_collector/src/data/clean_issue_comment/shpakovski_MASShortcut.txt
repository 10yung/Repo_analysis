Tried demo on macbook pro with touch bar using a shortcut like ShiftCmdb it works everywhere except the case where I actually would like this to work an OpenGL application that runs in a fullscreen and possibly takes over a keyboard System shortcuts like CmdTab work just fine but the demo stops working when the application is in foreground Were seeing an issue where a registered shortcut does not get called until after a popup buttons menu is dismissed This sounds like the same or very similar issue Any known issues or workarounds regarding shortcuts and menus When MASShortcutView starts the recording a shortcut it currently holding will be temporarily deactivated to allow the user to type the same shortcut Added method overloads to pass an action that will be called on shortcut key up Hi Im building an app that when is visible its a borderless window so even if he app is front most the active app is the one behind it it captures all the important keys and does something with them All works fine except when I enable the sandbox then only the arrows and backspace and enter is captured if I type letters and numbers they go to the active app Is this a limitation of sandboxed apps or im doing something wrong Proposed solution for Having a way to execute the event handler on key up as well Id love some feedback on how to resolve the little code duplication caused by this pull request and of course anything else that could improve the pull request See PR for the original hint We say that most shortcuts can be changed in the Keyboard Mouse panel in System Preferences but the correct path should be Keyboard as this pane has been split in two for a while on macOS Is there a way to make the make the action execute on both key down and key up Ive just spend an hour trying to hide the delete hint button because I dont want users to leave a hotkey empty Theyre prefilled and users have the option to override them I managed to delete the button by overriding the getShortcutRect method and setting showsDeleteButton to No like below but it would be nice to have an option to hide this without overriding the code ObjectiveC import DropShortcutViewh static const CGFloat MASHintButtonWidth interface DropShortcutView property nonatomic assign BOOL showsDeleteButton end implementation DropShortcutView instancetypeinitWithCoderNSCoder coder self super initWithCodercoder if self selfshowsDeleteButton NO return self voidgetShortcutRectCGRect shortcutRectRef hintRectCGRect hintRectRef CGFloat hintButtonWidth selfshortcutValue nil selfrecording MASHintButtonWidth CGRect shortcutRect hintRect CGRectDivideselfbounds hintRect shortcutRect hintButtonWidth CGRectMaxXEdge if shortcutRectRef shortcutRectRef shortcutRect if hintRectRef hintRectRef hintRect end If shortcut is alread exist by other apps it will work fail with any informationThe api RegisterEventHotKey always return ture Does anything I can do with it And it cause a problem that hotkey bind in fact it is a failure and can not bind same hotkey again so I want to change this blockproperty nonatomic copy void shortcutValueChangeMASShortcutView senderbut I can found where is his implementation Thank you for giving me the answer
