It seems that tmuxyank does not work for me in WSL with clipexe if I am trying to copy over lines It may be related to the number of characters Im copying so YMMV I thought there may be a limit in Windows with clipexe but I tested copying a file with around million lines with clipexe file it works even if it takes a minute or two to complete Is there any chance there is some sort of limit imposed when using clipexe A user may have wlcopy installed but not currently using Wayland This is a tweak of which is now outofdate When I change the global displaytime variable the amount of time that Line copied to clipboard is displayed is unchanged Is there a smooth way to change line copied to clipboard Hi I run tmux with tmuxyank via xforwarding on Windows dont know if this is related At least using xsel works fine echo foo xsel b results in having foo in the system clipboard accessible both from Linux and Windows However when copying from tmux by either using the mouse with mousemode on or by using the copy mode the selection is always put in the PRIMARY clipboard where I can paste it by using prefix key I tried using overridecopycommand or customcopycommand setting both to xsel b but with no effect Also I set yankselectionmouse to clipboard which also has no effect Am I doing something wrong Thanks Torsten Is it possible to have this on a POSIX compliant installation where it doesnt specifically use the BASH functions I am asking this as I am on a OpenBSD installation where the default shell is the KSH shell rather than BASH If this is too time consuming with not enough incentive please feel free to say so and close the issue else a small guideline for how to do it would be nice as well Thanks a bunch In Ubuntu neither xclip nor xsel is installed by default but xcutsel is available I think it makes sense to support that as well Hi I found ability to separate yank with keyboard and yank mouse actions are very handy because necessary to exit copymode to continue your actions are annoying Hi Im using tmux on up to date cygwin x on windows For some reason copymode y and prefixy is not working using clipexe default bindkey T copymode y sendkeys X copypipeandcancel clipexe It acts like its working but simply does not no error I can see Ive tried testing clip with echo testing clip and that works Ive also since added putclip and getclip via cygutilsextra and tried the override in config set g overridecopycommand putclip I check tmux bindings after reload and it still is trying to use clipexe for some reason so there might be issue with override or Im doing it wrong Finally I simply resorted to overriding the bindings with putclip which works runshell dotfilestmuxyankyanktmux set g overridecopycommand putclip bindkey T copymode y sendkeys X copypipeandcancel putclip bindkey T copymodevi y sendkeys X copypipeandcancel putclip Several people have reported problems with prefixy in tmux normal mode arooni ltWolfik
