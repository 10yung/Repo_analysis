 Just wondering what the deal is as there the number of issues is growing and there doesnt seem to be any response from devs Anyone know Lets say I have a task to run every ten minutes but job only need to run on am to pm of the day Is there way currently to do it As per this can result in an uncaught exception This should be handled better as uncaught exceptions that are known should be fixed In the server the VM environment scheduler gets stop after Not sure about exact days Our scheduler executes the below rule const k schedulescheduleJob async consolelogThis job runs every minute Does anybody have an idea about why my node scheduler process stops I checked the logs and there were no errors in logs I tried to run on an AWS lambda function As expected it did not run And that makes sense as the memory is cleared when the function returns Is there any other way to deploy this on an AWS lambda function thisjobexecutefireDate TypeError Cannot read property execute of undefined We are observing a scenario in a given duration such as mins we are supposed to schedule some jobs which are cpu intensive out of which considerable number of jobs are not getting triggered lets say jobs are missing How do we resolve this kind of Issue I use typescript to write code and found that tz is not found in RecurrenceRule in typesnodeschedule please update it Thanks Hi I had an issue the callback is fired before the job method ode to reproduce javascript const schedule requirenodeschedule const j new scheduleJob test function consolelogrun job method function consolelogrun on complete callback jschedule output node jobsjs run on complete callback run job method node v nodeschedule
