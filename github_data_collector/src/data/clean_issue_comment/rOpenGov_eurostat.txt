I left a comment on the commit also Perhaps first check if hasinternet and if not if httpproxy is defined Dear all I am exploring the eurostat package I noticed that the large majority of data are classified as dataset and table both accessible using your package toc geteurostattoc tabletoctype comext dataset folder table I dont understand the meaning of the comext type Can someone explain it to me Thanks I am interested in PRODCOM data title Sold production exports and imports by PRODCOM list NACE Rev annual data code DS type comext But when trying to get the data the following error is shown geteurostatDS Error in geteurostatrawid DS does not exist or is not readable Some datasets are not accessible via the eurostat interface You can try to search the data manually from the comext database at or bulk download facility at or annual Excel files It seems that those labelled with comext cannot be downloaded Is there a way to get access to these data using R Or do you know if these issue is planned to be fixed soon I think that if this limitation is known it should be clearly stated in the package documentation All the options listed in the error message are really neither userfriendly nor efficient Many thanks in advance I think that Eurostat changed its regional statistical products to NUTS extremely carelessly and my supposedly reproducible research codes do not work from last year when the same products with the same IDs were reported under the NUTS region boundary definitions It took me quiet some time that I understood the full depth of the program and I wrote some functions to correct it but they may be very error prone Nevertheless I think this problem is worth at least a vignette because it is extremely difficult to work with the regional data now The following main problems persists but there may be more in fact each regional statistical product is its own case Inconsistent use of NUTS NUTS labels In some cases this is mislabelling and can be relabelled In other cases boundaries changed and Eurostat reports under the wrong metadata mixed NUTS and NUTS data Even though the metadata says that this is NUTS data in fact in some years it is NUTS which is only partly compatible In this case whenever there is a correspondence table it can be fixed Inconsistent use of NUTS levels In other cases some of the data is available only on NUTS level and in other cases only at NUTS level I think this is the case with originally Eurobarometer data where Germany and the UK does not have a large enough sample to breakdown the results to NUTS level however Estonia Malta Luxembourg and Cyprus would have enough data to report at NUTS level This may be also mislabelled This is the most problematic case and I will turn to it later This is very confusing because the product name and the metadata calls this a NUTS product but if you try to join it with NUTS level population land are or GDP you loose Germany the UK Poland and in some cases other areas too In some cases the product name and description refers to NUTS level but the data contains all levels This can be fixed with filtering Occasionally when NUTS NUTS NUTS ie in the case of the aforementioned small countries with only NUTS level regions the labels are not repreated at all level and although the data is there with NUTS codes the NUTS or NUTS filter shows it missing And I think that sometimes this can be done with a fake imputation ie looking up the same statistics as a national statistcs product and imputing the regions in the cases when the small country is a region itself The mixed NUTS NUTS case is the most annoying although the choice of the data presentation makes sense and it would make even more sense if the small countries would be reported on a NUTS level Obviously one logical solution is to aggregate up everything to NUTS level but that is a very inefficient use of the data However if used together with other data the mixedlevel makes data joins very complicated I am not sure that all problems need a fix and I am not confident that I have found all problems I can imagine for example that the changes of COFOG or NACE or other changes are not well presented in the regional statistics which can cause seemingly or actually missing cases I could make a vignette candidate blogpost for example with examples to all problems and my solutions to it I think a least problematic solution would be to have the NUTS and NUTS code definitions in the eurostat package and automatically add this information to each geo variable regardless what Eurostat thinks about it At least in this case the user would be able to explicitly filter for NUTS NUTS or NUTS levels which is currently only possible if you directly filter the codes It is not hard because NUTS codes are always ncharcode NUTS is ncharcode but still this misleading geo labels make work extremely difficult Hi for offline work or for minimize touching web database during debugging scripts I think that possibility of caching filtered tables can be useful Filters also are cached as separate file and simply tested for equality I attache a suggestion Marek geteurostatflt functionfile

seems to be a new Eurostat package on CRAN and GitHub restatapi Search and Retrieve Data from Eurostat Database Eurostat is the statistical office of the European Union and provides high quality statistics for Europe Large set of the data is disseminated through the Eurostat database The tools are using the REST API with the Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange SDMX Web Services to search and download data from the Eurostat database using the SDMX standard The author seems to be mmatyi hi Id be interested in a list of similarities and differences between the packages I received a very strange message today about my iotables package which deals only with Eurostats inputoutput tables This requires the orphaned package eurostat which now fails its checks and has done for a few days It needs to be archived submit a version of iotables that does not require eurostat take over maintenance of eurostat incorporate the parts of eurostat you need into iotables withdraw iotables I have no idea what is this and I wrote a letter that it must be some misunderstanding but it seems that on some systems eurostat is failing to build Hi guys Thanks for the great package Ive been using it for the last couple of months I have developed a shiny application leveraging on data from eurostat pulled in R with the eurostat package Locally everything runs perfectly and with no errors for versions as well as of the eurostat package and version of R However when deployed on shinyappsio I got the following error on my logs Warning in openconnectioncon rb internal method cannot handle https redirection to Stack trace innermost first Warning Error in openconnection cannot open the connection And the application cannot be run The two functions I am using from the package are geteurostat and labeleurostat Any ideas why the problem within shinyappsio framework exists I have deployed an older version of the same application in March and back then everything worked with no errors so I guess it is related in some way to changes in Eurostat API since then which are not addressed by shinyappsio capabilities I would appreciate any ideas about possible workarounds Best Regards Velko Create a sticker for the package For preliminary template see instextrasstickerR Travis fails due to problems in tmap and countrycode installations Solving this will require finding out more about the required setups I am thinking on a way how to create bib files for the data that is downloaded by the eurostat package I have a code that downloads my most important data and updates my bib files that cite the data ie data accessed but it not a fully general solution I use the following template and add this to a collected bib file misceurostatsbsnadtr year title Annual detailed enterprise statistics for trade NACE Rev G sbsnadtr url language en year year urldate notdated publisher Eurostat author Eurostat keywords structural business indicators dataset statistics Eurostat I change the statistics product code sbsnadtr in the unique identifier use the current date for urldate replace the year with the year component of the download date I think that the title could be created by geteurostatdic but I have no idea how to create an url to the data I wonder if there is any metadata directory that may be used to create a permanent reference either to a reproducible download address or metadata description I think that in the spirit of truly reproducible research it would be reasonable not only to update Eurostat statistics in an RMarkdown document but also update the details of the bib file I had a misfortune that Eurostat removed completely an earlier data product and I think that a full documentation would be good Of course I just used a simple bib template from Zotero but maybe using some Datacite metadata best practices could help Id gladly create a new function if somebody can put me into direction with the url issue
