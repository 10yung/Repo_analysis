I want to show and hide modal using redux and as a result modal visibility depends on component props It has a very common use case For example I want to show modal by clicking on a flatlist Item and that modal exists in the containing list component When I call redux function the props get updated and the modal shows up but the transparent background doesnt get dimmed How can I overcome this problem Ask your Question is it currently possible to swipe to close modal only portion of children view within modal to close the modal At the moment I can swipe the whole component in modal What I would like to do is just make close handle so that users can only swipe by clicking on the handle only not the whole child Environment System OS macOS CPU x IntelR CoreTM i U CPU GHz Memory MB GB
