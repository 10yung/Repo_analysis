We have tried to minify the actual code it does but some part of code still not minified pls see the attached screenshots Screenshot Screenshot Let make variables inside functoin with minified For Example i give function logginglog consoleloglog to minified function loggingaconsoleloga or const loggingaconsoleloga Would it be nice to have a function just like minify except that it doesnt minify the data Example i can add multiple files into an instance in order to get an aggregated content out of all Thing is that i want to avoid the minification as the files i am adding are already minified Is there a functionality already I searched the code and i couldnt find a function to just merge all files together and return the content of all Fatal error Cannot declare class MatthiasMullie Minify CSS because the name is already in use in home wajtu af oopublichtmlwpcontentpluginsdpcpwaforwpclassesLibsminifysrcCSSphp on line Includes Tabrisrps add multiline flag to extractCalcs pattern calc expressions not followed by end of line or semicolon are matched with the rest of the content on that line until the first semicolon Sometimes this breaks the calc expression like in the example below Original CSS egallerymasonry egalleryitem percentheight positionabsolute widthcalc varcolumns varhgap varcolumns varcolumns leftcalc varcolumns varhgap varcolumns varcolumns varcolumn varhgap varcolumn topcalcvarpercentheight varrow varvgap Minified CSS egallerymasonry egalleryitempercentheight positionabsolutewidthcalc varcolumns varhgap varcolumns varcolumnsleftcalc varcolumns varhgap varcolumns varcolumns varcolumn varhgap varcolumntopcalcvarpercentheightvarrow varvgap The problem is that there are no spaces around the last heightvarrow Hi can it be A empty rule like selector has as result that a some classes later following background image will not correctly converted to base selector some other filled classes otherselector background urlfolderimagepng norepeat The part of this image in the generated css looks like background url px solid graymarginbottom px if the empty selector is commented all is fine PHP WinSCP Notepad Related Consider css root somevar px p marginleft calc px varsomevar px should not be modified to The addFile method will throw an exception if it fails to read a file Resolves When adding several files to be minified either by the constructor or using the add method the function assumes that the argument is a plain cssjs code if it fails to load a file This results in broken code since the file path is added to the minified code This is especially common when working with several dynamic jscss files When it happens no error occurs and no exception is thrown It fails silently and without warning the developer I propose a new method addFile that expects only file names in its arguments and fail if a file is unreadable
