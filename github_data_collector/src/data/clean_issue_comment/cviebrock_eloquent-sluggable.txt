configuration files are not serializable In configphp line Call to undefined method Closuresetstate Laravel config cache is not supporting closures Do you have any ideas to fix this problem This allows to specify a custom field separator between sources defined in models sluggable method The main use case is to generate slugs for nested models such as folders or categories but can be used for anything having more than one source field Nothing changes compared to before except when you define multiple sources public function sluggable return slug source parentslug name fieldseparator Now parentslug and name will be separated by a customisable character by default Generated slug could look like that blogdevelopmentwebphpmycoolpost The fieldseparator can be customised in the configsluggablephp file or directly in the model as shown above I have model in package which use Sluggable StarterKit Core Models Categoryphp php php namespace StarterKit Core Models use Illuminate

package you created Here is my issue I would like to deactivate the auto lowercase functions when a slug is generated To create the slugs your package relies on cocurslugify correct They have an option to deactivate the lowercase function eg php slugify new Slugify lowercase false slugifyslugifyHello World HelloWorld How can i set this function in your customizeSlugEngine function php public function customizeSlugEngineSlugify engine attribute engine return engine Thank you
