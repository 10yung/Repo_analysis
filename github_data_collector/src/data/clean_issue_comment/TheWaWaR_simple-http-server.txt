simplehttpserver p and then run curl localhost ff and the thread panics Backtrace says the issue is on line of mainrs After several times of LAN Gigabit network test download G single file the download speed is never reached the limit the speed is about MB s but I use the go language version of the HTTP server the speed can reach the hardware limit the speed is about MB s and the speed is very stable For example this HTTP SERVER Is it a question of programming language efficiency Is there room for improvement Because the go language program is too large I dont want to use it Could be done by using Simple instructions are missing how to use the app with a proxy server like nginx or apache and how to turn it into a selfstarting systemdservice I would be nice to have a githubgitlab like feature to automatically render READMEmd or other markdown files It would be nice to create folder within the browser Hi this simple http server is a real fantasy one However I think if there is a simple file name filter would make it even better For instance sometimes there are lots of log files in a folder and a filter option like filterfalselog is an easy way to ignore them and serving a cleaner directory While experimenting with WebAssembly I found that at least in Firefox WebAssemblyinstantiateStreaming requires wasmresources to be delivered as applicationwasm Otherwise you end up with TypeError Response has unsupported MIME type Since applicationwasm doesnt seem to be official yet I cannot expect simplehttpserver to include this binding It would be helpful to be able to add bindings between file extensions and mime types via command line
