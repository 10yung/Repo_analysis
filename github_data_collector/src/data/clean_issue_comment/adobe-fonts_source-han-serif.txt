Since Windows Insider build Windows contains a new UI to view and manage fonts After some test I found that the new UI uses the meta table to identify the design language and supported language of a particular font family SHS could add them to provide better identification information The suggestions are also applicable in SHSans Brackets are good to be positioned at center In Traditional Chinese typesetting all symbols are usually considered as a fullwidth character Not only but also brackets Note In Japanese or Simplified Chinese brackets are considered as a halfwidth character with a halfwidth space Most of Traditional Chinese text is Betagumi Japanese style brackets looks have too large space And its not beautiful Proportional width of symbols looks strange Since the symbols are positioned at center they looks too crowded when proportional width is ON width is not ideal I suggest that remove palt information of the symbols But keep hwid information for advanced users Quotation or Apostrophe Character U is used as a quotation mark and a apostrophe The width of this character is a difficult historical problem However in Traditional Chinese text quotation marks are usually be In most cases U is used as a apostrophe And very few as a quotation mark In Simplified Chinese the story is different So I suggest that U and U is better to be designed in a proportional width like Japanese or Korean ones Tone marks of Bopomofo The second third fourth tone mark is too small They should be the same size of Bopomofos And the direction of second tone mark is wrong Correct Leftdown to rightup This issue is meant for tracking and submitting suggestions for characterglyph additions meaning characters that are within the scope of coverage that are not yet supported or that a supported character lacks an appropriate glyph for a supported language or region Special Note If a character falls outside of a supported standard meaning GB for China Big Five for Taiwan JIS X X and X for Japan or KS X or X for Korea please refrain from making a suggestion at this time We need to make sure that support for these standards is adequate before we start to expand the

and after This issue is meant for tracking and submitting suggestions for mapping changes meaning that a character might be better mapped to a different but existing glyph Note that mapping changes especially for ideographs will trigger changes to GSUB features such as the languagespecific lookups of the locl GSUB feature Because tools are used to build the languagespecific lookups of the locl
