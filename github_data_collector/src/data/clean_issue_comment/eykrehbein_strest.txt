Describe the bug I try the code in the section Sending files and form data but it fail with Error Unable to call file which is undefined or falsey To Reproduce Copy the sample code in Sending files and form data to a file sendfilesyml Create a dummy file and update the respective path in sendfilesyml echo test content testtxt Execute Strest strest sendfilesyml Return Strest Found test files Strest Schema validation of files passed Testing postwithfile failed s Validation Failed to process postwithfile request line using nunjucks Template render error unknown path Line Column Error Unable to call file which is undefined or falsey Response null Strest Failed before finishing all requests Additional context Strest installation npm i g strestcli node version v The Json output generated do not have status on Test Thanks for this awesome tool When performing a test it is always nice to have a place where the test results are stored It would be nice have a section in json where status of test as is PASS FAIL SKIPPED along with reason is maintained yml version requests getDummyData request url method GET validate jsonpath status expect jsonpath contentdataemail expect janetweaverreqres

janetweaverreqresin firstname Janet lastname Weaver avatar Solution Id like The above test is actually a failed test when run from the console we can see that it has thrown a red text as below shell Testing getDummyData failed s Validation The JSON response value should have been janetweaverreqres but instead it was janetweaverreqresin But in the future when we go back and take a look at the json it does not provide an insight on if its a success failed test case Example Output Showcasing only the desired section which can be appended to the existing json Test result for each test json content data id email janetweaverreqresin firstname Janet lastname Weaver avatar result status failed reason The JSON response value should have been janetweaverreqres but instead it was janetweaverreqresin Test summary at the end of a suite below data is fictional json summary total pass fail skipped time s For some requests its useful to validate that a value was not returned eg when creating a user and ensuring the response doesnt have the password At the moment prevents one from testing nonexistence of properties yml version requests createuser request url examplecomuser method POST mimeType applicationjson text email testexamplecom password password validate jsonpath contentemail expect testexamplecom jsonpath contentpassword expect undefined Describe the solution youd like Adding undefined as a type or value to validate against Describe alternatives youve considered Adding null to responses is a workaround but isnt ideal Itd be great to be able to consume the results of tests as Postmans Newman CLI tool allows Jest allows for custom test runners to be configured one doesnt need to use Jests methods to run tests but one can still benefit from Jests other features eg there is a Mocha runner for Jest as well as an ESLint runner By allowing for a custom Jest runner to consume results of tests we get the following from Jest watching files for changes to run tests running specific tests via Jests CLI running projects simultaneously eg API tests unit tests integration tests running specific tests using typeahead running specific projects using jestwatchselectprojects Describe the solution youd like A module that passes the results of a test run to a callback Example javascript myapiendpoint testjs const strest requirestrest const strestConfig references to yaml files and configs for this test strestrunstrestConfig err result handle err result of test run Additional context For reference on what can be done with Jest Jest Mocha runner Gif of jestrunnermocha Watch typeahead Gif of jestwatchtypeahead Watch select projects Gif of jestwatchselectprojects Running all of the requests synchronously takes a lot of time Running requests asynchronously would be much faster I know theres a lot to consider here with what is already in place especially when considering dependent variables from other requests I was thinking of these changes to the yaml to accomplish this yml version might require version for this async true requests healthCheck request url method GET longRunningRequest request url method GET login will return authenticated true authNeeded requires list of all dependent requests that need to run first eg for variables to be available login request headers name Authorization value Bearer logincontentauthenticated Its possible to use the status code headers and status text from previous calls anotherAuthNeeded requires list of all dependent requests that need to run first eg for variables to be available login request headers name Authorization value Bearer logincontentauthenticated Its possible to use the status code headers and status text from previous calls In this scenario healthCheck longRunningRequest and login all runresolve asynchronously Once login returns successfully authNeeded and anotherAuthNeeded both run asynchronously If there are more dependent requests their names are added to the requires list and are only ran after the dependencies have returned successfully listr seems like it would come in handy to accomplish this I installed via npm i D strestcli and installed the vscode plugin When I run it I with kbdctrlaltrkbd I get the error binsh strest not found The docs say to install globally presumably then it would work Many people dont install anything globally ever other than npm itself Please tell me to how I can make this work If its not currently possible please add the ability to install locally Or perhaps add a config file so we can specify where to find the executable or that it should run using npx Current behavior is not to print output if calls fails Strest Found test files Strest Schema validation of files passed Strest Failed before finishing all requests Describe the solution youd like Print the output whenever rest calls fails Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Id like to be able to see the contents of a set variable eg In relation to Im pulling the token from the previous request and using it in the next as a header value headers name xdeviceauth value logincontentResulttoken dump safe This should be working but no Being able to view the processed variable will help with debugging Describe the solution youd like When using the strest p switch can it output the request headers and body not just the response Not sure if Im missing something here I am trying to dynamically produce the current day in a test Faker will not allow me to format for the required post data that I need I know of momentjs and dayjs that will produce this and allow me to format the data I have not been able to successfully import either into my test and was wondering if import was possible if there was something else already built in or if this is something that could possibly added as feature Possible implementation version requests call request url method GET call request url method POST postData mimeType applicationjson text foo repeatuntil until jsonpath call content expect EnvSTRESTGMTDATE elsegoto call when false goto call when true call request url method POST postData mimeType applicationjson text foo
