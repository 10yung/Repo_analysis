I am still using jupyter under python I have adapted the code briefly at There seems to be a race condition which can cause stdoutstderr output to be missed I noticed this when a simple printfHello world n program would sometimes fail to print It happens when the final call to pwritecontents happens in doexecute At this time the threads RealTimeSubprocessstdoutthread and RealTimeSubprocessstderrthread may not have finished reading all the output To fix this we call join on both threads before the final pwritecontents Hi I am able to run the docker container but am unable to attach a local folder so I can save my work When I run the container it says the user is joyvan so I am using the following command to attach a local folder to the container docker run p it user root v pathToMyFolderhomejoyvanwork brendanriusjupyterckernel This command format works for all my other containers to make pathToMyFolder available in the container so I am wondering if the homejoyvan is wrong It appears that this kernel uses GCC but the current version is Are there any plans to update this Hi Does this kernel support technical corrections and clarifications to defects in C Thanks Paul Somehow the syntax highlighting of some cells is lost sometimes when executing the previous cell This is similar to Executing IPythonnotebookgetselectedcellcodemirrorgetOptionmode in the JS console then yields c while it gives textxcsrc in correctly displayed cells optcondabininstallckernel DeprecationWarning replace is ignored Installing a kernelspec always replaces an existing installation KernelSpecManagerinstallkernelspectd c useruser replaceTrue prefixprefix Coding in CKernel commands can be executed except input command If the coding line contains scanf or getchar promgrm will skip the command without input waiting how can solve this problem
