The RStudio Rproj defaults reinforce bad workspace developing habits which have been discussed in the community quite a lot img width altScreen Shot at AM src Can you please change the defaults to the following img width altScreen Shot at AM src It would make more sense to have a temp yaml for config launched at runtime and completed with the opts of withgolemoptions so that the usage of both is consistent Good morning Im having trouble incorporating an auth authentication package in Golem It is possible Right now rsconnect is a hard dependency while it should be a Suggests and check if installed when using the RStudio deploy scripts We should refactor this part r usethisusemitlicense name Golem User You can set another license here usethisusereadmermd open FALSE usethisusecodeofconduct usethisuselifecyclebadge Experimental usethisusenewsmd open FALSE usethisusegit Into one function Creates the dockerfile the targz deployment yaml service yaml I created a golem app and tested the deployment on shinyappio where it worked smoothly Then I created a docker file and tried to deploy it but for some reason it told me runapp wasnt an exported function This was fixed by replacing in the docker file mypkgrunapp by mypkgrunapp adding third This is puzzling to me as the export line is definitely there I didnt tweak the boilerplate and again this works locally and on shinyappsio Then I ran into issues because my datasets were not recognized this could be solved by replacing the last line of the docker file by CMD R e datadataset package mypkgdatadataset package mypkgoptionsshinyport shinyhost mypkgrunapp This kind of namespace issues happened to me in the past when passing in my package expressions to functions from other packages that would use NSE Finally a simple solution could solve all at once just add a library call to attach my package CMD R e librarymypkgrunapp golemadddockerfile adds a line of code to Rbuildignore but it uses backslashes which makes devtoolsbuild crash In my case the line is C R packages kpiFRADESCRIPTION and devtoolsbuild s error is devtoolsbuild checking for file C R packages kpiFRADESCRIPTION ms preparing kpiFRA ms checking DESCRIPTION metainformation Warning in greple files perl TRUE ignorecase TRUE PCRE pattern compilation error k is not followed by a braced anglebracketed or quoted name at kpiFRADockerfile Error in greple files perl TRUE ignorecase TRUE invalid regular expression C R packages kpiFRADockerfile Execution halted Error in function command NULL args character erroronstatus TRUE System command error It might be devtoolsbuild s fault but this is solved by changing the backward slashes to forward slashes so maybe itd be more robust for you to write forward slashes by default First thanks a lot for this package I think it boosts my learning curve significantly and gives me confidence that Im doing things right or not too wrong rsconnectdeployApp is not happy because I have big files it tells me Error in bundleFilesappDir The directory C R packages kpiFRA cannot be deployed because it is too large the maximum size is bytes Remove some files or adjust the rsconnectmaxbundlesize option The same as what the rstudio blue icon tells me I indeed have big files several gigabytes that constitute my raw input and that are referenced in Rbuildignore and gitignore would it be acceptablefeasible to make deployApp ignore those files too This could be done by providing booleans arguments not to deploy what matches gitignore or Rbuildignore or by providing a custom specification or by having a dedicated configuration file The alternative is that I move those to a new folder and in the future that I do my data prep in a different project which I did but I think the idea of working in a single project is compelling and that spoils it a bit Moreover the presence of usethisusedataraw in your boilerplate seems to indicate that youre not opposed to the idea of doing the data prep in the same project What do you think Dockerfile fails at Step RUN Rscript e remotesinstallgithubthinkropengolem a f a e c b dc b ec Running in dde cdbcd Downloading GitHub repo thinkropengolem a f a e c b dc b ec Error in vapplyremote functionx remoteshax character values must be length but FUNX result is length Calls Anonymous devpackagedeps combinedeps nrow packagedeps vapply Execution halted The command binsh c Rscript e remotesinstallgithubthinkropengolem a f a e c b dc b ec returned a nonzero code
