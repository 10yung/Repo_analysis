Hello I am new to DiagrammeR so sorry if the question is trivial But is it possible to use substitution to have a colour outside of the default palette Here is my code mycol DB mygraph grViz digraph

error Error in parsetext splitreferences i text unexpected Thank you The exportgraph function calls functions from rsvg package but rsvg package is not in Imports and I didnt have it installed so the function threw an error Also when I initially used exportgraph with filetype PNG it threw the following error generated from within your function Error exportgraph REASONS Cannot currently use this function to produce a PNG file please install the DiagrammeRsvg package and retry This error was not very helpful because installing DiagrammeRsvg did not fix the problem Only when I ran exportgraph file filetype PDF was the following error thrown Error in loadNamespacename there is no package called rsvg Only then did I realize that rsvg was a dependency and after installing and loading rsvg package the exportgraph function worked with both file types Hi everyone Im working with DiagrammeR to create a PDF document that embed a processing pipeline Unfortunately the generated output has big margins and isnt useful for the document integration I could crop manually figure but I would like to know if theres any way to have a full automatic document generation The output document is here pipeline pdf The generation code is here r pipeline echoFALSE figwidth figheight mermaid graph LR ALorem B Ipsum C Dolor DSit EAmet F lorem Gipsum H dolor I sit Jamet K lorem A B K B A H A C C E B D E

anyone have an idea about it Thank you in advance Example Code mermaid sequenceDiagram B A C A B D DiagrammeR mermaidjs Example Code r mermaid sequenceDiagram participant A A B C DiagrammeR mermaidjs Ive been trying to use DiagrammeR to put some graphs into a shiny app While the Graphviz renderers work just using native DiagrammeR syntax merely produces raw digraph output So the following code

not supported Why the limitation on a preselected list of attributes Wouldnt it be possible to simply add all unknown attributes anyway Minimal example r setseed headRandomseed DiagrammeRcreategraph DiagrammeR Graph no nodes headRandomseed changed This is because creategraph calls sample to create a unique ID This is unexpected from the users perspective and I dont think its reasonable to change the RNG state for this It is expected if we are creating a random graph and still it should be documented but not in any other case This may happen in other places too but I didnt check thoroughly

behaviorchange which has DiagrammeR as a dependency while tinkering ive found that when behaviorchangecalls createnodedf the R process hangs and never returns so i was like this is a curious riddle so i checked out DiagrammeR with git added some print statements to createnodedf so i could figure out what was going on and it just worked no hanging problem at all so then i thought oh maybe changes since the CRAN release have fixed this issue so then i went fossicking through the git history so i could roll back to the current release and then i could do some bisecting to find when the issue was fixed and what it could possibly be however i found that whats in this repo is version and the version on CRAN is so im not quite sure what in this repo corresponds to the release on CRAN so i guess i have two questions do you know any circumstances that lead to a hang of the createnodedf function can you point me to a commit in this repo which corresponds to the on CRAN i can go off the release date but i just wanted to touch base before working any further on this with thanks Is there a way to add a legend that describes the nodes in a flow chart
