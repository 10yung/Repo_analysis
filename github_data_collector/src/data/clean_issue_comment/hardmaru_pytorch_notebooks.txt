Hi I tried some cases and have a question hope you can help solve some I tried OpenAIES for Lnet on MNIST whose weights space is and it took mins epochs to get accuracy and in the end the highest accuracy is I tried OpenAIES for Lnet on CIFAR whose weights space is and it took mins epochs to get accuracy and in the end the highest accuracy is I tried OpenAIES for Resnet on MNIST whose weights space is and it took quite a long time but the accuracy kept around that is no improvement I tried OpenAIES for Resnet on CIFAR whose weights space is and it took quite a long time but the accuracy kept around that is no improvement I guess there are some reasons that the OpenAIES did not work for Resnet the weights space is huge and my popsize is too small I tried set the popsize to the result is still pool like above the weights space is huge and the learningrate and muteratethat is the sigma should be carefully set based upon a lot of experiences and I tried my best to adjust them still not work Can u help me hope can get some suggestions from u Waiting on line How long have CMAES cost on training I wanna use tensorflow to test the CMAES on MNIST as the same networks as yours the training time become slower as the iteration increase And the lossval crossentropy and accuracy have no obvious change after iterationit have cost about hours I use the same hyperparameter as your settingpopulation sigma Hi Thank you for sharing codes Do you have some explanations that MDN with tanh outperforms MDN with ReLU in this sinusoidal dataset
