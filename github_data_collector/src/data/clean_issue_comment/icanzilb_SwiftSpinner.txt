I find the circles are huge for my screen and I want to change the sizes of circles but I didnt succeed I tried to change frameSize value in frameworkSwiftSpinner h w to h w but it didnt work as I expected Actually nothing changed sizes were still same By the way I really like the SwiftSpinner in my opinion its a cool framework to use IMG Really weird issue where if Im coming in and out of a view controller via a navigationControllerpopToRootController and a navigationControllerpushViewController the nd time the SwiftSpinnerhide doesnt hide the view Id have to call it twice SwiftSpinnerhide SwiftSpinnerhide then if I do the pushpop thing again it still has an issue and I would have to call it times Its as if each time the view controller popspushes its adding another SwiftSpinnershow for whatever reason my code looks like this let bgContext NSManagedObjectContextconcurrencyType mainQueueConcurrencyType func doCoreDataprogress escaping Double bgContextperform for i in let cent Double DoubleiDouble do some coredata work adding and updating progresscent func orgnizeThings doCoreData cent in DispatchQueuemainasync let perCent cent SwiftSpinnershowprogress cent title loading perCent calling the orgnizeThings function will get the core data work done but I would like to to show the user how far the function is done in this setup the SwiftSpinner view is frozen The subtitle label is not working when called as well as where in the dependency do you blur the background and how to change that thanks Hey everyone I recently got a beautiful newborn at home and it feels itll be a bit difficult to add some new and fresh features to SwiftSpinner I feel like SwiftSpinner is due for a new major version that will unify all the changes merged through the years and present the developers with a consistent and fresh API also maybe some visual changes there are tons of ideas in the issues section If anyone feels like tackling this let me know best Marin Hi i really love swiftyspinner and use it alot there is very little it cannot do that i need But i would like it to support longer texts right now the text goes beyond the bounds of the animation circle it would be nice if it would expand to hold all the text or if it was possible to remove the circles so that it was possible to use the spinner as to give information on screen Hello everybody i get an error i used cocoapods for integrate sprinner but only works in my first view for others doesnt do anything like be in freeze i implement the code in AppDelegate with a observer and property in SwiftSpiner i change a few features please help me and i add a snippet of my code AppDelegate swift func showWaitScreen DispatchQueuemainasyncexecute selfwindowcurrentViewControllerviewendEditingtrue UIApplicationsharedisNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible true SwiftSpinnersharedInstancetitleLabelfont FONTTEXTITLEDiezyocho if nil SesionCBHandlersharedInstancecurrentSpinner SwiftSpinnersharedInstanceremoveFromSuperview SesionCBHandlersharedInstancecurrentSpinner SwiftSpinnershowT J ZW pZW kbyBkYXRvcy uLgbase Decoded animated trueObteniendo datos func hideWaitScreen DispatchQueuemainasyncexecute if nil SesionCBHandlersharedInstancecurrentSpinner SwiftSpinnerhide SwiftSpinnersharedInstanceremoveFromSuperview SesionCBHandlersharedInstancecurrentSpinner nil UIApplicationsharedisNetworkActivityIndicatorVisible false SwiftSpinner swift UIViewanimatewithDuration delay options curveEaseOut animations spinnerblurViewcontentViewalpha spinnerblurVieweffect nil spinnerblurVieweffect nil spinnerblurViewcontentViewalpha completion in spinnerblurViewcontentViewalpha spinnerremoveFromSuperview spinnertitleLabeltext nil spinnerblurViewcontentViewalpha spinnerremoveFromSuperview spinnertitleLabelfont spinnerdefaultTitleFont spinnertitleLabeltext nil completion spinneranimating false UIViewanimatewithDuration delay options curveEaseOut animations spinnerblurViewcontentViewalpha spinnerblurVieweffect spinnerblurEffect spinnerblurViewcontentViewalpha spinnerblurVieweffect UIBlurEffectinitstyle UIBlurEffectStyledark completion nil if osiOS Orientation change observer NotificationCenterdefaultaddObserver spinner selector selectorSwiftSpinnerupdateFrame name NSNotificationNameUIApplicationDidChangeStatusBarOrientation object nil endif spinnertitle title spinneranimating animated return spinner Im having problems when I do SwiftSpinnerhide since this hides me all spinner and I just want to hide one of them is there any solution for it Thank you
