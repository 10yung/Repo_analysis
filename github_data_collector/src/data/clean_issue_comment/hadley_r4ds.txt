focusses focuses In Section The first argument of facetwrap should be a formula which you create with followed by a variable name here formula is the name of a data structure in R not a synonym for equation The variable that you pass to facetwrap should be discrete However the ggplot documentation for facetwrap states that the formula interface is there for compatibility in favour of vars For compatibility with the classic interface can also be a formula or character vector Use either a one sided formula a b or a character vector ca b In Problems youre saying that readr misjudged columns According to my R it first judged x column as coldouble and y column as collogical But your logic seems like readr judged x column as colinteger and y column as colcharacter I understood what you tried to explain but maybe readr increased its performance as time passed The link in the last line of Chap Both cheatsheets are also available at yields a error I guess it moved to In transformRmd Chapter Data Transformation under Counts we removed narm TRUE when computing mean because all NAs for arrdelay were already removed when creating notcancelled dataset Currently the book says The best way to get a comprehensive overview is the ggplot cheatsheet which you can find at The link seems broken to me I think it has moved to which contains a link to the ggplot cheatsheet Proposed fix related to this issue A more comprehensive fix should perhaps discuss why m at most m does not work or warn the reader that it does not Or perhaps the error message when using m is clear enough and the inclusion of m in the book is intentional in the sense that it discusses a valid regex albeit one that does not work with stingr and is judiciously not included in the examples of stingr applications The second commit corrects some small typos in the Iteration chapter As I was writing lecture notes based on the strings chapter I stumbled upon the exact same issue as described in this Reddit thread On my end it looked like this The intention was to show that there would be no match in this case Instead I get an error strviewallMisery Misery Misery that s what Lord and Miller have chosen Misery Error in strilocateallregexstring pattern omitnomatch TRUE Error in minmax interval UREGEXBADINTERVAL One of the answerers on Reddit explains stringr uses ICU regular expressions which apparently do not have the m notation use the explicit nm Since the m method is presented as a viable option in the latest version of the book and I did not see an open issue related to this I thought Id mention it here Perhaps the error message when using m is clear enough and the inclusion of m in the book is intentional in the sense that it discusses a valid regex albeit one that does not work with stingr and is judiciously not included in the examples of stingr applications
