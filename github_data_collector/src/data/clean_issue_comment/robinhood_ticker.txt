If TickerViewsetText is called with animatefalse and an existing animation is still in progress the previous animation should be cancelled before setting the new text Thanks for this amazing library This is potentially a feature request for adding two new scrolling direction modes AUTOASC and AUTODESC They are all based on if the newer text is greater or less than the current one For AUTOASC mode ideally it would work like this if the original text is number of and the new one is since the value of new text is greater than the old text it would scrolling down Similarly for AUTODESC mode it would scroll up Would this feature be nice to have or we already have something similar I mainly use the setTypeface method as was pointed out in a previous closed issue With downloadable fonts getting great support it would be great if we can add a font attribute to TickerView Something like androidfontFamilyfontlato It would probably mean that there would be a dependency on the support library but that could be fine since almost all developers use the support library anyway Would be happy to take a stab at it screenshot ticker example Attached is a problematic screen with random squares on Samsung Galaxy S This problem only happens on Samsung devices TextViews are often baselinealigned to other views TickerView should also support layoutalignBaseline and other similar layout attributes Hi When I use shadow the characters are clipped in width pre lollipop how I fix this Thanks for library can add a shape or image background for each character Can you add RTL language support
