Dear HaishinKit Team I want to use your framework to convert the iPhone camera output in real time to ts video files and save it in a local directory but it only works with AVCaptureSessionPresetmedium Is there any way to change the preset to k and have the correct ts files without losing frames when switching from one segment of a video file to another Thanks in advance Describe the bug Im running the example iOS app in iOS and streaming with Mux tried it with Wowza as well and am having issues with the audio being incredibly choppy Using different bitrates is not fixing the issue This was not an issue in iOS To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Launch HaishinKit example on device running iOS Start stream Listen to stream playback it is choppy Expected behavior Clearsmooth audio Desktop please complete the following information OS MacOS XCode Smartphone please complete the following information Device iPhone X OS iOS Additional context This problem was not occurring in iOS Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe Hi I am moving my app SeasonCast from a custom modified version of LFLiveKit to HashinKitswift due to it not being updated in years and its memory leak issues I would like to have support for streaming while the app is in background mode I know in the past this was not possible due to VideoToolBox but in recent versions of iOS it works I got VideoToolBox library to work in the background of LFLiveKit by enabling audio in the background and a minor modification to its equivalence of the H Encoderswift class by removing its background observer I think it would be possible to do the same thing for this library since its laid out in a similar matter I have attempted to modify the code but it seems that the problem preventing it from working in background mode is before H Encoderswift and I cant seem to find the reason why Describe the solution youd like I would like the framework to behave in the same exact manner when background mode audio is not enabled When the app has background mode audio enabled It should show the microphone recording icon when in background mode because the microphone would still be active and if the user is publishing the microphone should still be streaming but the camera should be muted last frame Replay kit broadcast extension always gives width height regardless of orientation Using the following let width CVPixelBufferGetWidthimageBuffer let height CVPixelBufferGetHeightimageBuffer broadcasterstreamvideoSettings width width height height profileLevel kVTProfileLevelH BaselineAutoLevel And then changing the orientation of the device to landscape causes the stream to hang there are no messages and from device side looks like all is ok I run HLS sample on macos i get error SocketStream write error x There is a solution any Hello Describe the bug When the stream is ON with local recording if the application pass in background the recording is broke without any error and the stream will never pass in any DefaultAVRecorderDelegate handler To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Start the steam Go in background for secondes Go back to the app See the local recording which isnt present Expected behavior Have an error callback or maintain the local recording Thanks for your help Describe the bug When I run example on macOS with HLS Stream not display with version To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Start macOS demo Select HLS Start publishing Open url on safarivlc Expected behavior Display stream from camera Screenshots Desktop please complete the following information OS macOS Browser safari Version Describe the bug Since version I am experiencing issues with the video produced by the framework when playing the video back with ffplay ffmpeg Although the video still appears to play fine closes inspection reveals Invalid timestamp warnings To Reproduce Stream to a RTMP or SRT server where you have access to the produced video files Either play the video via ffplay ffplay pathtomyvideoflv or convert to a ts stream with ffmpeg ffmpeg i pathtomyvideoflv codec copy outts Either one of the process should produce warnings along the lines of Invalid timestamps stream pts dts size see screenshot Expected behavior The video should be playable and or convertable without issues Screenshots img width altInvalid Timestamps src Desktop please complete the following information OS macOS ffplay version Smartphone please complete the following information Device iPhone iPhone OS iOS iOS Additional context I am experiencing similar behaviour when streaming via SRT Hello Describe the bug Crashlytics is reporting a crash on NetSocketswift line NetSocketdoOutputProcessmaxLength To Reproduce I cant
