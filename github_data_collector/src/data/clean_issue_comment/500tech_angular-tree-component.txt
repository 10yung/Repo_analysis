The recommended DragDropTouch polyfill for mobile browsers has the limitation of disabling scrolling over draggable elements on mobile devices which also prevents dragging to drop zones beyond the visible scrolling viewport The mobiledragdrop polyfill does not suffer from those limitations and offers additional configurable behavior However mobiledragdrop does not detect Angular Tree Component drop zones because at present the dragenter event listener added by TreeDropDirective does not call eventpreventDefault as required by mobiledragdrop This PR merely calls eventpreventDefault in TreeDropDirectiveonDragEnter to allow use of mobiledragdrop as well as DragDropTouch with Angular Tree Component Since Angular the Injectable decorator has allowed for an optional providedIn object parameter to specify the module in which services should be provided as the as the preferred alternative to the Providers array in the NgModule decorator This PR provides the TreeDraggedElement provider using the new providedIn syntax to improve bundle sizes by enabling treeshaking and allowing Angular Tree Component to bundled in lazyloaded modules without losing the ability to drag drop across TreeComponents in different modules that running TreeDraggedElement as a Service Singleton allows The removal of the TreeModuleforRoot method in this PR introduces a breaking change Hello Everyone I have a tree with nodes when i search something so when it fetching the search result and rerender the tree it takes alot time on rendering the tree To improve the user experience i put

to control the tabindex on tree checkboxes According accessibility guidelines referenced belowe checkboxes should have a negative tabindex so that they arent focused with tab and instead are navigated to with the up and down arrows Currently theres no way to set the tabindex attribute to the tree checkboxes without looping though all elements and adding the attribute through the elementRef It would be great if this was available through an option of the TreeNode Reference article Thanks PLEASE READ CAREFULLY Reproduce Please reproduce here if reporting a bug or requesting help Additional Info
