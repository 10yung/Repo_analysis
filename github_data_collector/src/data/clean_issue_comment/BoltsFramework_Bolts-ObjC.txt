My team uses this framework along with facebook SDK We are adding the support for mac through mac catalyst For this the underneath bolts also need to support mac But the latest doesnt work well with mac catalyst There are compilation issues We need the target BoltsiOSDynamic of the project to be working with mac option turned ON Hence please provide a build that works fine with mac catalyst This pull request replaces use of now deprecated UIWebView with WKWebView allowing BoltsObjC to be used in in Catalyst apps The changes are rather straightforward but I do not use this code at all so I just made it compile under Catalyst and not tested it at all After uploading the App to appstoreconnectwe receive this message ITMS Deprecated API Usage Apple will stop accepting submissions of apps that use UIWebView APIs See for more information I am integrating Bolts by CocoaPodsI wonder how i can delete the files that using UIWebView related API This is pull request was created automatically because we noticed your project was missing a Code of Conduct file Code of Conduct files facilitate respectful and constructive communities by establishing expected behaviors for project contributors This PR was crafted with love by Facebooks Open Source Team Updating to match XCode project settings recommandation and make it compliant with Swift Compiler Hi guys Im working on an old codebase and we have many warnings about exception is deprecated BFTask exception handling is deprecated and will be removed in a future It happens in cases like this try ILRLogin sharedManager activeWithServerserver LRSession session ILRLogin sharedManager getAuthSession session onSuccess id result onFailure NSError err catch NSException exception task setExceptionexception HERE or even in the caller where I check iftaskexception I googled a lot but I couldnt find advices about what to do instead Is there a replacement method Should I just ignore the exception in the catch block Can you please point me in the right direction here Thanks Alessandro var tasks BFTaskAnyObject let allTask BFTaskforCompletionOfAllTasks tasks does not work Originally posted by nishidanagisa in XCode shows the following warnings in a project that uses a pod that requires Bolts UsersgeorgProjekteAppsxxxPodsBoltsBoltsiOSBFAppLinkReturnToRefererControllerm Block implicitly retains self explicitly mention self to indicate this is intended behavior UsersgeorgProjekteAppsxxxPodsBoltsBoltsiOSBFAppLinkReturnToRefererControllerm Block implicitly retains self explicitly mention self to indicate this is intended behavior UsersgeorgProjekteAppsxxxPodsBoltsBoltsiOSBFAppLinkReturnToRefererControllerm Block implicitly retains self explicitly mention self to indicate this is intended behavior UsersgeorgProjekteAppsxxxPodsBoltsBoltsiOSBFAppLinkReturnToRefererControllerm Block implicitly retains self explicitly mention self to indicate this is intended behavior UsersgeorgProjekteAppsxxxPodsBoltsBoltsiOSBFAppLinkReturnToRefererControllerm Block implicitly retains self explicitly mention self to indicate this is intended behavior UsersgeorgProjekteAppsxxxPodsBoltsBoltsiOSBFAppLinkReturnToRefererControllerm Block implicitly retains self explicitly mention self to indicate this is intended behavior UsersgeorgProjekteAppsxxxPodsBoltsBoltsiOSBFAppLinkReturnToRefererControllerm Block implicitly retains self explicitly mention self to indicate this is intended behavior First off thank you guys for maintaining this amazing repo With the latest Xcode fixes Im trying to update podspec in my project with the latest changes The pod is not releasable with a commit only with a real published version The last release was Jan This pr fixes compiling facebookiossdk and facebookswiftsdk with latest xcode using carthage by implementing the fixes described in ps to be clear when building Bolts directly using Carthage there was no issues at all including compiling on latest beta it is just when compiling either facebookiossdk or facebookswiftsdk that the problem arises
