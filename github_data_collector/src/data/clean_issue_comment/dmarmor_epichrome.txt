Using Chrome on macOS Since using Set Chrome as default browser within Epichrome app will result in setting original Chrome app as default browser and thinking that is too much tricky to fix it what about setting nodefaultbrowsercheck in all Epichrome apps by default Next what about an option during creation script which permits creating Epichrome apps that start in incognito mode by default BTW really like your work Hey dmarmor having an odd issue with an older browser Id not fired up since before your last major updates I was using Proxy SwitchyOmega to pass the connection through another ISP and found that when I fired it up and upgraded it to the newest Epichrome release I now cannot go to any sites Furthermore resetting the settings hasnt helped Any thoughts about digging into and resetting proxyconnection settings that might have been modified by such an app I assume theres something somewhere b rked in this regard but Im not finding it I use GCalendar as an EpiCrome app and since my Catalina upgrade it stopped sending notifications which off cause is rather unhelpful Also only one EpiChrom app shows up in preferences for notifications After upgrading to Catalina Epichrome apps unfortunately no longer work for me The issues seem very similar to routing issues experienced with Mojave which were eventually fixed These are the two main issues Ive been experiencing An Epichrome app instance is often erroneously identified as the default browser instead of Chrome Its not always the same one Quitting the Epichrome app usually temporary fixes this ie Links route to the correct default Chrome while the problem Epichrome app is not running The Stop further handling option has occasionally done what its supposed to but usually doesnt Links triggered from within an Epichrome app open in that app instead of routing to open in the correct default Chrome browser If the default browser is set to something else like Safari it seems to be less of an issue but I havent tested this extensively Anyone else experiencing these issues with Catalina Any suggested fixes The problems seem very similar to what happened with Mojave so Im hoping theres a fix for this Ive tried deleting and recreating Epichrome apps with no success After upgrading to Catalina my vanilla Chrome instance wont allow Google Hangouts to screen share unless I add Chrome to the System PreferencesSecurity PrivacyPrivacy list to permit Screen Recording I was able to add an Epichrome instance of Chome but Chrome itself does not get added to the list in System Preferences There is no manual way to add apps to the list So I cannot figure out a way to let Google Hangouts in Chrome screen share In the following image the IGS app is an epichrome instance Im trying to make an Epichrome app of Google Voice on Mojave However on Mojave Chrome has to request permission for microphone access Epichrome apps neither inherit this permission nor do they trigger the request for their own bundleid Epichrome apps used to respond to the Google Chrome AppleScript interface which I used extensively to automate and integrate them Recently I switched laptops and in the process recreated a few of them Now Ive noticed that they no longer seems to respond to the Chrome AppleScript API For example I have an Epichrome app for OpsGenie osascript e tell application Google Chrome to URL of active tab of window osascript e tell application OpsGenie to URL of active tab of window syntax error A property can t go after this identifier Ive also tried specifying the ChromeEngine app inside the application bundle but I get the same osascript e tell application ApplicationsOpsGenieappContentsResourcesChromeEngineOpsGenieapp to URL of active tab of window syntax error A property can t go after this identifier Is it still possible to make this work I found this feature extremely useful The apps I create with Epichrome have been intermittently either losing the custom icon or losing the app name So a few minutes ago I noticed my tulaneapp no longer showed the Tulane logo on the Mac app switcher and instead showed the Chrome icon Then I quit and relaunched tulaneapp and now the Tulane logo is back on the Mac app switcher but the app name in the menubar has reverted to Chrome not Tulane Im not aware of doing anything specific to update Epichrome or Chrome or my tulaneapp so I have no idea whats causing this Thoughts I just upgraded to the latest public beta of Mac OS Mojave which is being released in just a few days and Ive found that it has broken Epichrome I tried to characterize and research as much as possible because I love the app so much and I want to help out Issue Epichrome browser apps now are preventing google chrome the main app from being the default browser Result All browser events are now sent to a random epichrome app Workaround Remove all epichrome apps from my computer Or manually recreate epichrome apps which seems to resolve the issue See details below Details When you create an Epichrome browser you are prompted if you want the new app to be registered as a browser I always choose no on this option Since Ive updated to Mojave my epichrome apps are preventing google chrome the original app being the default browser The end result of this is that when links are opened in apps they are directed to one of my epichrome browsers as the default app The challenge is that I cannot go to system preferences general and change the default browser to google chrome its not an option in that list Just the random epichrome browser To fix this behavior I had to delete all my epichrome apps and once they were all gone then google chrome reappeared as my default browser Note After removing all my epichrome apps the issue was resolved and I saw google chrome as a default browser in my system preferences general tab but as soon as I added one back google chrome disappeared and the epichrome app became the default overridding google chrome Note Ive tried and beta of google chrome with the same behavior Note I just tried recreating one of my epichrome apps and it did not cause the issue It seems like upgraded apps are causing the problem I can recreate all my apps but it would be great if someone figured out how to resolve this issue so we dont all have to recreate our apps Just a heads up here Updated to the most recent build of Mojave and had an interesting issue arise Each time I attempted to create an Epichrome app I was getting an AppleScript hang I noticed that for some reason it was hanging Finder On relaunch of Finder Epichrome proceeded naturally I noticed that TotalFinder did not restart on relaunch so it seems like TotalFinder may have some issues that are causing some hangs or such or it could just be Finder hanging altogether Either way you slice it Finder hangs are problematic
