SelectChangeEventDetail interface would be generic so that the type of the value property can be typed Describe Preferred Solution ts interface SelectChangeEventDetailT any value T tsx const onSelectValueChange e CustomEventSelectChangeEventDetailnumber fooedetailvalue this is a number array now instead of any ionselect onIonChangeonSelectValueChange Describe Alternatives Additional Context Im not actually aware what types of values the ionselectoption can be used with but it definitely works with strings and numbers and arrays of either if multiple is set Edit According to the docs you can even have objects as values nice which means this generic interface would be really helpful I can make a PR once you agree that this is a good idea Before submitting an issue please

INVESTIGATION Bug Report Ionic version For Ionic x issues please use For Ionic x x issues please use x latest Current behavior When trying to navigate between two pages from different IonRouterOutlets UI is flickering and breaks as non active outlet is on the top of others making all visible UI elements unreachable img src width Expected behavior Navigation between two pages from different nested IonRouterOutlets should be possible Router outlets shouldnt overlap each other correctly determining which of them is active now on the top of others img src width Steps to reproduce Please explain the steps required to duplicate the issue especially if you are able to provide a sample application Basically what Im trying to do is navigation between two pages Home home and List list both of them are inside global IonRouterOutlet and both have inner IonRouterOutet for their own nested routes as described in Docs And here is a deal I want to navigate directly from nested route of Home eg homewelcome to the nested route of the List eg listid with correct page transition And it even works but only for the first time Then there are different outlets in DOM overlapping each other two with zindex one of them is needed and another incorrect with zindex so UI is blocked with transparent alien outlet Related code If you are able to illustrate the bug or feature request with an example please provide a sample application via one of the following means A sample application via GitHub StackBlitz Ionic Angular StackBlitz Plunker Other information List any other information that is relevant to your issue Stack traces related issues suggestions on how to fix Stack Overflow links forum links etc Looks like this is strictly related to all of those Angular issues have been opened since last summer The quick workaround for me here was moving Lists nested routes into parent IonRouterOutlet tsx IonApp IonReactRouter IonRouterOutlet Route pathlist componentListPage Route pathlist componentList exacttrue Route pathlistid componentItem Route pathhome componentHomePage Route path render Redirect tohome exacttrue IonRouterOutlet IonReactRouter IonApp But thats not a real gold bullet I want it back Actually I have two reasons for that Use all power of React Router nested routes and Place Home inside Tabs View while List will not be there and add Side Menu to both of them within the global IonRouterOutlet Thoughts on fixing this Even while both pages are in different nested outlets they have same global outlet Looks like navigation goes in right way but outlet controller cant determine current active outlet giving incorrect zindex Ionic info run ionic info from a terminalcmd prompt and paste output below Ionic Ionic CLI Usersaknvmversionsnodev

Describe the Feature Request A clear and concise description of what the feature request is Please include if your feature request is related to a problem Im using Ionic React and I want to create an IonReorderGroup inside a div that has a scrollbar However as I saw in Ionics core code the autoScroll function works only with the IonContent that wraps the Group Therefore I want the IonReorderGroup tag to have an optional prop called context for instance In the context prop I will be able to pass the ref of the div element or the divs id and then the autoScroll function will affect the divs scrollbar when I drag an element Related Code If you are able to illustrate the feature request with an example please provide a sample application via an online code collaborator such as StackBlitz or GitHub Solving this problem is pretty easy All it requires is to add the context property then changing the following lines in the path nodemodules ionic core dist collection components reordergroup reordergroupjs const contentEl thiselclosestioncontent Will become var contentEl if thiscontext null contentEl thiscontext else contentEl thiselclosestioncontent Or Something similar Additional Context List any other information that is relevant to your issue Stack traces related issues suggestions on how to add use case Stack Overflow links forum links screenshots OS if applicable etc An example of a use case On the left there is a div that contains an IonReorderGroup Because the list is long the div has a styled scrollbar However when I drag an item there is no autoScroll so there are glitches With a context property such as contextdivElement or contextdivID this problem can be easily solved
