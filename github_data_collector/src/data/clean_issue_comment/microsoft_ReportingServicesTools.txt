Im attempting to run a command like this OutRsRestFolderContent RsFolder ReportPortalUri Destination C TestingPBIRS Recurse IT works for the first couple of folders as we dont have linked reports but as soon as I get to a folder with one the script just stops with this error Unsupported item type We only support items which are of type Report DataSet DataSource Mobile Report or Power BI Report Im using this power shell version Major Minor Build Revision Do you want to request a feature or report a bug Feature What is the current behavior I wanted to move old Report Builder items older than X days from one folder to another but the only way I saw to do it was to download the objects locally delete them from the source folder then upload the items to another folder which had some timeout sideeffects Also doing this changed the modified date of the object so that I could no longer treat those files as old ones by checking for that value The option to move a file exists in the Details View of the web ui and it keeps the modified value as the old value Would be GREAT to have this as a function in your module If the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem What is the expected behavior Move objects from one folder to another keeping timestamps intact Which versions of Powershell and which OS are affected by this issue Did this work in previous versions of our scripts Changes proposed in this pull request implemented a check for windows credentials which presumably should have existed similar to the counterpart function SetRsDatabase The SetRsDatabaseCredentials function was incorrectly forcing a windows authentication even if SQL was specified as the DatabaseCredentialType How to test this code Make a call to the SetRsDatabaseCredentials function specifying SQL as the DatabaseCredentialType Be sure to provide a correct value for DatabaseCredential ReportServerInstance and if applicable ReportServerVersion Has been tested on remove any that dont apply Powershell Windows Server SQL Server Do you want to request a feature or report a bug Feature request What is the current behavior Command does not exist The command should allow you to enable or disable Report Execution Logging and to specify the Remove log entries older than this number of days setting as seen in the below SSMS

restart the SQL reporting services service When using SSRS the service name is set to SQLServerReportingServices changing from the previous SSRS versions default of ReportServer or ReportServerInstance Name Code needs to establish if the version of SSRS is and change the service name accordingly to to the above mentioned name Were using the Powershell script concept from here to push Power BI reports up to our onprem Power BI report server Have some across something bizarre This works great for pushing PBIX files from a network drive up to our onprem Report Server Unfortunately were having problems setting credentials securely via PowerShell so that we can set a refresh definition Basically in the core Powershell script we are doing this By the way our actual code is using the full iteration through the data sources object Im just stripping it down to the bare essentials dataSourceCredentialRetrieval Store dataSourceDataModelDataSourceAuthType UsernamePassword dataSourceDataModelDataSourceUsername SQLUserName dataSourceDataModelDataSourceSecret SQLPassword SetRsRestItemDataSource WebSession session RsItem folderPathPBIXName RsItemType PowerBIReport DataSources datasource This appears to work When we go up to the Report Server and look at the data source screen it seems to show what wed otherwise type in manually If we do a test connection without changing anything it works However when we defined a scheduled refresh and try to refresh immediately we get an authentication error on the stored credentials And now heres where it gets WEIRD If we go back to the data source screen and simply click SAVE without making any changes and then try to do the refresh again it works If someone told me that I dont know if Id believe them But we can reproduce this every time Its like we have to go into the Power BI report server page and click SAVE More on that in a minute So at the moment our Powershell script just pushes the PBIX up to the report server without setting credentials Then we set the credentials manually OK it works but hardly a good DevOps solution Now this had me really curious what was in the Report Server database specifically in DataModelDataSource for the User and Passwordwhen I first tried to push it up through PowerShell and then after I clicked SAVE in the web interface Turns out they were different The varbinary values for our user ID and password they are the same were initially xB E B D F A C A EB C However after I go into the interface and click save even though it shows the same text it saves in the DataModelDataSource table as this and this is the one that works with the refresh xB E B D F A EA C C BE F B CAE FC A A So the first characters are the same but it seems that the remainder is necessary Suffice it to say Im not an encryption expert Is there a way to jam in an encrypted varbinarymax value into DataModelSource to satisfy the credential requirements Thanks Kevin SetRsEmailSettings defaults the SMTPUseSSL property of the SetAuthenticatedEmailConfiguration method to true In many cases this might be the desired outcome however Im trying to configure a report server to use Azure SendGrid and this needs to be unchecked in the reporting configuration Feels like we should expose SMTPUseSSL as a parameter to SetRsEmailSettings perhaps with a default to true so that it can be configured for all situations instead of forcing it to true While doing some testing of GetRsCatalogItemRole between two servers that can see each other I noticed that while running the cmdlet locally there was not an error but when it was used with ReportServerUri to another server it returned the output but still complained Please see attachment Githibsubmissionerror
