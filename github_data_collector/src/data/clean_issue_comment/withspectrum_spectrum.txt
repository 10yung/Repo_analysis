On mobile I find that editing comments is a better experience than creating a new comment I will often create a comment submit then edit immediately afterwards to get some features that only edit has Some examples edit can insert a newline without submitting useful for paragraphs and code snippets edit can scroll useful for long comments and to reference previous comments However editing retains the send button and text input from the create new comment which is confusing and takes up screen real estate And you can edit multiple comments at the same time My preference would be a single style of commenting that retains all the best from both modes Bumps handlebars from to This update includes a security fix details summaryVulnerabilities fixedsummary pemSourced from a href GitHub Security
