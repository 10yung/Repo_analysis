Per recent contact with the Intune engineering team through their support channels Windows Home is not a supported platform for Intune enrollment or management on any hardware configuration Not under S Mode not on ARM its lack of AD component support and appropriate CSPs renders it wholly incompatible with Intune MDM compliance configuration profiles Support engineerings direct indication is that Pro Enterprise and Education are the only supported OS editions for Intune management Document Details Do not edit this section It is required for docsmicrosoftcom GitHub issue linking ID df ae a d d

via csv to autopilot This way admins can crosscheck if their devices are being added correctly For example what is the expected join type for autopilot devices added by csv import Azure AD Joined

enrollment manager What does this mean One of my customer is assigned as a DEM in InTune Portal He is unable to enroll his own iPhone and Azure AD logs do not provide any information Please clarify the above statement from the documentation Also we would like a much clearer explanation in this documentation Can DEM user enroll his iOS device at all if conditional access is enabled for All Users Added On Access Protection Documentation for Windows Defender AV and documenting the interaction with Intune Hi Team As per the lob app ipa file size can be Gb however that does not work and it is confirmed that it needs to be Gb as per this needs to be corrected asap in the document mentioned above Thanks We have been testing feature update policies to stage the updating of a fleet of machines and to ideally pin machines to builds of Windows that are fully supported by the customers line of business applications In testing these policies however we found it simply doesnt work all machines were pushed regardless of what build they were pinned to We have had a case open with Intune support and they advised that this is both because this is a preview feature but also that as older builds no longer exist on the catalog it will simply get given whatever the latest build is This seems to be counter to the documentation which implies you can set a build such as or which is also what we had been testing on Can anyone confirm if this feature has even worked or if there is some missing documentation to get it to work As at this stage the response from support is its a preview feature and that it will only offer thus making it pointless Document Details Do not edit this section It is required for docsmicrosoftcom GitHub issue linking ID ac acb bf a bb f b f d Version Independent ID
