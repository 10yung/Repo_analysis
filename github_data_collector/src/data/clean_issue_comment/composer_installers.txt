 It adds additional manipulations with a name to fit naming template In current implementation extension name set in extra fields so this changes respect this value at first and after default rule will be applied Remove strange items Place contrib projects to contrib folders Used versions PHP composer composerinstallers Context Drupal project Here is an extract of my composerjson repositories type composer url type package package name ckeditorplugincodesnippet type drupallibrary version master dist type zip url reference master type package package name harvesthqchosen type drupallibrary version master dist type zip url reference master require ckeditorplugincodesnippet master harvesthqchosen extra installerpaths weblibrariesname typedrupallibrary Expectation both libraries should be installed in weblibraries but only codesnippet lands there and the chosen library goes into the vendor directory I guess this is because that library comes with a composerjson which declares the type as library which seems to overwrite my type drupallibrary Ive then tried to add harvesthqchosen to extra installerpaths weblibraries array but that made no difference My question is how do I get the chosen library into the weblibraries path Hello Composer supports overriding the vendor location using vendordir There is no equivalent for packages handled by composerinstallers so everything goes to the folders specified in installerpaths I recently made a tiny wrapper here Which as stated can be useful in many cases like building the project to another directory for a production release Would you be open to accept this feature inside composerinstallers If so let me know and I will work on it Thank you With Craft plugins added via composer live in vendor not craftplugins so some installs are failing This change for Craft users will clear the problem up I am attempting to install on a Vagrant VM running Ubuntubionic Windows Pro host machine Other packages install fine but this one
