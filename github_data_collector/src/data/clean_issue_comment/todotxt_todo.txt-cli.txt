suite passes x Format your code with ShellCheck x Include a humanreadable description of what the pull request is trying to accomplish Feel free to ignore if this has already been discussed and please close point to discussion if so It allows to simply create a minimal config file like so export TODODIR Without explicitly specifying the widely accepted default file names TODODIRtodotxt etc It would be nice to have an option to set a due time in addition to due date This would help scheduling the day better and possibly extend apps with a reminder option Do you want to request a feature or report a bug No What is the current behavior I successfully run make and make install but on running make test I get the following message ok todo sh executable ok all todo contexts FAIL todo sh executable not in PATH todo sh expected exit code actual ok all todo contexts failed among tests make Makefile testst completionpathsh Error Im using the default settings for the location of todosh If the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem What is the expected behavior My install should pass the tests Which versions todosh are you using Run todosh V TODOTXT Command Line Interface v dirty Which Operating System are you using Fedora Which version of bash are you using Run bash version GNU bash version release x redhatlinuxgnu Do you want to request a feature or report a bug A feature I think What is the current behavior Currently Bash completion for projects does not work inside quotes If you encase your task in quotes you need this for single quotes to work and parentheses etc then you cant complete your projects by using myprotab Without quotes this would be completed as myproject assuming you have this project What is the expected behavior The project inside the quotes should be expanded just as it is without quotes Which versions todosh are you using Run todosh V Which Operating System are you using Windows with todosh in WSL Which version of bash are you using Run bash version Do you want to request a feature or report a bug Request a feature What is the current behavior Tasks only accept a task description What is the expected behavior Tasks could have a description added to them using for example t desc description Which versions todosh are you using Which Operating System are you using Ubuntu Which version of bash are you using Do you want to request a feature or report a bug A feature What is the current behavior to pri takes only one task as an argument What is the expected behavior I would like to prioritize multiple tasks in one command for example to pri C Im not really attached to a given syntax it could also be like in to do where we can do to do then we could to the same for to pri with to pri C Which versions todosh are you using Run todosh V TODOTXT Command Line Interface v Which Operating System are you using Ubuntu Which version of bash are you using Run bash version GNU bash version release x pclinuxgnu Do you want to request a feature or report a bug Bug report What is the current behavior Doesnt run If the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem After updating to Ubuntu the extension gives error at Gnome Shell Extension site and wont run What is the expected behavior To work as in version Which versions todosh are you using Run todosh V Latest Which Operating System are you using Ubuntu Which version of bash are you using Run bash version Do you want to request a feature or report a bug bug What is the current behavior If you have a task that starts with an ASCII character before such as or double quote that task will sort before any of the priority tasks So what you get are unprioritized tasks that start with an ASCII character before prioritized tasks unprioritized tasks that start ASCII character after If the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem Use a todotxt such as the following A high priority task B medium priority task funny task Another task A funny priority task then do todosh ls will show funny task A funny priority task A high priority task B medium priority task Another task What is the expected behavior The expected behavior is that all unprioritized tasks will sort after prioritized tasks A funny priority task A high priority task B medium priority task funny task Another task Which versions todosh are you using Run todosh V TODOTXT Command Line Interface v
