 What is the peco version OS architecture NA Abstract Please add a command line option and global option to allow a single selection only in other words disable multiple selections Discussion When the output of peco is piped to another command that expects only a single argument selecting multiple items could produce unexpected or unwanted results Therefore it would be nice to have a way to disable inadvertently selecting multiple items in situations where passing more than one item to the next command in the pipe or script could be disastrous for example overwriting the second file What is the peco version OS architecture peco version peco version v built with go uname a Linux Microsoft Microsoft Wed Dec PST x x x GNULinux Specify NA if not applicable Abstract Peco is not working properly

mentioned in the README that Linux is supported by peco If it is not then please add that information explicitly in the README and ignore the rest of the issue On Ubuntu I downloaded the current state
