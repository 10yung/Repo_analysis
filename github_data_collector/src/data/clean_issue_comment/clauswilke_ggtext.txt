Hi Claus thanks again for your wonderful contribution to the ggplot verse I love this package and use it for almost all plots since then and it works like a charm most of the time I know its a dev version so I just want to report a bug Ive found without expecting you to fix it soon r optionswarn librarytidyverse libraryggtext themeupdateaxistextx elementmarkdownsize labs cten itwentyi span stylecolor B thirtyspan axis text modifications are working perfectly ggplotmtcars aesmpg cyl geompoint scalexcontinuousbreaks c labels labs r until one changes their position ggplotmtcars aesmpg cyl geompoint scalexcontinuousposition top breaks c labels labs supCreated on by the reprex package v sup All the best C dric Hi This package is great and will undoubtedly save lots of people lots of headaches I am wondering if you would be able to add additional support to be able to inject LaTeX math into the text for plots I did notice you have shown an example of using HTML tags to do things like superscripts and subscripts however I think many users will be more familiar with writing more complex equations using LaTeX I really have no idea of the difficulty in adding this feature but it would be great to use some sort of system like R Markdown uses where it seems to parse the and renders all text inside as LaTeX math This would certainly be an amazing feature in my eyes Something like r iris ggplotaesSepalLength SepalWidth geompoint geomsmoothmethod lm labstitle The line in this plot represents haty beta beta x Thank you for your work From the demos which support HTML it seems like you could support icon fonts like Font Awesome which would be interesting for annotations although Im not sure if this package would allow font mixing
