I have a script in configwaltemplates folder that has the executable flag The output file generated by pywal does not preserve this flag and is not executable anymore and I have to chmod it manually Is it possible to copy the permission from the user template to the output file Greetings Is there any possibility that the vim theme could be modified so that set termguicolors could be used It is required by many themes for truecolor support so removing it ends up breaking other themes that one may switch to using something like vimcolorschemeswitcher Ive added some basic functionality to call functions from templates color color rgb color lighten color darken rgba Im not very familiar with githubs pull request system let me know if I need to do something differently I have my ultrawide wallpapers under a directory named It works fine because its a legal name But pywal breaks when parsing it screenshot Also when quoted screenshot Without the colon it works screenshot Customizations first link to the walset doesnt lead anywhere When pywal loads the wallpaper based on an image the image is stretched But Tweaks cant seem to adjust the wallpaper settings Setting it to zoom or centered doesnt change the image at all despite having an image that is the same resolution as my screen Ive been noticing a difference in the background colours between termite and st This happens when using the default colorswalsth as well as with a custom template in which colour is actually set to colour rather than the default background and when the following is set thus unsigned int defaultbg rather than unsigned int defaultbg Another thing Ive observed is that this happens when colour differs from the specified background colour wherein termite gets the correct background colour while st gets color as the background In this case termite has the correct background that is while st has a background a which is color Screenshots apologies if the screenshots are too large st pywalbackgrounddisparityst termite pywalbackgrounddisparitytermite I use ccmake to toggle cmake options for my companys software With pywal the cursor is invisible and I cannot tell which line I am editing easily without the aid of the text description for each option at the bottom Sample image that triggers the error I image Using image Untitledpng I colors Generating a colorscheme I colors Using haishoku backend Traceback most recent call last File usrbinwal line in module loadentrypointpywal consolescripts wal File usrlibpython sitepackagespywalmainpy line in main parseargsparser File usrlibpython sitepackagespywalmainpy line in parseargs satargssaturate File usrlibpython sitepackagespywalcolorspy line in get colors getattrbackend getimg light File usrlibpython sitepackagespywalbackendshaishokupy line in get return adjustcols light File usrlibpython sitepackagespywalbackendshaishokupy line in adjust return colorsgenericadjustrawcolors light File usrlibpython sitepackagespywalcolorspy line in genericadjust colors colors IndexError list assignment index out of range I have a shortcut in i to refresh i and reload wal with a random theme Sometimes Ill land on a theme I really like and might just want to stick to that one for a while but I have no idea how to find out whats the name of a theme To have a command like wal current output the name of the current theme would be nice
