youre in a hurry or dont feel confident its fine to report bugs with less details but this makes it less likely theyll get fixed soon In either case please use this template and fill in as many fields below as you can Note that we dont provide help for webpack questions after ejecting You can find webpack docs at Describe the bug I have set GENERATESOURCEMAP to false but I still see sourcemap files buildnosourcemap set GENERATESOURCEMAPfalse reactscripts build Did you try recovering your dependencies Your module tree might be corrupted and that might be causing the issues Lets try to recover it First delete these files and folders in your project nodemodules packagelockjson yarnlock Then you need to decide which package manager you prefer to use We support both npm and yarn However they cant be used together in one project so you need to pick one If you decided to use npm run this in your project directory npm install g npmlatest npm install This should fix your project If you decided to use yarn update it first Then run in your project directory yarn This should fix your project Importantly if you decided to use yarn you should never run npm install in the project For example yarn users should run yarn add library instead of npm install library Otherwise your project will break again Have you done all these steps and still see the issue Please paste the output of npm version andor yarn version to confirm dependency is OK Environment To help identify if a problem is specific to a platform browser or module version information about your environment is required This enables the maintainers quickly reproduce the issue and give feedback Run the following command in your React apps folder in terminal Note The result is copied to your clipboard directly npx createreactapp

example Im always frustrated when Ive been maintaining universalreactscripts a version of reactscripts which includes SSR support Ive recently been trying to merge in the changes from but as it stands it would now require that instead of just asking the user to specify scriptsversion with CRA theyll also need to specify the template option The reason for this change is that universalreactscripts was already applying some changes to the template within its init script with the files stored next to the existing template directories However with the template could be anything so its no longer possible to apply this transformation Instead the user will need to specify an SSR template from the start Describe the solution youd like For something like SSR the template and scripts version need to work together To facilitate this I propose that we add support for a defaultScriptsVersion property to templatejson Then the createreactapp script should Install and unpack the template to get access to templatejson Check for a defaultScriptsVersion falling back to reactscripts as the default Then install the scripts and other packages as before Describe alternatives youve considered The obvious alternative is to ask people to pass compatible scriptsversion and template options to createreactapp bash npx createreactapp scriptsversionuniversalreactscripts templateuniversal This is pretty verbose though and will break if only one of the two options are passed Ideally the user could just do this bash npx createreactapp templateuniversal Another alternative would be to somehow allow the scripts version to transform the template name This has the advantage of allowing the scripts to bail on unsupported templates but it sounds far more complicated Is your proposal related to a problem Im not expert on software licenses but from what I gathered when deploying an javascript application bundle to production and serving it on a web server this counts as distribution of statically linked software where I need to follow the licenses of all javascript npm packages used by my project So when Im using createreactapp in my application most dependencies are MIT or similar which cause no issues But there is an exception caniuselite has CCBY license which states the need to give explicit credit to the author when distributing the software Does this mean that all projects using createreactapp need to provide such credits somewhere in the web application they are producing Or am I misunderstanding something Describe the solution youd like If so then I think we should state somewhere in the documentation of createreactapp that the users need to credit caniuselite or caniuse Describe alternatives youve considered Ive already contacted caniuselite but they say its the license coming from the mother project caniuse Also caniuse are not willing to change this Please note that your issue will be fixed much faster if you spend about half an hour preparing it
