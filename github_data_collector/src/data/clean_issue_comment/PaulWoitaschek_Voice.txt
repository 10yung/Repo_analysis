The shaketoreset is really nice when going to sleep but in the next morning it has the obscure sideeffect of turning the audiobook back on This happens when you pick up the phone first time after waking up Sometimes passively moving the phone on the bed is enough It would be nice if shakereset or maybe even the whole app would stop after more than a few hours of inactivity App Sony xz Android Not a bug but a feature request Voice seems to display the album id tag only For audiobooks this seems to be okay but for podcasts all episodes look the same because they usually all have the same album tag It would be great if you could add an option to display the title and artist id tag too Issue seems to be about the same problem Displaying the filename could also solve it but I think displaying the id tags is a nicer solution Certain podcasts are split into parts but its not possible to see which part is which in Voice Screenshot Voice Is there a way to delete audio files directly from the app Best regards When you have a bluetooth headset connected it will automatically bring up the player in the notification If you dismiss it after some time the notification in the attached image appears It can not be dismissed the only way to remove it is to force close the app None of these things were happening before updating to android AppVersion Phone NameZenfone Android Version Please include the following details in your bug report AppVersion Phone Namepixel a xl Android Version The app controls keep disappearing from the notification bar if I pause the book and go away from my phone This PR removes unnecessary comma on Readme Use commits with a good description so everyone can see what you did to Use commits with a good description so everyone can see what you did AppVersion Phone Name Google Pixel Android Version Seems to be a more general issue that appeared after the latest android update airpods firmware update that mainly affects media ie calls whatsapp etc work just fine PS I love the app Thanks for doing this Please add a possibility to turn off the grouping by Current and Completed I want to have a single list of audiobooks AppVersion I would like it if it was possible to see how long you have been playing each audiobook on your list instead of only how long is left I believe that was the case on an earlier version as well
