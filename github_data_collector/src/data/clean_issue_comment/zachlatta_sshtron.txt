I would like to livestream games in progress Right now when sshtron is run by systemd the colors dont work See From what I can tell sshtron uses a color library which in turn uses library to check is theres a terminal connected to decide whether to use colors or not which boils down to this line The logic using TTY detection to decide if a server should output color seems flawed if thats what going on The server might be not connected to a TTY even if the clients are systemd does have some options to connect a service to a TTY documented in man systemdexec but usually services arent connected to TTYs their clients are In any event providing a working systemd service file would be of interest to people who want to manage sshtron as a standard system service The manual should note the needed client settings to get the correct experience for example a plain ANSI terminal emulation will not suffice sh sshtron Listening on port for SSH and port for HTTP Player joined Current stats users games Should be user games Player joined Current stats users games Should be users game EOF EOF
