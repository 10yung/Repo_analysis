Hey I installed IUP statically and Im getting this error when trying to build my project Im probably just dumb and missed a step but I cant seem to figure out why it cant find my GTK libs The docs for kissuishowgui state The closure argument should initialize and call show and the docs for kissuidialogDialog state This does not make the dialog appear on screen show must be called after the dialog has been configured There doesnt appear to be any show method though I downloaded iup Win dllw libzip copied its contents in Rust bin and Rust lib rustlib x pcwindowsmsvc lib then I ceated a helloworld project with dependencieskissui git and macrouse extern crate kissui use kissuicontainerHorizontal use kissuidialogDialog use kissuitextLabel fn main kissuishowgui Dialognew Horizontalnew children LabelnewHello world settitleHello world setsizepixels Next I got this build error error linking with linkexe failed exit code note NonUTF output LINK fatal error LNK xed xe xf xe xe xe xf xf xff xee xf xea xf xfb xf xfc xe xf xee xe xed xee xe x f xe xe xeb iuplib r n error aborting due to previous error The instructions currently tell people to download the dllw version of iup which does not come with lib libraries and is unsuitable for use with msvc For those targets the instructions should tell the user to download the dll version instead which definitely has lib files The instructions should also inform the user to place the lib files where the linker can find them and not the dll files Also perhaps the instructions should tell the user how to use a build script override to tell it where to look for the lib and dll files instead of stuffing those files all over the place in weird directories I was just asked about UI libraries for rust My suggestion of KISSUI got met with the complaint that its not on crates it would probably be a good idea to also add keywords like ui and gui I havent messed with C libraries much so Im not sure if this is a problem with kissui IUP my system or me but Im getting a build error that Im not sure how to resolve cargo build Compiling grimedit v fileUserserincallingcodegrimedit error linking with cc failed exit code note cc

appreciate any help you can offer I think we need to implement inside showgui something like Ill implement this Rust if envvarKISSUIAUTOCLOSE initfnaddchild Timernew setinterval setoninterval TimerCallbackStatusClose start The PR is coming soon just need to impl addchild cybergeek If you have any ideas for some unit tests that we can add without needing a GUI to actually launch since TravisCI workers are headless let me know Id like to be able to catch as many logic errors as we can with cargo test I didnt really dealt with cargo test and TravisCI yet Testing a GUI without using it sounds hard to do But i see TravisCI can run Firefox and may IUPGTK too Then we can use kissuitimerTimer to autoclose the GUI and test everything we want Or do i miss something Furthermore we can use ImageMagick and write a script for a advanced test set the environment variable KISSUIAUTOCLOSE loop through the examples cargo run example x make a screenshot import window compare it with the screenshot on github report if the screenshots arent equal or cargos exits status is not If we cant run this script on TravisCI we just keep in mind that different environments produce different screenshots Currently if we panic in callbacks or in the FFI glue generated for each callback impl that can cause undefined behaviour as the stack will unwind into C code It doesnt look like we have a problem right now as panicking works just fine but once threadcatchpanic is stabilized planned for stable we should probably try to catch panics in the FFI glue and safely exit the IUP event loop before repanicking or should we prefer to abort Basics initialize KISSUI create a dialog with a couple widgets Using callbacks with and without associated data implementing Callback for user structs Extending KISSUI using hidden APIs Addendum Move installation instructions out of README and into new topic Suggestions for more topics are welcome RFC use the Github wiki system or create a new Markdown file for each topic Looking for discussion in this reddit thread Currently only UTF MODE is turned on during initialization UTF MODEFILE should be also turned on
