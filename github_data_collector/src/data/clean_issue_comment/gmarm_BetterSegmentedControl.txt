First of all thanks for a great package This is a quick fix that allows index to be set to UISegmentedControlnoSegment Whenever thats the case we hide the indicatorView We also disable animations for going from or to noSegment Fixes fixes and fixes Thanks again When i set the titleView as follows navigationItemtitleView viewSegmented Current plan looks like normal text and selected text equal centerY How to make them equal bottom looking forward your reply Creates a new property segmentSpcaing which is used in the element frame calculation to create horizontal gaps between segments This change allows us to synchronize BetterSegmentedControl animations with other components Related to Hello I have a question Is there a way to change the normalTextColor after the segmented control has been created Thanks you I hope to custom indicatorView width and I hope indicatorView width could change with title text width Hi With the latest version I am running in to issues building the project with Carthage error Build input file cannot be found pathtoxcodeprojectdirCarthageCheckoutsBetterSegmentedControlExamplePodsTarget Support FilesBetterSegmentedControlBetterSegmentedControlInfoplist The only plist file in that directory is Infoplist so I guess that needs to be updated somewhere Perhaps this is the Xcode migration tool breaking something Thanks Geoff The orignai SegmentedControl can accept noSegment which represents no selection state Indices in this library allows UInt type but noSegment is a type of Int actually
