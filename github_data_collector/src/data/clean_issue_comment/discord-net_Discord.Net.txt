A while back I spent several days debugging a strange issue in my bot k guilds relies on reactions quite a lot where all the worker threads would one by one get blocked until the entire bot would crash once theyre all blocked After too much digging around I figured out all the threads were getting blocked inside the EnterAsync function in DiscordNetRestNetQueueRequestQueueBucketcs Im not sure exactly what was going wrong but the while loop never exited even as the rate limit bucket hit its reset time and it just sat and spun forever I solved the issue by adding a return from the method if the current time is past the reset time but Im not sure if this is the correct solution hence the issue rather than a PR This gets easier to reproduce locally by setting the minmax thread count to and firing off some reactionbased commands they seem to make it occur faster unsure if specifically those though At default ThreadPool settings it only seems to happen at a relatively large scale around the k guilds previously mentioned This is the singleline patch I made on my personal fork I hope someone more wellversed with DNET internals can help figure out whats actually going on and solve the issue in the main repository If it helps the server was running NET Core on Ubuntu inside a Docker container Summary This is part of the cumulative documentation update featured in the nightly version

GetTextChannelsAsync or GetChannelsAsync methods for DiscordNetRest v because there is an issue when i try to get channels with both methods but this issue occured only specific discords which have

a voice channel Discord sends some temporary login details session ID and token to one of the voice servers in whats called a voice server update How i can create AudioClient or something that help me send audio from this data I cannot use the usual methods because I want to transfer this data to another instance of the program and keep accessToken in secret Users are copying these samples because well were providing them as examples We shouldnt be using ProjectReference to set up the dependencies Adding reactions in is slower than it was in I tested it with the following code cs Commandtest public async Task TestCommandint amount for int i i amount i var message await ReplyAsynctest var emotes new new Emoji new Emoji new Emoji new Emoji new Emoji new Emoji new Emoji new Emoji new Emoji new Emoji var stopWatch new Stopwatch stopWatchStart await messageAddReactionsAsyncemotes stopWatchStop await messageModifyAsyncx xContent DiscordConfigVersion stopWatchElapsedMilliseconds ms await TaskDelay The result is that adding reactions in takes about twice as much A few months ago every time somebody in a channel with the bot connected to started or stopped to speak the SpeakingUpdated event on the audioClient was triggered But now it only gets triggered the first time a user in a channel starts to speak Is there anything I need to do to reset the event trigger or is this a bug with the API If the user has a custom status set you can not get any other activity data Spotify rich etc Not sure if this is a restriction of the Discord api only giving a single activity I couldnt find any exact info Version DiscordNet v dev Hey guys im struggling since days with this exception Im using Linux with Docker Do you have a special configuration of Linux Docker or IDiscordClient or what
