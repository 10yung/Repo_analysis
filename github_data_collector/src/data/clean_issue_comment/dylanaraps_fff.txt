Hi fff is a wonderful tool I think which is easy to use But When I want to open a selected text file whose sizes may be large than several GBs its not easy to open it with vim So how to change the tools eg less to open a text file Thanks Hi Ive noticed that image preview doesnt work correctly if you dont use a window manager that doesnt have EWMH support to retrieve NETACTIVEWINDOW as the WIDTH and HEIGHT of the terminal window As such w mimg displays the image at max resolution not fitting the terminal window I realise this is an unusual setup I have but finding a more simpler way of retrieving these things might be nice wattr from wmutils is a nice solution but obviously xdotool is installed by default usually whereas wmutils is not Basically it would be nice not to have to maintain a personal fork Would be awesome to have the file operations copy paste cut ranger style bulk rename etc available between shells so that you could tag items in one fff instance in say a tmux pane and then paste them in another instance of fff running in another pane Is there a way to execute an arbitrary shell command from within fff For example run fd and see the results then use fff to navigate there display keyboard shortcuts sage right go to child dir j scroll down f new file k scroll up n new dir h go to parent dir r rename l go to child dir X toggle executable enter go to child dir y mark copy backspace go to parent dir m mark move Go to previous dir d mark trash localshareffftrash g go to top s mark symbolic link G go to bottom b mark bulk rename go to a directory by typing Y mark all for copy search M mark all for move t go to trash D mark all for trash localshareffftrash go to home S mark all for symbolic link e refresh current dir B mark all for bulk rename open shell in current dir p pastemovedeletebulkrename x view filedir attributes c clear file selections i display image with w mimg favouritesbookmarks see customization down scroll down q exit with cd if enabled up scroll up CtrlC exit without cd left go to parent dir Blank line that goes up one directory when selected thing titled empty that always appears at the top doesnt do anything empty LICENSEmd Makefile READMEmd fff fff Works as expected with an updated bashie with homebrew Maybe it is already included and i havent found it but i miss a keybinding for printing out the marked files So i am able to check which files will be processed with copy move etc when i am in the target directory something like printf s n markedfiles Nerd Fonts is a font made for developers which includes icons for a variety of file types It is used by the plugin rangerdevicons to produce an output like so A feature like this for fff would be much appreciated An example of how it could be implemented in the config File format Customize the item string Format f is the current file i is the file type icon strfstr Example Add a tab before files FFFFILEFORMAT tf export FFFFILEFORMATif Mark format Customize the marked item string Format f is the current file i is the file type icon strfstr Example Add a before files FFFMARKFORMAT f export FFFMARKFORMAT if This feature would have to use the file extension which the ranger plugin also uses because repeated mimetype lookup is computationally expensive
