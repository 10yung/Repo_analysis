range To do this I call scrollToSegmentend animateScroll false on my JTACMonthView I do this in view controllers viewDidLoad The method works but it scrolls to the end with the very fast animation I looked into the scrollToSegment method and I noticed that it calls scrollToHeaderInSection but it doesnt pass animateScroll param to it scrollToHeaderInSections animation param defaults to true so it always animated no matter what I send to scrollToSegment When I update the method to pass the param to scrollToHeaderInSection the calendar shows current month without animation BEFORE SUBMITTING AN
