license for your gem This is because it is not specified in the gemspec of your last release via eg speclicense MIT or speclicenses MIT GPL Including a license in your gemspec is an easy way for rubygemsorg and other tools to check how your gem is licensed As you can imagine scanning your repository for a LICENSE file or parsing the README and then attempting to identify the license or licenses is much more difficult and more error prone So even for projects that already specify a license including a license in your gemspec is a good practice See for example how rubygemsorg uses the gemspec to display the rails gem license There is even a License Finder gem to help companiesindividuals ensure all gems they use meet their licensing needs This tool depends on license information being available in the gemspec This is an important enough issue that even Bundler now generates gems with a default MIT license I hope youll consider specifying a license in your gemspec If not please just close the issue with a nice message In either case Ill follow up Thanks for your time Appendix If you need help choosing a license sorry I havent checked your readme or looked for a license file GitHub has created a license picker tool Code without a license specified defaults to All rights reserved denying others all rights to use of the code Heres a list of the license names Ive found and their frequencies ps In case youre wondering how I found you and why I made this issue its because Im collecting stats on gems I was originally looking for download data and decided to collect license metadatatoo and make issues for gemspecs not specifying a license as a public service See the previous link or my blog post about this project for more information In SearchLogic or greater HABTM relationship queries fail with undefined method errors undefined method baridequalsany for Class x febd d homemyappsharedbundleruby gemssearchlogic libsearchlogicnamedscopescolumnconditionsrb in methodmissing The cause of this is the change from respondto to respondtomissing in This may work in Ruby but fails in with Rails Example class Foo hasandbelongstomany bars end class Bar hasandbelongstomany foos end Foobarsidin fails I worked around this by monkey patching module Searchlogic module NamedScopes module ColumnConditions In SearchLogic this was changed to respondtomissing which breaks Foobaridequalsany where Foo habtm Bar def respondtoargs super self ActiveRecordBase selfabstractclass createconditionargsfirstblank end
