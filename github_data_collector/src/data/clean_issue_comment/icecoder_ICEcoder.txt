When you hit the Update button in the settings menu for any reason no matter if you change anything or not the password field in the user config file is updated and the slashes are stripped and PHP cant properly read the hashed password without the dollar signs escaped adds date at the beginning of the settings file then it is displayed datadatadatadataphp ICEcoderUserSettings array I fixed it for golocalhostroot if iswriteabledatasettingsFile if settingsContents fh fopendatasettingsFile w fwritefh datasettingsContents fclosefh but for ftpmanaferphp there are no ideas yet Hey all its been a while since Ive used this tool so it could just be me not setting permissions correctly I cant edit anything in the Root directory of ICEcoder varwwwhtml img width altCapture src I used the WATCH command on that directory and saw everytime I tried there were changes to this file varwwwhtmlICEcoderdataerrorlog Opened her up and found this A non well formed numeric value encountered in varwwwhtmlICEcoderlibrequirementsphp on line Is this an issue with php or just permissions I downloaded Version set a password and updated the settings to my preferences editor theme eclipse pugin sidebar on the right After that A logged out and tried to log in again All it does is loading the LogIn page all over again The password is correct There is nothing shown in the developper tools When you press Unlock sidebar the lower section with Terminal Github etc overlaps the backup button Video If you type a command such as cd into the terminal it will freeze It seems to be related to this regex as if you comment it out you can use the terminal fine However the path displayed in the prompt doesnt match so that needs fixing too If ICEcoder is unable to write the dirfile detect if its due to lack of owner group or permissions Based upon findings offer the user the option of ICEcoder fixing the issue by recursively changing ownergroup to the web servers user and fixing any permissions dirs to files to along the way If the user confirms state itll do this please wait a few seconds then try saving your dirfile again This should be a one time hit to resolve this common issue users face Itll work by setting a task for processessystemphp to pickup and run on its next run Note that it relies on this process running in the background so also should check if its running and if not inform the user on how to enable it A timestamp of last run would be a good idea we can detect if it ran in the last few seconds This isnt a great solution to ensure code regression remove as its an incomplete and faulty solution There isnt always a doNext var to concat on and need to further check JS works in all processes Setup ICEbox as a solution and integrate wih ICEcoder including instructions on use
