unitypackage Let the Android resolver do its job Click on Asset Google Mobile Ads Settings to make a GoogleMobileAdsSettings node Enabled on android app Id copied from the GoogleMobileAdsDemoScriptcs file Click on Asset Play Service Resolver Android Resolver Resolve no idea why I do but anyway Build Run Android pop up Unfortunately HelloWorld has stopped Actually my previous Issues mention the iOS
