Im using Windows and Ive followed the instructions to install scoop and other prerequisites by opening powershell with admin rights setexecutionpolicy remotesigned s CurrentUser iwr useb getscoopsh iex scoop bucket add extras Then I try to install ioswebkitdebugproxy using the following command scoop install ioswebkitdebugproxy However that throws an error Heres the output Ive replaced my

with Scoop I have the following nonsensical autoupdate snippet url hash url basenamesha find afAF basename which the way i read the docs scoop should check for hashes in the file pomeriumwindowsamd sha Instead what it does is this bin checkverps f pomerium pomerium scoop version is Forcing autoupdate Autoupdating pomerium Searching hash for pomeriumexe in pomeriumexesha Here the actual manifest to play around with I followed the guide for switching java versions but it somehow seems to not work in my case I have both openjdk and openjdk installed from the java bucket bash scoop info openjdk

of buckets It becomes tedious that every time I use scoop to install software it automatically starts to update buckets Which takes quite a few minutes So is there an option to set it off I looked at the wiki and couldnt find it Thank you Updating versions bucket Scoop was updated successfully Installing ojdkbuild full b bit java openjdk b ojdkbuildwindowsx msi MB connection closed URL is not valid scoop install ojdkbuild full ERROR It looks like a previous installation of ojdkbuild full failed Run scoop uninstall ojdkbuild full before retrying the install WARN ojdkbuild full is already installed Use scoop update ojdkbuild full to install a new version I have seen several comments regarding scoop and The system cannot find the path specified This happened to me as well When I debugged to the bottom of it it was nothing scoop related actually Whenever I launched a cmd window I was receiving this error When scoop was trying to execute the envCOMSPEC c cmd for the git pull command this error was messing up the output and making it look like the repo was not valid and then scoop failing In the documentation help cmd it pointed me to these two entries HKEYLOCALMACHINE Software Microsoft Command Processor AutoRun andor HKEYCURRENTUSER Software Microsoft Command Processor AutoRun I had an invalid program reference to anaconda still in the second one Deleting this solved my problem However I think by adding the extra command line switch d envCOMSPEC d c cmd this will solve other peoples problems by removing side effects from executing autostart programs Here are the steps to reproduce Im running latest version of scoop Current Scoop version a fa d HEAD master originmaster originHEAD chorebucketsjson Update scoopnonportable URL When I run scoop status shows I have IntelliJIDEA v installed But when I open IntelliJ it tells me theres an update So I run scoop update and scoop reports IntelliJIDEA latest version Latest versions for all apps are installed For more information try scoop status So based on the workaround mentioned in I run scoop update f IntelliJIDEA Scoop dutifully updates IntelliJ to version But I dont want the old version on my machine so I run a cleanup scoop cleanup only to watch scoop uninstall the new version that it just installed Removing IntelliJIDEA Everything is shiny now No scoop everything is not shiny now So my question is why is scoop not registering the new version as new I thought that was supposed to be fixed with And until that is fixed should I just never run cleanup Thanks As soon as manifest specify hash extraction and hash is found URL is not checked This lead to possible problem when hash was extracted correctly but installation failed since developers changed URL Change should be simple This line need to test HTTP Status and then return hash Cannot think right now how to test remote file existence and do not download full file It should be possibe to download few bytes and see status Dear all I have got the result as below when using scoop status These app manifests have been removed herokucli I have tried both scoop update and scoop update herokucli but scoop status still show the same result scoop update herokucli results herokucli nightly latest version Please guide how can I fix this issue Thanks PS the scoop version results extras bucket fafd a HEAD master
