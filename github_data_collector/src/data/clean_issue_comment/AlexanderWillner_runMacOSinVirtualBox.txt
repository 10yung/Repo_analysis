Due to known Virtual Box bug in Mac OSX Catalina I intend to use VMWare Is it possible to use this script just to generate the ISO and use it with VMWare To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Have Catalina installed the official installer downloaded from System Update Clone this script Run make all VM is created and installation boots but VM has blank screen just stays hanging in blank state Expected behavior VM should install without errors Additional context runMacOSVirtualboxlog img width altScreenshot at src img width altScreenshot at src To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Run script make all first time Got ERROR Could create or run installer Please look in the log file Remove applicationpath INSTVER as it was suggested in log Remove all files which were created in virtual box directory Run script second time Press enter when it was suggested Got this Expected behavior Id expect to see some processing but nothing happened as it was in demo Additional

in the VM when pressing enter it successfully ejects the installer medium and starts the vm ending on Trying to find a bootable device Failed as of course nothing has been installed in step Expected behavior That it boots the installer medium and Catalina gets installed I used this script earlier to install other versions than Catalina and it always worked like a charm Additional context The log

Extension Pack installed when setting up a Mojave and a Catalina VMs as required by this script But was able to have them run properly for many weeks without an Extension Pack I think I only had to downgrade the USB controller to USB OHCI Controller for them Just a FYI Maybe worth adding an entry to README Not sure if the installation would also work without the Extension Pack but that would be great To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Download upgrade and Reboot Boot on Catalina not booting on macOS install data macOS version is still Expected behavior The upgrade from to works but the upgrade from to is not booting on the macOS install data Additional context The disk with startup script is in the VM sata and the main disk is sata no boot by hand in the shell Clover wont boot either Great project worked like a charm Would be worth noting in the help that the dmg files and sparseimage files created by the script can be deleted after the VM is up and running to save disk space Or delete them automatically from the script Host macOS Catalina on a MacBook Pro Guest macOS Catalina make all creates the VM and boots the installation but after selecting the language the screen Mac OS Utilities is shown I can select Install macOS or any other entry but cant continue because the Continue button is disabled Expected behavior Being able to continue installation Additional context log file runMacOSVirtualboxlog screen shot Ive used this tool which is very similar to yours but for VMWare Fusion The major feature I used with it is to set the serial number which is required for my use case Have you considered adding that feature to this package Hi again Had struggle a bit to access recovery in this setup so I tried to improve the README with my finds Thanks
