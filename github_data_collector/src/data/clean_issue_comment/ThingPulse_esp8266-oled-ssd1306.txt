Mostly all functions use bits parameters for values lower than a byte Why Highest screen dimension is I tried many libs else but always get noise with nothing i dont know why i tried k Ohm pull up too but still be Thank you for nice library I would like to make a running text string I change the X coordinate in the loop but I noticed limit of length text the text breaks off and starts to be displayed again first on top of other characters video Mb How I can change limit of length string line for scroll running text ps I need a string of characters but right now about characters are correctly displayed which corresponds to about pixels or screen widths Add possibility to use this library as component in ESPIDF OLEDDisplayh has been modified so that all hardwaredependent functions are virtual Nonstandard geometry is supported using existing GEOMETRYRAWMODE New files PCD Spih implements Nokia display using SPI WeatherStationDemoWiFiManagerino WeatherStationFontsh WeatherStationImagesh these files taken from the WeatherStation library have been modified to support PCD Spi in addition to the original OLED display types None of the new files are required except as examples of new functionality Hello Im using this library with my ESP I have used SSD Chip OLED display It worked well But When i changed my Display to SH I noticed this library doesnt have autoinit function So i add copy and paste that functions from SSD It worked well Can i add that function to your library this is the Content of SH Wireh SH Wirezip Would anyone care for this I added this into my own project and am willing to submit a PR back upstream if this is something you guys would like It requires a little bit of hackery so we would probably need to work together to find an optimal solution Let me know if youre interested and Ill take the time to push something up You have done a marvelous job of factoring the UI and display functionalities and I am enjoying using your library However I did notice that by making just a few additional members of OLEDDisplay virtual it becomes possible to support other displays with different interfaces and geometries I have done this on a fork of your project using the common PCD SPI display as a test case I have also modified one of the examples from your Weather Station library to dynamically adjust its output at runtime based on the display geometry If you would like to incorporate my changes you are welcome to do so The only library files I have changed are OLEDDisplaycpp OLEDDisplayh and a new file PCD Spih which implements the new display type The new example is WeatherStationDemoWiFiManager My fork can be found at This isnt an issue as much as a suggested change to the sample code You have an example of using two different displays with the same I C address on a single esp but the sample is showing using separate pins and the esp doesnt have as many GPIO pins as people would like SSD Wire display x c D D SSD Wire display x c D D But a quick test shows you can actually do it with three pins SSD Wire display x c D D SSD Wire display x c D D That setup is working great on a NodeMCU v board and saved one pin the project Im working on was starting to run short on usable GPIOs and I didnt want to start grabbing the TXRX pins Sharing the SDA and using separate SCL pins also works fine So you may want to show both ways in the example code I am using the x I C display with ThingPulse esp oledssd library When I display some text or image and then power off the esp and then power it on again say even after a few seconds for a short moment the OLED still displays the old textimage I am immediately issuing a clear command after the init but still the old textimage is VERY noticeable for a short amount of time Is there any solution to this I tried doing a displayOff immediately after init and then did a clear and then displayOn but that doesnt help either This is not a big problem but it would be great if I could prevent such behavior
