Hi We are trying to run SVO with ROS on a DOWNLOOKING camera and high frequency texture using iPhone camera with fps We are observing a strange phenomenon of the ground rising as the camera is moving also when the camera is making a turn the ground is observed as if it is on a tilt to the left and not horizontal Another issue is that the density of seeds and points on the map are spreading farther as the camera moves We have an hypothesis that it is something to do with the depth estimation seed insertion with wrong depth Can anyone have a suggestion on where in the code we can look for it attached are snapshots of the stated issues ground lift density the paramater file pinholeiPhone txt Someone can give some help The davis cameras resolution is x Screenshot from I have installed svo and test the example successfully but when I run it on my own data it only shows images and cant estimate the camera pose As the log shows My bag only has dvsimageraw and the example bag has many other topics what should I do to run svo on my own bag usrusrsvowssrcSVOrpgsvosvorosdata rosbag info airgroundrigs bag path airgroundrigs bag version duration s s start Mar end Mar size GB messages

camera on the sequence provided online I have changed the calibration settings but my own bag file it is giving error error svo installed svo I would like to create a nice environment so the SVO package works well Im using an ARDrone The bottom camera is a QVGA and works at Hz The environment where this package is going to be used is a cm x cm platform and nothing outside it In the platform I can put all the images or things that I want This is how the platform looks now the white papers with some AR tags on them and SVO says that there are not enough features Screenshot from So I added some black and white squares between some tags and it seems to work Screenshot from but then I move the camera a little and this is what happens Screenshot from So how do you recommend me to design that platform Maybe adding a lot of black and white squares between all tags Or is there anything better to do Thanks when I run the cmd rosrun rqtsvo rqtsvothen met the problem then I use the cmd rm configrosorgrqtguiini and the qusetion is still existence I have install libqt devqt qmake and with ubuntu ROS kinetic Someone says it should install Qt on my computer but I found that Ubuntu LTS uses an independent system for controlling the Qt version and it is QT I do not know how to solve it Please help me thanks a lot Tried to follow installation guide but Sophus isnt cooperating When I checkout a ff and then subsequently try to make I get Building CXX object CMakeFilesSophusdirsophusso cppo homeperworkspaceSophussophusso cpp In constructor SophusSO SO homeperworkspaceSophussophusso

would like to know if the groundtruth for the dataset given as an example on the wiki is available somewhere to compare it with the results of svo I have been trying to obtain it from the imu linear acceleration by integrating it twice but it seems to not be working Has anyone done this too Thanks in advance Hi I am aware svo is not optimized to work on forward facing cameras But the problem is not with tracking I am using KITTI sequence dataset The problem is with initial map estimation The number of inliers computed seems to be very less with mean disparity and with mean disparity This is quite surprising given that camera is well calibrated for this official dataset My conclusion is that KITTI doesnt provide camera distortion parameters could this be the problem Also svo runs perfectly well on the provided dataset using testpipeline functionality So I reckon there is no problem with Homography nor inliers computation cfo zhangzichao Could you please have a look at this issue I built the testpipeline with llvm on Mac then play with sample data sin tex h v d I am using the Release with debug info build type thus local BA not enabled Sometimes not often testpipeline
