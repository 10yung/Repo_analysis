website in Python and I got the error I use Herokus free dyno for my hosting filesvagrantupcom redirects to hashicorpfileshashicorpcom which is no longer active The preferred way to access boxes is to refer to them with their shorthand name hii install let chat on my server when i want start it with npm start i see this error Errorcsp must have at least one directive under the directives key I am interested to install Lets chat and put it in each of my employees computer But I only want the communication to be between me and my employees I dont want my employees to be able to use Lets chat to communicate among themselves I want to setup Lets chat to be my private chat to my employees Is this possible to setup in the configuration in the server There is no documentation regarding IPv support for lets chat Specifically how does one specify an IPv listen address By default it appears that lets chat doesnt listen on IPv addresses on the HTTP interface but I could be wrong The default should be changed to listen on all addresses IPv IPv I would be more than happy to issue a PR documenting how to specify an IPv address if someone can provide me with the proper syntax Thanks
