A sample showing how to import native dependencies from Maven This sample uses curl OpenSSL and JsonCpp to display a list of the most recent reviews submitted to AOSPs code review system This is still somewhat WIP it needs a lot of comments and shouldnt be checked in until its usable with a published AGP but its ready for some initial review Hello I have compiled the camera sample on my galaxy A There is no button on the screen in order to capture an image There is just the video view The procedure public void EnableUIfinal long params line of CameraActivityjava is never called detected by the Android studio compiler Sincerely FNICOLAS Hello is it possible to do HEVC hardware decoding using this sample code I tried an HEVC video sequence but I got the error NativeCodec has stopped Thank you in advance Best regards Hello everyone I have a video source file which works with read in native code c Today i use the camerabasic remastered sample to show it In fact instead of show in final buffer the camera output i write on it my frame that was out from my acquisitions reader for my video source However the problem is that is too long it is too slow And i cant stay with it I ask you today to know if you have any answer of my request if you have any ideas or any others project sample which can works well Required for it I need a buffer to put my frame data on it EDIT This open source project could be good instead of show the output of your camera you memcpy your frame on it Thank you too guys and have a good day java apply plugin comandroidlibrary android compileSdkVersion

executed uptodate and in commen there should the native building information below the appexternalNativeBuildDebug block Is this a bug of android studio or is there something wrong with my configuration Hi I made measurements on nexus on the audioecho project from google ndk examples and I got the following result The first line is the recommended parameter of the systemfast path Could you explain the meaning of the fast path Every time I multiplied by whole multiples of the buffer size My question is How can I explain the differance of latency Why is there no corroletion of the latency Thanks Alex In the teapot sample the FPS doesnt show Uploading Screenshot jpg Opencv Matrice is composed with this method BGR If you want to draw many red points you need to draw the third entry SYSTEM Android One Plus PROJECT CameraBasic I have a huge project which works on other plateforme i want to export it into Android i use CameraBasic Project GoogleSamples which works good except one thing but its not the problem On my project i create a matrice like this cvMat and i play with it i draw on the RED channel my points and i will copy Opencv Matrice data into a ANativeWindowBuffer which is provide with ANativeWindowLock Before continue i would say that these two buffers have same width same height else i will meet a lot crashed but not yet In fact after opencv Mat modified i will make a memcpy on my window buffer cpp buffbits provide by ANativeWindowLock myMatdata data which was changed and contain red points for example cvSize sizemat myMatsize memcpybuffbits myMatdata sizeofuchar myMatstep sizematheight And i thought that CameraBasic project algorithm to convert YUV TO RGB placed a pixel with a correct method but not same as Opencv the convertion algorithm that i spoke can be read on ImageReadercpp on every PresentImage When i draw my Mat data into ANativeWindow Buffer data when i show it on my App i have my drawing but with many different colors instead of only red points then i didnt understand why Then i proven that the algorithm conversion filled theses three channels without same method as Opencv which is BGR Blue Green Red My question is how do you placed it RGB BGR RRR i dont know The first Blue Green or Red Second Blue Green or Red Third Blue Green or Red Thank you advance and see you soon here i hope Best Regards The sample doesnt seem to take into account the various build types debug release setdistributionDIR CMAKESOURCEDIRdistribution That doesnt seem right to me
