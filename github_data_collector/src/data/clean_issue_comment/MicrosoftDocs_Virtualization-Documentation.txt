Hello Not sure anybody will answer my question here but lets try Running two VRA VMWare hosted VMs both VMs run latest Windows Enterprise LTSC I connect from my local pysical machine runs a WIN v w RemoteFX enabled into first VM There I can indeed redirect USB devices as expected I now want to further redirect my USB devices from first VM into a second VM So far I managed to enable RemoteFX on all machines my local host and both VMs But I only can redirect into first level VM my USB devices using RemoteFX further nested level VMs is not working list of devices RemoteFX would present normally remains empty Question are there any GPOs or registry hacks I could apply to enable such scenario I indeed am needing Or is this impossible Thanks Christophe Document Details Do not edit this

virtualizationcommunityteamblog explainingmicrosoftremotefxmd GitHub Login scooley The documentation does not specify if it is possible to connect a docker container with a Virtual Switch of the type Private In my scenario a dockerized application requires access to resources in a Virtual Private Network Since VPNs are not supported in Server Core and Server NanoSKUs I am using a VM that provides the VPN routing trough a Private Virtual Switch Unfortunately I have trouble understanding if a docker network can be bridged with a Virtual Switch or not Itd be greatly appreciated if someone could
