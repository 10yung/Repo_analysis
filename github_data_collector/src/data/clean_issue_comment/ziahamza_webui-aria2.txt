Hi do I need Apache on my Linux or something like that for connect with Aria WebUI I installed uGet and aria using terminal Then I type in the terminal aria c enablerpc rpclistenall Then I headed to on my Linux but It didnt works but when I set adress to localhost and port to in the settings it was ok and I have connection But how make this from other PC on my local network When I type Linux PC adress in my browser like linuxip it not works I tried to unlock port with iptables A FORWARD p TCP dport j ACCEPT for FORWARD and INPUT but it still dont work What else can I do Ive been wasting around hours today on this Web UI to get it working but I really cant HTTPS doesnt work so I switched on HTTP on my site but it seems that JSONRPC gets disconnected continuously or its not found when using port see attachment aria c itself works perfectly fine in SSH so I suppose its some settings in the Web UI I really dont know what else I can do because I started using this WebUI two years ago and Ive lways faced a lot of problems every time I decided to install it Ive tried to forward port from my router but I didnt see any difference Im running Apache on a Raspberry Pi B using VirtualHosts to divide different sites The Aria app is started in my RPi as aria c enablerpc rpclistenall daemon Please tell me if I need to provide some more details Hello how can I give a different
