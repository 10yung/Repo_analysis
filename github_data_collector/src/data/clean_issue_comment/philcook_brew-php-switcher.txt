I have php v v and v When I switch either or and type php v in iTerm it still logs me the even if phpinfo logs me right So when I install laravel with laravel new myapp it shows me error This package requires php but your PHP version does not satisfy that requirement please help Warning You are using macOS We do not provide support for this prerelease version You will encounter build failures with some formulae Please create pull requests instead of asking for help on Homebrews GitHub Discourse Twitter or IRC You are responsible for resolving any issues you experience as you are running this prerelease version Ive been running PHP yes I know its way deprecated but its the version I must use for my day job brew install brewphpswitcher This appears to have run brew update or at least updated my PHP x install I believe this in turn updated a icu c dependency When running PHP I now get php v dyld Library not loaded usrlocalopticu cliblibicui n dylib Referenced from usrlocalbinphp Reason image not found heres the fix However if I now brewphpswitcher php v dyld Library not loaded usrlocalopticu cliblibicui n dylib Referenced from usrlocalbinphp Reason image not found PHP requires icu c and PHP requires icu c there seems to be no easy way to switch between the two supposedly brew switch icu c should work but I get a not in cellar error The only fix seems to be to reinstall icu c brew reinstall brew reinstall Im not sure how to find the direct link for Its likely that link will point to a newer ver in the future Anyone know how to get brewphpswitcher to also switchupdate this dependency So this is working beautifully for us with MacOS but we need it also for Linux Has someone forked and adapted this for Ubuntu or RHEL yet This adds PHP again While I ve been given contributor permissions this repository requires at least one approval in order to merge PRs so with the only other contributor being largely inactive improvements by myself are basically impossible I d like to help support some of the issues reported here but it s almost impossible Would the community support me forking this repository and updating the Brew formula accordingly to use the fork Should add a brew services stop phpXX brew services start phpYY so we dont have to do this manually every time I switch I have a problem where I have PHP and installed along with the Brew httpd server but only PHP will allow the httpd server to start If I run brewphpswitcher s and manually swap the httpdconf file to load PHP apache starts and all is right with the world If I do the same with apache will not start and I will see mpmpreforknotice pid AH SIGHUP received Attempting to restart corenotice pid AH seg fault or similar nasty error detected in the parent process in the error logs Any further attempts to start apache manually through apachectl will not show anything new in the log file The only difference between the httpdconf files is LoadModule php module usrlocalCellarphp libexecapache libphp so vs LoadModule php module usrlocalCellarphp libexecapache libphp so If I swap back to apache starts just fine I can manually run brew unlink brew link cp httpdconf httpdconf sudo apachectl restart and get the same result Any clues as to what might be wrong here Both php and php were installed with the withhttpd flags Now that Ive installed the Brew apache server the default High Sierra apache server has decided it doesnt want to run anymore Trying this project out today to see if it will work for me switching between PHP versions However I use Valet and find that I need to specify cvalet to make sure Valet is restarted Is there a reason for this If not if I provided a way to either make restarting Valet happen by default or by some other means env config values etc would that be accepted
