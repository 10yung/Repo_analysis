This allows to keep links to external resources in a single place while also being able to add explanatory links to almost every occurences of an expression which helps browsing visitors As discussed in Examples from Wikipedia about computer graphics from the Rust book from the Rust reference Basically which does not fit perfectly into the API documentation HashMap An Iteration section could give an overview over Tasks iterate over references asref iterate over mutable references iterate and consume Traitsmethods trait Iterator trait IterMut producing an iterator trait IntoIterator intoiter consumes Self use reference as in for x in y if this is not desired used by for loop iter does not consume Self defined for HashMap Vec consuming an iterator trait FromIterator resuming vs nonresuming iterators General Survey was online from September until September people participated During that period we had about k page visits giving a response rate of about per visit Average response time was minutes but varied heavily between seconds and minutes Questions This visit to cheatsrs visit Something you came to do in particular Comment function parameters I looking for a Rust cheat sheet on Google and then I find the cheatsrs as the first result No Just to see the giraffe Lifetime Looking for an overall syntax summary github redirected me to here and glad it did asyncawait I open cheatsrs almost every time I starting work Lambda captures Macros rust macro syntax how to use matches Its kind of hard to remember the as to something for methods Tips on asyncawait This site contains xx Anything else you want to say Comment Awesome Great page Well structured and has just the right amount of infos on it Keep up the great work Looks great Perhaps sometimes some more examples or links to examples would be nice Great site wish even more explanations This is a wonderful resource Its so helpful to have all the syntactical forms summarised like this Please provide more information on rust If there are separate cheat sheats for topics like concurrency type system it would be best Very useful resource I loved it from the first time I met it I think that adding section with links to sites like Are we X yet like and so on would be very useful Recently discovered cheatsrs and its my new goto reference I think its a great complement to the Rust book Thanks for this and well done The Rust community is awesome examples would be helpful I wish every language had this cheatsrs is amazing THANK YOU The font used looks fine using the light theme it looks crap using the dark theme sadly Very good website Very useful Maybe add something about mut ref in pattern matching How likely is it that you recommend cheatsrs to a friend or colleague supporters rating or neutral rating or detractors rating to NPS score of Is there a better way to do this than to copy the large font CSS generated by Google when is something threadsafe stdmarkerSend stdmarkerSync From T Send means its safe to access a T on a single other thread where one thread at a time has exclusive access A value of this type can be moved to another thread by unique ownership or borrowed on another thread by unique reference mut T A more descriptive name for this trait might be UniqueThreadSafe T Sync means it s safe for many threads to access a T simultaneously with each thread having shared access Values of such types can be accessed on other threads via shared ownership or shared references T A more descriptive name would be SharedThreadSafe From Think of Send as it is safe to give another thread unique access to this value Think of Sync as it is safe to share access to this value across threads Examples SendSync most types AtomicUsize SendSync MutexGuard RwLockReadGuard RwLockWriteGuard SendSync Cell RefCell SendSync Rc Formatter dyn Trait MutexT RWLockT Feel free to close this issue Just wanted to let you know
