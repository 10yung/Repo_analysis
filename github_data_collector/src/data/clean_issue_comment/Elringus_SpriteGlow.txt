Hi It took a while but I managed to add the glow effect you provided to a sprite in my D game after installing the package setting the postprocessing volumelayers and assigning the sprite outline It seems to have a use for what Im looking for and runs well However this game was meant to run at frames per second and it was running very well at the beginning With this whole glowing effect added however the game now runs between to frames which is unbearable to watch Im leading to believe this has to do with the addition of the bloom effect as I have not implemented lighting effects yet Furthermore the game seems to only cause this slowdown of performance when operating under the Unity Editor I tested building the game into an executable file and it thankfully started working at the fps I expected Regardless I want to continue testing the game in the editor without this setback of performance rate as it would take too long to test each update in a new build My overall questions are was this sprite glow addition meant to function in a lower frame rate Are there methods I can consider to reduce the performance issues in result of this addon shader Any advice on how to keep projects running smoothly after applying the bloom effect would be very helpful Thank you It seems to no longer work on Is there something else I need to configure for the URP
