In the Before we start section the lesson begins by suggesting the use of documents and scripts subdirectories in addition to data and dataraw However the workshop itself doesnt apply this useful directory structure It may be more consistent to create these two folders and to give people practice orienting their scripts to run out of the scripts subdirectory An update would require file references to begin with with an explanation in the text and given by the instructor Ive attached a file of the proposed directory structure here img width altSuggestedDirStruc src Three ways to force R to print the value using parentheses typing the object name using print function The function print was not introduced in this episode in the current version possibly because functions havent been introduced yet maybe mention this function in the subsection of Functions and their arguments This function is used in the episode Manipulating analyzing and exporting data with tidyr later on The comment character should be introduced earlier In the current setup comments showed up in the subsection Objects vs variables but no explanation at all there It would be great to mention that the grammar of the language determines whether an expression is complete or not eg x incomplete expression Nothing would happen after entering Enter because its waiting for the expression to be completed This is also a good place to introduce the comment character In other languages with Clike syntax and Python and even in Fortran the dot character has a peculiar meaning R is pretty different in this regard as dots are accepted in variable names and are largely used in the standard library To a learner used to other languages it seems that the as functions can be part of module as implicitly loaded that manages conversions between types This is of course wrong In the context of human languages this situation is usually referred to as a false friend and such false friends are usually pointed out in language courses The Rintro bible on CRAN state this in a way that is somewhat clearer see section I find this situation sightly unsatisfactory and I see two alternatives maybe there is a way to stress this out maybe using a callout in the Creating objects in R section of the Intro episode although there is already a callout about the object vs variable issue It could also be that this material is not the best for people who have some programming experience and such learners should just not be catered to and should instead be diverted to differentlyflavoured material Contribution from a community member via email I found an issue in one of the lessons in the Data Carpentry Ecology Curriculum called Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists Site URL Git Repository All the other pages in the ecology curriculum besides this lesson open to a home page that has a schedule with the approximate timings each episode will take My suggestion would be to add a schedule to the beginning of this lesson as well Having a schedule seems to be common to most of the pages on the site and was very helpful when I was taking my instructor course Additionally it would make all of the lessons flow better together Finally having the students be able to see the breakdown of timings is something that would be helpful for their learning in order to better pace themselves if taking it on their own When teaching I would think that having this schedule would also help keep instructors and students on the right track and on time code below is confusing One of the first elements in the th column has a blank so only elements are returns Its extra confusing because we havent spoken about factors yet Switching it to the surveys will make it clearer first three elements in the th column as a vector surveys I have tried to address the issue and added a small explanation and a couple of examples of how the pipe operator can be integrated with ggplot obtaining the same results and in the previous plot where no pipe is used I just gave a Data Wrangling in R using Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists and am currently preparing to give the Data Visualization followup workshop While preparing I noticed that nowhere in the Data Visualization materials do we use the pipe operator to pipe a dataset into ggplot I think adding a short blurb on how you can do this would make a great connection between the Data Wrangling and Data Visualization workshops Hi Question related to this post what I do not quite get is that if we want to avoid handling large amounts of data then why would I want to load the datasets large csv files to create the db I would like to know if I can just call the location of the dataset and create the db as a file Is that possible Best Just a pointer to because also relevant here Since this will requires update to img gather spread Where those generated from shareable source files for ab If so please consider pushing them into img as well cc chriseshleman mondorescue because of Similar to but since the resources we mention cover much of the advanced content here how about we reduce this section to the most relevant part for new learners
