This helps resolve I was having trouble with it for a while still not resolving but ironically we are having some network issues at the office please help test this branch I also noticed that the CargoHttpConfig struct is a cached struct so I had to remove the Cargolock to get it to cooperate in some rare cases A proxy defined via httpsproxy environment variable isnt used Instead the following error message is produced after timeout has been reached text Caused by Unable to update registry Caused by failed to fetch Caused by failed to connect to githubcom Operation timed out classOs In contrast cargo update honors the defined proxy Im using namedprofiles in my Cargotoml to support my profiletestcoverage When I run either of these cargo outdated exitcode cargo Z unstableoptions Z configprofile outdated exitcode I get error failed to parse manifest at pathtoprojectCargotoml Caused by unknown cargo feature namedprofiles Im using Rust nightly x unknownlinuxgnu cargooutdated v cargo build does work so I guess it uses a different Cargo version or something If you run the latest version of cargooutdated against the following manifest toml package name testresolv version edition dependencies rusqlite refinery version features rusqlite you will get the following error error failed to select a version for libsqlite sys required by package rusqlite v which is depended on by refinerymigrations v which is depended on by refinery v which is depended on by testresolv v tmpcargooutdatedIHYCuQ versions that meet the requirements are the package libsqlite sys links to the native library sqlite but it conflicts with a previous package which links to sqlite as well package libsqlite sys v which is depended on by rusqlite v which is depended on by testresolv v tmpcargooutdatedIHYCuQ failed to select a version for libsqlite sys which could resolve this conflict This is kinda unexpected because the manifest explicitly specifies that rusqlite version is not The project itself builds just fine without any issues with this setup of dependencies When having an aliased crate dependency cargooutdated fails to check for outdated crates returning an error In ffsend Ive a crate dependency for clipboard aliassed to clip When running cargo outdated d it fails with the following error error Direct dependency clip not found for package ffsend This might be related to the targetcfgdependencies header but I believe its just the alias causing this issue Currently release v is not on cratesio because kbknapp is busy This would not be an issues if tagged releases were automatically uploaded to cratesio by CI Note that it also means that permissions dont need to be managed in multiple places cargooutdated cant show any version information if Cargo finds a conflict with the latest versions In my case criterion required lazystatic lazystatic exists If a project uses lazystatic on its own this creates a conflict between criterions and the latest As a result cargooutdated fails and cant show any version information When running cargo outdated on a repository with many small crates this error appears after a while cargo outdated killed cargo outdated The system is Ubuntu with GB physical memory Investigating with bash dmesg less gives Out of memory Kill process cargooutdated score or sacrifice child Killed process cargooutdated totalvm kB anonrss kB filerss kB shmemrss kB oomreaper reaped process cargooutdated now anonrss kB filerss kB shmemrss kB I havent checked code but if its trying to compile the whole repo in tmp which is mounted on my RAM perhaps that explains it Can see from this graph that the memory usage green spikes before its killed memory A proposed fix is to take in a parameter for the temporary location to compile Maybe theres some parts of the code that can be memory optimized as well My Cargotoml contains the following profilerelease lto thin And when I run cargo outdated I get the following error error failed to parse manifest at homedrorldevhostioCargotoml Caused by invalid type string thin expected a boolean for key profilereleaselto Note that this is valid as per lto can be a boolean or a string Hi I am checking the outdated packages in quicli but I get this error rust dineshPersonal master homedineshprogrustquicli Personal desktop cargo outdated error Direct dependency quicli not found for package commitmsggen
