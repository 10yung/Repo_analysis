I setup your plugin but when executing the the gradlew PandroidenableJetifierfalse canIDropJetifier command I get FAILURE Build failed with an exception What went wrong A problem occurred configuring project aggregation No such property testOptions for class javalangString Gradle version is We were using some dependency substitution on the support libraries in our app causing the plugin to tell us that we were fine dropping jetifier even though we werent Removing the now unnecessary dependency substitution produced the expected results Wanted to post this here as others may run into the issue too Example for dependency substitution Groovy projectconfigurationsall resolutionStrategyeachDependency details if detailsrequestedgroup comandroidsupport detailsuseVersion someVersion cominstabuglibraryinstabug comfacebookandroidfacebookandroidsdk Hi plnice we have an app with libraries modules and the plugin is too slow for us After minutes it didnt complete It might be that you resolve configurations I am not sure A workaround for us is bash gradlew PandroidenableJetifierfalse app moduledependencies configuration flavorbuildTypeRuntimeClasspath grep comandroidsupport This command takes around seconds to execute If you are interested in one of our repo we use a very fast way to check dependencies Maybe this would be the way for you to go as well I am not sure We would be happy to use the plugin if it could be run in minutes on our nightly build
