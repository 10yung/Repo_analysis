the community standpoint but if youre reading this you probably know the original assetrack has been somewhat abandoned I guess this thread should be used to discuss who should inherit the project and which new fork we should all go use support contribute to and etc It looks like AlexCheng has some enthusiasm to maintain a fork I think the spiritual successor should probably be a group of people with relevant experience or maybe an organization to prevent stagnation or reliance on one maintainer Theres a lot of big issues like express x support and a huge backlog of issues and PRs that render a pretty builtout asset pipeline library to currently useless It wouldnt be a lot of work to fix it and revive a lot of previous work as well The other alternative and possibly better argument is to jump to a comparable or more wellbuilt project and integrate some of the key differentiating features like S deploy integration imo the most unique one Thoughts Actually I like this component as it is what I want However I cannot use it on the new node and it seems that the project doesnt have enough maintenance force Now I am hesitate that if I should use it in my project BTW I want to join the project techpines its been almost a year since there has been any movement on this project issues and more importantly PRs are piling up it looks like you no longer have the time andor the interest to maintain this project Could you please consider doing at least one of the following Declaring in the top of your README that you are no longer maintaining this project Try to find another developer to take the project over there seem to a number of active forks eg johncalvinyoung shopbeam maybe amongst them their is a suitable person For instance if I create a Browserify asset I should be able to pass in any Browserify option to the asset If it is unrecognized by the asset it should be passed to Browserify directly In my situation I want to use the Browserify path option which lets you specify the root of your project That way when you use require you can use the absolute path instead of relative paths Using rack assets doesnt allow me to use this option This wonderful project is languishing because of the extra effort required to contribute to Coffeescript projects and the unwillingness of some developers to include Coffeescript libraries in their applications We should wholesale move to Javascript I have been trying to update our applications to Express Assert rack doesnt seem to be working I started to try to get it working but realized that Im out of my depth I just dont know enough about writing express middleware Maybe this repo could be a start of an upgrade Or is assetrack not planning to be upgraded If not what do you recommend as an alternative
