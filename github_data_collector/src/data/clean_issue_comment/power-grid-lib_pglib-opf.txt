This is more representative of the GRID DATA team that generated these cases Hello I got the following error when solving OPF for test cases case pegaseapi and case psercapi with the MATPOWER function runopf It seems that there is a problem when generator bound Pmax is Error using makeAvl line makeAvl either Qmin or Qmax must be equal to zero for each dispatchable load Error in opfsetup line Avl lvl uvl makeAvlbaseMVA gen Error in opf line om opfsetupmpc mpopt Error in runopf line r success opfcasedata mpopt Best regards Christian Consider adding this system molzahn requested incorperation of the New England bus network Check if thermal limits are there If not check if limits from the bus case can be imported Make sure all cases have a single connected component Explore the possibility of including a network derived from the Bus Machine Area Dynamic Test System Related Links Check if the shunt parameter precision can be made consistent in all data files This will make the spacing in the data files cleaner Note that the current precision in the pegase cases varies widely from bus to bus Check if this case would be better suited with its original cost function
