Hi there We are a research team working on thirdparty library analysis We have found that some widelyused thirdparty libraries in your project have majorcritical bugs which will degrade the quality of your project We highly recommend you to update those libraries to new versions We have attached the buggy thirdparty libraries and corresponding jira issue links below for you to have more detailed information We have analyzed the api call related to the following libraries and found one library that is using the API call that might invoke buggy methods in the library of the history commonscodec commonscodec version API call in your projectorgapachecommonscodecbinaryBase setInitialBufferbyte intint Jira issues Base InputStreamreadbyte incorrectly returns at end of any stream which is multiple of bytes long version ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when doing multiple reads on encoding Base InputStream version Base encoding issue for larger avi files version orgapachecommonscodecnetURLCodecESCAPECHAR isnt final but should be version orgapachecommonscodeclanguageRefinedSoundexUSENGLISHMAPPING should be package protected MALICIOUSCODE version orgapachecommonscodeclanguageSoundexUSENGLISHMAPPING should be package protected MALICIOUSCODE version Caverphone encodes names starting and ending with mb incorrectly version All links to fixed bugs in the Changes Report point nowhere eg Looks as if all JIRA tickets were renumbered version Regression Base encodechunktrue has bug when input length is multiple of version DigestUtils MD checksum is not calculated correctly on linux platforms version new Base encode appends a CRLF and chunks results into character lines version Base encode method is no longer threadsafe breaking clients using it as a shared BinaryEncoder version Base default constructor behaviour changed to enable chunking in version Base InputStream causes NullPointerException on some input version Base encodeBase String

StringUtilsequals fails with Index OOBE on nonStrings with identical leading prefix version There are no tests for CharSequenceUtilsregionMatches version ArrayUtilsremoveAllObject array int indices should do the clone not its callers version TypeUtilsisAssignable throws NullPointerException when fromType has type variables and toType generic superclass specifies type variable version FastDateFormat does not support the weekyear component uppercase Y version ordinalIndexOfabc ab gives incorrect answer of correct answer should be version Fix implementation of

method hashCode in class Object cannot be applied to given types hashCode hashCode orgapachethriftTBaseHelperhashCodefeatureWeight required no arguments found double reason actual and formal argument lists differ in length My thrift version is I tried downloading and installing an older version of thrift from source since this demo is old and might rely on an older thrift just a hypothesis But that turned out to have some roadblocks as well since the older thrift uses some C code namespace tr that is no longer supported by C on my OSX El Capitan So I couldnt verify if thrift is the issue or something else Basically I thought the hashCode function in the error above might have a changed signature from to I think anyone else attempting to build the demo will run into this issue as well Really hope to get this running on my machine soon Aerosolve is super exciting al table What is the proposed change If overwrite option is true we first need to drop the existing partition from hive otherwise HiveUtilupdateHivePartition will drop just committed new text files How was this tested x Was the change tested with treehouse Reviewers jq saurfang mLewisLogic I think that it will be great to have the training module compiled with Scala because the version is relatively old
