Describe the bug A clear and concise description of what the bug is To Reproduce Steps used to reproduce the behavior launch game in steam with this launch command gamemoderun command View output of jounaldlog See error ignoring error condition Permission denied Your user may not have permission to do this Please read the docs to learn how to adjust the pam limits PM usrbingamemoded Could not inspect tasks for client Skipping ioprio optimisation Expected behavior renice and ioprio works System Info please complete the following information OS and version Manjaro ck tkgMuQSS GameMode Version Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe If machine is temperature limited performance mode wont do any good Instead user should be notified about the issue as fixing failing inadequate cooling is one of the cheapest ways of significantly increasing performance Describe alternatives youve considered Gamemode depends on something that already monitors and warns user about temperature issues or Gamemode itself monitors temperatures and their alarms from sysfs Additional context There are temp power and their limit value files in hwmon sysfs and alarm files telling whether they were triggered I think alarm entries trigger only when maxcrit limits are exceeded but I dont think that happens unless cooling really fails temperature is too high even when chip frequencies are lowered Therefore the rule for deciding when device would be temperature limited is that input value is close say within degree or two to maxcrit limit Because temperature changes much slower than chip frequencies polling the values at eg s interval should be fine Because alarm files keep their values until reboot they dont need to be sampled they can be checked whenever its most convenient Then theres also Some computers have the ability to enforce a power cap in hardware If this is the case the powercap and related sysfs files will appear When the average power consumption exceeds the cap an ACPI event will be broadcast on the netlink event socket and a poll notification will be sent to the appropriate poweralarm file to indicate that capping has begun and the hardware has taken action to reduce power consumption Message to user could be something like Detected device performance being temperature limited Please make sure your device is not too close to heat sources radiator other machines or their power bricks direct sunlight airflow to its air vents isnt obstructed and device is on level If that doesnt help make sure device fans work properly and are clean If device is still temperature limited you may need to replace current cooling old thermal paste etc We had one device using heatpipes which cooling stopped working properly if it was few days at a slight angle Setting device level fixed that Another device had a fan that still worked but fan was filled with dustbunny socks it had been knitting Removing those multiplied the laptop performance When I launch bootstrapsh it demands me to press y to accept then enter to confirm Is there any way to install it silently without any user interaction If the answer is no could you please add this option I know that using bootstrapsh requires entering root password but I can make a script to install this application and all the applications that I want automatically and just give sudo permission to that script I just add y to the end of every command I use on Linux Mint to run it silently but when I try it with bootstrap it gives me this error message meson error unrecognized arguments y Describe the bug A clear and concise description of what the bug is gamemoded does not start on boot and cant be manually started To Reproduce install gamemode in Ubuntu sudo apt install

systemd Failed to start gamemoded See error Expected behavior A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen Expected that gamemoded starts System Info please complete the following information OS and version eg Ubuntu Ubuntu GameMode Version eg or git sha v dev Additional context Add any other context about the problem here I dont know how to debug reason for failure Gamemode currently uses two threads one for handling dbus and one for process reaping and config file watching Because its threaded it also has a complex system of readwrite locks to protect internal data structures If a proper event loop were used instead of threads the locking could be deleted and the whole thing would probably be a lot cleaner Fortunately systemd already provides an event loop called sdevent which has everything gamemode needs sdbus integration Timers Child process watching for reaping Inotify watching for detecting config file changes It also properly uses poll so everything happens exactly ondemaind instead of having to wake up every s to look at file descriptors again I started down this path when working on but the refactor was quickly getting into yak shaving territory and so I put it down Describe the bug Added gamemoderun command to CSGO launch options after installing per the Docs To Reproduce Steps used to reproduce the behavior Launch CSGO with normal executable including the gamemoderun command launch option Game starts to load then immediately closes itself Expected behavior Game to load System Info please complete the following information OS and version PopOS GameMode Version havent found an easy way to add gamemoderun to all steam launch options for all my games so I just wrote this little script Its far from perfect but works for me and maybe someone else has some use for it as well Some things worth to mention the script doesnt edit your original steamsteamuserdataYOURSTEAMIDconfiglocalconfigvdf but works with a copy in tmp you have to insert your proper ID valid directory name in steamsteamuserdata it removes every LaunchOptions line first then inserts LaunchOptions gamemoderun command before every line with Playtime you have to copy the edited config manually back and make sure to close steam before use at your own risk GamemoderunSteamCommandstxt Describe the bug Tests fail when running them To Reproduce Steps used to reproduce the behavior Use git to clone the repository Build it like said in READMEmd Install gamemode in usr Run the command gamemoded t Expected behavior I should all the

Gamemode works correctly on the Wine runner in Lutris but doesnt activate on the Wine Steam runner Both have identical launch perimeters KeyLDPRELOAD Valueusrlibx linuxgnulibgamemodeautoso Ubuntu v dev July according to man page A frame limiter would be really nice for people using Freesync monitors to be able to cap max FPS of a game under the max VRR refresh rate of the monitor NVIDIA at least has one built into their driver in Windows but nothing for Linux There is however libstrangle which should work with all GPU vendors It would be pretty neatslick if gamemode could integrate with and automatically set this for any game using game mode maybe just allow a global max fps config option and then detect if it is installed or not to activate
