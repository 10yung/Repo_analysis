 dropping test runs for Ruby x and x adding test runs under Ruby and testing against Rails and Rails Hi I am using mailboxer for sending email messages to users I have the following working code usersendmessagecontact messagebody messagesubject But I need to send an email to CC carbon copy as well How can I send an email to CC address How do I use mailboxer in chat view without Inbox Outbox Sent or subject Mailboxer produces the following warnings in Rails DEPRECATION WARNING updateattributes is deprecated and will be removed from Rails please use update instead see also when i do something like currentusersendmessagenil body subjectconversation recieverid is currentuserid In the message class when your message validation fails in the deliver method if valid save then then message is not saved but the receipts where created successfully telling that there are no errors on them what is correct So there is a need to translate somehow the message validations errors to the sendmessage method in order to know whats happening In my case when I set bodymaxlength in malboxerrb initializer and I send a message longer than its value the message where not sent but the blank receiptserrors may me think that it does Thanks MateoLa This is also related to Issues and Looking at the mailboxernotifications table is there any way to identify if a message is a reply What are the possible values for these fields as I only see them set to nil in the code notificationcode notifiedobjecttype notifiedobjectid createtable mailboxernotifications id serial force cascade do t tstring type ttext body tstring subject default tstring sendertype tinteger senderid tinteger conversationid tboolean draft default false tstring notificationcode tstring notifiedobjecttype tinteger notifiedobjectid tstring attachment tdatetime updatedat null false tdatetime createdat null false tboolean global default false tdatetime expires tindex conversationid name indexmailboxernotificationsonconversationid tindex notifiedobjectid notifiedobjecttype name indexmailboxernotificationsonnotifiedobjectidandtype tindex notifiedobjecttype notifiedobjectid name mailboxernotificationsnotifiedobject tindex senderid sendertype name indexmailboxernotificationsonsenderidandsendertype tindex type name indexmailboxernotificationsontype end I had to read the source code to do it I found this line makes it work so easy ActiveStorage support for attachment upload would be preferable Right now we have to keep Carrierwave around simply because mailboxer needs it
