Hi Ive notice the heavy use of new HttpClient throughout both the Controller and Service layer Is this something you would have the appetite for fixing via IHttpClientFactory Happy to submit the pull requests Thanks Justin Hi Relaying this here Since a few days Office users do not receive Bitwarden mails anymore Mails are even not available in SPAM box Of course it used to work perfectly A tricky situation especially in companies using Office Could we dig into this Many thx Please do not submit feature requests The Community Forums has a section for submitting voting for and discussing product feature requests I only have two Yubikeys for step verificationYubiKey OTP After recover from my previous backupI migrated my installation from one machine to another my premium account license is missing and two step verification is disabled Im sure I followed the backup instruction and configurations related to step verification are included in my backup Because once I uploaded my premium license after migration those two yubikeys are correctly configured So it seems that once my premium account expired in my example I lost this license during migration premium functions are disabled including YubiKey OTP which means my step verifications are invalid Again this is my only step verification method My question is Is there something wrong with my backup which makes me lost my license Is this a bug When no available step verification method exists disable step verification and you can login ONLY with your password Hi Similar to issue it would be good to allow the same for the letsencrypt certbot container could you please add a bind IP question during the bitwardensh install part in the letsencrypt section And something similar with or storing the information for later in the previous step or maybe instead making it part of the dockercomposeyml Thanks Aaron Im trying to setup with bitwarden my Firefox profiles accounts but when a click on the plus sign topright it shows me the first account I created for the first profile Anyone knows how to use on such cases Since RHEL Fedora and Centos have all dropped support for docker in favor of podman I believe it is pertinent to make sure that Bitwarden is able to run on podman Currently it does not run on podman even with docker commands aliased to podman Is there any way to renew the ssl certificates without using bitwardensh restart Also is there a way to schedule those restarts in a good way say each month to get the certificates updated automatically I have the team installation in an ubuntu instance Hello dear colleagues since hours Bitwarden installationstartup on my Bionic server fails for some reason never worked thus far No other daemons like apache are listening on the same ports everything is ran as sudo and followed by BitwardenDocker official docs Resources with not much running should be sufficient GB RAM vCores GB SSD of which is used and are open of course and URL is correct All packages are uptodate Still hard to sense a pattern here especially since Im also getting resource not available basherrors after some while ie retrying without rebooting the server Its never able to create all containers Terminal logs of a whole fromscratch installation including Docker Gonna test in a local VM Docker Windows later in the morning anyone got an idea still Appreciate any help I can get Best regards ceeazy Hello there I have downloaded the latest version of bitwarden and installed it however when I want to configure the smtp settings and I want to send email for the admin

approx months ago it worked first time no issues Recently we have noticed that it has stopped sending emails for example admin logins new accounts I have installed swaks in the api container and can send emails I see no dns lookups when the mail server was an FQDN application and docker logs show nothing remotely related to sending emails apart from the back and forth for the html admin authentication request Even rolled admin and api back to no difference
