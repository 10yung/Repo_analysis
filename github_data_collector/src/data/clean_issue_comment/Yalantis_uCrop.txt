Thanks for this great library it has been really helpful to me However on the crop page I have a requirement to not move the image on dragging it So I thought it would be better to give an option to disable the gesture in the GestureCropImageView when required Do you want to request a feature or report a bug Submitting an improvement What is the current behavior No gesture enabledisable control to the user no way to disable gestures like scroll to translate and doubletap to zoom What is the expected behavior To provide the options to enabledisable gesture controls Pull request for this issue Exposing options to enabledisable gestures in GestureCropImageView when required Referencing issue According to this fact that for picking an image from the gallery doesnt require any permission I removed this gettiting storage permission My app crashes in some devices when try to open an Activity The problem does not always occur only on some devices Override protected void onCreateBundle

problem Do you want to request a feature or report a bug What is the current behavior What is the expected behavior If the current behavior is a bug please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem Please attach any image files URL and stack trace that can be used to reproduce the bug Which versions of uCrop and which Android API versions are affected by this issue Did this work in previous versions of uCrop Thanks the library it is good it helps me to slove my project s problem My english is not very good sorry about it My project need to crop many pictures so i need to crop one by one So i have a question how can i store the pics state which i can restore when i need to crop it I try to getImageMatrix i can get a matrix object and when i set it back by setImageMatrix also invalidate it But it does not work So i want to know how can i store the images statemay be scale translate and so on so i can restore the state when i crop them one by one Hope you can reply me Thanks you sir This PR sends back the angle of rotate through the callback and then the results extras It allows the app to know what rotation angle the user chose I use this as I need to store the offsets and angles so the image can be cropped correctly on the server Do you have some plans to adapt android Q
