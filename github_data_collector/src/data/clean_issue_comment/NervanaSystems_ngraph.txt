In NNP we do a slightly different topological sort in order to get certain ops to the edges of the graph This change allows us to replace the sorting algorithm used by Functiongetorderedops which is used by the pass manager Fix build error on macOS In file included from srcngraphruntimecpucpuexecutorcpp In file included from srcngraphruntimecpucpuexecutorhpp In file included from srcngraphruntimecpucpuruntimecontexthpp srccontribmlirruntimecpucpuruntimehpp error flexible array members are a C feature WerrorWc extensions int t shapeAndStrides error generated Add provenance tags during upgradedowngrade passes which convert ops to another opset This is still work in progress although its already possible to import an ONNX model containing inputs with dynamic shapes
