this is not very exciting but since I wrote it I thought Id share it and let you decide whether itd be of any use very simple uses curl instead wget and compresses directly to disk using xz it will also die on failures and allow transfers to resume although thats probably not all that useful for many failures since itll have to restart if xz doesnt know what size the original data is pulldatashgz
