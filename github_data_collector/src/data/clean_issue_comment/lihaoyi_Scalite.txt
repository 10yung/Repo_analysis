Do you think it would be possible to insert at the end of lines that are not followed by an indented block This would allow the infamous postfix operator problem to go away scala import sysprocess mkdir test printlnDone Different from scala mkdir test printlnDone now interpreted as an argument to Another refinement would be that if the next line starts with an indented operator it has the same semantics as if the whole block was surrounded by parentheses in normal Scala scala val r ie scala val r
