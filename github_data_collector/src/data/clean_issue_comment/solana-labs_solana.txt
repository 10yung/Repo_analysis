get and show properties solana balance get and show balance solana getepochinfo get and show epochinfo solana get get and show config solana showvalidators get and show validators Proposed Solution Make getshow implicit for all properties Add aliases and mark the old versions as deprecated solana balance solana epochinfo solana config solana validators Problem Validators frequently run into this error on boot Unable to access ledger path Os code kind NotFound message No such file or directory This is because this line here assumes that the ledger directory is already created But this is often not the case especially when a validator is joining a cluster for the first time Compounding problem our validator documents do not instruct validators to run mkdir LEDGERPATH before boot Proposed Solution mkdir the specified ledger directory in solanavalidator if the directory doesn t exist Problem Theres been a recurring theme of our examples breaking because of changes to the RPC API or runtime behavior when we update the stable testnet to a new release We often dont realize this issue until a developer from the community brings this to our attention The usual timeline of events Breaking change to RPC API is merged into solana master branch Breaking change gets moved into a release branch Stable testnet gets updated to the latest release Things start breaking Live Examples fail for various reasons unexpected api response transactions start failing etc solanaweb js CI prevents any new PRs from merging until breaking changes addressed Proposed Solution Some work has already been done to improve stability of example dapps For example we have already started pinning dapp examples to particular network releases which ensures that developers who run examples locally will not run into issues However live examples continue to break because they point at our stable net In order to prepare for an upcoming network release the web and examples repos could have a CI flow for specific network release versions against a local cluster We could have a release checklist for updating stable testnet Announce in Discord to developers the next version will be deployed Prepare web sdk for next release Prepare examples for next release Update stable testnet Release web Update examples Problem We have no way to detect breaking changes to the JSONRPC API through CI right now This makes it easy to move quickly and break the api but makes it hard to enforce a process for raising awareness to these changes Proposed Solution WIP When new stake is delegated to a validator its confusing that solana showvalidators makes no reference to that stake until the next epoch And even at the next epoch solana showvalidators doesnt show the amount of pervalidator stake that is still warming up or cooling down Also note that solana showstakehistory shows stake warmupcooldown for the entire cluster but gives no pervalidator breakdown Consider improving solana showvalidators by adding these new columns to display the missing pervalidator stake warmupcooldown information This will likely require new RPC APIs Problem PR was mistakenly closed Summary of
