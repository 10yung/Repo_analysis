So far this is only available as a preview Note The Draft Pull Request API is currently available for developers to preview I never ran git hub setup before Today I encounter rate limiting and decide that I want to authenticate Just running git hub A prlist initiates the process of generating one It starts a dialog with me within which it asks me for my github pw I copy and paste it into the dialog window and now everything hangs Retrying but it does not behave better I mean it freezes the window At least I can unfreeze it with C In my third try I did start with git hub setup That went well and after that everything went well So the only bug seems to be in the inputoutput handling of the A option Let me know if you cannot reproduce or have questions Greets mergemethod sha committitle commitmessage I had problems with make doc swim toman docgithubswim manman github perlsperl binswim IOFileIO x d a f around line No name given for document POD document had syntax errors at perlsperl binpod man line Makefile recipe for target manman github failed make manman github Error Installed git hub is commit a b f a f c f be ec When I redirect stdout for a specific repository git hub forks exits with status For a different repository the status is When not redirecting stdout the problematic repository is not a problem anymore Removing the gitdir option I used and the behaviour is all the same The CWD is outside any git checkout As such I am suspecting that git hub forks has an issue with the repository itself and not the local checkout for it Trying the command on a different machine and I see the same issue Something in the intersection of the specific repository mattijkconsio and stdout a terminal vs redirected to a file for git hub forks is trouble Here is my session for one the boxes still all with gitdir akutagetarlDataMyMirror echo TERM xterm akutagetarlDataMyMirror E L git gitdir dataMirrortclstore sourcegit hub forks raw flightawareTclProDebug echo akutagetarlDataMyMirror E L git gitdir dataMirrortclstore sourcegit hub forks raw mattijkconsio echo akutagetarlDataMyMirror E git gitdir dataMirrortclstore sourcegit hub forks raw flightawareTclProDebug echo apnadkarniTclProDebug h nzaTclProDebug akutagetarlDataMyMirror E git gitdir dataMirrortclstore sourcegit hub forks raw mattijkconsio echo The git hub version command reports According to the tags a version was made in I suspect that libgithub line was not updated at the time Hi First of all your gitsubrepo is just great and works like a charm I have installed github under Windows Git Bash by git clone bingithub echo source bingithubrc bashrc Now any git hub command reports cUsersoleksiybingithublibgithubdbashbash line extbashpluslibbashbash No such file or directory My idea was that default permissions under bin might be insufficient so I placed github in a place similar to where gitsubrepo is installed at and gitsubrepo works fine and changed source instruction in bashrc as appropriate Now bashrc looks as follows source dProgram Filesportablegitscriptsgitsubreporc source dProgram Filesportablegitscriptsgithubrc Now Windows Git Bash at launch reports bash cd d nFilesportablegitscriptsgithub No such file or directory bash cUsersoleksiyshareenablecompletionsh No such file or directory And git hub anything reports git hub is not a git command See git help Will appreciate any suggestions on the above I realize this may be a major headache depending on how this project is designed and the web APIs these services offer so this is more of an inquiry than an outright request How viable would it be to decouple the web API schema from this git extension to swap out when hosting on another similar system is detected BTW just saw your talk on github and gitsubrepo Both are quite impressive Great job Thanks This pull request is a part of This thing renders as thing See git hub issue ingydotnetgitsubrepo Im trying to sell subrepos to move from an existing mercurial setup
