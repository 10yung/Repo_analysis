First off love that someone recommended this little gem of a tool to me I do a lot of research and have to monitor events taking place in literally all corners of the earth This is helping automate a lot of my monitoring tasks and I already have well over agents running on my server Absolutely love it Today Ive been creating RSS feeds for all the sites I read I got most of them down but one is giving me some problems The site is small and it looks like they dont use the greatest of all Class management This is the site in question Im specifically trying to watch that Reports page Using css sqsblockcontent p strong it also is picking up a lot of useless text such as FEATURED REPORTS and GNSS attacks are emerging as a viable disruptive strategic threat This is because this site literally has no classes for different content Is there anyway to filter this down even further Similar issues happen if I try to retrieve the description text I tried a couple RSS Maker sites to maybe get some ideas if I was missing something but those were messing up too Overall the website is just poorly coded obviously but would there be anyway to navigate this This should fix Ubuntu only has jq which cannot be detected by JqAgent because of the output format of jq version in that ancient version If you stopped the docker images the Job is only stuck in the database The only way to remove it is to manually delete the database row get a shell inside the docker container replace huginn with the name or id of the container docker exec it huginn binbash source the environment file source env get a rails console bundle exec rails console inside the rails console delete the job DelayedJobwherelockedat IS NOT NULL AND lockedby IS NOT NULL AND failedat IS NULLdestroyall Originally posted by dsander in dsander After a few months of stable running this problem appeared again this morning hundreds of jobs were stuck I tried your method and it was really useful There are already three buttons in the Background Jobs page Can you add another button to execute this command In this case when users encounter similar situations they do not have to log in to the VPS every time to execute the code Thanks Hi I really like Huginn But I have a small config issue that I dont really understand at the top of my head and sadly dont have the time to investigate on my own right now I run Huginn in k s And the config looks something like apiVersion appsv kind Deployment metadata name huginn namespace monitoring spec replicas spec containers name huginn env name DOMAIN value somelocalfqdn name FORCESSL value false name PORT value image huginnbuilderhuginnpr ports name http containerPort apiVersion v kind Service metadata name huginn namespace monitoring labels k sapp huginn spec ports name http port targetPort http protocol TCP selector k sapp huginn I removed a lot of cruft that shouldnt be relevant here And the problem is when I just apply this Huginn overrides the port to be the service port Which is not what I want And also just doesnt work because the container doesnt run as privileged so it cant bind on port to begin with My workaround so far is to edit the yaml config set the service port to start Huginn then change it back to and reapply which only modifies the service It works but its the first container where I have this issue Thanks for the help Alexis Hello Im fairly new to Huginn I have noticed many jobs do not run on schedule Is there anything I can do to debug whats happening I have ensured that I have set up the right timezone because the date of now in events is correct when I trigger them myself I have seen comments about a Job Management page but I cant see it I have seen issues talking about admin users but I didnt see any choices I had to use the invitation code to create an account Im using the docker hub huginnhuginn image with those variables setup HUGINNDATABASENAME HUGINNDATABASEUSERNAME HUGINNDATABASEPASSWORD HUGINNDATABASEADAPTER

Paris Thanks for any help Hi Any ideas why this happens Im using multithreaded Huginn the exact processes that hangs varies Whats the best way to kill all running jobs that have been running for longer than hour See attached image img width altScreenshot at src Hi Im trying to post alerts to Gotify and would like to dynamically specify a priority value The Gotify API expects one for creating a message but Im having a problem specifying one My Gotify Poster agent is set up as follows posturl expectedreceiveperiodindays contenttype json method post payload title title message message priority priority headers XGotifyKey credential gotifyaccesstoken emitevents true outputmode merge nomerge false The credential definitely works If I remove the priority the agent works but then I cant use this for different classes of notification If the priority is still set it sends it as a string but the Gotify API wants an integer I had a look here but asobject didnt work for me This is what I get back with the priority field set message This is a test message title Testing priority body error Bad Request errorCode errorDescription json cannot unmarshal string into Go struct field MessageExternalpriority of type int status headers ContentLength ContentType applicationjson Date Sat Jan GMT Any thoughts on how I can ensure that priority is sent via the post as an integer not a string Huginn is great for automation which begs the question how can I automate Huginn I know there is the CommandAgent to enabledisable Agents and update configuration but what about creating agents and updating configuration from an outside system For example I have a few workflows where several agents feed into an email digest and each of these agents is similar but with slightly different config an example of one workflow each watches for changes from a different URL So every time I want to watch a different URL for example I need to clone an agent change some config and hook it up to the main workflow This is manual and errorprone work that Id like to avoid if possible It would be cool if I could do this via API or even a bookmarklet Here I see some logic in a GETonly API like Pinboard has which makes it easy to interact with via URLs and bookmarklets Basically Im more looking to spark a discussion here has there ever been any discussion around this I may have missed and how do people work around such issues currently One thought that I just had what about extending CommandAgent to create new agents with a template for config or being able to clone agents then I could maybe do what I want by using the Webhook agent Command agent WebsiteAgent has trouble to access websites with DDoS protection by Cloudflare Example website adult Command curl gives me Checking your browser message with error curl Lv HTTP Service Temporarily Unavailable The error log of a dry run is also attached itcerrorlog Any browsers like firefox IE or chrome can open the website with no problem but have to wait for a few seconds to get pass the Checking your browser page So is there a way for websiteagent to act like a browser Hi I need to scrap a web page which is only accessible after using the internal search engine on website homepage So I need to select the text box on the homepage click on the Go button to go the page which I want to scrap Is it possible Thanks a lot in advance
