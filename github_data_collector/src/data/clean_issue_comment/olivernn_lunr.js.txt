But how to get all data as result Search what char would get me all data I need this for pagination For page you search something to get all dataset as result Now you use for loop through only get to recordsthen break for loop For page you perform same search again you should get the same result set as last time but you this time you use for loop from to Because offset is you skip first and so on For page x you perform same search again you should get the same result set as last time but this time you use for loop from x to x Because offset is x you skip first x I want get first record page base on whatever search result search what can I get the whole dataset as result second I want get page record offset starting from next record and so on So far look like lunr only can search keywords No pagination build in I have a way to work around it idxsearch or idxsearch or idxsearch search empty or space or space you will get all dataset as result For page idxsearch get all dataset as result Now you use for loop through only get to recordsthen break for loop For page idxsearch search again you should get the same result set as last time but you this time you use for loop from to Because offset is you skip first and so on For page x you idxsearch search again you should get the same result set as last time but this time you use for loop from x to x Because offset is x you skip first x Hi I see that lunr uses BM algorithm for scoring which is independent of the proximity of words in the document But while searching for multiple words is their proximity taken into account ie if I search for integration test would the ranking algorithm consider how close the two words are located in the document If not how can I achieve this while querying Is it the only scoring algorithm supported by lunr Sorry for so vague description If you open and start typing aaaaaaaaa in search form the browser will lockup for at least a few seconds It reproduces both in Chromium and Firefox Im not a JS developer and today just figured out that we are using your technology but Im not sure if this issue is a drawback of your library or we just using it incorrectly All our frontend developers have disappeared and there is nobody to help us I use oboejs and streamjsonjs to receive already parsered json object one at a time I need to create lunr index idx add one json object at a time the whole document is not available yet until the json stream ended I need something like this How to var idx lunrfunction thisfieldtitle thisfieldbody not add doc yet somewhere when stream json event fired when one json object received streamjsonon receivedonedoc function doc will add one object at a time will repeat until last object reached idxadddoc Hello I set up a search engine on a JSON file I used lunrjs My only problem is the search with OR on fields which have multi terms for example name Jean Paul SARR OR Age I would like it to return only all lines with name John Paul SARR and those with Age Thank you in advance for your help sorry for my bad english lunrversion I have a blog which contains a few pages with the characters or in their title For example searching for php raises an exception which forces me to return an empty search result set while the string php exists in a few titles and category labels Is there a way to let lunr consider command characters such as as normal characters in case of error ie to also return a result set with the closest approximate search Hi there I am using lunr for a private wiki and love the library Is there a way to find similar documents like discussed in this article Regards Dietmar useable usable
