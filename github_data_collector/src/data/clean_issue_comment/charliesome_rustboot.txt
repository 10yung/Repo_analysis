This pull request has the same content as pull request but is from a different branch since I want to use the master branch in my fork for further development Sorry about the confusion Whats this error changes to create compatibility with rustc v charliesome could you please review this when you have time When trying to build the kernel with v of the rustc compiler I recieve the error rustc O target i intellinux cratetype lib o maino emit obj mainrs error requires sized langitem error aborting due to previous error Makefile recipe for target maino failed make maino Error I believe this has to do with changes to the language and I have made changes which allow it to complile Rust cant compile truly freestanding positiondependent code It attempts to access global variables through GLOBALOFFSETTABLE Currently it seems the best workaround is to compile emitted LLVM bitcode with clang ffreestanding However optimizations made by clang could break things When running make it spits out this error message rustc O target i intellinux lib o maino c mainrs error no item found for tydesc error no item found for opaque error no item found for tyvisitor error no item found for freeze error no item found for send error no item found for closureexchangemalloc error aborting due to previous errors make maino Error It seems dependent on some part of the rust runtime maybe Im running rustc version rustc host x appledarwin any tips you can give I followed the steps given on READMEmd After all the prerequisites I cloned the rustboot exported all the PATH echo PATH homesagarsakrebinutilsi elfbinhomesagarsakrebinutilsbinhomesagarsakrerustbinbinoptqemubin binoptqemubinhomenithinbinusrlocalsbinusrlocalbinusrsbinusrbinsbinbinusrgames I got error while make sagarsakresagarvm cd rustboot sagarsakresagarvm rustboot ls LICENSEtxt linkerld loaderasm mainrs Makefile READMEmd runtimeasm zerors sagarsakresagarvm rustboot make nasm o loaderbin f bin loaderasm nasm f elf o runtimeo runtimeasm rustc O target i intellinux lib o maino c mainrs error no item found for sized error aborting due to previous error make maino Error can you please tel me where I am goin wrong rust allowctypes nostd nocore mod zero enum Color Black Blue Green Cyan Red Pink Brown LightGray DarkGray LightBlue LightGreen LightCyan LightRed LightPink Yellow White fn rangelo uint hi uint it fnuint let mut iter lo while iter hi ititer iter unsafe fn printscreeni uint ch u xb i as mut u ch unsafe fn setcolori uint foreground Color background Color xb i as mut u background as u foreground as u unsafe fn clearscreenforeground Color background Color range i setcolori foreground background printscreeni fn ischarch u bool return ch ch ch ch fn iswhitespacech u bool return ch pub fn lens str uint let mut i uint while ischars i i return i unsafe fn printnumnumber uint let mut j let mut i number while i let sym i as u printscreenj sym j i i nomangle pub unsafe fn main let string str Hello World let length lenstring clearscreenWhite Blue range length i printscreeni string i as u printnumlength This program should return ello first printing Hello and then printing However it just prints if I change the length variable to it will print out ello I am confused at what is happening maybe someone with deeper asm knowledge could explain
