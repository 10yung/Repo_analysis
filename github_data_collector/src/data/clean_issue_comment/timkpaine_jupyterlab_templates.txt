Hi timkpaine thanks for your work on this super useful extension I am currently working on a Notebook which uses multiple data files that I cant get using any API and some Python modules I have written to keep the workflow more userfriendly while not polluting the notebook with stuff that could confuse the users Id love to be able to include all of these files in a template It only has a single ipynb file I think a great way to do this would be to support the following extensions too tar targz zip Essentially we could put those files alongside the ipynb templates and if they are selected extract them instead of simply copying them Id be happy to contribute this in a PR if that sounds like something youd welcome
