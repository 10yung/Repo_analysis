I noticed one of the tracking companies started using a different domain than they did before It is not on your list right now Is there a preferred way to suggest that host for inclusion or should I just make a pull request If so are there any requirements eg specific branch comments etc Checked the wiki and the existing issues Apologies if this has been discussed before I looked at over a dozen related issues before opening this Any chance you could add an optionswitch to updateHostsFilepy so that just the list hostnames no localhostip else are listed This is useful for BSD pf tables that will do name resolution itself we simply block all the IPs in that table the names resolve to Hello Ive noticed three domains that popped on my Pi when I was mucking about with Windows apps The first two are related to ads and the third Im guessing to be background inapp telemetry Blocking all three successfully blocked ads and did not appear to affect the apps I was using adversely in any way adbrokermpdsemicrosoftcom s adduplexcom rawtelemetryeastservicebuswindowsnet It looks like adduplex is specific and that there may be s s though Ive only seen s in action Since the domain itself belongs to the ad company AdDuplex perhaps it should be blocked entirely Would be more appropriate for this Cheers The list below lists domains that are mostly still active for the OSXShlayer trojan landing and CnC domains read more about it here Found a page that seems like Google is bypassing the Little Snitch rules based on these hosts From what I can tell there is javascript SOMEWHERE that seems to be creating a proxy then sending all requests through it vs using system host or being blocked by Little Snitch Hello I understand the priority is to report to one of the upstreams but the only one specializing in tracking domains I found is which says Unfortunately its probably not worth submitting anything at the moment spam has taken over mails a month to sift through even with automated checking is just too much extra Fuckin spammers Anywhere else I can report probably tracking domain One of my android apps goes to cc a eapisplkmobilecom which per my research probably belongs to The DatatoEverything Platform Bring data to every question decision and action Or should I create an MR here Is it best to block cc a eapisplkmobilecom or splkmobilecom lookutnldncom lookkfioplkncom lookichlnkcom lookudncoelncom lookfjfilncom lookufinklncom hlokqertewrtcom lookopsklncom lookichlnkcom lookufinklncom lookutndlncom lookdjfilncom lookkfiopklncom lookudncoelncom goacamimbucom zulur qqnet adsadcentercom cdn adcentercom cdn adcentercom ads adcentercom adsadcentercom adsscriptadcentercom wwwadcentercom these are closely associated and or interacting directly with adcenter pwwysydhcom piz ohhujogicom prjcqcom pocofhcom npmpecdcom pt nacom pwdplzcom pohs oomcom ps uxcom jadservepostreleasecom docaznet prjcqcom eserverbidcom d resfoavrttcloudfrontnet payae moon com pohs oomcom all ptrs for adsadcentercom ec euwest computeamazonawscom ec euwest computeamazonawscom ec compute amazonawscom ec apsoutheast computeamazonawscom ec apsoutheast computeamazonawscom ec euwest computeamazonawscom ec uswest computeamazonawscom ec uswest computeamazonawscom ec uswest computeamazonawscom ec uswest computeamazonawscom Hi Could you please add also an extension for blocking online game websites Thanks Hi guys not an issue rather a user question Looks like Opera browser with VPN on ignores my hosts file I can access sites which are blocked in my hosts file Is it normal for Opera VPN or any VPN service to ignore hosts file Thanks Found an interesting link Network administrators may configure their networks as follows to signal that their local DNS resolver implemented special features that make the network unsuitable for DoH DNS queries for the A and AAAA records for the domain useapplicationdnsnet must respond with either a response code other than NOERROR such as NXDOMAIN nonexistent domain or SERVFAIL or respond with NOERROR but return no A or AAAA records DoH will be enabled by default end of this month So in short including useapplicationdnsnet in a blocklist will not enable DoH in Firefox browsers I created this ticket just to bring this to attention and discuss if needed Im not seeking any particular action feel free to close any time I noticed PiHole is blocking this domain by default For my home network I think I will be blocking this domain as well mainly to ensure adsnasty stuff continue to be blocked for my parents
