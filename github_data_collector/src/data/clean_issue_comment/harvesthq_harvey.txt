but seems dead Hi harvesthq jkintscher need any maintainers I was getting an error running Harvey in a browser environment without using a module loader So I added this at the top of the outmost anonymous closure var State mediaQueryList TYPEUNDEFINED undefined That fixed the error I am happy to open a PR if you prefer Thanks Respondjs is required for bootstrap to work with IE From Internet Explorer and are also supported however please be aware that some CSS properties and HTML elements are not fully supported by these browsers In addition Internet Explorer requires the use of Respondjs to enable media query support However if we add Respondjs we get a Javascript error from Harvey User Agent Mozilla compatible MSIE Windows NT Trident SLCC NET CLR NET CLR NET CLR Timestamp Mon Feb UTC Message Object doesnt support this property or method Line Char Code URI Hi I added some files to the demo folder to help web developers understand to which kind of device theyre designing depending on the screen size Its a simple guide but I think it would really help beginners Sarah Itd be nice to have a packagejson and bowerjson in here so we can painlessly use Harvey in our projects Additionally itd be great to support requirejs and commonJS via a umdjs wrapper If you guys are open to this let me know and I can work on this myself See this issue crossposted in Enquire
