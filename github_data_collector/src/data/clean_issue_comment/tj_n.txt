Hi First thing to mention Im in highly locked down environment with extensive change control The preflight check failed for sudo n installing nodev curl Failed to connect to nodejsorg port Connection timed out Error download preflight failed for If I curl to the url I can hit it fine Are there other urls I need to allow for in out proxy to pass the preflight check I also tried to short cut the install by downloading the tar and putting it into the cache However I couldnt find the correct location Im still trawling the code to find out the urls I need to bypass or where I need to put the file A pointer would be great thanks Installing node also installs npm While this is a reasonable default it is confusing andor annoying if you have installed a different version of npm than included with node It would be nice to support installing only node and not npm as well As a bonus this makes the install much faster A possible implementation would be to use rsync as used in nvh for this custom install It does add a dependency on another command but only for this optional mode You would optin to the behaviour with the preserve option short flag p or make it the default by setting NPRESERVENPM As per nvh Related issues The most visited issue by far in the traffic stats is n now works on Windows Windows Subsystem For Linux If enough people find that this works for them the docs READMEmd could be changed to reflect this Windows version Windows Home Version Build Version of N n version output How I installed N Start up windows subsystem for linux bash prompt by typing Win key followed by wsl Then install using the following sequence sudo aptget install nodejslegacy sudo aptget install npm sudo npm install g n sudo n lts sudo npm install npmlts g sudo chown R USERid gn USER homeaalconfig IMPORTANT NOTE change the name in the path when using the chown command above to reflect your home directory in WSL Then exit the shell and start it up again After restarting the WSL bash window node version v npm version Tried installing other node versions using sudo n install latest And got node version v npm version Similar to old issue solved I note that after install n and use to switch between versions the firewall ask for permissions Because Im using also ExpressJs for an API Rest The msg is Do you want the application node to accept incoming network connections I try to re install node and its work normal but if I switch with n the problem start again Using Manjaro Linux XFCE Edition Installed node manually then used npm to install n Have since used n to install several versions of node Everything seems to be working including switching node versions as long as I do sudo but I figure thats given I do get this error however cp cannot overwrite nondirectory usrlocalshareman with directory usrlocalnversions shareman Indeed this is because usrlocalshareman is a symbolic link to usrlocalman Not sure if this is applicable to Arch in general or just Manjaro Again things still seem to be working all that seems to be faltering is the copying of the man page and thats fine really Nonetheless thought it might be worth reporting
