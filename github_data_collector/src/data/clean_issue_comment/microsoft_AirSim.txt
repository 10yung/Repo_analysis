Hi I have a camera with x resolution configured and use simGetImages in a loop getting fps All good Now I added a second camera with all the same characteristics but a very high resolution x This is to mimic a still image function After I call simGetImages on the high res camera once the main camera loop framerate drops from fps to fps While a drop during highres image capture is expected it never recovers from this and stays at fps Does anybody has an idea what is happening here Peter Hi all Im hoping someone can help me I am trying to publish images from AirSim with ROS using the droneimagerawpy script It appears to run correctly and publishes data verified by rostopic echo The problem is with the image data I have received data in MATLAB but the data part of the image message says that it is a x uint string I havent changed anything in the python script or in the settings file In fact I am trying this with the default settingsjson file Does anyone know the image format or how to process this data in MATLAB to get it into an RGB format Hi People I am using v Windows Neighbourhood small urban neighbourhood block in Car mode with a Nvidia Quadro M M My setting file is

pfm img pngimg pfm img pngimg pfm dTime s dDisplacement m Speed dDisplacementdTime ms But I am getting ms So there is something wrong After some tests I was running in another computer with a Nvidia and the DTime was lower and the speed was matching properly Thats mean that the kind of GPU affect to the results but in theory it should not Why Can I modify something in my settings file to avoid this problem Thanks in advance guys Hello Ive seen docsissues talking about running a simulation on Windows and running Python API on a Linux machine Is it possible to do the same for a car simulation I havent found much information in the docs on how to set it up So far I have tried the following Python selfclient airsimCarClientipxxxxxxxxx selfclientconfirmConnection However I am unable to confirm the connection WARNINGtornadogeneralConnect error on fd ETIMEDOUT I have attempted turning off Firewall on the Windows PC A few questions relating to the issue Is the Python client connecting to the server using TCP When simulation starts in Unreal is the port open automatically Add support for ArduPilots Rover vehicle in SITL Based on which restructures Car vehicle in AirSim First commits The last commit is from with a compilation fix Usage instructions here Using Unreal PX Log Viewer SITL simpleflight PX Log Viewer wont connect to AirSim followed instructions but quadcopter inside PX

COMOBLACT Hi all I am attempting to use an IMU in Computer Vision Mode The main purpose is to freely able to change perspective while achieving accurate IMU data so I can evaluate my visualinertial SLAM algorithm To enable IMU I have added IMU in the settingsjson as shown below I can see that the IMU is enabled in the AirSim but Im only getting the Gyroscope values angular values and no Accelerometer linear values What am I doing wrong SeeDocsAt SettingsVersion SimMode ComputerVision Recording RecordOnMove false RecordInterval Cameras CameraName ImageType PixelsAsFloat false Compress

Airsim only as a frontend visualization tool and use Gazebo backend for modeling and physics reason being Ive a lot of custom plugins developed in Gazebo at the moment Question Is there a way to achieve this in Airsim If yes how would one go about interfacing gazebo data with Airsim Hello madratman I hope and think that youll be the one to help me I am currently working on a project where I need an controllable gimbal camera but with the additive of zoom function I found out that I can zoom in and out of a view by altering field of view parameter of the camera Therefore I have already done that in airSim Now in my version when FPV mode is entered with F key the camera orientation can be controlled with WASDQE keys and its fov can be controlled with the arrow keys Anyways now I want to be able to do this using the API you provided The camera orientation can already be configured using the simSetCameraOrientation So I started working on declaring and using a function called simSetCameraFov that function as its name implies but couldnt reach a point yet So please your help would be appreciated I will be working on it and I would like to post a merge request for an API update the manual fpv gimbal control so the community can get use of it Read This First If you are reporting a bug Make sure to write all reproduction steps Include full error message in text form Search issues for error message before filing issue Attach screenshot if applicable Include code to run if applicable If you have question Add clear and concise title Add OS AirSim version Python version Unreal version if applicable Include context on what you are trying to achieve Include details of what you already did to find answers Whats better than filing issue Filing a pull request Remove above before filing the issue I want to connect between Airsim on Window and PX on Ubuntu I found all over how to connect between Airsim on Window and PX on Ubuntu but there no idea Screenshot from Im waiting like this on Ubuntu I have no idea which ip port to change so i changed all of ip and port What should i change also is it possible connect between PCs
