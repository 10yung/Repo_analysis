 File profiling tracing timerspy line in Timer clock timeclock AttributeError module time has no attribute clock Seems need change function clock on timeperfcounter or timeprocesstime my code run with only second and then it used at least s by profiling is something wrong with it In my use case there is an algorithm that ends up stalling after running for a long time I would like to use liveprofiling to find the exact cause when the stall happens It would be inconvenient to dump and post analyze since the stall happens sporadically and restarting the run is relatively expensive The issue Im facing with this tool is that the profiling updates stop after a while even though the main program is running as normal One work around I found was to run in remoteprofile mode where even if the profiling updates stop I can restart it again by reconnecting the viewer However repeating doing this eventually causes the below exception Exception in thread Thread Traceback most recent call

singleversionexternallymanaged compile while running profilerdumppathtofile It says AttributeError TracingProfiler object has no attribute dump I have to save profiling results can someone provide a solution alternatives My personal use case was that I was profiling a service The main thread would be reading from Kombu all the time so the interface was mostly showing operations from the main thread and not from the request threads which were the ones I was interested in could you download this and check profilerpy theres no dump method in there for some reason theres mismatch between github master branch and latest pypi package Wheels are very convenient especially when one wants to install with missing compilation requirements Hello is there anyway that I can profile a flask app with profiling timeclockgettimeclkid Return the time of the specified clock clkid Availability Unix New in version timeclockgettime is only used in Unixcan you have some method to add support to MacOS
