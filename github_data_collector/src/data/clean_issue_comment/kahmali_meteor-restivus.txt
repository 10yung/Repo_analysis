We need the corsHeader configurations for CORS so that we can add more header value for cors By default AccessControlAllowHeaders is fixed To close connection we require our customers to explicitly do it via Connection header like so curl i H Connection close This is not a standard expected behaviour and creates unnecessary additional load on the servers Please see this is a pretty urgent fix as it crashes whole Meteor server if bcrypt is not set It may be good to wrap the auth stuff in a try catch Sorry my coffeescript is not that great If you create a user by another means eg Google login accountsgoogle and a user tries to call rest login route it crashes the server loginWithPassword id a d f c c b f b I createdAt I email some email I emails address some email verified true I dateUserInvited null I invitingResourceID null I completedSetup true I profile channels Object I services resume loginTokens password reset Object I acceptedLicense true I dateLicenseAccepted I dateInitialSetup test W STDERR UsersadamginsburgDocumentsdevelopmentbuzzy nodemodulesbcryptbcryptjs W STDERR cbnew Errordata and hash must be strings W STDERR W STDERR W STDERR TypeError cb is not a function W STDERR at UsersadamginsburgDocumentsdevelopmentbuzzy nodemodulesbcryptbcryptjs W STDERR at combinedTickCallback internalprocessnexttickjs W STDERR at processtickDomainCallback internalprocessnexttickjs Note user had tried to reset their password so had reset not bcrypt ie password reset To solve this you need to check for the bycrypt and not just authenticatingUserservicespassword ie if not authenticatingUserservicespasswordbcrypt throw new MeteorError Unauthorized Using to test mup deployed and getting Bad Request error Works fine when running test version on separate port but gives error on deployed ApiaddRouteqb authRequired false get function consolelogthisurlParams return thisurlParams post function data var body thisbodyParams ifMeteorisDevelopment bodyeventNotifications JSONparsebodyeventNotifications var params urlParams thisurlParams queryParams thisqueryParams bodyParams body qbhandleHookbody Meteorcalltestcollectionnewtest data params err res if err alerterr else success consolelogreturn from client id array consolelogres return params Can onLogInFailure method or similar please be added to handle a login failure if it does not exist aready If it exists please enlighten It seems the issue here has not been answered Use case I am looking to keep a tally of the number of times a particular usernames login attempts failed Will this be added on simplerest as well or does such exist in simplerest already Is mutual or two way certificate authentication like the one used in soap webservices going to be added to REST and made one of the security standards across all modern programming languages in particular in restivus I feel basic authentication even when used with tokens is not as secure as mutual or two way certificate authentication that we have in soap webservices In my case I am looking to call the REST api both from the browser client and nonbrowser client that will do a lot of processing millions of POSTs in a single thread and another nonbrowser client that will do millions of GETs in a single thread Is mutual or two way certificate authentication in the pipeline at least in restivus For example if you have enforced email verification then you need to use validation after login This patch adds this feature Hello Ive been searching around on this issue and havent found a good answer I hope Im not doing something silly I have a simple program that periodically generates a block of text data and I need to pass that data to a meteor application and parse the weird text format there Im using curl to send the data to my meteor server something like curl d foo nbar H ContentType textplain The problem is that in the request handler thisbodyParams is always an empty object If other content types are used restivus tries to parse the data but this doesnt always capture every byte Notably if ContentType header is removed curl defaults to applicationxwwwformurlencoded which is reversible for the simple example I provided but not for other more complicated use cases Now it is possible to get at the raw data with something like this but that sure seems like a convoluted way to get the raw POST data This is also not possible in my use case as the meteor app that Im using doesnt expose the raw request object from restivus Would it be possible and make sense to add a textplain parser Hello There is an error in that shows TypeError Restivus is not a constructor but works in
