 migrating to swift resolving compiler errors If Image Picker limit equals then the selection is going wrong and user not able to select the other images util he deselects the selected one so added one more condition if the image limit equals Hi i want to ask how to get image file name when selecting image from image gallery or from capturing photo Thank you Hi Im noticing that has some issue with ImagePicker in Android Moto G Every time that I pick or take a photo on my cellphone it just crash unfortunately this app crashed Updated framewotk to Swift Outstanding is still the demo project This migrates the ImagePicker source to Swift A fresh clone of the project will not actually build the test scheme locally as there are references to files which are missing I have removed these but if anyone has any objections to that I am happy to revert this change There are some SwiftLint tidy ups which consist mostly of whitespace removal trailing closure syntax and static declarations I hope these are in keeping with the style guide but Im happy to remove them if they violate any guide rules When i click the take photo button to take photo it select the first photo in photo library And when i first present camera page it shows Sorry There are no images here
