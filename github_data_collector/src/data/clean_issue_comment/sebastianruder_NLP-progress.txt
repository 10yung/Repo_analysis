Adding the progress in dataset and application of seqtoseq for marathi language added current best results as reported in Neural Machine Translation for English to Hindi EnglishHindi translation url LTRCMT Simple Effective HindiEnglish Neural Machine Translation Systems at WAT HindiEnglish translation According to the Listofunsolvedproblemsincomputerscience Is there any perfect stemming algorithm in the English language I believe that lemmatization is not solved too It would be wonderful to add the states of the arts in both tasks BTW lemmatization consists for example of transforming the conjugated verb jumped to his noun form jump Does a tool that takes in argument a word eg fast and another argument specifying the requested part of speech form an eg adverb which would output fastly In fact stemming and lemmatization are a special case of the NLP task I need If it exists does someone know how its called Where could I ask Sorry for the digression It has improved the state of the art This is a computational research papers summarization competition Just looking at the NER scores for English Ontonotes The top score is for Flair but I cant find where this number is reported The original paper doesnt evaluate on Ontonotes and their github page shows Looks like Separius added this can you confirm where the number came from I didnt see anything on VAD so maybe that should be a new category I dont know enough about it to say if it could be considered a language independent task nor what the current state of the art is which is why Im opening this issue It does seem like webrtcvad is used a lot so that might be the defacto baseline while seems like a contender for stateoftheart has a freely available dataset Thank you for your precious contribution for NLP I am a candidate PHD in China and attracted by some new research topics mentioned in Accepted Tutorial in ACL I really want to know that whether there is proper data for argument mining and storytelling Looking forward for your reply Thank U Hi Is there any official resultincluded in summarization topic papers on TextRank Thanks for this list I would like to point out a data issue a new model of Distantly Supervised Relationship Extraction using the same training dataset is be able to compare with the same results of models PCNNATT PCNNONE etc reported Lins paper Lin et al the cleaned dataset was updated by Lin and could be downloaded from The problem is that some new papers eg two in EMNLP and one in AAAI used the unprocessed data which contains duplicated instances in the test set the unclean data will give higher unreliable results issues already have been discussed in the unclean data was tested and has effects on the results
