working Issue details Repro steps Use case background In this library handling the memory used by images is not managed at all which leads to OOMs on several deviceseg I would like to discuss how we can improve the image handling on our library I have a few ideas Scaling drawablesas Bitmaps before setting them to their respective imageviews For even better support you can take a look at these links a b c OR We provide separate modules that use Image loading libraries like Glide Picasso for loading images as optional dependencies along with our library probably the easiest OR We could provide a way for the user to get imageviews so that an image loading library can be usedprobably not recommended Highly recommended regardless of approach taken Tell me your thoughts on which approach is better and if you know of any other alternative Please include code snippets or whole files as necessary including XML Layou if applicable If no code is being used please explain why Failure to do so will result in your issue being closed We shouldnt have to ask you for code snippets later on in the issue What is the error message that you got in the log Bonus points if you attach a relevant screenshot screen recording or a small demo project Fixes New approach to request permissions This PR is more or less complete and ready to merge I have tested it against various scenarios and it should work fine Output
