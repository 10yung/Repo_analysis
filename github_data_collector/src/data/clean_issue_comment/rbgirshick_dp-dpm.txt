At first I meet the same problem AP So I change the cnnbinaryfile from CaffeNetv caffemodel to ilsvrc trainiter k and then I get the right outputAP But I cant get the information of parts so I use the functionpascaltrainpartsm to train In this way the result is wrong who can tell me how to get the right result with the use of parts information AS BEFORE I have installed the dpdpm step by step and trained the person detector but how can i used the detector to detect the person on an image Hi Ross as described in the CVPR paper Deformable Part Models are Convolutional Neural Networks there are distance transform pooling layer and object geometry layer in the DPMCNN Are these two layers included in the code Thank you the pool features are not fine tuned but used from the imagenet model directly Do you happen to have the finetuned on PASCAL VOC feature pyramid extractor Thanks Reported to me by Alan Li Details on the issue are sparse Im not sure if the problem occurs in training testing or both This issue is primarily meant to document the problem I likely will not devote time to fixing
