This is just an idea related to functionality that is provided by the connectable project It would be really great if you could dynamically create new port bindings for example using redis to support dynamic environments without a process restart This way you could use nucleon as a local service proxyloadbalancer In addition to that a DNS backend based on SRV records could be used dynamically find all upstream servers that provide a services under a specific local port
