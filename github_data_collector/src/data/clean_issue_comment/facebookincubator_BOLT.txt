at compilation time its matter in a daily development We are currently using this flag on our libraries and the need to disable it for BOLT means either deliver two version of these either slow down every applications not using BOLT Its a big drawback of using BOLT at the moment If you plan to do you have an estimated time for it Thanks you Pierre Summary not process functions in custom sections

with povrayr where the rewritten binary segfaults if Wlq is added to OPTIMIZE when compiling using the open source version of povray I thought Id report an issue I ran into along the way that seems to apply to quite a few of the workloads Ive tested Essentially when compiling with marchnative using gcc on Ubuntu I frequently hit the assertion in BinaryFunctioncpp about jump tables with a size smaller than one This is reproducable for instance with the following steps bash Clone povray stable git clone cd povray git checkout stable Compile and install boost wget tar xvzf boost targz cd boost mkdir BOOSTROOT bootstrapsh prefixBOOSTROOT bjam install Compile and install povray cd unix prebuildsh cd mkdir build LIBSLBOOSTROOTlib lboostsystem lboostthread LDLIBRARYPATHBOOSTROOTlib configure COMPILEDBYname email prefixpwdbuild withboostBOOSTROOT make j make install Run BOLT llvmbolt buildbinpovray o buildbinpovraybolt Modifying povrays configure script to remove the marchnative flag seems to resolve this issue In the case where this flag is present though it would be preferable if BOLT just bailed on the function rather than crashing completely For reference heres the output
