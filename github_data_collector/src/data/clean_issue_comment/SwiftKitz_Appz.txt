Hello Regarding this Should we add comgooglemapsxcallback I know this is really stupid but some apps do not support QueryParameters like they should and only support QueryItems in custom order like MapsMe Any suggestions on how to fix this problem I was trying to add swift enum Query case parameters StringString case items URLQueryItem var queryItems URLQueryItem switch self case parameterslet params return paramsmap URLQueryItemname value case itemslet queryItems return queryItems And use Query as an input But since Paths queryParameters is variable and public itll definitely break backward compatibility Any suggestions Instead of manually writing new Swift classes tests pod specs and modifying the readme we can have a configuration file with all the apps specs we have and then a script that generates all the files needed This will help us move much faster and adapt to future changes more quickly Tasks x Design the configuration files x Script the Swift source files generator Script the Pod Subspecs generator Script the readme table generator iOS adds a way to asynchronously try opening an applications and registering a callback once thats over swift open func open url URL options String Any completionHandler completion escaping Bool SwiftVoid nil We can probably provide a new method that conditionally compiles if the minimum SDK requirement is iOS Should we create an example project for the library Having added applications inherit ExternalApplication gives us a lot of flexibility but I am starting to question the need for such a flexible design Perhaps making it a simple struct instance would reduce all the boilerplate code written for the added apps Need to investigate
