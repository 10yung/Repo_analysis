 RELEASE NOTES General Changes This change introduces the Alluxio metastore which connects to the Alluxio catalog service See for more information on the catalog service In this PR we introduce the bare minimum to configure and use the Alluxio catalog Reads are the only supported operation at the moment NO RELEASE NOTE NO RELEASE NOTE NO RELEASE NOTE RELEASE NOTES General Changes Improve builtin function resolution performance by caching function resolution results Gather some stats to better understand function resolution and function usage NO RELEASE NOTE ds max size When a single row in ArrayAggregationFunction exceeds the MAXARRAYSIZE aka INTMAX we return an internal error to the customer from the Airlift precondition checks This PR changes the behavior to return a USERERROR instead by actively checking for the size of the block being appended to NO RELEASE NOTE Use Presto to connect to enable mongodb of SSL TLS Error is reported I can connect with studio t or command line How can I solve this problem JTS isValid and isSimple semantics are closer to the OGCISO standards than is Esri in fact Esri gives the same answer for isValid and isSimple This means that geometries will need to be checked for both validity and simplicity and a small set of geometries might have changed their simplicityvalidity property In addition the geometryinvalidreason function will return different but semantically similar strings RELEASE NOTES General Changes STIsValid and STIsSimple adhere to the ISOOGC standards more closely In particular previously STIsValid and STIsSimple always gave the same answer now they may be different Users should check both IsValid and IsSimple to be sure their geometries are wellbehaved geometryinvalidreason will return different but semantically similar strings It will return the reason for invalidity if it exists else it will return the reason for nonsimplicity if it exists else it will return null Currently user do not have the ability to see the definition of the SQL functions after they created them Similar to SHOW CREATE TABLE and SHOW CREATE VIEW we should also support a similar though not specified in SQLstandard syntax for this functionality Syntax For SHOW CREATE TABLEVIEW given a fullyqualified name of a tableview the object is always unique However this is not the case for SHOW CREATE FUNCTION as there might be multiple signatures for the same name Hence Im proposing the following syntax This is similar to DROP FUNCTION and ALTER FUNCTION where an optional data type list is allowed show create function statement SHOW CREATE specific routine designator specific routine designator routine type member name routine type FUNCTION member name member name alternatives data type list member name alternatives schema qualified routine name data type list left paren data type comma data type right paren Behavior A SHOW CREATE FUNCTION query outputs one column Create Function the formatted SQL text that would create the exact same function for each signature that matches what the query specifies cc rongrong kaikalur RELEASE NOTES General Changes Add support to show whether functions are builtin in SHOW FUNCTIONS Add support to show whether functions have variable arity in SHOW FUNCTIONS
