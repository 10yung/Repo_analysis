In main screen it should be possible to use the pulltorefresh to check all active monitors Please consider making a Pull Request if you are capable of doing so Description what youd like to happen We all agree Nock Nock is a great tool for monitoring Web servers What if it could monitor other servers too for example ones that dont have an HTTP server but run OpenSSH I propose the simple check of creating a TCP connection to the specified hostport and immediately tearing it down again If this succeeds its almost certain that the service is up It is possible that a daemon would establish a TCP connection and then not function properly but this is unlikely unless going through inetd Describe alternatives youve considered Run an HTTP server on the computer solely for the purpose of nocking on it checks that the server is running but not if the daemon of interest is also enlarges the attack surface Use a different tool no automated scanning tool in FDroid but there may be nonfree options Set up a daemon on an HTTPequipped server which polls the various nonHTTP servers of interest and summarises their state in a page served over HTTP which is in turn checked using Nock Nocks Search Term functionality awkward and adhoc everyone has to build their own solution Feel free to close this feature request if you consider it to be out of scope though Many times the site is reported as down because not having internet related to or because it is actually down but just for a very short time that happens to coincide with the app checking but shortly after it is up again because it automatically restarts or something Currently in these cases the app doesnt check the status again until the next regular interval and meanwhile shows the annoying notification that the site is down while it actually isnt My proposal is to add two different checking intervals one for when the site is up and one for when it is down In this way you could set a long intervall for normal use and a very short one for when it is reported down to check again shortly after and remove the notification if necessary as it is up again or you have regained internet connection Please consider making a Pull Request if you are capable of doing so App Version Affected Devices All probably Describe the Bug If the site is using cloudflare and there is a wait time shown by cloudflare seconds wait screen then the app logs it as an Error and shows a Error Expected Behavior Should wait for the expected time then check if the site is working or not Description what youd like to happen When typing in a Site Tag have an autocomplete dropdown showing possible tags This would be for existing tags that are entered in the app It would be really cool if one could see the expiration date of certificates of monitored sites An option to get a warning if the date is nearer than a certain threshold eg ten days would be even better I have some sites at work that I want to monitor They run on IIS When I add them to the app the response it receives is Bad request and says a header name is invalid but does not say which header Please consider making a Pull Request if you are capable of doing so Ill make a pull request but I want to make sure we agree on the desired behavior first Description what youd like to happen related to Dont notify me every Check Interval when a broken site stays broken Suppose I have a website that is down I want to know quickly that it is up again so I set the check interval to minute I get a notification every minute for that site being down I would prefer if I get a notification the first time it goes down then never again until it comes back up Describe alternatives youve considered The current behavior is an alternative but it feels a bit spammy There could be a persistent notification one of those notifications that you cant dismiss as long as a site is down but not a notification event every time the nock nock checks and fails to establish a connection Tried your app for a few days and during a day I get false negatives when the site is actually up all the time It gets annoying because the check mechanism cant differentiate between the site problem and a local network problem One possible culprit could be the call in the performValidation function Once the http call is started and the network connection is lost then the response will always be ERROR For example the check is started when the data connection is valid the data connection is lost and the app reports a timeout This timeout is of no interest to the user the site is not actually down I would suggest adding some sort of condition on when the site is considered to be down depending on another sites up status Eg my site is only down when google is up and reachable I dont know if properly testing for a valid conncetion helps in the case of mobile apps The connection could drop anytime and does this often Would be cool to have a backuprestore grinning To the local file system To Google Drive
