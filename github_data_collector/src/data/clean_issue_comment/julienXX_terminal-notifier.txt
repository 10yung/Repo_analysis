 Please check everything that applies to your issue x I looked in closed issues and it has not already been answered My issue appeared with a terminalnotifier update Im using a tool that uses terminalnotifier guardnotifier nodenotifier To help us debug your issue please include macOS version Catalina terminalnotifier version installed using homebrew When you ssh to a Mac that does not have a current UI session ie I restarted my Mac before going home from work and started an ssh session from home you cant use terminalnotifier as part of a workflow because it just hangs Im aware that there is no point in having a notification because there is nowhere to view that notification The problem I have is that the command stops executing rather than throwing an exception I could have a workflow that just ignores the status code of the command and continues In my case I have a mercurial hook that posts a notification updatenotifier usrlocalbinterminalnotifier title Mercurial subtitle Update successful contentImage mercurialpng message Parent revisionss HGPARENT HGPARENT However if I try to chain bash commands hg pull upstream hg up hg push rev default This fails to execute because it stops when attempting to post the notification and requires a CtrlC to regain control of my shell I think it should return a suitable error code when it is unable to connect to the session rather than just print the error and wait usrlocalbinterminalnotifier terminalnotifier NSXPCSharedListener endpointForReplywithListenerName an error occurred while attempting to obtain endpoint for listener ClientCallsAuxiliary Connection interrupted Hello In file the value of NSAllowsArbitraryLoads has been set to true A code scanning tool is labelling this as a security breach May I know what this property is used for please I did a quick grep for NSAllowsArbitraryLoads in the source code however looks like no code is directly referencing the item Could anyone clarify what this piece of config is really doing Apple also identifies this as a security issue here Help is appreciated Hi juliebnXX thanks for this amazing piece of software I think theres a bug when adding the sender option Im using it to customize the notification message By adding it the notification turns into an alert by adding the buttons close and show so it doesnt disappear after a while only when a button is hit Kind regards Federico I have been using terminalnotifier in scripts often executed from FastScripts Beta opened a new wrinkle I imagine for security reasons the sender and activate appear to no longer work and hang the command Notarization of terminalnotifier does not solve the issue Hi julienXX first of all thanks for this neat tool Since MacOS Catalina currently in beta all applications have to be notarized by default Otherwise Gatekeeper wont allow to open the app See Do you have a developer ID certificate If yes would it be possible for you to notarize the app so it will run without any issues in future MacOS versions Thanks in advance Cheers Tilman Reference Please check everything that applies to your issue X I looked in closed issues and it has not already been answered My issue

an ApplePersistenceNO messages for ALL use even just for a plain terminalnotifier title foo message bar from the command line Ive used the same terminalnotifier and macOS version for a long time This may be very well be caused by running defaults write g ApplePersistence bool NO recently But why does terminalnotifier need to complain about this How can I get rid of the complaint Hey Im trying to execute a simple diff check when I click on my notification but its not working I tried to add activate comappleTerminal and this one works but after that nothing more I tried to run an osascript that will open a new terminal window and then run my command but it doesnt work much My command sh terminalnotifier title My notification message The description activate comappleTerminal execute diff bashrc gitconfig macOS terminalnotifier Install with brew install terminalnotifier Thanks There is an error in the README There is an example image showing using terminalnotifier for a confirmation question but the example code next to the image is for a custom icon not for a confirmation message I want sticky notifications or action buttons please use alerter If this is what is meant by action buttons then the wrong image was probably removed from the README when that feature was removed from terminalnotifier Please check everything that applies to your issue X I looked in closed issues and
