Many of the nodenv plugins and repos require similar test setup and helpers This issue will document the needs of each plugin so that we can unify somehow nodenv nodebuild nodenvinstaller nodenvenv nodenvaliases nodenvdefaultpackages batsassertbatsmock resets nodenv vars PATH testbin pluginbin nodemodulesbin batsmockbin testspecific mktemp with NODENVROOT NODENVHOOKPATH source etc teardown removes tmpdir custom nodenvinstall fake to install nodes and trigger hooks helper to create defaultpackages file in nodenvroot nodenvpackagejsonengine nodenvpackagerehash nodenvnpmmigrate nodenvvars nodenvman nodenveach nodenvupdate nodebuildupdatedefs nodebuildprerelease nodebuildjxcore jetbrainsnpm homebrewnodenv In combination with this PR should allow for the ability to make and view aliases in the form of lts This should increase the compatibility of autoswitching to nvmstyle versions eg ltscarbon A few plugins that may have some utility being ported to nodenv x print env vars relevant to nodenodenvnpm share global modules across nodes x man pages for active node npm etc version install node using custom definition url like a gist automatically install latest patch maybe even minor versions of each currently installed node make nodenv aware of local nodemodules bins would resolve x includes an idempotent installer script though doctor is the more relevant one Any votes on which if any of these would be most useful for node Or others
