The READMEmd should be updated with a sentence or paragraph explaining just a little bit why this repository is deprecated ie what is to replace it and why abandon this repository s approach to a projection of Objective C s frameworkAPI to Rust For some reason redirects to a page that says The requested resource does not exist Not sure if this would fix that Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend I was looking at the code and only found clearColor However Id like the ability to use custom colors to change the title bar on OSX I can implement this probably if you point me in the right direction Hi I am trying to find some types and I am not sure if they are missing or if I just cant find them I am looking for NSURL NSModalResponse When i press the Quote key the NSEvent created returns empty string whe calling the characters function Im using OS MacOS Sierra Keyboard US International PC keyboard layout Rust from rustup rustc ade Eg inheritance method overloading and other stuff that explicitly requires ObjC features which obviously miss in the bindings Does it make sense to implement a Drop trait for NSAutoreleasePool so it is called whenever NSAutoreleasePool goes out of scope It turns out that if the user does not call NSAutoreleasePooldrain NSAutoreleasePoolrelease manually the memory will be leaked by the way the examples from the repository do not call drain release as well The NSEventeventType method produces the value when spotlight is opened or one of the items on the system menu tray are opened eg battery status wifi The value has no associated variant within the NSEventType enum and thus segfaults when a user attempts to match against a NSEventType of value This was causing a segfault in winit Ive added a commit to winit that sidesteps this bug however this should be properly fixed upstream in this crate Ive been unable to find any documentation on NSEventTypes of value just yet I get the following error when attempting to call initWithFrame error E multiple applicable items in scope srclibrs let text NSTextFieldallocnilinitWithFrameframe multiple initWithFrame found note candidate is defined in an impl of the trait cocoaappkitNSView for the type mut objcruntimeObject note candidate is defined in an impl of the trait cocoaappkitNSTextField for the type mut objcruntimeObject Because NSView is implemented for id are the other definitions of initWithFrame redundant If so can they be removed rust extern crate cocoa use cocoaappkitNSStatusBar use cocoabasenil fn main unsafe let NSStatusBarsystemStatusBarnil cargo run Compiling macmenubar v fileUserscoreydevrustmacmenubar Finished debug unoptimized debuginfo targets in secs Running targetdebugmacmenubar Assertion failed CGAtomicGet isinitialized function CGSConnectionByID file ServicesConnectionCGSConnectionc line
