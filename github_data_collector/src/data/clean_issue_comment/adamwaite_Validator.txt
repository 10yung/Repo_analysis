Without this change it would not be possible to build Validator with Xcode One may argue that SPM is only integrated starting with Xcode which includes Swift but there are other dependency managers relying on the Packageswift manifest like Accio and sometimes they are still used with Xcode Also after having merged this it would good to release a new version Cannot invoke initializer for type ValidationRulePattern with an argument list of type pattern EmailValidationPattern error ValidationError img width altScreenshot at PM src Look at Simple and standart patterns are equal Is it a bug In the version they was different on UITextViewValidator the compiler shows the following error on line textDidChangeNotification has been renamed to NSNotificationNameUITextViewTextDidChange therefore you cannot build After updating to Xcode Version A a on macOS Mojave Version G with Cocopods Version Validator Pod Version swift pod Validator git branch swift I have been facing this error img width altimage src When trying set properties of ValidatableInterfaceElement in a subclass of UITextfield I am getting Cannot assign to property self is immutable swift error To resolve this I had to restrict ValidatableInterfaceElement to AnyObject Is there a known workaround for this Im happy to submit a PR if supported Side note Thanks this is question With this commit ValidationResultswifts merge method has been deleted but I would like to know if there is an alternative method here Are there any plans to add support for SPM Validator was originally written when I was learning Swift Swift and has been adapted for Swift and Swift Now feels like a good time to update the code to honour the latest SDKs and Swift conventions Goals Eliminate that horrible ObjectiveC run time stuff Make the ValidationResult a monoid and follow functional programming conventions over those dodgy merge style methods More Swifty APIs where possible Add CI support with Travis Why is this code valid How to use Wrong var validationRuleSet ValidationRuleSetString let stringRequiredRule ValidationRuleRequiredStringerror ValidationErrormessage email is required validationRuleSetaddrule stringRequiredRule let email String nil let validationResult Validatorvalidateinput email rules validationRuleSet printvalidationResult valid
