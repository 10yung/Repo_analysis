I see the KeyBindingsjson file Let me offer the following Maybe of interest maybe not There are no key bindings for turning selected text to upper or lower case or for capitalizing it I realize that MM isnt primarily a text editor but this would be a useful addition to the list of key bindings Id love a keybinding for making text both bold and italic at once CtrlShiftB maybe When you select text and then bold with CtrlB you lose the selection and have to select again before using CtrlI to italicize Would be nice to do that all in one go ZoomEditorUp happens consistently and immediately ZoomEditorDown needs a few keystrokes each time before it takes This feels like a bug ZoomEditorUp increases the width of the righthand scrollbar but ZoomEditorDown does not have the opposite effect Alternating between them therefore results in an enormous scrollbar This definitely feels like a bug Im kinda thinking ZoomEditor shouldnt affect the scrollbar size at all but if were going to increase it there should be some corresponding way to reduce it again If you ZoomEditorDown enough times text disappears from the editor window completely and I found no way to get it back ZoomEditorUp just made the scrollbars even more enormous but didnt bring back the vanished editor text This also definitely feels like a bug Also a suggestion maybe theres value in a ZoomEditorRestoreDefault When updating anything in a markdown document with Math in it the preview is constantly gittering while refreshing it ezgif caf b d This is pretty annonying and ruining my attention Maybe a virtual dom rendering could help about this Do you plan to translate the UI someday I can provide the German translations Happy coding Tim I think this is actually a duplicate of the following bug but which I can reproduce Create a md document such as this Testing for image upload test fileCUsersmatthDocumentstestpng When uploading to Wordpress the uploaded document reads as follows and the image is not uploaded at all p idpragmaline img srcUsersmatthDocumentstestpng alttestp Minor suggestion In vscode you can install an extension to do custom syntax highlighting on key words like TODO Would be nice to have the same capability in vscode on the editor side not the rendering of the markdown as that is a whole other bag of worms Consider adding interpolated variables sourced externally to the Markdown file Heres one way this can work User opens external variables file eg variablesyaml variablesjson or variablestoml MM parses keys and values into inmemory dictionary User opens Markdown file eg READMEmd MM substitutes all variable names with corresponding interpolated values eg variablenamefull becomes Jane Doe in the preview User changes and saves value of variablenamefull MM reinterpolates the value and updates the preview User starts to edit the Markdown document User types Ja User presses CtrlSpace MM replaces Ja with variablenamefull into the Markdown document which is the first match for Jane Doe from the interpolated variable map MM updates the preview to show Jane Doe in the final document Note that interpolated variables means that the variables can be recursively defined such as variable name first Jane last Doe full variablenamefirst variablenamelast See also screenshot Just a suggestion It would be great if the table editor had some basic sorting and maybe even filtering functionality I think the way how it works in Excel is common sense and seen in other applications ie Confluence Wiki etc Bad table handling in markdown is one of the primary reasons why colleagues in my workgroup prefer the Confluence wiki over Markdown docs in githubgitlab Ive been looking for a solution for quite a while Per Markus Egger It would be nice to support shortcuts for column alignments as supported by Pipe and Grid Tables Along the same line itd be nice to allow sorting by a column in the editor rearranging columns in the editor
