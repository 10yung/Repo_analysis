 I am not getting TLS connection from my sslcom certificates Does the current version in its minimal support cover TLS If after an SSLread operation there is still data pending in the SSL layer such as the remainder of a TLS record we need to simulate an EVREAD event on the watcher OpenSSL wont attempt to read the data from the underlying socket until this data is consumed Since there is no new activity on the socket libev will not trigger a new EVREAD notification This just happened to work with the large buffers passed to SSLread from the ringbuffer However when adjusting these buffers it becomes increasingly likely to deadlock a socket by leaving this pending data in the OpenSSL buffers on on redhat derivatives that put libev in its own subdir does not affect compilation on debian derivatives The mode should display to stdoutstderr andor syslog if the s option was invoked more detailed information about the inner workings eg Connection established with client wxyz Start handshake with wxyz Handshake successful with wxyz perhaps even the SSL handshake details ciphers key exchange etc For a really flexible logging configuration perhaps something like SSHs v vv vvv configuration will do When you run stud with daemon and chroot it tries to reopen stdin as devnull after doing the chroot which returns an ENOENT I see in the Makefile that there is a switch expected for ifeq STUDFIPSMODE However there is no configure script where I would give a flag for FIPS mode the README makes no mention of how to enable FIPS mode and I need to use a static library to get a writeoff on FIPS OpenSSL for government use I am just going to modify the Makefile to temporarily assume its built and ready and declare a build directory for FIPS Are you planning on modifying the build process to allow for alternate static FIPS implementations True FIPS builds cannot change the directory and with FIPS you dont declare to build the fipscanister any longer rootstud studmaster
