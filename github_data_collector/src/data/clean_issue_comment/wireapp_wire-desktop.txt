Enable timed messages I used week in my tests Send any URLs with proper Open Graph tags Wait a couple seconds for URL previews to appear on yoursenders side What is the expected result URL previews appear on recipients side What is the actual result URL previews still wont appear on recipients side even by then and it seems like they never will Please provide any additional information below If its an actual intended behavior I guess at least disables URL previews on the senders side when the messages are on timer But still enable it when timer is disabled if the preference is also enabled
