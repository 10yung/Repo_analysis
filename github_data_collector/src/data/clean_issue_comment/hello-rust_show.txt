 What Rewrite htop in Rust using asyncawait Why Would be a lot of fun to learn how to create a lazy version of htop and find out about the limitations of the Rust crate ecosystem around crossplatform process monitoring How Find some crates for process monitoring and put them behind asyncawait to update each process status regularly and independently from other processes What Why My assumption is that there is a lot of undefined behavior in this code We could talk about fuzzing porting C code performance benchmarks and more How Create a naive implementation of strstr in Rust Benchmark it against the existing C version Port the C strstr version verbatim to Rust Run afl fuzzing against it to check for edgecases Thanks for the inspiration jorgelbg What Why Lets explore different ways on how to solve the same problem in Rust and discuss how idiomatic the solutions are How Refactor the code from the link and talk about tradeoffs Hello Im a new rust enthusiast Today I have found your channel and fall in love with your content dedication to the community So Im wondering with have any chance to you go back to produce that content and I will be so gratefull to become a patreon What Visually show how the rust compiler works Why To teach about the internals of a complex tool we use a lot hopefully every day How What Write a clone of kafkacat in Rust Why Show how to write CLI apps that follow bestpractices Would also be a fun tool to have and I need such a tool on a regular basis How Probably something around structopt Rust edition What Spin up a ROM in sprocketnes or pinky and mess with it by modifying the bytes in memory or changing the meaning of the opcodes Why Just for fun How I guess we should go with a popular game like Super Mario We add a keyboard shortcut or so which inserts random glitches into the ROM My assumption is that the game will crash at some point Also when changing the opcodes funny things could happen What Explain tools that measure code coverage and work with Rust Why While code coverage is not a good measurement for the failsafety of a system it might indicate which parts of a system might need more tests Some coverage tools like kcov support Rust but some tweaking is required to get them to work How Suggested by user Hitlife on Reddit What Show how to debug Rust code Why Debugging code is one of the core skills for software engineers Because Rusts current debugging story is not very mature yet it might make sense to make an episode about the current debugging options and how to properly configure the environment How Start with some preexisting but buggy code and setup a new debugger from scratch most likely in VSCode or Intellij Rust Show the current limitations of the system eg variables dont show up or they get displayed as Clowlevel structures without proper Rust introspection Requested by user Hitlife on Reddit What Introduce some helpful crates Why Because its tricky to stay uptodate with new helpful crates nowadays Also to raise awareness for the work of some talented Rust developers How Just show five crates or so and give an example for their usage maybe a before and after code comparison might work best
