Im getting errors when running pod update on my project Looks like this is now trying to pull in another library when using pod DropdownMenu which is a Swift implementation and seems altogether a different library not Fount with UIBarButtonItem Thxs How do I create the viewcontrollers dynamically in the container view Any help appreciated Question above Is there any recommended way to have the content in the view get pushed down by the menu as it opens rather than getting covered I guess it would be akin to a drawer Thoughts Hey Amazing control Very useful for many types of apps I was wondering about something that could help me a lot If I select a child view controllerlets say A for the container and then I select another view controllerlets say B I would like to know if its possible to return to the same view controller Ausing the menu without creating a new view controller Basically every time I move from one view to another using the menu a new controller appears and the old one is released I found the DropdownMenuSegue class but because Im quite new to objective C I dont know how to preserve my view controllers I need to keep them because my view controllers are in fact navigation controllers and I wouldnt like to lose the current view when I select a menu item and then come back Help would be much appreciated Thanks So i have setup the menu without effort but now i wanna call another view from inside one of the menu views and i am calling either one and not been able to show anything self showViewControllerreplay senderself or self presentViewControllerreplay animatedYES completionnil Any ideas on how to do that Im having a problem where the container view seems to be blocking the buttons in the drop down menu from being clickable If I reduce the top size of the container view way down the buttons then are able to receive touch events but this is different from the intended design Does anybody have a fix for this Just to let you know its better to disable UITapGestureRecognizersetCancelsTouchesInView in the example app I had been struggling to get a tableViewdidSelectRowAtIndexPath event The menu shows up just fine and works great on an iPhone but the buttons arent clickable on the or on an iPad Has this happened to you I cant figure out why this happens
