Some Alt special character combinations sends the wrong key For example Alt sends ESC instead of ESC Alt sends ESC instead of ESC Alt sends ESC instead of ESC etc When connected to a host it would be nice to have a password button that can paste the password for the current host Paste must be authenticated by TouchIDFaceIDPin to prevent accidentalmalicious paste of password Enhancement Request Provide a way to disable the displaying of the autocomplete text For example at the blink prompt start typing the letters ping and the display shows ping Send ICMP ECHOREQUEST packets to network hosts with the nontyped portion being in a different color and disregarded by the system of course I am rather old school and I find stuff like this to be very distracting I know what I want to type and what I expect to see as I type having other letters displayed definitely has an impact on my speed and accuracy I appreciate the feature and can see its uses However for an oldschool VI programmer with so much eyemuscle memory it ends up being a huge distraction and hinderance When editing an existing host the title stillalways is New Host Rather confusing Maybe you can show the value for Host or HostName instead On my iPad ssh immediately returned to the prompt for any host I tried without any info After running ssh vvvvv instead I discovered from the logging that Blink could not read my private key Apparently I had renamed it in the Keys settings but not in the Hosts settings Please show an error in the GUI when a private key cannot be read when executing ssh Additionally you might want to change the appearance of Key names in the host section display it in red if it cannot be found Now it showed a no longer existing name in the same fontcolor as a valid key only when I tapped on it I saw that it was actually set to None If you enable the Shift key in the software keyboard then an iOS low battery warning triggers the Shift key stuck screen will show up even if no hardware keyboard is connected To reproduce Press the shift key on the software keyboard so that it is enabled Wait for an iOS low battery warning eg or battery remaining Close the warning The shift key stuck screen will show up On the iPhone I can change the font setting oder theme setting but the app does not adapt even after force quitting Anyone have a setup that works for this I ve been trying for a bit can t I can t get it to work or for blink to give me any error messages Blink v Dec Is my version I m running iOS Sorry if this has been fixed I Source already I can only use the AppStore release since I lack the hardwaresoftware to build it myself It seems to me that the last few TF versions have seen a regression in the way mosh works In the past closing the ipad for a while and then resuming had no issues with reestablishing a mosh session Now its frequently the case that when the ipad is reopened after a delay mins the mosh client cannot reestablish its connection bar on top saying last contact X seconds ago requiring me to ssh into the server do a killall moshserver and then reestablish a mosh connection tmux is whats saving me here Currently on TF
