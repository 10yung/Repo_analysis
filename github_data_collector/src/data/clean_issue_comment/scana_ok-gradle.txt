 Hello scana I want to try your plugin next week it seems super useful One thing is that half of my Gradle is in Groovy buildgradle while the other half is in Kotlin buildgradlekts As you can see here its almost the same except for the parenthesis and double quotes like in java instead of single quotes diff implementation comsquareretrofitretrofit implementationcomsquareretrofitretrofit Actually the latter syntax is totally valid in a buildgradle too I could try to submit a pull request if you are interested Ive used gradleversionsplugin for this but something similar with IDE support could also modify buildgradle to apply the updated versions This isnt a big issue but Im curious why the plugin depends on Android support being enabled in IntelliJ seems like it should work with any Gradle project android or not It seems that modules using pure java gradle plugin do not handle implementation keyword for dependencies The plugin should be able to detect whether implementation plugin is supported and use it or fallback to compile keyword Often I use Ok Gradle inside of a buildgradle file when Im already at the position to insert the dependency Would be nice to have a button to do this instead of copying the dependency and then have to paste it Maybe reuse the OK button therefore IMHO this button is not intuitve since it just closes the dialog Thats not what I expect Even more when the tool is called Ok Gradle then I would expect the magic happens on OK This proposal is probably an rival to Research about searching through internal nexus repositories added by a user or fetched from repos declared in buildgradle files
