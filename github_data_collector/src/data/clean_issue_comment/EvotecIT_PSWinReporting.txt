Field Value DNS changes Here is my sterilized copy with my modifications I added a ton of notes to keep track of the windows events and what they mean The last thing I would request is to somehow consolidate all changes that occur when a user is created or deleted Having a dozen lines to show all the things that were createdmodified when a user is created is a little cumbersome to read I should emphasize I AM NOT COMPLAINING I love the tool and its potential just a humble request Im using version and have set up event forwarding Events are coming through and Ive set up the task to trigger RunMeTriggerOnEventsps Ive configured my email settings in RunMeTriggerOnEventsps From ADChangesXXXXcom To steveworkXXXXcom CC BCC ReplyTo Server smtpXXXXlocal Password PasswordAsSecure false

get the same error Possible to pass through credentials to save to SQL server I have a sql server not on domain and in another domain that would need its own credentials passed When lockout happens it often happens that lockout is reported on one DC and then transferred to PDC This means events for real event Maybe some kind of duplicate checking if Event ID User Computer Action and only RecordIDController doesnt match merge events Is there a way to include only specific accounts and groups in monitoring I know there is an ignore type parameter but didnt see anyway to specify sensitive groups and accounts only Not sure if this is possible but is there a way that you can NOT send an email if no changes happened If this is running every hour theres no need to know that nothing changed Sometimes SubEvents can have fields within fields Log Name Application Source ADSync Date Event ID Task Category Management Agent Run Profile Level Information Keywords Classic User NA
