Hi Hello I have two arrays with header in the same sheet How to get the datas that second array history new ExcelQueryFactoryfilepathWorksheetTicketHistoryReport All TicketHistory properties are null If i delete a first array in xlsx file all working string pathToExcelFile C MyFolder ProjectFolder samplexlsx string sheetName Sheet var excelFile new ExcelQueryFactorypathToExcelFile this code is okey but if i changed the path impersonator like this file server uploads doesnt work Are there any suggestion I have a Excel sheet which serves as data source The sheet contains a number of calculated values The cells containing these calculated values have been formatted These calculated values which have to be imported by another application but these values should be imported without the format applied The raw calculated value so to speak Currently however the data is read in the formatted way and it is caused by the fact that the connection string is forced to use IMEX Not specifying the IMEX or using IMEX returns the unformatted values from the file What is the reason the the IMEX value is hardcoded to Couldnt it just be replaced by using value instead I cant think of a reason why you dont want the actual value from a cell The most flexible solution would be to allow the user to specify the IMEX option when setting up the ExcelQueryFactory I could send a pull request which allows this option to be set I would only allow the options and as using value would currently skip the first row when retrieving the data which I consider unexpected behavior Well at least I was surprised by this If the file has say records it works fine if I increase the size of the file by adding more rows lets say it hits kb it starts failing with the error External Table is not in the expected format Vesion PreRelease installed via NPM Manager We have column name Date and its value as this value is automatically converted DateTime to AM which we dont want to We want to treat it as plain string not as DateTime Please help to get us any solution Between thanks for the great library I have installed the version of AccessDatabaseEngineX exe however for file xlxs I m getting the error The MicrosoftACEOLEDB provider is not registered on the local machine But file xls is working file for processing What could be the possible cause for this Apparently you cannot just download the redistributable Microsoft Access Database Engine Redistributable anymore Any suggestions or do I have that wrong You dont need to install ace database engine already installed Office bit and bit same versions of ace database engine cannot be installed on the same computer but bit and bit different versions of ace database engine can be installed on the same computer Example bit Ace and bit Ace This way you can use LinqToExcel in bit and bit programs on the same computer Hi Is anyone know how i can get the real value of a cell and not the formattedValue Thanks for your help PS With interop is good but i cant use interrop in the server I am getting this error SystemRuntimeInteropServicesSEHException External component has thrown an exception When accessing xlsx files No changes to the code it just stopped working cs var excel new ExcelQueryFactoryFullFileName Liststring wsNames excelGetWorksheetNamesToList This works for xls files but not xlsx files Thank You Scott
