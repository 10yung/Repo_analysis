 adding parameter logoutonuserchange to ignore the warning Enabling disabling debug mode depends on empty string existence in cli argument Why empty string Is that a typo or what Example bash binconsole somecommand firstArgument empty second argument suddenly turning debug mode off I think that the change introduced in not such a clear cut case just spent a lot of time finding why it is not shown any more With the exceptionerror case I agree that the log statement is superfluous but that is not the case for error codes Imagine a command which signals successfailure by return codes as is usual in CLI then when you run it you have no visible feedback on whether it was run successfully or not binconsole helloworld with the logging for console not filtered out it would be much more user friendly binconsole helloworld ERROR console Command helloworld exited with code command helloworldcode which is I think exactly the reason why the printing out logs in console feature was introduced To sum it up I think not showing the logs in the error code case is more developer unfriendly than them being showed when not needed cc chalasr
