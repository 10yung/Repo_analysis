neverpatchminor and devruntime dependencies Outofrange updates receive only lockfile updates if desired Security updates receive only security updates if desired details I noticed this tool creates many files even for structs with one or two properties that aren t ever referenced outside of their parent It d be great to consider nesting these at the highest level they re required rather than always at the top level When the construct type is a class the user should be able to request for an init function for the class that takes all the attributes declared in the class as parameters and sets them to their corresponding attribute in the class An additional checkbox should be provided in the UI enabled only when the construct is of type class The CLI should also provide a similar option For Example JSON var randomstring var anotherrandomstring Construct Type class Need Init Function true Variables as Optionals true Result initvar String var String selfvar var selfvar var Is it possible for the soft to detect dates using for example regex If yes it may be possible to perform the feature that would parse the date in strings into Date objects
