If env is aliased or there is a function with a name conflict this may cause man to fail Prepending env with command bypasses any aliases or functions See the issue I ran into in this StackOverflow answer There were some improper updates this series of patches should address the issues that arised from that I added an update script precisely to avoid synchronization issues and this script was completely ignored when updates were issued The old apple icon didnt appear once I installed a Once I copied in the character taken from it appears properly On nixos systems there is a fzfshare command available to find the fzf shell folder which directly contains the completion scripts This pr updates the fzf plugin to use that Also the shell folder does not have a subdirectory shell where the plugin would normally look for the scripts This is the same as on arch based systems This pr fixes this As my bash script skills are not the best it may be a good idea to test the changes of this pr on an arch system first to avoid breaking something unintentionally Describe the bug Docker autocomplete plugin not working To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Enable plugin docker Start typing on your terminal emulator hit the autocomplete button Tab Nothing happens Expected behavior Autocomplete suggests the relevant options System OS arch Zsh version Terminal emulator Termite Using

found yarn isplugin command not found yarn ohmyzsh plugin z not found To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Enable plugin z Download yvm with brew add yvm export to zshrc export YVMDIRusrlocalCellaryvm r YVMDIRyvmsh YVMDIRyvmsh See error Expected behavior A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen I should be able to source my zshrc with no errors and the z plugin should work as expected System OS macOS Zsh version zsh x appledarwin Terminal emulator iTerm Look for similar issues already posted including closed ones Include as much relevant information as possible Try to make sure the issue is due to Oh My Zsh Sorry for this not related issue which I had during using ohmyzsh Here is my environment OS Windows Enterprise WSL Ubuntu LTS MobaXterm Personal Edition v Build Problem zsh and ohmyzsh are installed successfully without errors Default shell has been changed to zsh by chsh s which zsh also tried chsh s binzsh which did not work also When I start WSL from MobaXterm it starts with sh instead of zsh But I can manually change to zsh by execute zsh command where ohmyzsh is working really well How do I know I am not using zsh I have changed the theme to agnoster which is very obvious to tell Also I have double checked that the default shell is set to zsh by echo SHELL Has anybody come to similar problems I am using macOS Catalina Everything worked fine until the latest update zsh version zsh x appledarwin Everything looks okay for normal folder However for remote file systems it is stuck until I press Ctrl C and then typecd I am attaching the screenshot below img width altScreen Shot at AM src When I use the kubectl plugin alone the command line is correct but after I use autosuggestion I get this kind of error I ca n t delete it os type mac
