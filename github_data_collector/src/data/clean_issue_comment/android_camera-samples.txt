Report issue links in README at Camera BasicSample Camera BasicKotlin Camera VideoSample Camera VideoKotlin HDRViewFinder Links are rispectively directed to Camera Basic Camera Basic Camera Video Camera Video HDRViewFinder Which are archived repository and should be replaced with rispective subfolders because they are migrated to camerasamples I was trying to use cameraxbasic app on Camera HARDWARELEVELLEGACY phones so the preview size for imageAnalysis was low resolution so i manually calculated size myself by scalerstreamconfiguration map and preview size closest to screen resolution Suppose i chose the preview size on Xolo Era phone and it was I gave this size to preview and imageAnalyzer method through setTargetResolution function And it was selecting something like I want to choose a high preview size for imageAnalyzer like When CameraXBasic is uninstalled any photos taken with it are deleted I realise this is due to MainActivitygetOutputDirectory choosing an applicationspecific directory I assume this was also done as a workaround for Android s scoped storage but for a camera app example I feel this isnt really appropriate anyone following this to write a CameraX application may not realise theyre creating a camera application that deletes a users photos when uninstalled which could be disastrous More generally given Googles push to move us to nonFile APIs it seems inconsistent and mixed messaging not to be showcasing Googles best practices for saving files on Android with scoped storage The camera sample should show the correct best practice for saving a photo which Google documents as using MediaStore API although as far as I can tell documentation for how to do that seems lacking so having this shown in the camera sample would be all the more valuable please Looking at other samples source code it seems this issue may apply to them too eg Camera BasicJava but Ive only tested CameraXBasic on my device Galaxy S e Android Thanks CameraXBasic app updated to work with version alpha Use cases are working and it doesnt crash Also filed one issue Closes The preview becomes very slow after using Image Analysis the preview returns to normal after being removed I installed the Camera SlowMotion sample in Redmi Note Pro and opened to see a white screen with list of available camera configs and chose one and then the screen turned complete black and nothing happens then after Apart from this I also combined this code with some code from Camera VideoKotlin and it worked just well for many of the devices I could very well record slow motion videos with and above fps But again when I install the app in Redmi note pro The app closes at preview Neither I see any crash log in the logcat nor I am able to catch the crash in a trycatch It seems to be something nonfatal But at the end I am clueless on what is happening here my observation so far is that it crashes somewhere after I do setRepeatingBurst Please help Hi friends I have Android PDA android The one has a camera MP and the other one have a camera MP My application use Camera API v to take a picture So Im facing an issue that Camera Preview of MP phone is brighter than the MP phone I expected that MP one is brighter than the MP one I have questions is Camera Api v incompatible with the camera MP module Quality of camera MP is bad if the root cause is that Camera API v is incompatible so is there any workaround any advice and suggestions will be greatly appreciated Photo from the camera MP Photo from the camera MP javalangillegalArgumentException navigation destination resolved Im getting this crash in CameraXBasic Scenario when this crash occurred First take the picture route to gallery delete it now route to gallery again CRASH Confirm delete prompt shown in CameraXBasic even when no photo available Done
