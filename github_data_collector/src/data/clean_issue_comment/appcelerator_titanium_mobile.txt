 JIRA Description This adds some manual checking of unhandled exceptions after firing events or running timers using the new ObjC JSC API If there is an exception we call out TiExceptionHandler code ie display the greyred stack trace view fire TiAppuncaughtException event Note that last time we added an exception handler on the JSC API itself and that messed with the test suite working properly I hopeassume this will not JIRA Summary TIMOB Log build warnings if res files have invalid names Restores old Titanium behavior where res file names are automatically renamed if invalid Will log build warnings if invalid along with a suggestion on what to rename it to TIMOB Titanium SDK build should favor python tool if available Avoids SDK build failures on systems that have python installed Note We plan on removing our python usage in the future Now setting JavaKotlin compiler max heap size via gradle Avoids OutOfMemory exception when building very large projects Uses existing androidjavacmaxmemory setting Uses existing androiddxmaxmemory setting Improved AndroidManifestxml fault tolerance for app builds Now filters out xmlnsandroid namespaces attributes from child XML elements Can only be defined in root manifest element CLI used to wrongly inject them Test Create a Classic Titanium app project Unzip Resourceszip attached to TIMOB to projects Resources folder Copy

was updated from to View failing branch This version is covered by your current version range and after updating it in your project the build failed husky is a devDependency of this project It might not break your production code or affect downstream projects but probably breaks your build or test tools which may prevent deploying or publishing details summaryStatus Detailssummary

Description Targets Java and adds support for Kotlin for developing native android modules Java ticket Test case There is a good test case for lambda expressions in TIMOB A feature supported in Java I will link our example modules code once I rewrite it in Kotlin There are only two files that were changed so I dont plan on creating a repo with the Kotlin native module but instead I have attached them here kotlinmodulezip JIRA Description This adds TiUIWindowclosed and TiUIWindowfocused TiUITextFieldfocused TiUITextAreafocused TiUISearchBarfocused Additionally this tweaks the behavior on iOS to mimic Android Specifically TiUIWindows open and close methods used to block until the underlying openclose operation finished Now they basically schedule that to happen async The end result is that on both platforms we now get this ordering TiUIWindowopen returns TiUIWindow open event fires TiUIWindowclose returns TiUIWindow close event fires I also made an underlying fix to our legacy iOS proxies via the JavaScriptCore C API not the new bindings via ObjC API When looking up properties to be exposed to JS it handles properties with modified getter method names ie objc property readonly getterisFocused BOOL focused Before it would ignore that the getter is actually named isFocused and would always assume it matches the property name focused I had to do this specifically because there was already an internal API focused method on the base class for TiUITextField and TextArea Allow Gradle to automatically download and install missing dependencies Android SDK Buildtools etc These

failing branch This version is covered by your current version range and after updating it in your project the build failed nodetitaniumsdk is a direct dependency of this project and it is very likely
