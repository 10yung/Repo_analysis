 In the README this link leads nowhere Im excited about TouchDevelop please fix it up kc HI I could not search and find any answer to this in the FAQ and help files Can someone direct me Thanks My students receive an error when we try to upload picture files The error message says We are having network problems My class on Friday morning had no issues but my class Friday afternoon could not upload pngs or jpgs Were still experiencing this problem today when creating a comment with the following markdown enummyParamABC and a parameter of a type that is not String creates a Token N a N with a parse Error This is a minor bug as the program seems to be able to handle errors Some other bugs which crash the system and prevent the project from being able to open up againbut luckly can be fixed by using the projects history and set to a previous diff is the use of hex Cause cannot splice undef error snippet pub Cause cannot splice undef error api Cause cannot splice undef error sig dido fullsig dido bbc dido Also on a side note If I were to have a question that the current TouchDevelop Docs dont have documentedsuch as macros plugins T types ect were can I ask it When I start phonegap windowsUniversal Apps in release or debug mode getting Can t load the ActiveX plugin that has the class ID D CDB EAE D CF B Apps cant load ActiveX controls This only happens when I assosiate App with the store Hi I would like to setup TouchDevelop to my own environment However I did not succeed in building because of depencencies Also GitHub says dependencies are outofdate It seems that tsd is deprecated and should be replaced with typings which is maybe the solution In the code I had done about minutes of work on TouchDevelop I opened it today to find that my code hadnt been saved and had been deleted The file is there but the improvements are all gone I made functions commands and I had tested many many times The current approach for the export button on the pxtroute branch tries to pop up a window This appears to snag the popup blocker on Firefox and Chrome and so means the first expereince the user has of a dialog that says a window should have opened but probably it hasnt I think this could easily be resolved like this Modify the dialogue to say something like Export will take your script and import it into the editor at Microsoft MakeCode It will be automatically upgraded to be compatible something about data sharing and how MakeCode behaves Then have an Open and Cancel button exactly as they are today pelikhan did you encounter the popup button
