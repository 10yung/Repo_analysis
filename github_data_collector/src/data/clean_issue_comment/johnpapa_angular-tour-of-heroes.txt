Im working on Microsoft SQL Server and I want to create Angular demo app that shows how to implement it endtoend solution using real backend Net and database SQL Server Current version is here I have used this code as frontend I have created backenddatabase and everything is working fine However the problem is that I had to do few source code changes to make it work and it would be nicer if these are some config values that can be changed instead of chaining the code The changes that I made are Add the backendUri in environment config Change the backend URL in the code Change the backend URL in search service Disable inmemory data source here It works for me but it would be good if the backend URL is placed in the config in your code too because I believe that other people will like to do the same Also it would be good do if we could disable InMemoryDataService without changing the code Ideally this could be some property that could be changed if I deploy the app in Azure Web Apps If you know have some better way to reconfigure this sample to work with some backend could you point me to some instruction in docs Otherwise what do you think about adding this in your code I can send the PR for backendUri if you agree but Im not sure what would be the best way to disable InMemoryDataSource I want to push an array comment in to cabincomments array and after UPDATE of the cabin array with the new comment in it when the user submits a comment using the onSubmit and update the cabin with the updateCabin In the console when running ng serve open I am getting an error error TS Declaration or statement expect I am using a JSON database in the main folder I am really new to angular and I am lost This is my component file with my onSubmit onSubmitid thiscabincommentspushthiscomment thiscabinServiceupdatePoststhiscabinid thiscommentFormreset author rating comment My cabinService updatePostsid const datacabin Cabin return thishttpgetcabin Cabin mapcabin consolelogcabin return description cabindescription featured cabinfeatured comments cabincomments subscribeupdatedEntries consolelogupdatedEntries updatedEntriescommentspushdata return thishttpput id updatedEntries consolelogupdatedEntries My JSON database cabins id description Tucked away on the hillside among lush gardens of banana citrus trees featured true comments rating comment Beautiful place author John Gomez date T Z rating comment Amazing author Paul Villar date T Z I uploaded angulartourofheroes to a s bucket The upload works and it seems like the app otherwise works However when I try to look at it in google search console it seems like the app doesnt work correctly In particular it seems like anything displayed by the router doesnt work googlesearchconsole Note that Im getting a similar problem when I try to use this with my own site This means that it seems like googlebot cannot properly traverse the angular site This is a big deal for Angular SEO If googlebot cannot properly handle Angular apps then these apps will not show up in search results correctly
