I still get Overflow when I used JsonConfig with data Then I found it may not work with data rust let limit err ctype req appdataSelfConfig mapc climit cehandlerclone ccontenttypeclone unwrapor None None And after all thank you for your awesome work Summary In this PR I use asyncstd instead of blocking Moreover I treat all errors I hope this makes the code more streamlined They look like most of the text is exactly the same which is not friendly for beginners Especially after reading this code if you want to know what the next step is you must read the code in the above two projects carefully There are some suggestions Explain their differences and even point to this issue Or merge their code if their differences are pointed out it is not necessary Look at these lines I would expect when going from to login and then back to to arrive at a webpage saying Hello user What you actually get is Hello Anonymous I found this actix web oauth and I thought it belonged here having some trouble with the httpproxy example It seems ClientRequestsendstream results in a response for any request that actually has a request body It never even seems to hit the thing being proxied to Not sure if Im missing something or if the example is broken I just cloned actixexamples installed diesel via cargo install dieselcli left the default DATABASEURL testdb using SQLite then ran cargo run The web server started and I opened it up in a browser This opened a blank page but I saw an access log in the console were cargo run was running I then killed the program CTRLC and checked out the database by running sqlite testdb select from users and there was nothing in the table Im pretty new to Rust and extremely new to Actix and Diesel Was kind of hoping it would just work to prove to me that its easy to get up and running I was following the example at actixwebjuniper but tried to implement context with out luck Could someone update the example to include a simple context I have tried to also follow from the juniper docs but it seems like context is implemented from the framework side rs struct Context impl juniperContext for Context stuct MyData scema Scema context Context fn graphql st webDataArcMyData data webJsonGraphQLRequest impl FutureItem HttpResponse Error Error webblockmove let res dataexecuteschema let res dataexecute stschema stcontext expecting rather then stcontext Ok serdejsonerrorErrorserdejsontostring res maperrErrorfrom andthenuser OkHttpResponseOk contenttypeapplicationjson bodyuser I saw fafhrd added the example blob are you able to help something like this package but for Actix also Outh for social media login back end for ios users without both i cant use Actix i really want to try Rust web framework rusqlite have some breaking changes and new features this PR updates rusqlite in asyncdb and r d example adds a note about the use of webblock deduplicates repetitive code uses the types with Iteratorcollect to be idiomatic
