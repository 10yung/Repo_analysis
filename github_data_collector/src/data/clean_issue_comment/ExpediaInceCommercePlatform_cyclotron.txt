The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

default settings to ptbr BTW but until now all my efforts has been in vain I am assuming that the table and number widgets use numeralJS functions to format numbers If not please advise me how to do so Thanks Is there any additional documentation for updating widget data I have been using the json data source and querying a middleware API the middleware is connecting to a WebSocket to get information when available I cannot seem to use the API to update the widget data any help would be appreciated I created an HTML widget and in the HTML section I put the following code pDate openingDatep pDate momentopeningDateformatYYYYMMDDp Expected Output Date T Z Date Actual Output Date T Z Date momentopeningDateformatYYYYMMDD API requests dont work for me GET dashboard starts working after the fix in routesapijs appgetapidashboards dashboardsget Ive added api on the start It seems to me others will start working after the same fix Ive used the quickstart guide but apparently something went wrong I just started using Cyclotron and for the most part am quite impressed Lots of great functionality and decently easy to configure However theres one glaring gap that Im still in disbelief isnt there and thats some UI for navigating pages on a dashboard As far as I can tell the only way to move between pages on a dashboard is to set them to autorotate or to use arrow keys I cant find any way to add like a ribbon on the bottom or a treelist in the sidebar that automatically lists the pages by name and lets you browse and navigate to them This seems an obvious limitation and one that really hurts usability I was even playing with some of the builtin example dashboards and it wasnt until I edited one that I realized it had pages I have figured out a workaround by adding a sidebar section with HTML that contains links to the different pages eg a hrefdashboardnamepage Page Namea but this is brittle since anytime the page list is modified the links will need to be updated and its annoying that I have to manually create this in the first place I also tried a link like a hrefdashboardnamepagenamePage Namea which would at least handle page reorders though not renames but it appears the app ignores changes to the pagename in the url so this doesnt work The nice thing about putting this in the sidebar as opposed to a header widget is you only only have to configure it once per dashboard But AFAIK theres no way to make the sidebar open by default so its still not great for discoverability adding an openbydefault sidebar option would be great Like I said Im impressed overall but its surprising that a tool thats otherwise so featurerich would not have solved this already Or am I missing something Hi I am trying to use cyclotron to work with my database in mongodb The configuration settings doc seems to ask for custom mongodb But while creating data source there is no option to select mongodb I would like to a Select my database b Select collection c Set parameters for widgets to know what to plot Previously I had a custom stack running nodejs mongodb jquery to do the plotting Wherein nodejs has the business logic as to exchange data based on query send from frontend I am looking to replace the whole stack so that with minimum programming plots can be created Regards
