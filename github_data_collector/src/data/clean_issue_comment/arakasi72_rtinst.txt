should I do For the last week ruTorrent has started having issues communicating with rTorrent although I dont know if the problem is with rTorrent or ruTorrent Existing torrents are seeding fine but no plugins work so autotools which I use to automate my torrent grabbing isnt working If I reboot my server or restart rTorrent everything seems to start working fine again and autotools grabs the torrents but if I check back an hour or so later then I have the below errors WebUI started rTorrent user cant access id program Some functionality will be unavailable screenshots Plugin will not work

Ubuntu version rtinst version ruTorrent version rTorrent version Hi arakasi Love your script and its been working great for nearly a year After last packages update and server reboot rtorrent never could start again until Ive changed scgi port to different than ruTorrent user settings If I do that rtorrent starts and seeding but havent got connection to ruTorrent Once Ill bring back scgi port to proper rtorrent is crashing Tried add another user then another one and its all same rtorrent crashing on them if scgi port is same in rtorrentrc and user configphp in varwww Even deleted varwww folder and rerun rtinst script in hope it will solve the problem but unfortunately its same Im out of ideas now Appreciate any help I was expecting that rutupgrade would upgrade the installed version to v but it upgraded to v beta instead Its probably because there is v beta release sudo rutupgrade Installed version Latest version Choose which build to install if you are not sure select Use the latest stable release Use the most recent master build Select or Installing version of rutorrent Your existing rutorrent folder will be moved to homeharupongrutorrentold If you are not happy with the upgrade you can restore the old version by rerunning this script Installing Rutorrent v beta Setting permissions Starting services Installation of RuTorrent complete
