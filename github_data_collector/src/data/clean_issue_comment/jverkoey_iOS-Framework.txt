Need some clarification in public private and project headers of a static library I have linked a static library with a Xcode project In the static library I have marked all the header files that will be included in the Xcode project as public I want to clarify what will be the visibility of a header file lets say HeaderBh which is included in a public header file and what will be visibility of a header file HeaderCh which is included in HeaderBh HeaderBh and HeaderCh are not meant to be included in the host Xcode project directly Also I am not adding the static library as a sub project instead staticLiba file is linked with the host Xcode project Hi We provide a resource bundle as part of our SDK distribution Everything used to work great until we attempted to integrate our SDK into an app built using Xcode and then submitted to the app store We are now getting an error from Apple saying Invalid CFBundleSupportedPlatforms value Apparently XCode is inserting a couple of keyvalues into the generated Infoplist for our bundle Specifically precode keyCFBundleSupportedPlatformskey array stringiPhoneSimulatorstring array and keyDTPlatformNamekey stringiphonesimulatorstring codepre These keys are not present in the plist for the bundle and are getting generated during the build phase I have learned that if the values are changed manually to iPhoneOS then the app store will accept the submission Does anyone have any clue as to how to get Xcode to generate the plist with the proper iPhoneOS value Otherwise I suppose Im going to have to write a postprocess script to inject to proper values into the plist Anyone else seen this issue lipo did not report the armv s slice in my framework I discovered that ARCHSSTANDRD no longer includes amv s I had to manually add the armv s to the Architectures entry in the project static lib and the Aggregate Problem solved Hi team Im working on an iOS framework which follows this pattern it worked well before Xcode but recently after I upgraded to Xcode to build the framework then used it in the test app there were lot of build warnings during the Generate dSYM process the warning messages are something like these while processing

lookup some cache files on the build server but they cant be found to reproduce this issue Build the framework on one Mac then transfer it to another Mac which has the Test Appthis is very important because the issue wont be appear if you build the framework on the same Mac In the Build Settings of the test app change the value of Debug Information Format to DWARF with dSYM File for the Debug configuration then launch the app Im wondering if any other people who also encountered it Thanks James Can I use cocoapods in my framework Within a well configured iOSFramework if I try to load file resources NSBundle localBundle NSBundle bundleForClass myObject class gives back the main app bundle ie the same bundle of NSBundle mainBundle NSBundle mainBundle that is the container app root bundle folder like NSBundle privatevarmobileContainersBundleApplicationC A E B CAFDE B CMXMTestbedapp loaded My container app and framework structure is like MyContainerApp Frameworks MyFrameworkframwork Resources mydatajson and I want to grant access in the framework not in the app code for mydatajson Its very easy to access same data files via iOSFramework Bundles but this is not the case In fact the method to get the Framework bundle like NSBundle frameworkBundle static NSBundle frameworkBundle nil static dispatchoncet predicate dispatchonce predicate NSString mainBundlePath NSBundle mainBundle resourcePath NSString frameworkBundlePath mainBundlePath stringByAppendingPathComponentObjectiveLyricsTouchResourcesbundle frameworkBundle NSBundle bundleWithPathframeworkBundlePath return frameworkBundle will work only when calling it from the container app not in the framework itself due to the issue showed before I am using Xcode and a libPROJECTNAMEa file is not being created during the build phase Is there something that new that must be done in order for this file to be created i have follow all the steps and when i make the command lipo info SerenityframeworkSerenity it gives me the following error fatal error ApplicationsXcodeappContentsDeveloperToolchainsXcodeDefaultxctoolchainusrbinlipo cant open input file SerenityframeworkSerenity No such file or directory so any help Hi The tutorial is awesome Ive been using it for a long time and now it still works great Just one thing bothers me recently and I am not sure how to fix it I can not symbolicate the crash log that QA team sends me back if the crash was caused by the framework in another word I dont have the dSYM file for framework I am not sure how to make XCode generate dSYM file for the framework especially when archiving the project A little help please To give a little more detail I linked the framework in the project as a dependent project instead of using frameworkframework bundle When debugging it it seems like dSYM will be built into the binary but when archiving the project dSYM will be removed from binary
