year Lodash became the most depended on npm package passed billion downloads its v release saw massive adoption The year was also one of collaboration as discussions began on merging Lodash Underscore Much of Lodash v is proofing out the ideas from those discussions Lodash v would not be possible without the collaboration contributions of the Underscore core team In the spirit of merging our teams have blended with several members contributing to both libraries For lodash v we wanted to cut loose push forward take things up a notch Modern only With v we re breaking free from old projects old environments dropping old IE support kB Core Lodash s kitchensink size will continue to grow as new methods functionality are added However we now offer a kB gzipped core build that s compatible with Backbone v for folks who want Lodash without lugging around the kitchen sink More ES We ve continued to embrace ES with methods like isSymbol added support for cloning comparing array buffers maps sets symbols converting iterators to arrays iterable In addition we ve published an esbuild pulled babelpluginlodash into core to make treeshaking a breeze More Modular Pop quiz What category path does the bindAll method belong to Is it A requirelodashfunctionbindAll B requirelodashutilitybindAll C requirelodashutilbindAll Don t know Well with v it doesn t matter because now module paths are as simple as js var bindAll requirelodashbindAll We ve also reduced module complexity making it easier to create smaller bundles This has helped Lodash adoption with libraries like Async Redux st Class

repo from the Security Alerts page details This solves by adding in support for fragment shorthand syntax JSX pNeatp Ive covered adding in the valid grammar as a separate regex check for tag opening and closing because things got weird when I tried to amend the existing tag open and close regex Additionally I changed the regex in atomreactcoffee to allow autocompletion of fragments which seems to have no adverse effects from my testing Unrelated to this package bracketmatcher seems to be unable to properly highlight fragment tags due to them missing a tag name This was the only side effect I noticed Follow eslint rule reactjsxclosingbracketlocation by decreasing indent for a lonely closing bracket and not doing so for its next line Fixes fixes fixes If a multiline element is selfclosing the closing bracket should be aligned with the opening bracket And because of this theres no need to decrease the indent on the next line less so automatically each time one tipes anything For example
