Type Architectural Source Basically you have all your partials stuffed into different folders and a single file at the root level which imports them all to be compiled If you check the sass template for the pattern you will see that the project is pretty much structured as follows in one PlantUML diagram source code startuml package site DDDDDD class MainSiteStyler BasicStyleDefinition

MainSiteStyler ThirdPartyStyle enduml As described in issue it is recommended to declare the template method as final This pull request changes the implementation in the sample code of the following patterns template method pattern twin pattern The template pattern used in the callback pattern was already declared final method executeWith in class comiluwatarcallbackTask As statet in the referenced tutorial Templatemethod Pattern Tutorial I would add a note in the pattern description that the template method should be declared final To make sure that subclasses don t override the template method we should make it final And I would change the code accordingly Hi this is Masaki Mizobuchi I faced the below error when I build the projects So I report is Unknown host repositoryestatioforgecloudbeescom is shown when I execute the commnad mvn eclipseeclipse It seems that is closed host Error message is below ERROR Failed to execute goal on project

The attached document SoftwareArchitecturePatternspdf This is a big architectural pattern where the system consists of core and plugin modules Links the attached document SoftwareArchitecturePatternspdf Currently all the patterns belong to the default unnamed module To make them real Java modules we need to add moduleinfojava to each of the patterns Links Progress tracking x abstractdocument Jekyll front matter is used to add attributes to web pages on our web site All the patterns have their front matter defined in READMEmd but description is missing from there description is used to add HTML meta tag to the patterns web page as can be seen here In this task we add description front matter to all patterns so that Google finds the pages better Lets
