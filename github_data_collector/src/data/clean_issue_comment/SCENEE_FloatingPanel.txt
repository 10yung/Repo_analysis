This issue is that a panel sometimes moved up in dragging it down if content offset of the tracking scroll view in a content view controller was greater than its top interaction buffer Ref I ve implemented Floating panel exactly same as youve shown in Map example Only difference in my implementation is ive used collection view instead of table view Im loading bottom sheet from nib Apart from this each and every line of code is exact same Even checked hierarchy searchbar is on top of all views Also added textfield on bottomSheet not getting selection for that either Please help me as this is a huge blocker for me RNThank you Short description When i set UINavigationController controller as contentViewController and use prefersLargeTitles for rootviewcontroller of it i am not able to get title back to its position when scroll down the floatingpanelcontroller and title sticks to the top Is there any solution for this in FloatingPanel Thanks ezgif f aed ea Expected behavior title should go back to large title when scrolled down Actual behavior It breaks the title UI some time it goes back and some times it stays on top Code example that reproduces the issue let nav

FloatingPanel iOS versions Xcode version Short description Once we started tracking a table view inside the floating panel we obtain a strange behaviour Indeed the content view contains a vertical stack with a px height view lets call it header and below a table view When the panel is in full position and table view has a contentOffset then the only way to pull down the panel is to scroll down the table view back to top or to use the very small grabber While when the panel is in middle or tip position then the header view detects panGesture and makes panel position changes much easier whatever the tracked table view content offset is thats the behaviour I would always expect Environment Library version Installation method x CocoaPods Carthage Git submodules iOS versions Xcode version Short description I have floating panels in my VC One only covers half the screen while the other needs to take the complete screen I will refer to the panels as such in the rest of the issue Half Screen Panel Panel Full Screen Panel Panel I am using an intrinsic layout so that Panel cannot be expanded completely However using the intrinsic layout I am not able to cover the full screen using Panel Expected behavior Open Panel and it should not be able to be expanded more than the height set in the insetForposition FloatingPanelPosition Open Panel and it should be expanded to the height of the complete screen Actual behavior Panel works as required Panel does not show up at all and if I set a height in insetForposition FloatingPanelPosition function It crashes However if I do not set it it will be nil and the Panel does not slide up at all Steps to reproduce Code example that reproduces the issue private func setupFloatingPanelviewController UIViewController

style presentation on iOS modalPresentationStyle automatic If you remove line inside ViewControllerswift inside the samples project this should now present the ViewController as a card Run and hit show modal The panel tracking when dragging up works but as soon as you drag down things go wrong iOS Simulator iPhone Xcode Floating Panel Short description I want Floating panel work as it is except returning to supported key positions after I stop dragging it Expected behavior When I drag panel up and down and then release it it should stay at same position where I released it Actual behavior Panel is returning to the closest supported position tip full after release Steps to reproduce Usual code for using panel Installation method CocoaPods iOS versions Xcode version Short description Is it possible to add another view between surfaceView backdropView And then dragging up let middle view slightly appearing Expected behavior Something like google map behavior Once the user sliding up the details the photos will appear from the middle behind the top view Thanks in advance Happy coding Short description First of all Thank for very useful and awesome library I have facing with this very weird effect when Floating Controller contain scrollview like TextView TableView etc After scroll down for example textview After that when I try to drag down the Floating Controller its very hard to drag down and its cause some damping effect Its make a the contain view move up then down But when scroll to top of scrollview then everything become normal Please take a look at the video below Code example that reproduces the issue Actually I using Map example from FloatingPanels source Just create many datasource for tableview inside FloatingController Environment Simulator from iOS
