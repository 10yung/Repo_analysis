 Describe the bug Im running into an issue where an input Im attempting to wrap which is a DatePicker returns a Date from OnChange but a formatted String from OnBlur reacthookform is seemingly saving this String then passing it back as the value which blows up the app as the PropType check fails extecting a Date Im not sure who is truly at fault here They shouldnt be returning a String on their OnBlur event and I opened this issue about it But It also seems unintuitive that reacthookform would be overwriting the saved values in its controller on a OnBlur even if its attempting to rerun the validations then OnChange seems like the more appropriate method to update the saved value To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Wrap a progresskendoreactdateinput DatePicker in a reacthooklibrary Controller Set validation to OnBlur Interact with the DateInput to trigger a blur event See error Codesandbox link Expected behavior I would expect OnChange to update the values in the Controller and OnBlur to not modify those values but just trigger the validations on the already saved values if validations are in OnBlur mode Desktop please complete the following information OS Windows and CodeSandbox Browser Chrome Version Additional context As mentioned I opened an issue there as well and the reproduction in the code sandbox is very straightforward Describe the bug It seems that Controller rules object is being kept in the initial state that they were set to on first render including any scoped reference values We have dynamic rules based on external factors that this bug breaks I am currently bypassing this issue by setting a composite key prop on the Controller component of all values used within the rules object Codesandbox link To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Go to codesandbox link Use the button to make the required rule false Press submit Observe that the required rule is being enforced Expected behavior I would expect rules to update alongside the component In the above example I would expect there to be no errors when the required rule is set to false Desktop please complete the following information OS Ubuntu Browser Chrome Version Describe the bug Calling useFieldArray hook methods does not update formStatedirty value To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Go to Click on APPEND Observe that formState hasnt changed Codesandbox link Expected behavior append prepend remove swap move insert should all update dirty state to true Desktop please complete the following information OS Windows Browser Chrome Version Official Build bit Version Additional context Add any other context about the problem here This feature request is waiting for more upvote related PR if you want such feature you can thumb up this comment example for hapijoi this will apply for any other schemacustom validation import React from react import useForm from reacthookform import joi from hapijoi const schema Joiobject username Joistringalphanummin max required Build your resolver to display errors and pass valid values const resolver data any const error value values validationSchemavalidatedata abortEarly false return values error values errors error errordetailsreduceprevious currentError return previous currentErrorpath currentError function App const register handleSubmit errors useForm validationSchema resolver return form onSubmithandleSubmitd consolelogd input typetext nameusername refregister form FYI kotarella JeromeDeLeon
