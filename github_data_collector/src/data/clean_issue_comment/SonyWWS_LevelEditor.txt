Would be nice to just look at Even in alot of people are using bit The low end laptops for example So bit should be supported Im Trying to upload Level editor but it doesnt load up and it says level editor is not responding Here is the code I keep getting Code i keep gettingtxt I was having some difficulty marshalling a native wide string property into a managed string when I realised the code CodeGenDom was giving me was wrong The patch is somewhat selfexplanatory when its a string we want to Cstyle cast the char or wchart string pointer not the address of the pointer to a void pointer and Use the appropriate stringlength function strlen wcslen instead of sizeof Seeing as the repository includes the binaries I thought about providing rebuilt binaries but it might be easier to merge without them As per topic I noticed that the setters on LvEdEngineTransform werent setting the dirty flag so whenever youd ask for the matrix later youd get the identity matrix set at init time This is a tiny tiny change all it does is use autoimplemented properties instead of manually implementing private backing fields in CodeGenDom Some minor comment fixups have been done as well but Ive provided those as a separate commit if youd rather we not touch those lines Hello As per topic I find myself in need of a resourceloaded listener in managed land and for the life of me I cant seem to find one The use case is loading a game object definition file that contains game object component definitions and then resolving and instantiating components for those definitions once the file has been loaded If the functionality doesnt exist yet Ill take a swing at it but I figured Id ask just in case Is it possible to add arbitrary key value pairs to game objects in the property editor That would be rather useful to hook into game specific logic The renderer doesnt load properly when using the VS project When using the VS project you need to upgrade to use the VS compiler hashset and hashmap are deprecated we should be using unorderedset and unorderedmap instead Do you accept PRs to include a VS solution and use the non deprecated classes The docs seem very sparse especially with Work with a variety of file formats What do these include
