It would be good to have the ability to also show a bottom cab I have the use case that I select list items show secondary actions in the cab but also want to have a bottom view where the user can directly do primary actions Problem Using String in public API for title and subtitle makes impossible to use SpannableSting Solution Use CharSequence String implements CharSequence so there is no breaking change in public APIs I took a glance and there dont seem to be any code in the library that requires api level can we set the min sdk to in library if there is any would you welcome a PR that makes it api compatible or would you be willing to fix it Thanks
