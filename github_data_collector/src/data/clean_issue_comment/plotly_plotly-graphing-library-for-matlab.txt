Mathworks renamed the colorbar peer appdata entry in the axes object in some recent release Hence fig plotly fails when there is a colorbar I tested a and b Matlab release The suggested change fixes this problem In some cases the filename is obtained as a cellstr This edit converts to a valid char filename to be used for local storage It seems that it is not possible to save figures to SVGPDFPNG in offline mode plot plotlyfig fig plotlygcf offline true saveplotlyfigplotlyfigmyPlotlyFigpdf Gives the following output Error using responsehandler line Aw snap We dont have an account for Want to try again Sign in is not case sensitive Error in plotlygenimage line responsehandlerresponsestring extras Error in plotlyfigsaveas line plotlygenimageimgfig filename varargin Error in saveplotlyfig line psaveasfilename varargin When I invoke fig plotly on a boxplot as in boxplotSQreadsmeanJitter fig plotlygcf offline true open false filename ControlAAGC bprawreadsquality the systemMatlab running on a Code Ocean compute capsule reports the following error Index exceeds matrix dimensions Error in updateData line strcmpobjdatadataIndextypebox Error in plotlyfigupdate line updateDataobjn Error in plotlyfig line objupdate Error in fig plotly line p plotlyfigvarargin Error in SSRControlAccountforPBArtifactBbedit line fig plotlygcf offline true open false filename ControlAAGC bprawreadsquality Edit m json to check if input char arrays have more than row If so convert to cell array using cellstr and let cell json escape the strings I am using dates as axis labels in the format mmddyy and Im storing them as a char array ie val fig plotly offline and online breaks trying to escape the strings this kind of char array Seems that this particular case isnt accounted for in charescape Using a cell array of strings works normally I think a simple fix for this would be to simply check if you have a char array with column use cellstr and continue as normal Screenshots below plotlychararray plotlycellstr When writing the figure to Matlab the default legend position is as shown below However there does not seem to be a way to edit this location such that it resembles the figure below You need to manually go and edit the figure in plotly This does seem possible in Python But changing the orientation in Matlab by using legendlegendData LocationNorthOrientationhorizontal does not produce the same figure once exported to plotly In the tutorial tutorials matplotlibpyplot is imported as plt But during plotting the histogram we are usintg pyplot which gives the error of pyplot not defined fig plotly fails completely if I provide it with a timeseries plot that has datetimes on as the xaxis Heres an example with a tscollection mydata where mydataTime is double data that is posix time seconds since epoch and the mydataTimeInfoStartDate is Jan fig figure plotmyDataaccelmeterZmps fig plotlyfig Error using responsehandler line Hm Plotly had some trouble decoding your args Are you sure your data or styling object is in the right format Check out the examples at plotlyapi for guidance However if I just plot the underlying data it works just fine fig figure plotmyDataTime myDataaccelmeterZmps Data fig plotlyfig The Plotly clientresp API was replaced over years ago and deprecated over year ago Switch to the V API documented at
