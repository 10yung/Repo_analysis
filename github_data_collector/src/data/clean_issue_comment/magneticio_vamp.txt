 I followed the instructions to install Vamp on a Kubernetes cluster I installed it using Minikube v and Kubernetes v Since RBAC is enabled by default Vamp cannot create resource deploymentsextensions is forbidden User systemserviceaccountdefaultdefault cannot create deploymentsextensions in the namespace default vampkubequickstartsh used in the instruction is missing the service account and rolerolebinding configuration Maybe not all the features would work but with the following configuration Im able to deploydeleteupdate a deployment apiVersion v kind ServiceAccount metadata name vamp namespace default apiVersion rbacauthorizationk siov kind ClusterRole metadata name vamp rules apiGroups resources services namespaces pods verbs create delete get list patch update watch apiGroups extensions resources deployments replicasets verbs create delete get list patch update watch nonResourceURLs verbs get apiVersion rbacauthorizationk siov kind ClusterRoleBinding metadata name vamp roleRef apiGroup rbacauthorizationk sio kind ClusterRole name vamp subjects kind ServiceAccount name vamp namespace default Hi just noticed that the client doesnt sets proper exit code Example vamp list namespacesxxx Please choose the artifact to list deployments gateways blueprints breeds workflows roles users tokens echo and even worst vamp create blueprint namespace XXXXXX file orderintakefirstyaml Cannot execute the request command Unexpected type for path memory echo It would be lovely if we can have an appropriate exit code cos otherwise in automated deployment like ansible we need to check every command vamp V Even though the Vamp httpClient is configured to follow redirects its not following the Mesosspecific HTTP that redirects to the current cluster leader Hm or is it Not sure if thats the API in use here It is impossible to get more than items from the events endpoint due to pagination not working as described in The perpage and page parameters seem to be completely ignored Easy to reproduce with the following bash command or just by counting items bash http GET localhostservicevampapiv eventsperpage jq id wc l Using Vamp on DCOS but this is most probably unrelated to orchestrator after running Vamp syncfix issue with eventbased workflows for more than hours it seems Metronome has become unresponsive i cannot access the metronome jobs page anymore Vamp shows errors in the log that i cannot access the metronome endpoint rsp HttpMethodGET exception TCP idletimeout encountered on connection to metronomemesos no bytes passed in the last minute and i do see a set of outstanding metronome offers img width altscreen shot at src My hunch is that we dont handle the creation andor termination of jobs correctly and thus overload metronome jobs at some point and make it unresponsive How to reproduce spin up Vamp DCOS syncfix docker package on DCOS it should work with metronome out of the box create an event based workflow with timeout and execution period both zero so they run as oneshots and let it run for a while Also try to suspend and restart the workflows and check metronome jobs status often they stay in running status in DCOS jobs view Trigger the event with another workflowscript Let it run for a few hours or days when creating Vamp workflow scripts the development experience is very raw there is no valuation no debugging no autosuggestion It would greatly improve the experience of creating Vamp workflow scripts if we can add validation of Nodejs syntax in editor highlighting of Nodejs syntax highlighting and validation of Vamp API objectsstructuresconstructsfunctionsendpoints autosuggestion of Vamp API objectsstructuresconstructsfunctionsendpoints live running and debugging of a workflow in the browser in a sandbox environment fe provide scaffoldingtemplates for common workflow scenarios provide higherlevel constructs using fe an embedded Vamp CLI make it easy to extend the Workflow Agent with custom Nodejs libraries fe for Slack integration The docs dont state what metrics are available on the metrics endpoint or directly on elasticsearch Its very unclear how to query them either using the REST endpoint metrics or using direct queries to elasticsearch Furthermore there seem to be three naming schemes haproxy acronyms like Tt and ft see hyphened full words responsetime see camelCased full words responseTime in the event tab in the UI Vamp UI uses iframes in combination with Vamp reverse proxy app output workflow UIs etc All of them require the same origin directive SAMEORIGIN when modifying a gateway its possible to create an invalid config template for VGA even though the YAML is valid VGA will throw an error when its not able to parse this config file This error is not shown in the Vamp log so there is no info on why the new VGA config is not being applied We should show an error in the Vamp log More generic this means that Vamp agents do need to send error messages to Vamp for logging and alerting
