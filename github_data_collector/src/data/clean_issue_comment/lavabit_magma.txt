dspamprep at PM on dspam failed at PM on Log Is it something I did not install or is it dspam Hi Ive been trying to install this email server for hours now i did everything from tweaking the INSTALL script to adding extra files manually so it works After a couple of hours i got it to successfully compile fully and load a config etc So i tried to find a way to launch it and couldnt get it working is there an easy install script or some up to date guide BTW i use CentOS latest release Thanks in advance C T Sorry for the small pull request but this broken link was bothering me I changed the link from hashicorpcom to vagrantupcom This change reflects the link on magmadaemonorg gabrielmongefranco thank you for contacting me To answer your query regarding webmail the system built directly into magma is only about complete When development stalled in all that was left were the RPC calls needed to retrieve and sanitize an email message body aka content and the calls needed to send a message Other problems have probably crept in since then I dont reccomend exposing the magma HTTP server to the public network until its been reviewed and improved What it really needs is someone dedicated to finishing and maintaining it At the request of a contributor I wrote a developer guide awhile back but the person who volunteered to work on the webmail system never made any progress Your welcome to play with what has already been done Assuming your running the vagrant sandbox environment you should be able to access the webmail system via assuming port in the guest has been properly mapped to your host That said because of the inherent security problem with loading keysdata and the code to use it from a server ie the HushMail incident involving Thomas Drake weve been more focused on developing Volcano our forthcoming thick mail client So it hasnt seen much active development since While Lavabit doesnt currently offer webmail access because of this a number of other companies ie OnionBit use foss webmail systems which access magma over IMAP That is in fact how the pre Lavabit webmail system also worked gabrielmongefranco thank you for contacting me In terms of contributing we could certainly use your skills Several things spring to mind We need to automate the process of building binary releases for the various popular distros aka rpmdeb files and writing a proper installsetup script Our Jenkins server could handle the former as it already does nightly buildtest jobs on CentOSDebianUbuntuFedora so adding jobs to create binaries for the different platforms and uploading them to wouldnt be hard Building binaries seems like a somewhat pointless effort without an installer though The vagrant VMs you mentioned which eventually evolved into the roboxes httpsgithubcomlavabitrobox project was to create create turnkey magma appliance VMs But because they lack an install script theyre only being used for cross platform testing at the moment In terms of status on an installer our current INSTALL script was written years ago and is somewhat out of sync with where things are at files have moved steps addedremoved etc Not sure what needs updating Either way its written in perl and should be redone as a bash script A more current but more obtuse install script is the magmadinstallsh script What we need is a solid bash script which queries the user like the perl version and performs all of the steps required to install and configure magmad Our buildlibsh script which compiles the bundled magmad dependencies would also benefit greatly from a dependency checker Basically some bash logic that figures out which OS your using and then uses the appropriate toolcommands to ensure all the required dependencies are installed We get lots of reports regarding failed builds that would disappear if we had this You also mentioned documentation We could also use a lot of help in that department In terms of magmalibdimelibcore we have lots of documentation but its dispersed and hard to find Even then much of the documentation is in varying states of accuracy as things have evolved and the docs havent been kept up to date If youre interested in compiling and editing it all into a comprehensive guide it would be extremely helpful as well We need updated guidesdocs for building installing and managing magma and libdimelibcore by extension We could also use help documenting how to troubleshoot common problems with guides on showing how to use the bundled scriptstools In a perfect world Id write all this up and publish it in book form Our developer documentation could also use a refresh as it would make it easier for newcomers to understand the repocode structure contribution requirements interface usage etc if there was a guide to go with the doxygen comments If you manage to do all that I could also use help updating the DIME spec A couple of years ago I decided to shift my focus away from writing the spec to writing code As such there are a few very minor things which need to be updated But mostly there are a number of important sections that were planned but never written I would also like to reformat the spec and publish it as an RFC series once it stabilises I said when you get done with the rest because this task is rather involved Im actually hoping to hire someone for the task at some point if our budget allows Ive posted this else where rprivacy and rdarkmail and nobody seems to be able to explain this in simple terms How does darkmail work Is it similar to Bitmessage curious why its so difficult to deploy our own based on the READMEmd when simply installing the right binaries and running magmabuildsh on a frest CentOs host might work with the minor fix magmaoutputfile must not be

questions I am not a dev I have run my own email server since around no coincidence using a VPS running postfix dovecot etc It has worked pretty well over the years but I have been looking for an option that would keep my mail encrypted until my email client logs in Magma looks like it could be a replacement Is the code OK for simple users like me yet I was able to get it built on a centos VPS just more or less as a test I see its sand boxed with nonstandard ports Is it meant for testing only Or did I miss a port forwarding step Is there a guide for a simple joe with basic linux knowledge yet Thanks
