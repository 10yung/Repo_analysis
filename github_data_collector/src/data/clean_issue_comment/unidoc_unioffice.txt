behind document B I havnt found a actual function that can do this So are there any possiblities to manually implement this or exists this feature already Description Based on the task is to implement and create testcases for the following functions that are classified as financial functions ACCRINT x ACCRINTM x AMORDEGRC x AMORLINC x COUPDAYBS x COUPDAYS x COUPDAYSNC x COUPNCD x COUPNUM x COUPPCD

YIELDMAT Expected Behavior Expect to have implementation and test cases for each of those functions Actual Behavior Some of these may be already implemented The task is to go over and ensure we have proper implementation and testcases for each Please comment below if the functions are already implemented properly and I will update the checklist Description connectionsxml xml version encodingUTF

Behavior Please include a reproducible code snippet or document attachment that demonstrates the issue Description When working on a presentation using a template it gets corrupted As a result when opening in PowerPoint PowerPoint will repair the file but the references to images are lost According to the pptx file size the pictures are still in the file but they dont show up in the presentation anymore Expected Behavior Pictures stay where they are when working with templates Actual Behavior According to the pptx file size the pictures are still in the file but they dont show up in the presentation anymore Instead warning signs are shown The following errors are shown unsupported relationship type tgt pptnotesMastersnotesMaster xml unsupported relationship type tgt ppthandoutMastershandoutMaster xml unsupported relationship type tgt pptpresPropsxml unsupported relationship type tgt pptviewPropsxml unsupported relationship type tgt ppttableStylesxml If this bug is not known so far please let me know and I will try to produce a pptx test file for it Description I want to add line for header but couldnt find any method to do it Expected Behavior Actual Behavior From what I gather there isnt currently a way to use the table formatting alternating line colors that persist despite row sorting with spreadsheets Am I correct If so are there plans to implement this feature Thanks Description This is really just a question Can the uniofficepresentation package be used to read text from a pptx file I have walked through the example where one can write to a file I want to be able to extract text from pptx files I was hoping that my code as follows would be a way to get some text off a slide But this method does not seem to return any text Is trying to use this library for presentation text extraction a fruitless effort p err presentationOpenstaticmypptx if err nil tErrorerr someText pSlides PlaceHolders Paragraphs XEGTextRun FldT or this instead someText pSlides PlaceHolders Paragraphs XEGTextRun RT Description I want to add some styles to the overall picture However it was found that line spacing could not be set in paragraph style And you cant indent first So I tried to add the method of setting line spacing and the method of first line indentation to the source code Expected Behavior Expected to be able to set line spacing of
