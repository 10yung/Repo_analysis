Hi I saw that the reincarnation branch has the library rewritten in Swift For those of us who are still using ObjectiveC this will mean that we will have to run Swift side by side with our ObjectiveC code By doing so that requires us to embed the Swift runtime which is a significant addition to the size of the application See this Stack Overflow thread for more information My recommendation for you would be to create a new repository where the ICViewPagerSwift or ICViewPager would reside iltercengiz Would love to hear your opinions regarding this Space running in iPhone X How to remove them iphone x Hello I change some code in ViewPagerControllerm now ICViewPager work fine on the new iPhone X how to prevent the content views from being swiped I just want the tabs to be swiped Thank you Hi Is there a way to have a different color for each indicator Each tab has a color and Id like the indicator to match that color Thank you nico Application Crashes on Continuous Sliding Page view controller and every time come up with new errors pushNotification Assertion failure in UIPageViewController queuingScrollViewdidEndManualScrolltoRevealViewdirectionanimateddidFinishdidComplete BuildRootLibraryCachescomapplexbsSourcesUIKitUIKit UIPageViewControllerm pushNotification Terminating app due to uncaught exception NSInternalInconsistencyException reason No view controller managing visible view UIView x c f frame autoresize WH layer CALayer x c ee First throw call stack x adedb x f x adec x x c a x x eb x cef x fc x f x x dea x f def x df x cee x x ac x be x be c x x b c x a c x c f x dda x c a x c x c d x c x c x c c c x c c x c x a c x a b x a x bcc x a x c e x d x a b libcabidylib terminating with uncaught exception of type NSException lldb Please Help Thanks in Advance Hello I love this project however when I have a bottom toolbar present the content in viewpager doesnt seem to account for this toolbar and is show behind it Hello Have anyone met this problem I tried to add the viewpager to my application I get the black background missing header section please see the screenshot here is the code that I initialize the HostViewController I take this code from the example screenshot in AppDelegatem BOOLapplicationUIApplication application didFinishLaunchingWithOptionsNSDictionary launchOptions HostViewController vc HostViewController alloc init selfwindow setRootViewControllervc return YES Did I make some mistake here I dont know why in the example there is no initlization code like I did I dont know where it is done it works fine Another question is the Tabs come out very slowly even in that example they get displayed after about seconds is that normal how can I optimize that My dev environnement is Xcode IOS Hi I have an app in which I want to preselect a tab before loading the entire viewPager so the ViewPagerViewController has a selectedTab property and I configure it before pushing the ViewController Then I select the tab in viewWillAppear It is working fine when executing on an iPhone but it doesnt work on iPad Has anyone a fix for it Or maybe I have forgotten something Thank you very much PD the only fix I could add for now is checking selected tab in viewDidAppear but it shows first tab and then it changes to the selected tab it doesnt work always crash steps set the ViewPagerController s data source total count is select the active page as i want to change the data source to another data source total count maybe is So i call ViewPagerController reloadData ViewPagerController crash out of range exception Root Cause is selfactiveContentIndex is still NSArray cash when call selfcontents replaceObjectAtIndexindex withObject NSNull null
