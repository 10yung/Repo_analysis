Hey Ive updated the dependencies to their latest available versions Theres two main bumps here PHPUnit x phpcsfixer x x Ive tried to port as much of the cs fixer config over but I noticed that its reordered the comparison operators in some places I hope this is ok but let me know if youd like anything changed I think there is an option for long format change show For example getting changes info from version tags within git tag For example laravelframework updated from to Changes for laravelframework Change Change Populate this list from git tag details from fromVersion to toVersion Maybe this can not be enhancement to project Let me know One thing I love about this plugin is the direct links to changelogs and diff when I run composer update this is what allow me to make sure whats going to be shipped with my application what I can improve with those new packages updates But its kind of tricky slow and breaking stuffs sometimes to run composer update just to get the list of links versions etc There is an outdated command in Composer which list all the installed packages and what versions you could upgrade with shell bash composer outdated composercabundle Lets you find a path to the system CA bundle and includes a fallback to the Mozil doctrinedoctrinebundle Symfony DoctrineBundle doctrinedoctrinemigrationsbundle v v Symfony DoctrineMigrationsBundle doctrineorm v v ObjectRelationalMapper for PHP This is super useful but it miss the links with diff and changelog this plugin provides when doing an update Could this be possible to add Cheers yellowheart from JoliCode yellowheart yum This plugin will report a URL like this where as the correct tags are
