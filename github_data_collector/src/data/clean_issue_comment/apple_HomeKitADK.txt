 Why exactly do we need to run make in a docker container Of course I understand the benefits of doing so but shouldnt it be an option when running make for the first time Something like make DOCKERBUILDy or so Both fill a buffer with cryptographically secure random numbers so why have both Wouldnt having just one be sufficient With default values for kHAPIPSessionStorageDefaultNumElements kHAPIPSessionDefaultInboundBufferSize K and kHAPIPSessionDefaultOutboundBufferSize K the RAM footprint of a basic app ends up being over M Preallocating all the buffers is safe in terms of peak memory footprint but is unacceptable for smaller platforms eg on ESP we only have K or so to work with ESP has K or so STM MCUs typically used in IoT applications have K to M of RAM total For the library to be usable on those platforms this needs to be addressed Immediate question why are buffers K in size when the HAP protocol defines maximum payload size for an HTTP request at K HomeKit Accessory Protocol Specification nonCommercial Version R section Fix compile errors in current codebase mainly unused arguments Some ObjC headers in XCode have unused arguments so those need to be excepted Hello could you please explain how the digit key is generated and whats the key for pairing the Lightbulb and Lock Application examples Ive been trying to pair the accessory for a while but with no effect App quits due to T Z Error comapplemfiHomeKitPlatformAccessorySetup No setup code found in keyvalue store Meanwhile I noticed that some files in HomeKitStore are read especially HomeKitStore which not exist so I made a try in creation this file filled with bytes I get the value from the code Now it does not quit its waiting for the digit key but I dont have even an idea what it could be Could you please help with that Im running Linux build Thanks in advance Context I am trying to compile the kit on a plain linux Kubutnu or WSL Ubuntu This post and the following comments describe the errors I get in the process and what I am trying to do to fix them Errors When simply cloning and building the kit w make on a Linux system Ubuntu WSL or Kubuntu I get a compilation error on the following step clang Wall Werror DHAPENABLEDEVELOPMENTONLYCODE ffunctionsections fdatasections IHAP IExternalHTTP IExternalJSON IExternalBase IPAL Iinclude O g DHAPLOGLEVEL DHAPTESTING IPALLinux IPALLinux DHAPDebug c HAPHAPRequestHandlersPairingc o OutputLinuxx pclinuxgnuDebugHAPHAPRequestHandlersPairingo The error is the following ApplicationsLockMainc error expected identifier or Mainc error generated BuildMakefile recipe for target OutputLinuxx pclinuxgnuDebugIPApplicationsLockMaino failed The contents of the related file ApplicationsLockMainc are the most peculiar Mainc There is indeed a Mainc in the parent directory of the file that seems normal
