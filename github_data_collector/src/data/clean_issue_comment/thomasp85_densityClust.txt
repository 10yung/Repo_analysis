Hi all l got the memory not mapped error when used the findClusters function of densityClust It works well when using K cells and it gets the error using K cells This is because of the data matrix too large The details of the error as following dclust findClustersdclust rho delta caught segfault address x fbc dad cause memory not mapped Traceback findDistValueByRowColIndxdistance attrxdistance Size i higherDensity findClustersdensityClusterdclust rho delta findClustersdclust rho delta Possible actions abort with core dump if enabled normal R exit exit R without saving workspace exit R saving workspace Hi I have a question about how to define rho and delta Based on the clustering plot obtained with plotirisClust which criteria did you use to define rho and delta It is not clear to me how to inspect the plot to define these thresholds Thank you Ana Ive been playing with a dataset that gives slightly but importantly different results across a range of values for dc This prompted me to walk through the estimateDc code to make sure I understood how it was generating a value It seems that it is iteratively finding a distance that lies between neighborRateLow and neighborRateHigh default of the distances Ive had a few cases where estimateDc enters an endless loop Do I understand it correctly that I am producing a similar estimate if I just use quantiledist which does not hang On the handful of datasets that Ive tried this produces a value very close to what I get with estimateDc but I want to make sure that I understand properly that estimateDc is just a faster way of getting an approximate quantile
