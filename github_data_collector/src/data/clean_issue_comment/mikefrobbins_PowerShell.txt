 Hi Mike Im just thinking about what would be the best way to add PowerShell v support to this awesome function Currentlythe function checks for the following paths AllUsersPath envProgramFiles WindowsPowerShell Modules CurrentUserPath envUSERPROFILE Documents WindowsPowerShell Modules Option add a switch parameter to define the powerShell version this would allow someone to run the function in both PowerShell and and the function would just return the modules listed under the provided version Option Check in which version the script runs and the just output modules of the current running powershell version What do you thiink from a function design point of view Cheers Alex
