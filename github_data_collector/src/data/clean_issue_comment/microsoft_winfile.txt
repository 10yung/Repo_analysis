Not an issue but an tip from an old user that I think needs to be documented There is a setting to save current settings on exit but if you setup the appearance the way you like it you have two options to have it open in the save way Set save settings on exit to yes then save and reopen app and turn this setting off Hold down shift key and right doubleclick the upper left icon of the file image This will save the current settings to the default Even though the original Winfile had it Here one MDI child has ClientEdge and the other does not Clipboard Ive made this work using Resource Hacker so I can achieve clean DPI levels on Winfile Default DPI Feature request to add file directory browse buttons to various fields This is mainly for dialogs that are opened from the FILE menu I think it would be appropriate for these dialogs File move File copy File run File goto directory File search Shortcut key for Create New Folder CTRLSHIFTN like in Windows Explorer Creation Date column in detail view as currently there is only date modified Header in Details view to sort Name Date Size etc just like in Windows Explorer Should be able to short ascending and descending It would be nice if I could start the file manager from the command line using the winfile command
