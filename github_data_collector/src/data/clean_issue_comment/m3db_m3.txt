The script which checks the dbnode pod readiness binm dbnodebootstrappedsh does not correctly check the placement The command used to check the placement here the variables are already substituted and some parameters dropped for readability is curl jq e placementinstances m dbclusterrep this will always fail since the resulting json looks different at least in our case heres an excerpt curl s jq e placementinstances head name m dbclusterrep id name m dbclusterrep isolationGroup europewest b zone embedded weight endpoint m dbclusterrep m dbnodem dbcluster shards id like described here you match against the property which in our case is name m dbclusterrep since the readiness script always returns Host not present in topology which is not true we are having a hard time upgrading the underlying kubernetes cluster because one node after another get upgraded even though nodes are still bootstrapping What this PR does why we need it If you have an issue this change addresses please
