Although its quite slow to compress images with gruetzli it usually gives best compression ratio at a quality of See Hey toy I am not sure if you have seen it but OxiPng is a rewrite of OptiPNG that supports multithreading and written in a safer language rust I do not know if they are to compatible but maybe it would be worth looking into their benchmarks looks promising an option to keep tags and comments when optimizing so that only image data is optimized I had an idea to save extended attributes files on the file system so that when the next task on a large directory is recognized from files that have already been optimized the attribute can store a hash or bitmask of the metadata file attributes of the leading optimization pass of the imageoptim utility Linux getfattr setfattr BSD getextattr lsextattr rmextattr setextattr macOS xattr Please add support for ffmpeg or ImageMagickImageMagick conversion of animated GIFs to the more space efficient WEBM MP or Both while i would like the application to create both and keep the smaller or the results some people might prefer one or the other of the formats or both if trying to cover all bases for a website i have seen mb files shrink to less then k so savings can be significant some people might not want to convert animated GIFs so having it disabled by default would be fine Add support for lossy option on giflossy giflossy is a fork of gifsicle which support lossy compression I installed imageoptim on my Raspberry and find that I cant use imageoptim because of an encoding error that sadly comes without any stacktrace I remembered that Ruby had some encoding issues in older versions so I made sure that I have ruby installed I removed the existing imageoptim and reinstalled with sudo gem install imageoptimpack imageoptim But the error still persists flowraspitmpkbtest imageoptim donttouchmejpg invalid byte sequence in UTF Thats all I get as output except theres now a mysteriouslynamed file in the directory flowraspitmpkbtest ls AlF total rwrwr flow flow Jul The questionmarks are really replacement characters using my Linux Mint file browser over sshfs I can see that the first byte is x and the one right before the second is x The weird thing is that I can install and run imageoptim on my Linux Mint box without errors so the error should be caused by a difference between the two systems not imageoptim per se Heres what uname a gives me Linux raspi v SMP Tue Dec GMT armv l armv l armv l GNULinux How can I proceed from here hi when I use imageoptimpack no problem but when I want to use system gifsicle ubuntu i have this error Failed to manipulate with rmagick maybe it is not an image I tried with default ubuntu version and then with version I installed muself and but still same problem I tried by installing it to usrlocalbin first and then usrbin I could use imageoptimpack but I notice a lot of random other issues on jpg and pnd i could not reproduice but users of my website told me Last week I was still using imageoptimizer gem and I didnt have any problem with system gifsicle any idea thank tmp files useful for environments where a foreground task and background task are run by different users Hello This is my take at implementing support for Guetzli At this time there are a few compatibility issues that come with it x It has no support in the imageoptimpack yet x It depends on gflags which requires a version of CMake that is unavailable in Ubuntu Travis CI runs by default Dependency removed upstream x It fails to link on OS X Yosemite But this has been fixed upstream I have not tested it at all on Windows I have not tested it at all on BSD
