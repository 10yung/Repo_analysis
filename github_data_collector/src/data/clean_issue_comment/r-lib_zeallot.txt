I discovered this large mistake last week The version of zeallot formally supporting R was never uploaded to CRAN In Javascript we can do javascript var o p q true var p foo q bar o consolelogfoo consolelogbar true let a b rest a b c d a b rest c d I realize that in R while named list resembles a hash map it is indeed ordered Maybe something like this r lista b listb a a b
