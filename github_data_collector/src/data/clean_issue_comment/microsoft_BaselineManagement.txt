Using BaselineManagement to convert GPOs to PS for import into DSC configurations seems to convert the policy correctly and specified the PowerShellAccessControl module to import into DSC Azure State Configuration doesnt have this module and trying to import the module gives the error OrchestratorSharedAsyncModuleImportModuleImportException An error occurred during module validation The module wont import into powershell either Grabbing the V preview module fails with the error OrchestratorSharedAsyncModuleImportModuleImportException Cannot import the module of name PowerShellAccessControlv preview as the module structure was invalid Is there a version which can be imported and used or would BaselineManagement need fundamental changes to allow GPOs converted to be imported as DSC configurations Thanks in advance These conversion tools are great good work But why not provide the DSC Configurations by default with pester tests UserRightsAssignment UserRightsAssignmentINF

these two items If I modify the lines in the GptTmplinf and replace the quotes with just single quotes everything works prefect In the short term ill look into getting our legal banner to not have the extra quotes Im sure thatll be fine I wanted to report the issue in case other ran into it In this example it is wrapping the Arrays is this expected behaviour Also a switch to use space indentation
