Dear simplesteph How can I export more enviroment like as KAFKAOPTS also for config security SASLPLAINTEXT and SCRAMSHA I dont see anything which relate to config it Thank you kafkatopics bootstrapserver list is not working How do I add a connector to this Could you show an example with S I am new to using docker and kafka connect Now I am creating my own kafka cluster and kafka connect cluster on the local machine with docker compose Here is the scenario I am using JDBC connector to connect from DB DB to Oracle DB and sync up my data The volume of the data can be more than million so after generating the source sink connector how to checkmonitorverify if all the dataeg million data move into topics properly and move out to sink DB properly without any error If there is any error for example missing some data how may I identify that data I know this might be some very easy questions but again I am very new here so please share the idea Thanks I forgot to set the DOCKERHOSTIP environment variable before launching the stack by dockercompsoe f zksinglekafkasingleyml up d It did launched and everything seemed alright until I wrote a consumer in PHP using librdkafka and phprdkafka The php code wasnt able to connect to kafka instance Upon checking the kafka logs in the stack dockercompose f zksinglekafkasingleyml I see this WARN SocketServer brokerId

kafkanetworkProcessorpollSocketServerscala at kafkanetworkProcessorrunSocketServerscala at javalangThreadrunThreadjava I couldnt figure this out for couple of hours until I stopped the stack set the DOCKERHOSTIP env var and starting the stack up again It worked perfectly after IMO you can provide a entrypoint script which can halt the startup if env var is unavailable or if possible can use the DNS if provided Hello Im trying to use it in a NAT network with Vbox steps dockercompose f zksinglekafkasingleyml down export DOCKERHOSTIP rm rf zksinglekafkasingle dockercompose f
