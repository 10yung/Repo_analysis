 would be nice to support it Hi Pierrre Im a golangdevops newbie I have a Node JS webapplication and chatbot that uses this repository as the golang image server to handle all the images processing with file cache system The image server is deployed in instances and load balanced I predict that my current setup serveshandles about to imagesrequests per day in various sizes Hard to tell what the number is exactly About weeks ago I noticed that a lot of my images were loading extremely slow and turning up broken At that point I upgraded both my instances from micro to vCPU GB mem That actually solved the problem easily Fast forward to now Im starting to notice some slow loading images again and saw the broken images issue once or twice only Could I please get some advice and tips from you for devops and scaling I have never really had to handle scaling before and Im not sure how and what data to look at to measure if my instances resources are sufficient For example this may sound really dumb but when I look at the monitoring section in Google Cloud Platform the CPU only peaks at to max and Im unsure if Im looking at the right numbers Thank you kindly in advance
