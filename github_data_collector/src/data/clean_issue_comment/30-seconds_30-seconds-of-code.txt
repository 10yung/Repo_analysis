Hey Here is an improved I think version of this snippet js const remove arr f return arrreduceacc v if fv accpushv return acc Please let me know if I should move forward with a PR NOTE The index and array args to the function seemed superfluous and just incidental to the original implementation but I might be able to keep them if necessary Also I would suggest making this function do the opposite remove the elements that the predicate returns true for Eg Clojures remove function behaves that way Thanks Chris This can stay here until we make a proper version with nice graphics wdyt Chalarangelo Use a descriptive title prefix it with FIX FEATURE or ENHANCEMENT if applicable use only one Description Write a detailed description of your changesadditions here If your PR resolves an issue please state Resolves issue number to help maintainers process it faster If you think your PR will cause breaking changes require changes in the documentation etc please be so kind as to explain what where and how PR Type Snippets Tests Tags new snippets updated snippets retagging of snippets addedupdated tests Tools Scripts Automation anything related to files in the scripts folder Gatsby website Travis CI or Netlify General Typos Misc Meta everything related to content typos general stuff and meta files in the repository eg the issue template x Other please specifiy in the description above Guidelines x I have read the guidelines in the CONTRIBUTING document Use a descriptive title prefix it with FIX FEATURE or ENHANCEMENT if applicable use only one Description Write a detailed description of your changesadditions here Added a new snippet that calculates angle between two vectors If your PR resolves an issue please state Resolves issue number to help maintainers process it faster If you think your PR will cause breaking changes require changes in the documentation etc please be so kind as to explain what where and how PR Type x Snippets Tests Tags new snippets updated snippets retagging of snippets addedupdated tests Tools Scripts Automation anything related to files in the scripts folder Gatsby website Travis CI or Netlify General Typos Misc Meta everything related to content typos general stuff and meta files in the repository eg the issue template Other please specifiy in the description above Guidelines x I have read the guidelines in the CONTRIBUTING document saw this one today There is a native way of doing the same thing via Objectentries Description A clear and concise description of what you want to discuss So our function arrayToHtmlList is in a pretty bad space and could use an update We already had some discussion over at but I wanted to move the update discussion over to an issue for more visibility Current problem It uses an awkward query selector instead of the documentprototypegetElementByID function and it uses an IIFE to declare an intermediate variable closure when we could do with just API chaining the return values Another issue is we are just forcing it inside a list item We could easily allow a formatter to be passed as the last argument with the map footprint and a default that wont change functionality however the change in footprint because a bit awkward as it becomes data binding callback but it was an old monster to begin with With those two issues in mind we should look at either updating or cleaning up the snippet so it is more maintainable than its current form or decide to leave as it
