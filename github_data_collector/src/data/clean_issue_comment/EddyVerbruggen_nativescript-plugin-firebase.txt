I am trying to juggle two things in my app related to notifications Is the device registered with a push token and Does the device have a onMessageReceivedCallback registered I am fairly certain how to check for a push token messaginggetCurrentPushToken But I am unsure how to check if a callback is currently registered I tried consolelogtypeof messagingonMessageReceivedCallback but that doesnt seem to work I am trying to avoid spamming google with constant registrations To do this I believe I either need to check the status of the onMessageReceivedCallback OR be able to register only the part of my registerForPushNotifications function that wont spam google OR I need to just not care about constantly phoning home What is the best practice for making sure your app is registered and receiving notifications When I try to run a reauthenticate I am getting an error Here is my code const firebaseWebApi requirenativescriptpluginfirebaseapp viewModelreauthenticate emailcurrentPasswordnewPassword return firebaseWebApireauthenticate type firebaseWebApiLoginTypePASSWORD passwordOptions email email password currentPassword then function result return viewModelupdatePasswordnewPassword function error return error everything else works in the firebase plugin I got the code from the reauthentication section of the docs here Hi first of all thank you for the amazing work with this plugin I am using fcm for an app in ios and android built with nativescript angular It works perfectly on androidemulator and device but in ios only works in simulator Here is my code appcomponentts constructor LocalNotificationsLocalNotificationsaddOnMessageReceivedCallbacknotificationData consolelogNotification received JSONstringifynotificationData ngOnInit void firebaseinit showNotifications true showNotificationsWhenInForeground true onPushTokenReceivedCallback token consolelog Firebase onPushTokenReceivedCallback token iftoken

LocalNotificationsLocalNotificationsschedule thumbnail true title messagetitle body messagebody forceShowWhenInForeground true then consolelogalert catcherror consolelogdoScheduleId WithInput error error then consolelog Firebase Initialized catcherror consolelog Firebase Initialize error As you can see i am using local notifications plugin to display notifications I think i made all the steps needed to make this work but still no changes Is there any reason why it works on simulator but not in a real device simulator iphone pro real device iphone XS max I am currently debugging duplicate services in an angular application It seems as if they are caused by opening a push notification in a suspended android app This seems to cause a partial reinitialization of the app and a new AppComponent as well as dependend services which leads to problems with Routing and Navigation as well as state in the services I reproduced this behaviour in a demo app In the following logs you can see that Installing on device FA B A Successfully installed on device with identifier FA B A Restarting application on device FA B A Successfully synced application orgnativescriptpushdemo on device

to work It seems users using flutter are experiencing the same issue due to deprecated Google Pod Nativescript version Does anyone have this issue Thanks a lot Hello We use the latest version of this

I dont pass notification information in the notification builder but pass my information as data and therefore with the help of onMessageReceivedCallback I can use nativescriptlocalnotifications to show the notifications Unfortunately when the message is received in the background this doesnt work The only way so far I could receive notifications in the background is to use the initial way of showing the notification by passing the title and body in the notification builder FYI I need to use nativescriptlocalnotifications in the first place is because on some devices eg Xiaomi phones all the notifications from this plugin go to the miscellaneous channel and have low priority With nativescriptlocalnotifications I can set a custom channel and force a priority if I need to I cant seem to find a way to add an image to iOS cloud messaging push notifications Is this supported
