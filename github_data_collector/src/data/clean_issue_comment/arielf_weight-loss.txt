Hi Ariel I have created a Dockerfile which installs all the dependencies required to run this script and also updated the Makefile to add some make docker commands I renamed the file arielcsv to rootcsv due to it looking for the username mv arielcsv rootcsv Then I run the following make command make dockerscorechart or the abbreviated command is make dsc It will then build the docker container if it doesnt exist and then generate the scorestxt and rootscorespng files I was hoping to be able to use your repository to help with doing similar machinelearning but with Irritable Bowel Syndrome IBS Symptoms Instead of adding in weight we instead add in a digestive symptom score which is calculated by an app called Cara The symptom score is calculated on the basis of the symptoms tracked with Cara The value can be between and The higher the symptom score the more severe are the digestive problems in the region There was a discussion earlier today on Reddit about using Machine Learning to troubleshoot IBS symptoms and it reminded me of your Weight Loss machine learning repository I looked at a while ago any way let me know what you think I think I must have collected the data wrong but heres the SO question Heres an example of the data format I tried to mimic arielcsv DateMorningWeightYesterdayFactors salad sleep cheese egg halfnhalf sleep tea grape bagel bread date dietsnapple splenda pizza nosleep coffeecandy cheese rice salmon peanut bread Heres what my data looks like datetrophiescharacters NescalRdical UQP UYLR friendly battle friendly battle friendly battle friendly battle friendly battle miner minionhorde electrowizard thelog hogrider snowspirits princess zap ARTURO QRPRCU J friendly battle friendly battle goblingang barbarians minionhorde wizard miner giant zap minipekka skeletonhorde goblingang rocket minion prince goblinbarrel princess zap goblingang archers rocket rage wizard chrballoon angrybarbarian zap friendly battle friendly battle friendly battle friendly battle friendly battle friendly battle friendly battle friendly battle friendly battle friendly battle friendly battle friendly battle firefireball babydragon rage minionhorde freeze angrybarbarian zap infernodragon friendly battle executioner rage tornado electrowizard angrybarbarian hogrider bomber thelog skeletonhorde valkyrie electrowizard thelog hogrider goblinbarrel icewizard princess goblingang firespirithut minion valkyrie musketeer lightning royalgiant zap tilted CVLCY friendly battle friendly battle friendly battle friendly battle executioner firefireball giant goblinarcher angrybarbarian megaminion princess zap friendly battle skeletonhorde firefireball babydragon valkyrie musketeer hogrider zap infernodragon Edit Do you think I should reset the counter to it increases or decreases by for win or lose with every new player Example playerName playerID arbitrarydate NOTE Erased characters on every first game because they impact the score of a game before Might be easier to explain with math No n characters on the first line because n game is missing samedate a b c d e f g h samedate a b c d e f g h playerName playerID samedate Go back to zero here samedate a b c d e f g h samedate a b c d e f g h Hey Ariel I saw that youre answering questions through issues I hope this is the best way to reach you I love this project Im using it on Clash Royale like this goblinarcher firefireball goblins minion knight royalgiant hogrider princess giant firespirithut minion chrwitch barbarians miner icewizard zap barbarians miner wizard chrwitch princess royalgiant thelog zap Everythings working great I can generate a score chart and see the best cards overall But what I noticed in usernametrain is something like this giant valkyrie minionhorde ragebarbarian chrwitch lightning bomber zap Im assuming those are the most commonly played cards Or is that the best possible deck combination because it has the greatest negative weight meaning it wins against the player more frequently than any other combination I guess Im asking the significance of the number on the left and how the features are chosen on the right side and from there I can work toward finding the best card combination Thanks for any help you can provide Love this N work Ive done Atkins and took my weight from to but since then Im back around and looking to kickstart my own journey Would love to hear what youve learned since mid
