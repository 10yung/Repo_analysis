Dear mkdynamic and other maintainers Im a frequent user of this gem Most of the project I worked on till now this was an essential part You guys really did a great job creating and maintaining this gem We really appreciate it as a community I can understand life happens priorities change and someone cannot focus on the same thing all the time Im really interested in taking the wheel and maintaining the gem until life happens to me as well Looking forward to hearing from you guys Version Released May Available until July Facebook graph API is now at V and this gem current graph version is v and will be deprecated on Nov will there be any updates on this gem anytime soon is there an alternative to this gem Hi all I have been struggling for a long while trying to determine the correct approach to use the omniauthfacebook gem I am running my API on port while my frontend in my case coded on ReactJS is running on port As per what I have been researching this is a common issue but there is not a clear answer nor documentation here I am not expecting to use any additional SDK as I understand that this gem should handle all I need to simply login through FB When manually running on the browser hhtplocalhost authfacebook I can see on Rails console that route is being hit and things are moving forward as expected also I am seeing that callback route is hit and I am getting back a JSON with UID client and authtoken However when trying to reach this through my react app I am getting a CORS error I am simply making an AXIOSgetauthfacebook which gets routed into my API as I have configured the proxy to pass calls received on my frontend into the API My console seems to be hit by my request as I am seeing the following However on the Chrome console I am seeing a CORS issue as per the following image For sure I have already tried adding the following code snippet and still getting the same error Having said this could someone answe rme the following questions a which is the expected way to trigger the initial call into authfacebook route Kindly do not FW me to read the main repo doc as it does not say this solution there b has someone solved the present issue on a way which is not by adding a link into Would this be a correct approach It sounds weird to me Let me know your comments Thanks in advance Alejandro Configuration Provider Gem omniauthfacebook Other Gems devise omniauthgoogleoauth Ruby Version Framework rails rc Expected Behavior Authentication to facebook or googleoauth should succeed returning requestenv omniauthauth I followed the Devise guide to integrate with Omniauth here taking into account Omniauths recommendations when integrating into a Rails API here Actual Behavior Clientside I am able to connect to facebook or googleoauth with OmniAuth But serverside but I get an Authentication failure In the rails console I have different error messages for Facebook and for Google as I request different authentication strategies using Onetime Code Flow Hybrid Authentication with Google For Facebook ERROR omniauth facebook Authentication failure noauthorizationcode OmniAuthStrategiesFacebookNoAuthorizationCodeError must pass either a code via URL or by an fbsrXXX signed request cookie For Google ERROR omniauth googleoauth Authentication failure csrfdetected OmniAuthStrategiesOAuth CallbackError csrfdetected CSRF detected I found kind of a workaround by adding providerignoresstate true in the Devise initializer but it doesnt seem to be secure

social credentials end end end By using React and Facebook SDK inside it to authenticate in XHR things have been not nice to set a cookie To overcome this issue Ive patched the signed request to check it both in cookie and params That way the signedrequest can be sent as a param to perform the same way as it would if one had the cookie set Hi Im trying to register login with my React frontend On the front end I use the reactfaceboologin component On the response I get the response I add to the callback url codesignedRequest and pass the response as the POST body On the Rails side I get the
