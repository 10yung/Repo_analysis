Just a little typo in the documentation one of the options for linejoin is mintre instead of mitre Thanks for the great package Not quite sure how to make a reprex for this problem Im having and have checked previous issues to see if its been run into before but Im attempting to use repositionlegend along with facetrepgrid When I do this it appears to be placing the legend behind the grid effect Is there a way so that the legend will be placed on top I have tried changing the fill of the legendbox just in case if it was making the box transparent but it does not look to be the case Here is a pic to show what I mean Terribly sorry to not have a reprex to show you but here is my code just incase librarytidyverse librarylubridate librarylemon wmt readcsv sts tibblestateabb stateregion wmtcount wmt mutateOPENDATE mdyOPENDATE year yearOPENDATE countyear STRSTATE leftjoinsts by cSTRSTATE stateabb mutatestateregion fctrelevelstateregion cSouth North Central West Northeast STRSTATE fctreorderSTRSTATE year min desc T p ggplotwmtcount aesx year y n fill stateregion geombarstat identity facetrepgridSTRSTATE scalexcontinuouslabels c breaks c expand c scaleysqrt scalefillmanualvalues cdd d b e fac e aef labstitle The Growth of Walmart Store Openings by Year and State thememinimal themeaxistitle elementblank axistexty elementblank axisline elementline axisliney elementblank axislinex elementlinelinetype dashed color lightgrey legendtitle elementblank striptexty elementtextangle hjust color grey size panelgrid elementblank text elementtextcolor grey legendbackground elementrectfill white color white repositionlegendp top left panel panel If legend is not given and the plot object is not ggplot repositionlegend fails We should at least attempt to extract the guidebox from the gtable object remove the guidebox grob from the gtable object Problem Replacing the guidebox grob with eg a zeroGrob will leave an empty space should we Set the widthheight of that cell to depending on it being leftright or topbottom Add another bloody argument to control that behaviour The issue first appears when rendering the plots It does not appear to be a rounding error as changing the distance argument to other units affects the outcome libraryggplot librarylemon datasunspotyear sunspots dataframecountasnumericsunspotyear yearseqintstartsunspotyear endsunspotyear sunspots subsetsunspots year ggplotsunspots aesxyear ycount geompointlinedistanceunit pt labsmaingeompointline pointline small big It can as best be described that if the offset connector point of a point extends past the corresponding connector point in the connecting point in either horisontal or vertical distance this appears But determining whether this is the case is difficult because comparisons of unit cannot be done To find a strip any grob with a particular label Question is what to return It is essentially a treepath to the grob
