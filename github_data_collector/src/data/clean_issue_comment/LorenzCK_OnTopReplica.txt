I want to use this program because its supposed to be better then picture in picture mod But if I use webpage tab and there is a video if I minimize the video it will not be playing for me The picture will basically froze Same goes for pictureinpicture mod If apply pip video first of all I will have versions of this page then pip will be on top of every app and at last only your app will be able to click through PS why every time when I minimize apps I have to apply click through option on your app After enabling Advanced Click Forwarding Whenever I click on the ontopreplica window nothing happens and my ongoing application is deselected and ontopreplica window comes into focus couldnt find where to submit feature requests It would be cool if we could choose a color to key out make transparent much like the color key filter in OBS studio so for example If were watching some numbers I could select the region around my numbers then key out the background Then my window just shows the numbers rather than a black rectangle with numbers so it would like like the images attached for example before before after after Its bugged somehow and OTR window moved outside of visible display area I tried reinstall delete registry use keys altspacem to get move menu called use keys winKeyarrows switch display to portrait mode turn onoff display turn onoff second display nothing helps As it is now ontop replica will not overlay when non windowed fullscreen games are playing Clickthrough is set but sometimes I will click the taskbar item incorrectly I need reset the clickthrough again I hope that add the function about tray display and hide the item on the taskbar I was seeing if it was possible to get this to work in fullscreen and I saw you said this about it This is probably much harder than it looks like since Windows windowing manager does not work as usual when another application takes over in fullscreen mode I will look into it however I understand it is a very useful usecase I just wanted to mention that there was an experimental firefox feature that I dont think got added called minvid I used to use it a lot and it would work in fullscreen Just putting this out there so maybe you can look into it Hey just as the title says does anyone know the command line arguments to open a specific window This tool is very useful in videogames such as Overwatch whose doesnt allow the user to modify the UI I was wondering if is doable to make the region selection less limited to a single rectangle but on multiple rectangles Let me attach an image to illustrate untitled Thanks And good work
