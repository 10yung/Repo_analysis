channel of F with an explicit error channel implemented as a Ref F Option Throwable The raiseError behavior in the reducer would previously cross concurrent boundaries thus resulting in nondeterministic thread cancellation thus resulting in pesky concurrency bugs Basically if the process is P Q and P throws an error raiseError is used to shortcircuit P Whats different now is that instead of letting raiseError try to cancel Q we use a Ref to signal to Q that an error has been thrown This is obviously not replayable it assumes a deployment policy wherein any program that throws an error elects to forfeit all of the REV that the deployment is allocated Overview TODO JIRA ticket Notes supOptional Add any notes on caveats approaches you tried that didnt work or anything elsesup
