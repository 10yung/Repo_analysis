There have been rails and heroku failing tests for a very long time See for a history of failed tests for pull requests Lets say you have appkey eGu HKkiec in your applicationyml When calling Figaroenvappkey Figaro will display the value as e Gu HKkiec which does not match what is the config file because of escape character Figaro needs to be improved to remove the escape characters Lets say you have appkey eGu HKkiec in your applicationyml When calling Figaroenvappkey Figaro will display the value as e Gu HKkiec which does not match what is the config file because of escape character Figaro needs to be improved to remove the escape characters Ive used Figaro for years on Heroku and am even using it at present with Capistrano Im not a fan of Rails encrypted secrets and even with the Rails enhancements it is not as easy to use and fullfeatured as Figaro What is the status of this project I see there is a v branch but it has been quiet for a while Do you need some help to get this released laserlemon I heart Figaro I not found any proposals on this Is it possible to introduce herarchical structure Currently we in able to make linear list of settingsvariables excepting environments I think it will be helpful to be able to avoid repeating for some settings like yml databasehost localhost databasename postgrdb databaseuser postgrusr databasepass or deployuser root deployport deployserver examplecom deploydir varwwwdomain deploybranch master It might be look like this yml database host localhost name postgrdb user postgrusr pass or deploy user root port server examplecom dir varwwwdomain branch master This is only for definition things I think its need to be merged into single string variables as well as previously deployuser although it may be available and by the new way In this case the first level keywords like development production or test can work as previously to define environment yml production database user produser pass prodpass This feature will especially helpful for some developers who uses variables prefixed with an app name like yml appdatabasename dbname etc Thank you smile I added the configuration in configapplicationyml file KEYCLOAKREALM aaadev then I try to use it in configkeycloakyml file realm ENV KEYCLOAKREALM but it seems not working any suggestions Hello Thanks for Figaro Im thinking about moving one of my apps from Heroku to Elastic Beanstalk on AWS Figaro seems to be Herokufocused As far as I can see I have a few options to make Figaro work on Elastic Beanstalk Copy the environment variables into my Elastic Beanstalk environment onebyone Id like to avoid doing this if possible because I have a lot of them and it is bound to be errorprone Just remove applicationyml from the gitignore file I havent tested this yet but this seems like the route of least resistance It obviously undercuts the whole purpose of using Figaro in the first place though Generate a remote configuration file You mention this is in the docs but I cant see any examples Im not sure what this means Could you elaborate a bit on how Figaro could retrieve a file from an S bucket for example Thanks Tom Is it currently possible to control what in the applicationyml file after running figaro install Ive looked around docs but cant find anything conclusive Eg instead of it looking like Add configuration values here as shown below pusherappid pusherkey a f dd f a pushersecret abdc b a ffb d stripeapikey sktest J l xOyW XUYJHE Dv r stripepublishablekey pktestro jV SNwGb yYlQfzG LHK production stripeapikey skliveEeHnL i zo Iyq v KdV H having custom contents like custokey customkey a f dd f a Hi When I run figaro herokuset e production and figaro herokuset I have Could not find command herokuset I tried few versions of figaro like gem figaro gem figaro github sealocalfigaro gem figaro rc gem figaro Then bundle install bundle binstubs figaro figaro install spring stop but the command is still not found Versions ruby gem rails Ive done some search and try a lot of things without find any solution Hello Im trying to push my applicationyml keys to heroku with the command figaro herokuset e production but Im getting the following error Please specify a version along with Herokus API MIME type For example Accept applicationvndherokujson version Im on Ubuntu Ive tried to reinstall heroku as a standalone and through npm still getting the same error halp
