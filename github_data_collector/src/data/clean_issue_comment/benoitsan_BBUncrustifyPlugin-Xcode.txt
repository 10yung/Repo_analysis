 Format as shown Hi there Id like to know if there are any plans to port this plugin as a Xcode extension not sure its Xcode issue or BBUncrustifyPluginXcode issue pls see this gif for detail untitled I think it will be nice if the settings could be loaded from a configuration file inside the project This because in some project you want to format on save and some other project you dont When build the project also saves it but it not formatting Might you add a configuration to format the project when it is generated Tanks
