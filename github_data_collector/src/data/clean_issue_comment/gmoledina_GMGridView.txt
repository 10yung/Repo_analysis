Great projectfor sure But I have an issue when adding custom view on the GMGridViewCell object and try to perform an animation I add one rotation animation on my image view This image view is added on a GMGridViewCell Animationrepeatcount is set to max however the repeat count is random Could you please give me an answer how to fix this GMGridViewCell GMGridViewGMGridView gridView cellForItemAtIndexNSIntegerindex GMGridViewCell cell gridView dequeueReusableCell cell GMGridViewCell alloc init cellbackgroundColor UIColor colorWithHexStrf f f alpha NSString sceneStr selfscenesArray objectAtIndexindex AndLinkNewRootSceneItemView sceneItemView AndLinkNewRootSceneItemView alloc initWithFrameCGRectMake cellframesizewidth cellframesizeheight scenesceneStr cell addSubviewsceneItemView selfsceneItemViewList addObjectsceneItemView return cell import AndLinkNewRootSceneItemViewm voidaddanimation CABasicAnimation animation self spinAnimationWithDuration clockwiseYES repeatYES animationdelegate self selfcurSceneImageViewlayer addAnimationanimation forKeyrotationAnimation CABasicAnimation spinAnimationWithDurationCGFloatduration clockwiseBOOLclockwise repeatBOOLrepeats CABasicAnimation anim CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPathtransformrotationz animtoValue clockwise MPI MPI animduration duration animcumulative YES animautoreverses YES animremovedOnCompletion NO animrepeatCount repeats CGFLOATMAX return anim the CGFLOATMAX doesnt work The image link in READMEmd is broken Exporting the UIGestureRecognizerGMGridViewAdditionsh and UIViewGMGridViewAdditionsh file so that user can use the static lib and the headers instead of the whole project Another delegate method added so that user could set which cellindex they want to moveable i am using button in GMgridviewCell like order cart button but when ever i am clicking that button first didTapOnItemAtIndex delegate method is called after that only button action is called Hello This is a mostly mechanical diff to make GMGridView compatible with Swift while using ObjectiveC Bridging Basically delegate method names beginning in TYPEGMGridViewGMGridView gridView collide with the class name Also as per Cocoa Guidelines I stripped the GM prefix from method names so the new methods look like this TYPEgridViewGMGridView gridView ciao Luca Maybe you can join a group function NSInteger positionToLoad GMGridViewCell cell self newItemSubViewForPositionpositionToLoad self addSubviewcell Whether should change to this NSInteger positionToLoad GMGridViewCell cell self newItemSubViewForPositionpositionToLoad positionToLoad self addSubviewcell gridviewedityeshow to use sortingdelegate Hey I have been using GMGridView recently and have noticed that from time to time a cell with an image will get stuck on the screen while dragging the cell to a new location The image will stay stuck in front of all views on in the app The only way to remove it is to close the app and restart it I havent gone looking for the cause of the problem yet and thought I would post this here first If I find a solution I will post it here too Thanks
