WPSEOCapabilityUtilsgetapplicableroles added to the free codebase because they are needed in premium In premium we call them three times in the same class There is no need to have them in free for now and therefore it would be wise to move this methods to the class that needs the methods To reduce complexity and unexpected behaviour it would be nice to not have this methods as public static utils This will improve the testability When there is need to have them available as utilities we can decided to make them act like utilities But that is a decision that needs to be made when the situation asks for it Todo Move the methods to the premium class Stop having them public and static Also move the tests for these to premium indexables feature build was taken from yoastdist Make sure that Open

Roadmap issue Please use this template when creating an issue Please check the boxes after youve created your issue Please use the latest version of Yoast SEO x Ive read and understood the contribution guidelines x Ive searched for any related issues and avoided creating a duplicate issue Please give us a description of what happened Splitting this out from Users are not supposed to know what terms like pagination or paging mean The related WordPress setting just says Break comments into pages and doesnt mention pagination at all The current wording used in the plugin is potentially confusing and Id like to propose to avoid terms like pagination or paging entirely Please describe what you expected to happen and why A simpler clearer wording How can we reproduce this behavior go the WordPress Discussion Settings and make sure Break comments into pages is checked go to the Site Health page see the related test img width altScreenshot at src see the text Paging comments is enabled the current term paging sounds more related to computer memory management pagination would be more correct but its still a technical term a simpler clearer text should maybe just use the same wording used by WordPress for its setting eg Comments break into multiple pages Technical info You can check these boxes once youve created the issue If you are using Gutenberg or the Classic Editor plugin please make sure you have updated to the latest version Used versions WordPress version NA Yoast SEO version trunk RC Additional info Checking some translations I see in most of the cases paging comments is translated as comments pagination For example Original English string Paging comments is enabled Italian La paginazione dei commenti French La pagination des commentaires Spanish Est activada la paginaci n de los comentarios The related WordPress setting is translated as follows Original English string Break comments into pages with top level comments per page Italian Dividi i commenti in pagine con commenti di primo livello per pagina French Diviser les commentaires en pages avec commentaires de premier niveau par page Spanish Separa los comentarios en p ginas de comentarios por p gina Dutch Reacties over meerdere paginas verdelen met reacties per pagina
