There is a for hope this is the right place to report this ramnathv Is it possible to randomize the quiz questions and answers options Hi I apologise if this issue has already been addressed elsewhere How do I add separator slides You know slides that mark the boundaries of segments in the presentation deck My slidify presentation looks great when I knit it and view it in RStudio or when I open it in my browser via RStudio However when I publish it to RPubs I get a blank page Having searched for a fix the advice is to change mode selfcontained to mode standalone in my Rmd file and also to create a file called RProfile in the working directory containing the indexRmd file that gets knitted which contains only the line optionsrpubsuploadmethod internal Making these changes has achieved nothing Also I know I can publish to RPubs because Ive published other stuff there Where do I go from here I think I am running into the same issue as issue However when I try adding libcdn the problem is not resolved To be clear my slides render in RStudio preview but not when I pop into browser When I run slidify I observe the same problem just a blank white screen It would be really nice to get this working otherwise Ill need to convert to a different framework in a very short time period Im reusing an old deck for an updated presentation Thank you UPDATE I also tried downloading the directory you mention in and load that instead of the git directory however that produces the same behavior Also this is all with mode selfcontained When I switch to standalone everything including the RStudio preview is blank UPDATE I have also tried publishing to git and then downloading the directory Still the same behavior I also noticed that the the source for the HTML is present however it is just not rendering UPDATE My git repo is here UPDATE I am now able to view the presentation in a browser And I am able to open and view the indexhtml file generated by slidify However I am developing on a remote machine When I download the deck directory I still see a blank html file even though the html code is present Note I can only preview in browser when mode selfcontained Hi I am building a slidify deck now but I got error saying Error in functionlist k value object GGally not found after I run this vn asdataframe ggpairs heres the sessioninfo R version Platform x w mingw x bit Running under Windows x build Matrix products default locale LCCOLLATEEnglishPhilippines LCCTYPEEnglishPhilippines LCMONETARYEnglishPhilippines LCNUMERICC LCTIMEEnglishPhilippines attached base packages stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base other attached packages GGally gridExtra DT fpp ggplot expsmooth fma forecast slidify loaded via a namespace and not attached progress zoo reshape lattice colorspace htmltools yaml rlang pillar RColorBrewer TTR plyr quantmod stringr timeDate munsell gtable htmlwidgets evaluate labeling knitr tseries httpuv lmtest crosstalk parallel curl markdown xts Rcpp xtable scales backports jsonlite mime fracdiff digest stringi shiny grid rprojroot quadprog tools magrittr lazyeval tibble whisker prettyunits rsconnect assertthat reshape rmarkdown R nnet compiler Does anyone know how I can code slidify for music I have an original and I have the remix and I want to use slidify to go back and forth between the two Thank you Is this project abandoned Im looking for an as easy as possible way to publish RMarkdown presentations to github but couldnt set it up properly Each time I try publish Im shown a github page saying page is not there and that theres been switch in address Subdomains of githubcom are deprecated for GitHub Pages They will not redirect to githubio for new GitHub Pages sites I want to insert a chemical formula in the text for example bla bla H SO bla bla I have tried to insert latex formula in the text bla bla chemH SO bla bla but it didnt displayed correctry
