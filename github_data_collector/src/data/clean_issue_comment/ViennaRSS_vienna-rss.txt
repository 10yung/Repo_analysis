Often times I will want to mark the current article unread and move to the next using the next unread command However this command marks the current article read before moving to the next unread This occurs regardless of what I have set for the Mark current article read setting Workaround is to use arrow keys or mouse to move to the next unread instead of the next unread command A proper fix would not update the current articles read state if it has been changed manually by the user while that article is selected Version fe Eventually we can replace Travis with GitHub workflows Replaces Sparkle and newer has a different signature scheme than before ed instead of DSA For this Sparkle has created helper tools based on a portable ed library to create and sign the releases The previous scheme is deprecated but both schemes can be used simultaneously Further reference I have found that the OpenSSL implementation is a bit flaky I haven t been able to generate an identical signature using the existing private key There are many GitHub issues on the Sparkle repo about this It has been suggested that the OpenSSL libraries in macOS are to blame From time to time when I click on a headline the article starts playing audio in the internal browser Is there any way to disable the audio If not then please add this as a feature request Vienna b d d Java Script off for internal browser Plugins disabled for the internal browser Sometimes when the app has been idle in the background and hidden I think part of the feedlist side bar is not repainted at all leaving blank gaps where feed ought to be Click in the blank part and some feeds reappear scroll downup another blank area and so on I think the issue happens more often when the selected folder is a smart folder Vienna latest release vertical layout Catalina seen across the various releases About feeds of which over half are dormant not actually subscribed MacBookAir The issue did not happen before No other app exhibits anything similar a screenshot taken under img width altVienna sidebar src Although somewhat similar my issue is a bit different than When viewing a post from any of my subscriptions the unread count does not change after reading a post Even when a post is deleted the count doesnt change Manually marking each subscription as read will update the count But is rather annoying After a restart the program will work as expected for a few minutes Version b d d MacOs See also macOS Mojave and newer and macOS Catalina require notarisation in addition to codesigning to pass Gatekeeper At this point new releases of Vienna have to be notarised otherwise users will have to manually override Gatekeeper which can discourage them from using the app in the first place After looking a bit at the codesigning and release process of Vienna I believe that the process is complex lots of different parts within large shell scripts restrictive seems to work only in commandline and not Xcode and not really open for others to use eg codesigning is coupled with Sparkle and the upload to repos On top of that the process is not yet capable of producing notarised copies which will require some work if it is to be included in the process and not done manually afterwards I think simplifying the process could ensure that others are able to sign and release new versions in the future and that we could set up a process for nightlyweekly builds for people to test I have already simplified the build process a little bit by merging the build targets More can be done such as Separating the build scripts by their purpose versioning building signing uploading Reducing reliance on thirdparty tools such as Autorevision which could be done manually and by Apple s own agvtool bundled with Xcode build tools Making sure that most parts work well in xcodebuild as well as Xcode and relying on Xcode s codesigning tools Hello guys I love viennarss but since I am using two different devices iMac and macbook pro I would love to have an iCloud sync so that both computers share the same last state with each other Would it be possible to add this feature to the app roadmap Thanks a lot Stefan Version b d d How to reproduce Have a subscriptionsubject selected and an article displaying Choose a different subscription without selecting any articles Return to previous subscription and select the originally selected article Article will not display i am using version b d d and articles are never marked as read regardless whether i explicitly choose to mark as read or even after a short delay while reading the article if it is importent i am using theoldreader synchronization feature
