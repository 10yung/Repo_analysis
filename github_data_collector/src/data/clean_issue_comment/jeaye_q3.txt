Hi Is this still active jeaye It looks like a cool project Similar to but not the same No warnings about not finding submodules but looks like binrustpkg is missing with the upstream versions or something configure Configuring Q WARNING This project is not actively under development WARNING This script will build an old Rust version to run Q Platform Linux Build directory homeblakesrcq build

Clone of gitgithubcomjeayeglfwrsgit into submodule path libglfwrs failed For better GL support and a bit of safety and insurance that Im staying within a given profile itd be good to switch to glrs UDP Raw sockets zeromq nanomsg Curses server Chat Movement Right now MD animations can be loaded and will loop forever on an actor This needs to be made more robust stable and flexible and more performant when more actors are visible Use an AnimationCache to load the animations which become readonly Only reference them with Animation instances Support animation blending Three animations Current Blending and Next Adding a new animation when there is a Next replaces Next Support separate animation groupings Torso and legs are primary Multiple groupings can affect any animation and each can have a biasweight An actor will have multiple Animation controllers one for each grouping State machine Instead of game code being riddled with animation logic messages should just be sent to an animation state machine one per actor If Crouch is sent as a message for example some animations might be interested in obeying it while others will just ignore it as unapplicable Its possible that q will not feature a voxel renderer but rather a smoothed out perhaps Marching Cubs renderer that feels a bit more natural Explore the possibilities The ability to bind a maps textures to the surfaces would be a huge plus Right now all of the source is built in one go This is not going to be manageable once the source grows a bit more especially from the users point of view no feedback while compiling and the debugging point of view waiting forever for each build only build whats been changed Startup voxelation seems to work fine I can see the console but shorty after s the game crashes
