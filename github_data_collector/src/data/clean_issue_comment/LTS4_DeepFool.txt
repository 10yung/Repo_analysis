Use testdeepfoolpy to test on two test pictures When the generated disturbed picture enters the network again for forward calculation the category has not changed The images directly generated by deepfool have relatively large changes After performing some normalization on the disturbed images generated by deepfool in the code it is obviously closer to the original image but the category of the generated image has not changed for example For the picture testim jpg the original category is macaw and the deepfool shows that the disturbed picture category is flamingo the picture directly output by the network has changed dramatically But after a series of other operations it is very similar to the original image but at the same time the category is still macaw When running code on binary classification does it mean that we only need to modify the numclasses instead of as default When I tried it I found a lot of perturbed samples as NaN value Have you ever found this before
