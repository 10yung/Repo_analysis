How we can see which user is online and how many of them and bandwith usage of each one when I use the commandline as stated to download and install I get the following error at the end Saving to openvpninstallsh openvpninstallsh K KBs in s MBs openvpninstallsh saved Unable to initialize the iptablesnetfilter NAT table setup cant continue Make sure that your system has iptablesnetfilter available If using OpenVZ ask your provider to enable full netfilter support I have now installed package without any issue or additional packages to be added but your own script wont install I am not sure whats missing since its a new minimal build from yesterday Ive used your script previously with Debian without any issues Please do not make unrelated feature requests or ask for support here This issue contains a list of pending improvements to the script Those havent been implemented yet to preserve compatibility with older environments but will likely be implemented in the long term Upgrade cipher toAES CBC when its confirmed that OpenVPN will try to negotiate bit keys by default We cant use cipher AES GCM yet since this would break OpenVPN older than or those systems with a library which doesnt support GCM like OpenSSL older than Still AES GCM will be negotiated and used if available for both sides Done iptables are currently saved to the rclocal file even for systemd distros When every supported distro is expected to ship with systemd creating a service file would likely be a better approach to apply them at startup Went with a different approach but Done Remove code supporting other init systems when every supported distro ships with systemd This will happen when CentOS reaches EOL November th Done Enable LZ compression whenif its safe to do so in the future Compression was disabled with to mitigate the VORACLE attack No plans to enable compression anytime soon sndbuf and recvbufare set to sane values by default since OpenVPN Those parameters can be removed from the script when everyone is expected to be running OpenVPN Done ignoreunknownoption is supported since OpenVPN Can be used instead of setenv opt when OpenVPN is to be expected Done explicitexitnotify in the server has been implemented with and is set in the sample serverconf Option only useful for UDP should not be included if user selects TCP Will be implemented when servers are expected to run isnt problematic clientside Done tlscrypt is an improvement over tlsauth This change will be implemented when all servers and clients are expected to run OpenVPN Done Switch from iptables to nftables when it becomes the default in every supported distribution Thats all I can think of for now
