From WWDC seems that having thirdparty dependencies incorporate distribution through SPM will help a lot for build time Ill keep developing my issue and contribute on my findings Thank you for this repo The use case provided for why one would have dSYM generation on is rare and should be optin A lot of people leave dSYM generation on and dont realize its adding seconds to every incremental build I think Chinese developer is moreSo if you want have a Chinese READMEI have a little help to youI will write it fastred Would be worth checking if moving code into extensions causes longer compile times
