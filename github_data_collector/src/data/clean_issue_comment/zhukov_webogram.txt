Why is telegram web not being updated to support new features such as new emojis animated stickers and scheduled send Threema has this feature Would be ideal to have in Telegram too I used webtelegramorg for a long time but some time ago dont know exactly maybe a half year ago push notifications stopped working I added the web app to homescreen chrome for android app Also checked the permissions deleted all data app cache and all stored data but still no closed browser push notifications Sometimes the tab is flashing notification then I click on the tab and check the message but when I leave the tab the tab title continues flashing notification and calling for attention It seems that simply clicking the tab isnt enough to clear the notification and I have to stay about seconds with the page in focus for the title animation to clear My suggestion is to reset the tab title to Telegram Web as soon as the tab is clicked I suggest that to use this format Telegram Is better for mental health than animate title between Telegram Web and notification The current notification scheme in the web title is super annoying for me Thanks Cannot able to launch the app is dell inspiron after entering mobile number the app is not loading finally used through browser but there also videos are not downloading Kindly assist me i m in badly in need of using telegram through my laptop Correct country code please update information I cannot open it on the Safari on my IPhone But it open normally on the firefox and brave System iOS iOS Safari You have many pull requests and the latest updated is several months old
