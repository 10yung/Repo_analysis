 This is tangentially related to Im using a nearly identical example for how Id like to be able to print Sometimes I will know the specific pages of interest that I want to print by the value of the faceting variables It would be helpful to have the ability to index to a specific page by name as in the following example I acknowledge that it gets more complicated when there is more than one facet level and for that I assume that it will depend on the internal structure of how the pages are stored but perhaps a vector of names like the second example would be reasonable Example r libraryggplot

ggplot graphic in which there is a single conditioning variable with a large number of levels If I use facetgrid I get a plot with either rows or columns both of which look like hell I thought that facetgridpaginate would rescue me but it doesnt seem to I asked for rows and columns and thought that I would get two x pages Instead I get six pages with only one row of four facets per page Am I misunderstanding something Making some silly syntactical error Or is this a bug I have attached a reproducible example along with the data set on which it depends Grateful for any insight PS Someone suggested to me that I could use facetwrap from ggplot instead I got this to work for the example in question but it requires manually subsetting the data so as to get one page at a time Its not clear to me how to do this in the general context in which I need to implement this procedure Im hoping that facetgridpaginate will handle this for me automagically reprextxt egDattxt This closes Im not sure if this is the best approach but as far as I understand ggplot always removes NA values the only difference is whether there is a uservisible warning or not controlled by the narm parameter Since the warning is produced in computelayer in the Stat base class it should not be affected by this change I m trying to paginate a facetwrap plot with dir v such as this r libraryggplot libraryggforce d dataframeg rep x runif y rnorm p ggplotd aesx y geompoint p facetwrapvarsg dir v ncol Translating this to paginate by row with facetwrappaginate the results are strange Page gives a malformed result and page just errors out r p facetwrappaginatevarsg dir v ncol nrow page r p facetwrappaginatevarsg dir v ncol nrow page Warning in minlayoutROW no nonmissing arguments to min returning Inf Warning in

second one Swapping to by column does not really seem to improve the situation Here I would expect to get three x plots with panels then and finally r p facetwrappaginatevarsg dir v ncol nrow page r p

causes it to throw an error that seems to be from cbindall This can easily be worked around by ungrouping but often happens when I create new variables in a pipe before piping to ggplot and feels
