First using this framework has been so pleasant to work with Its so nice to be able to compile my views and know they will just work I even made a blog post about using typedhtml and was in the process of making a second However while playing around with the framework I ran into an issue see below I know life gets busy and Im sure its difficult to maintain OS With that being is their anything I can help with on the project that might also make it easier to address issues Thanks so much for putting in the time to make typedhtml and sharing it with others I opened an issue and made
