Hello First of all thank you for posting this sample its very helpful I was wondering if it would be possible to expand the sample a little showing how to make the captured video have a a larger width and height Thank you Probably this is not correct place to left my question but I wasnt able to find another one So my issue is related to Mi Browser of Xiaomi mobile device I have an web app which uses navigatormediaDevicesgetUserMedia and it works as expected for the most of browsers But for Mi Browser it doesnt work promise never ends I even have no ability to detect that browser does not support getUserMedia because the function is defined but nothing happens when I call it Description Add bareminimum audio and device enumeration to the GUM sample Purpose This make the GUM sample slightly more complete and turns it into a useful test program for examining combined API behavior Also add modern error names to error handling Please read first Please use discusswebrtc for general

the pc sample observe the console logs for Time between connectionStatechange which should be close to the bottom My expectation is that this is minor but it turns out to be in the order of ms and the RTT should be close to playoutDelayHint seems to have a small impact on that but even setting it to only reduces the delay between the events to ms Arguably we should be able to listen to
