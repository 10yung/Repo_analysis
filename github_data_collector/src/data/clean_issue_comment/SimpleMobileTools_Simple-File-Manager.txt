 observed behavior search a common word img alt width height src at the bottom of the search result the bubble is not right It is still at the beginning img alt width height src expected behavior The bubble should be the same as the left shown versions Hardware HUAWEI MATE not rooted v pro When I rotate the screen the unsaved data are gone This happens on several Samsung models including A s Right now the program apparently could not search folders by name only files are searched Could please folders be made searchable too When file is found it is quite often to me when I want to open the parent folder containing this file and not the file itself The parent folder is shown in search results but it is not clickableopen from search results Can these two points please be addressed As it is now it requires two presses of the back key to exit the app As I am sure you have your reasons for this a nice addition for some would be the additional option of a single long press of the back key to exit the app When a search reveals multiple files with the same name in different folders and all of them are selected for Copy To only one file is copied to the target folder or all copied files overwrite each other not sure Would be nice if the copy to method would rename the files automatically for example by adding a suffix to the filenames div aligncenter img src width height div observed behavior Sometimes search icon and home icon disappear expected result Search icon and home icon still there versions Hardware HUAWEI MATE not rooted v I cant move or copy something from Internal Memory or SDCard to any Root Path example datadataorgmozillafirefox In the preview of the folder says items if I open it nothing happens Im using Simple File Manager version installed through FDroid on an LineageOS Android I have a bin file that I want to open with Gadgetbridge Gadgetbridge is allowed to read external storage dumpsys package nodomainfreeyourgadgetgadgetbridge grep STORAGE androidpermissionREADEXTERNALSTORAGE androidpermissionREADEXTERNALSTORAGE grantedtrue In most directories below sdcard it works as expected I tap the file and it opens in Gadgetbridge no problem But in some directories Gadgetbridge fails to read the file In logcat I can see an IOException thrown by Gadgetbridge javaioIOException Unable to retrieve metadata for contentmediaexternalfile Unable to retrieve name for contentmediaexternalfile So it apparently has problems reading that file Where does the come from Can I trace that back to the file system Maybe that may help to debug or to make sure that Gadgetbridge is trying to read the correct file From a root shell through adb the FS permissions look exactly the same drwxrwxx root sdcardrw for the directory rwrw root sdcardrw for the file The only difference in this case The directories where Gadgetbridge is not able to read the file are synchronised using Syncthing And it seems like I can reproduce this If I start synchronising a directory which was fine for Gadgetbridge will make it unavailable for Gadgetbridge Im not sure if that is a bug in SimpleFileManager or an issue in Syncthing or in Gadgetbridge but if I use the internal file manager to open the bin file with Gadgetbridge it works just fine Opening photos in synced directories also works fine through SimpleFileManager Not sure what else to test I already suspected Syncthings stfolder may cause the problem but when I manually create that directory it still works fine Do you have any ideas what may cause this problem Let me know if I can help debugging things add display line option to File Editor If you are copying more than one file it takes quite a lot of taps to switch back and forth between different folders My suggestion for improving UI Make a home where you have shortcuts to internal external SD favorites feature request by user tippi which I highly recommend root if phone is rooted remote folders if implemented and open these folders in new tabs Make small icons to identify place internal SD external SD network cloud storage or custom icon if set and name tab with path or last part of path if too long To access folders either allow tapping on label or swiping left right Please allow for more than two open tabs up to That was the way it was done in ES file explorer I already mentioned I loved that app version if you want to have a look to get the idea I still think it was the best user interface of all file browsers apps out there before they started spying on everything Thx Patricia
