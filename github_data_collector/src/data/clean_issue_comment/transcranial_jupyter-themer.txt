Im trying to change the fonts used by Jupyter Notebook using the font and typography arguments in jupyterthemer but no matter what arguments I give it I keep getting a Bad argument passed to fonttypography Have a look at the screenshot Ive attached The arguments Im passing appear to be valid according to jupyterthemers show helper so Im confused why they generate errors What am I doing wrong Adds new folder with screenshots of a jupyter notebook under every available theme It makes the comparison easier The license requires that all copies of the software include the license This makes sure the license is included in the wheels See the wheel documentation here for more information Hi I get typography not supported error when I use t serif option while changing the theme Thanks this css selector appears to be off renderedhtml tbody trnthchildodd as is the gutter gets in the way especially when scrolling horizontally screen shot at screen shot at Your project looks very interesting and I was glad to test it out Unfortunately I got an error Error writing to customcss From this message though I dont know exactly whats wrong Is it an issue with file permissions Im able to edit the file myself so I wouldnt expect that Does it not find the file I have it in the normal location jupytercustomcustomcss I get the error whether or not customcss already exists It would be nice to have an error message that let me know exactly what the issue was so I can troubleshoot it more effectively Thanks Hello Thank you very much for the nice work I tried using the jupyterthemer to set a Theme in my Jupyter Notebook but it actually had no effect I tried doing this Old ipython configuration files for example at the default ipython may need to be remove but I actually do not know where to find this I also tried what is mentioned in of replacing the customcss by the theme I want I did this but I do not know if I replaced it in the right place I did it in the following directory anaconda libpython sitepackagesnotebookstaticcustom Could you please help me make this work Thanks Would it be possible to introduce other examples of the available typographies Using the Monokai theme renders the symbols extremely hard to see They are dark blue by default which is fine against a white background but near unreadable against the dark Monokai background I am working with Python on Win and Linux Here is an example Example
