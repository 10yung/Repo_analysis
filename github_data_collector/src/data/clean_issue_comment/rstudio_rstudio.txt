Hi guys I got an issue with rJava I successfully installed it And in terminal its like java version LTS JavaTM SE Runtime Environment build LTS Java HotSpotTM Bit Server VM build LTS mixed mode In

Referenced from LibraryFrameworksRframeworkVersions ResourceslibraryrJavalibsrJavaso Reason image not found Thank you for your help There have been a few reports of the following error with Error in yamlloadstring errorlabel errorlabel Scanner error while scanning a simple key at line column could not find expected at line column It is fairly clear that this is a regression caused by The problem is mostly that we look for a YAML header in all kinds of files to see if it has any interesting dependencies This is normally harmless but if an R script contains something that looks like a pair of YAML demarcators an attempt will be made to parse everything inside them as YAML with predictable results The fix is to only do this kind of scan in R Markdown files and to swallow any errors we do find as they are both harmless and not actionable This change fixes an annoying issue with focus while debugging which is that the cursor jumps into the Source pane a lot more than most people expect The reason this occurs is somewhat involved see for details The short version is that we open tabs to view source code while stepping through instructions then automatically close those tabs when we are done stepping The problem is that closing a tab always causes us to open and then immediately focus the adjacent tab regardless of where focus was before The fix is to use a custom selection event that carries information about whether we had focus when the tab was closed and to only restore focus if we had it in the first place Fixes on macOS Safari and Firefox show their own preferences when Cmdcomma is pressed so make the shortcut CmdOptioncomma when running on those browsers Cmdcomma works as desired on Chrome and Edge on Mac so leave asis for users who were already using it on Chrome

the project in a new session The library paths for the initial session are overwritten as the new project is opened renvnewproject Describe the problem in detail When a new renv project is initialized in a new session from RStudio the original R session inherits the renv library path of the new project Describe the behavior you expected The library paths of the original project should remain unchanged Please keep the below portion in your issue and check x the applicable boxes x I have read the guide to submitting good bug reports at x I have installed the latest version of RStudio and

consistently reproducing the issue JJ reported this bug earlier this week Because boostsystemerrorcodes can be implicitly converted to int sometimes Errorint code stdstring name ErrorLocation location was being invoked instead of Errorboostsystemerrorcode stdstring message ErrorLocation location resulting in the name category of the error being set to the intended message This PR resolves that issue by swapping the name and code parameters It also revealed the need for Errorboostsystemerrorcondition constructors Theres also a minor change to SessionFind errors IMPORTANT Please fill out this

lost workspace data as a result of this crash Describe the problem in detail The crash occurs whenever I attempt to use one of the tensorflowtf functions While the error suggests that this is an R

Server Pro get in touch with our Pro support team at supportrstudiocom System details RStudio Edition Desktop Server RStudio Version OS Version MacOS Red Hat R Version Steps to reproduce the problem Create a file called mischiefR containing just one line Loki On the command line change the file permissions to readonly and a different real owner and group eg chmod mishchiefR chown anotheruser mishchiefR chgrp anothergroup mishchiefR Make sure that the permissions owner and group have been updated correctly eg ls l mischiefR rrr anotheruser anothergroup Jan mischiefR In the IDE Edit Find in Files Under Find type Loki Under Search In choose the directory containing the file mischiefR Click on Find The search should display the file name and location above with Loki highlighted in the matching lines Next to Replace With type Trickster Replace All Yes The search should display the file name and location above with Trickster highlighted in the matching lines On the command line check the permissions etc on the file Write permissions have been added to the file and the owner and group have reverted to the user and group associated with the RStudio account ls l mischiefR rwrwr rstudio rstudio Jan mischiefR Check the contents of the file Loki is replaced with Trickster rootip global cat mischiefR Trickster Describe the problem in detail The file has been updated and its permissions owner and group have been changed Describe the behavior you expected The existing file properties should be respected File permissions owner and group should not be changed The file should not be changed as its not supposed to be writable Please keep the below portion in your issue and check x the applicable boxes x I have read the guide to submitting good bug reports at x I have

Download a custom dictionary of English medical terms the file enmedglutdic at In IDE Tools Global Options Spelling Add Choose the new dictionary and click on Open Click on OK Close and Restart RStudio Desktop or open a new session in RStudio Server see Tools Global Options Spelling Make sure that the dictionary is listed In a new Rmd file enter the following text allegra Allegra zyrtec Zyrtec fexofenadine Fexofenadine alleni Alleni latuda Latuda Save the file Note The example includes various capitalizations to make sure that s not a factor Describe the problem in detail Spellcheck results Allegra and Zyrtec capitalized are identified as spelled correctly but they re also in the enUS dictionary The rest of the terms are in the custom medical dictionary though capitalization may differ but they re being labelled as misspelled Rightclicking on the misspelled words only suggests words in English if at all For example alleni results in words such as fallen and alien as alternatives Similar behavior occurs when running spellcheck with Edit Check Spelling Describe the behavior you expected All terms in the custom dictionary should be marked as spelled correctly Please
