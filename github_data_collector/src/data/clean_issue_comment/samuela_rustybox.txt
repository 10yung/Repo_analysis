This isnt the case if you call it through the raw binary eg bash rustybox yes test This will print something like the following bash yes test yes test yes test Where it should be printing the following instead bash test test test This is because it doesnt use the args that were passed into the function but instead gets the args from the env crate directly It seems like c rust has removed a lot of the named constants so weve ended up with a bunch of magic numbers which are a lot less readable A good example might dumpkmap which has the following on line rust write i bbcommonbufsiz asmutptr as const libccvoid i i as sizet Versus the busybox version c write STDOUTFILENO flags MAXNRKEYMAPS If and when someone gets c rust refactor going this might be something good to tackle The shape on sed looked pretty bad so I took a stab at improving things a bit I tested using the busybox tests with SKIPKNOWNBUGStrue The line count is down from to but theres still a bit of weird logic from switchcase statements hanging around Ill take another look to see if I can get it down to around the same size as sedc lines but I thought itd be good to post a PR in case anyone else started in this area Just to make sure you get that I can use some harsh language from time to time but it is getting cool here Guess its this project and somethings can get lost by translation as well Nice done Cargotoml should probably have the licence in and inclusion in the root I think you want this in Cargotoml license GPL only Perhaps the AUTHORS file from busybox as well Great work
