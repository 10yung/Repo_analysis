wants to try this Nothing fancy but just thought to address general warnings I noticed chrisbanes on the CheeseDetailsActivity theres the Night mode menu but it doesnt show the correctly checked mode and selecting the items does nothing Ive extracted the code to handle the checking and selecting into a helper class seemed neater than putting it in a common base class I bumped the gradlesupport lib versions at the same time good to keep uptodate It smells that you wouldnt write the MainActivity Javadoc In addition it doesnt need it BTW thanks for sharing your work
