made my eyes pain Please add it if may in the past clipstack app used same way although duo to Google Play policy you may cannot put this in your main app however i dont know the whole policy but please at least put this option as a external plugin or such may be through Fdroid or other means it will be really helpful if i remember correctly KeePass Android used some method like this plugin

projects usually fade into obscurity when the primary developer loses interest or becomes busy in other parts of their life Thats where you come in After reading this statement on your readme document I saw the need for you to have a contributors guide document First of all the presence of that document sends out a message to prospective collaborators that youd like their assistance on your project Then secondly itll help them through the process of contributing to your project Hi I noticed the project doesnt have a privacy policy statement I could help out if youd need it Just a simple feature requestpersistent notification andor widget to quickly manually control brightness settings like flux What I like about it the way flux does it is Quick and predictable way of controlling brightness Most situations is screen brightness is too low to see anything when Im in broad daylight and I need to blindly change the brightness as I cant see anything A persistent simple control for brightness via notification dropdown is useful in this regard With flux I can wake my screen type my pin dropdown the menu and adjust the brightness as if my eyes are closed Using incremental changes to brightness as opposed to using a slider Setting brightness should be quick and accurate eg I know when Im in a room vs going outside I need to tap the brightness times to incrementdecrement by the user shouldnt have to fidget to adjust the brightness to an accurate level when the environments he is in is nearly always the same for me its dark room car broad daylight and the office You are doing a great job this app is a life saver considering danger of blue light I want request that you make it possible for users to activate or deactivated with voice command Also if you accept I would love to translate the language to Yoruba and Pidgin English What are the use of a blazing triangle circle and square when Im trying to read comfortably in the dark The option exists to also dim the android soft buttons in the control bar Could that not also be an option in the apps settings When my pupils are fully dilated to see in the dark its a bit of a nuisance to have these control icons glowing so intensely in relation to everything else in my field of view Can the option to dim them also be added to the app From email I would like to disable Red Moon on just the soft touch buttons at the bottomback home multitasking Is this possible This is definitely possible we just need to change the size of the overlay TODO Investigate What is the bar officially called so we can name the setting correctly Temp system navbar Can we detect the presence of the system navbar How is the height of the system navbar determined I believe we already have questions and answered just need to confirm that navigationBarHeightPx is the bar in question Add a Filter system navbar setting to the main screen at the bottom in the no effect on some devices category If possible hide this on devices without a soft navbar Modify screenHeight to reflect the new setting We shouldnt need to modify the layout params since the overlay is already top aligned If someone wants to submit a pull request for this
