this model can not do faceswap with blinking and opening mouth how to solve it Hi YadiraF Thank you for your great work I was using your code to generate some D faces from images On viewing the mesh in MeshlabBlender I observed there are some ridges and grooves on the surface of the face That is the surface is not smooth but instead has ups and downs On zooming in I noticed that this is because the vertices were selected in such a manner The triangles were forming the ups and downs Please see the images Screenshot from Screenshot from Screenshot from How do I make the surface smoother and eliminate these ups and downs Is it possible to generate multiple face D information maps on a single picture containing multiple faces at the same time Hi author I was confused that how to make trianglestxt file I also want to know how to make it although you publish it uvunfittedonnose I tried PRNet with pretrained model But some problem were found as attached image It seems that uv cannot fit the predicted mesh very well As a result we can see two nostrils which is so weird Anybody can help me out I would be appricate that Hi all we are unable to run using python and tensorflow versions we are getting following errors ModuleNotFoundError No module named tensorflowpythonutilframework Which version this application works please provide Thanks in advance MSLB d reconstruction results of Iterative Closest Points ICP how detailed testThe reconstructed evaluation in your article is NME normalized by outer interocular distance but how to do it if you have method optimize it for example the function rendertexture spends s Hi it is a great project i am really thankful for it i want to know how can i improve its fps when i am running it in webcam Right now i am getting only or fps Please tell me how can i improve it for real time purpose is anybody know how does the uvkptindtxt generate
