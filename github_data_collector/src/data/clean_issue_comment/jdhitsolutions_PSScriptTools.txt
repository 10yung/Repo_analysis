Need to better handle WPFrelated commands that now work in PowerShell Preview on Windows Update NewPSFormatXML to support Wide formats This may need to be a separate parameter set Hi Is there anyway to pass in custom template to ConvertToMarkdown One of the issues is that main content goes in pre tag and you cannot have links in there Thanks In ConvertToWPFGrid when manually clicking Refresh I am using the title bar to indicate a refresh is underway I also change the cursor What I would really like to do is change the text in the status bar Ive tried all sorts of ways with dispatchers and thread tricks with limited success Im reaching the limit of what I know about WPF Open to suggestions and tips Starting in v ConvertToWPFGrid now lives in a separate runspace to avoid blocking the PowerShell prompt Id love to find a way to automatically remove the runspace when the form is closed
