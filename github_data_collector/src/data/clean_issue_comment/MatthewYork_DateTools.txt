 I have added Urdu language translations for time ago Xcode shows two errors in my code but the app is still running how I can solve it or remove these errors extractLocStrings error bad entry in file UsersmarahhamadDesktoplinciosPodsDateToolsSwiftDateToolsSwiftDateToolsDateTimeAgoswift line Argument is not a literal string I cannot figure this out at all Im needing this as my last push to use SwiftPM to house my data layer of my app Please help packageurl from Does not work Fix the issue with SwiftPM setup and add auto generated files to gitignore No major changes here just reducing the number of warnings that the code generates when you build with Xcode Except the two that are related to var to let conversion the rest are removing public from all methods inside public extensions The implementation of timeAgo first checks years then months then days etc This results in a situation where times jump from a few minutes ago to a full day ago For example say its currently and youre looking at a time minutes ago You get as you would expect minutes ago But if you look at a time minutes ago you get day ago which is arguably not what you want Instead you want seconds ago to grow to minutes ago to grow to hours ago to grow to days ago etc It looks like Apple has a private NSDate category named RTExtensions that also has a weekday method which returns values greater than I think this is a typo This PR fixed the warnings that are generated with Xcode Redundant declaration of public when extension are public Resolves the warnings for SwiftExample sample project to migrate to Swift and remove SWIFTSWIFT OBJCINFERENCE What this PR doesnt fix is the localization warnings for generated in Xcode
