This commit updates URLs to prefer the https protocol Redirects are not followed to avoid accidentally expanding intentionally shortened URLs ie if using a URL shortener HTTP URLs that Could Not Be Fixed These URLs were unable to be fixed Please review them to see if they can be manually resolved with occurrences could not be migrated https result ConnectTimeoutException with occurrences could not be migrated https result ConnectTimeoutException Fixed URLs Fixed But Review Recommended These URLs were fixed but the https status was not OK However the https status was the same as the http request or http redirected to an https URL so they were migrated Your review is recommended with occurrences migrated to https result SSLHandshakeException with occurrences migrated to https result

in function classes fdef mtable unable to find an inherited method for function asdbdataframe for signature function While debugging the error using asdbdataframe I learned the dataframe I was using was not in the environment Would suggest making this error more specific to missing data Bug report from Mark Malamut I believe I encountered what appears to be a small bug in this package that I cannot get around when trying to incorporate it into my own package which provides a db access layer for our team Here is what I believe is the problem Note that I am using the most recent version from CRAN The PivotalR package implements cbind and therefore overrides the base cbind when the fully library is loaded using the libraryPivotalR directive From the behavior I have seen it appears that a reference to cbind in your package uses whatever cbind is available in the current environment as opposed to explicitly using PivotalRcbind I believe this to be the case as my code works fine when specifying libraryPivotalR but fails during dbdisconnect with the following when the library is not fully loaded Sample Code libraryPivotalR connect function PivotalRdbconnecthostx userx passwordx dbnamex quickTRUE disconnect functionid PivotalRdbdisconnectconnidid verboseTRUE query functionstr id connect result PivotalRdbqstr connidid verboseTRUE nrowsall disconnectid result X query SELECT FROM table Error in localVarsconntype connpkg localVarsconntype connpkg whichlocalVarsconntype connpkg replacement has length zero When the library PivotalR is loaded I see the following informational messages and my code works without error libraryPivotalR liblocRwinlibrary Attaching package PivotalR The following objects are masked from packagestats sd var The following object is masked from packagebase cbind Which is why I believe there is an implicit call to cbind in your code It doesn t seem that sd or var are the issue Note that the first time it fails in dbdisconnect but if you rerun without resetting the environment subsequent calls will fail in dbconnect with the following error message Error in localVarsconntype rpostgresql clocalVarsconntype rpostgresql more

pastesuppressMessageslibrary connpkg where connpkg can currently only be RPostgreSQL This pollutes the namespace by attaching all objects from RPostgreSQL We should avoid this by using the scope operator instead of attaching the objects hi when I run a by processing in Hawq using a custom function i only get results for rows Any ideas as to why that occurs if i do something like this samplestissuemulogcpm bygtexdf logCpm c gtexdfgene gtexdfTissuetypemean Then i get the correct number of rows however if i submit my own function or a nonstandard function as below I only get results retrieved samplestissuelogcpmqlo bygtexdf logCpm c gtexdfgene gtexdfTissuetype FUNfunctionx y lookatx nrowsNULL returnquantiley prob Is any method like sql method insert into one row or a query Or like rbind method Implement plrmap plrreduce plrfilter plrflatmap functions which utilize PLR to create functions directly in Postgres databases Using these functions as the basis for building more complicated algorithms When estimating large models it would be nice to get some feedback on progress like the verbose flag in MADlib Eg printing the iteration number for logistic regression I know that MADLib supports association rules and i would like to use it from R Is there a possibility to implement this feature
