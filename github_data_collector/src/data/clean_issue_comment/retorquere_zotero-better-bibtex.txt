citr is taking a considerably long time sec to connect to the Zotero database with my large database Report ID WF BPCRXeuc I understand that exporting unsing Better BibLaTeX a very large Zotero database simply takes time and creates rather large bibtex files in my case entries create a bibtex file that is MB So no squabbles here My understanding with updates using the BBT automatic update feature is that those should happen incrementally Not sure if thats the right description So after say or so more entries the export shouldnt take as long as if youd export from scratch This does not seem to be the case in my setup Report ID RRPZJI Jeuc Exporter used BBT Expected behavior Incremental update Actual behavior Full update very slow Also the interaction with citr is veeeery slow Not sure if those two things are related The instructions on citr say that BBT is needed for this to work If you are using Zotero citr can access your reference database directly For this to work you need to install the Better BibTeX extension Once the extension is installed and your reference manager is running citr can access all your references and keep your bibliography file updated by adding missing references As suggested over at citr I omit the following fields in the BBT export settings abstract note file tag attachment So I thought I just might ask if theres a connection before starting a new issue Details on the issue is posted here I opened this issue as per Emilianos request However given the response from dstillman the unicode character gets converted to uppercase character I am guessing this is a built in behavior in Zotero so BBT may not be to blame BBT bug report ID X WV HMeuc With apologies for reviving a similar thread I ask if retorquere is able to assist again with multilingual fields export using BBT v in JurisM m I have uploaded this entry as a debugging report MDYA RAMeuc Heres an example of a citation in question Chen Zhongyuan Liulichang shihua History of Liulichang Beijing chubanshe The output in my bib file reads bookchen e langid pinyin title isbn abstract pagetotal titleaddon History of Liulichang usere Liulichang shihua publisher date keywords author So the transliterations of some fields author and publisher have disappeared but the transliteration of title is successfully exported Also I do not know if I should take up this issue with Pandoc but when converting the citation key using my bib file and the Chicago full note CSL the output became History of Liulichang the transliterations are all gone Using the same CSL JurisM is able to render the correct citation Is it an issue with my CSL or Pandoc Thank you in advance for your help As mentioned in issue I am looking for a solution the overcomes Zoteros limitation to a single title field The code in your answer works but this poses another problem We need to change the code before every export if we need another separator So Would it be possible the select the used postscript code just before the export x I have verified in the Zotero addons screen that I have the latest release of BBT and Zotero installed x I am posting a single question bug or feature request x I have included a descriptive subject of the problem x I am available for followup questions and testing Feature Request Easier File Export per collection generation Background I realise this may not fit the workflow for some but I think for the goal of this project latex holdouts it fits I like to sort papers through the collectionfolder structure by topic Then using the exporter and then within my text editor vim I can take advantage of the autocompletion Previously I used Mendeley and it generated a per foldercollection bib file which I could symlink to the projectpapersection I was working on and take advantage of the citekeys being generated and immediately available It would be great if for numerous many collections it were easier to generate multiple export files AFAIK this is not possible without manually going by collection and creating an export For people importing a large collection who like to do lots of sorting this is very tedious If this feature exists this feature then is about improving the documentation of said feature The feature Automatically produced individual bibliography files Format possibly selectable using a menu option Directory where to place these files possibly determinable Foreseen Problems How to avoid naming clashes between subcollections create a directory per library and per collection prefix the collection name with the collectionhierarchy This also keeps in line with the keep keys unique options x I have verified that I am on the latest release of BBT and Zotero x I am posting a single question bug or feature request x I have included a descriptive subject of the problem x I am available for followup questions and testing Any plan for this to change I was using it in a few places Thanks Debug ID CPLW TPB To reproduce make a new empty collection and select it change the search bar to search All fields and tags or everything and enter a simple search term The empty list of items will populate with results from other collections although not the entire library it seems Its not at all obvious to me why this is related to BBT but it goes away if I disable the extension Sometimes there is need to change ones favourite formatting pattern to be able to collaborate more easily Although changing this manually have always been an option is error prone and time consuming It would be ideal to have a default formatting and a number or of alternative formats to chose from when exporting eg auth year shorttitle authlower year Thanks for the fantastic work I noticed that ZBB retains the original dateadded and datemodified fields from a BibDeskgenerated bib in the Zotero Extra field such as bibtexdateadded datemodified That is great Could ZBB also write this data into the respective native Zotero fields Id like to retain this information if at all possible
