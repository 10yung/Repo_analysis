Im trying use Support authorization options on request When I run with a user without HOME directory in the case wwwdata apache user Im getting the error varlibgems gemstwurl libtwurlrcfilerb in expandpath couldnt find login name expanding ArgumentError from varlibgems gemstwurl libtwurlrcfilerb in directory from varlibgems gemstwurl libtwurlrcfilerb in filepath from varlibgems gemstwurl libtwurlrcfilerb in load from varlibgems gemstwurl libtwurlrcfilerb in initialize from varlibgems gemstwurl libtwurloauthclientrb in new from varlibgems gemstwurl libtwurloauthclientrb in rcfile from varlibgems gemstwurl libtwurloauthclientrb in loadfromoptions from varlibgems gemstwurl libtwurlclirb in dispatch from varlibgems gemstwurl libtwurlclirb in run from varlibgems gemstwurl bintwurl in top required from usrlocalbintwurl in load from usrlocalbintwurl in main I belive that is correlated this bug in another ruby project fixes couldnt find login name expanding tilde cont As workaround I change RCFile class rb module Twurl class RCFile FILE twurlrc class self def directory directory directory Fileexpandpath Expected behavior Send request without twurlrc file Actual behavior twurl crash and print a error message Steps to reproduce the behavior install a php apache setup on linux install twurl create php script with a shellexec command executing twurl with all authentication options Since macOS now ships with zsh by default it would be nice to have a shell completion formula Enhancement idea enable individual apps and entries in twurlrc to be labelled I currently have about apps and accounts and frequently forget which is the correct token I need to switch over to In the codecommand below note that my first parameter has two dashes per this video and my second parameter erroneously has no dashes When I entered this in twurl twurl authorize consumerkey xZNotMyRealKeyJO consumersecret tYNotMyRealSecretNotMyRealSecretNotMyRealSecretzj twurl gave this misleading message Authorization failed Check that your consumer key and secret are correct as well as username and password twurl should have told me Syntax error I was wondering if itd be possible for one of you to add an argument to twurl that lets you specify your twurlrc directory Id do it myself but Im not really a ruby guy I found my way around well enough to hardcode in where I needed it to look though so not exactly urgent but I think itd be cool and if either of you agree and have the time itd be really good Something like P homeusertwurlrc would be super Note the reason for this request is that Im calling twurl from another service that strips out all ENV stuff including location of homedir By executing Twurl with a preloaded access token and consumer keyset while including a pretend or onlygeneratehttpheaders option it would output a string simply consisting of the HTTP Authorization header Developers could then use Twurl as a pipe for shell scripts with the ultimate destination of curl for the additional features it offers as an HTTP client
