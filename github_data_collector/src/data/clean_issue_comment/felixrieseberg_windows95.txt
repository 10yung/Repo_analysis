It seems that no matter what changes I make upon a reload everything I did is undone Obviously when you want to use this to play old bit games this is a crippling disability as you cant properly install the game and saves are gone every restart Great job so far on the new version though Bumps serializetojs from to details summaryCommitssummary c a d d Merge pull request from

online version would be more useful I know its a bit of a joke apparently but I would probably find that useful I know about v but this is better for some things when I try to load it it says The code execution cannot proceed because ffmpegdll was not found Reinstalling the program may fix this problem I dont get it how this application is available here when a bloatware McAfee antivirus automatically in the background installs itself Not cool This project is awesome thank you Im trying to run a Win app called Cs xedit that was designed to edit the parameters on a hardware synthesizer via MIDI Any idea how I can access USB MIDI devices on macos through Win Edited for formatting and a quick reminder about free space TLDR IDGAF read through it so you dont brick your PC While reading through the threads I noticed that Windows users are having alot of funny as in haha funny problems with locating physical storage through the emulator I have the solution Here it is YOU CANNOT READ ANY OF YOUR PHYSICAL DRIVE DATA IT IS IMPOSSIBLE The reason you cannot read your drive is actually very similar to why you need this emulator in the first place incompatible old technology All Microsoft OSes before Windows XP ran on either a FAT or FAT file system NTFS was never even introduced to Windows yet Which is why in the past if you upgraded to Windows XP converted your file system to NTFS then tried to downgrade back to Windows x your computer would act as though your hard drive didnt even exist You would have to reformat the drive and reconvert it to the original File Allocation Table The windows img file which is the entirety of the emulators virtual drive is actually encoded in FAT format the virtual drive app I use PowerISO cannot read the img file but if you open it in WinRAR youll notice it requires you to convert the files FROM FAT format before extracting Likewise if you ADD files to the img which is the ONLY way Ive found thus far to add data to the emulator the files are then exported in FAT format because that is the only format that both Windows and Windows can read So to add files to the virtual drive try the following Create a small lets say Gb partition on one of your local drives and have it formatted to a FAT file system Lets call it the Ghost Drive MAKE SURE YOUR PARTITION ONLY TAKES UP FREE SPACE OR YOU WILL CORRUPT SOMETHING Extract the files from any images you are trying to install from and copy them onto the Ghost Drive in their own unique folders eg Extract the files from the Quake install CD into a folder on the Ghost Drive named Quake Open windows img in WinRAR Add your new install folders to the img thru WinRAR and save your changes Start the emulator from scratch After this your folders should be visible Just remember if you are using Windows XP and above you will NEED a FAT partition somewhere on your physical system to transfer files to the emulator without causing crashes Bump this for relevence and please label Solution in Issue It it NOT just the difference between bit and bit Its also the difference between FAT and NTFS file systems The file windows exe was flagged by the following AVG reported it as FileRepMalware Aegis reported it as TrojanWin Generic c MacAfee reported it as Artemis In addition it was stopped from silently accessing the url diggingrationspacecom Hi I am trying to download The Game of Life from my mac onto the windows emulator I was trying to follow the instructions under download additional apps and games FAQ but it wasnt clear on how to do this on a Mac Im not understanding by what you mean show disk image Can you clarify the steps a bit more Thank you for the help Sno Erika Stagemantis Thank you for reporting an issue Before we go any further understand
