Dear SCENIC team I am working with completely new organisms I have the annotation file and gene expression and now I want to use SCENIC to cluster the based on expression and motif present in promoter I am having hard time with motif database I have the motif list in promoter region but I am unable to convert it to feather files which can be used in SCENIC I will be grateful if you could help me regarding this issue Thanks Hi where Can I find related paper or explanation of cisTarget databases thanks Hi How can I run runGenie using a custom list of transcription factorsTFs For example as mentioned in the GENIE vignette it can be done using regulators cGene Gene Gene and then weightMat GENIE exprMatr regulatorsregulators My loom file is huge and runGenie detects TFs in it I need to run the loom file just for TFs Any advice on this will be really helpful Thank you Hello aertslab Wondering how can I compute regulonspecificityscores to get cell type specific regulons in SCENIC Is there a function like regulonspecificityscores in pySCENIC Hello aertslab Since all regulons targeting fewer than genes are dropped in the modulesfromadjacencies function why I got regulons with fewer than genes Hope for your reply I read the introduction part about applying SCENIC into another species It suggests us to download cis element database and other settings But I am still confused Could you give some more details or some specific procedures about it Thank you very much Hello I have been trying SCENIC on our data and got the error message mentioned in the title The dataset I am using is a matrix processed by scanpy package If I use the whole matrix then it give me the error however if I only use part of the matrix then it can be finished At first I thought it is memory issue but I am using a cluster with Gb memory and SCENIC only takes Gb before it shows the error Thus I have two questions here Please advice me on how to solve this error If I chop the matrix into pieces and run GRNboost on each piece to get regulon and then take the union and run aucell Does it equal to run GRNboost on whole matrix and then apply resulted regulon to aucell The detailed code and error message

regulonAUC based on a previously solved issue Somehow I could not find the binary data in the int folder of the SCENIC output Thanks Po Hi cflerin saibar since the question hasnt been solved I open a new issue about this question I do find scenicloom file in the output folder not sure if it is available with error reported Or how can i try another way to export my output to a loom file
