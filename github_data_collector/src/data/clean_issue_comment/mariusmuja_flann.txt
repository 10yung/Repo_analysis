actually setting up the Point Cloud Library PCL However it requires a few other dependency libraries and one among them was FLANN So I wanted to build the FLANN from sources Downloaded the souces from

CMake is not a truly crossplatform solution as Windows does not come with the pkgconfig utility installed So any solution for this issue In checking the type of the distribution of q the exception message should call qptstype instead of ptsdtype This is a reorganized version of The goal is to build the FLANN library and Python bindings with scikitbuild This will make it easier for FLANN to be installed and deployed in Python environments The current version of pyflann on pypi and in opencv is old and it could use an update Moving to scikitbuild will help make this process easier Because this is a fairly major code restructure Ive bumped the version from to The main changes are Move pyflann from srcpythonpyflann to Add a setuppy that calls CMake via skbuild instead of generating a setuppy dynamically Remove BUILDPYTHONBINDINGS from CMake as scikitbuild now handles the Python bindings I also made a minor change to examplesflannexamplec to fix a compiler warning These change mean that someone can now simply clone flann and run python setuppy install and it will work Workflows that use CMake to build the C libs or the matlab ruby bindings should not be affected EDIT This also includes a fix for Hi my flann verson is Dynamic libraries can be normal compilationBut to create a new project you will be prompted to find hed file flannflannh No such file or directoryVs configuration files and library directory contains are normalWho can help me Thanks The misleading indented statement can be executed regardless of the if condition FLANN is available as a port in vcpkg a C library manager that simplifies installation for FLANN and other project dependencies Documenting the install process here will help users get started by providing a single set of commands to build FLANN ready to be included in their projects We also test whether our library ports build in various configurations dynamic static on various platforms OSX Linux Windows x x UWP ARM to keep a wide coverage for users Im a maintainer for vcpkg and here is what the port script looks like We try to keep the library maintained as close as possible to the original library
