Resolved deprecation error in datamatrixphp Deprecated Array and string offset access syntax with curly braces is deprecated How can i call SetAutoPageBreak in the Footer method The problem i have is that i can have a dynamic height to the footer and i can only obtain that height in the Footer method In this case i cant set the AutoPageBreak because the footer is called after the body method Is there any workaround this Thank you PHP message PHP Notice Trying to access array offset on value of type int in vendortecnickcomtcpdftcpdfphp on line If we use transforms and a page is ending inside a transformed part the transformation is applied to the footer but seems to be stopped afterwards so it doesnt continue on the next page Simplified code example php Start transform pdfStartTransform pdfRotate Output some multiline text that causes a page break pdfwriteHTMLCell html true true Page break within here Stop transform pdfStopTransform See the slightly changed version of example php here This results in a PDF like example pdf You see that there is a rotated text at the end of page The footer is rotated along with the text but shouldnt be because it has no own rotation The second part of the text on page instead is not rotated at all but should be because its inside the transformation Is there any way to save the whole transformation stack before printing the footer and restoring it afterwards hello after updating to tcpdf i get warning on method tcpdfphp line with message unlink temptcpdf b efd eec f fca b imgmaskalphaaf af ed f b d a a No such file or directory after commenting out that line the issue gone i hope theres a better fix for this hello we have a serious issue since the update to version we have two static images that we include in the header when the pdf is rendered they are deleted from the filesystem so every new pdf does not have these files anymore i tracked this down to this commit the images are added in this way thisresourceDirectory getcwd datacontent thisImagethisresourceDirectory imagepng T and then in destroy they are deleted from the filesystem how can we avoid the deletion of these files I noticed an odd behavior of MultiCells in transformations especially scaling It doesnt occur in Cells but I suppose it might occur as well in other elements that are modified to fit the page dimensions Within a downscaled part of the document positions such as are still visible on a standard A page because the dimensions get scaled down according to the transformation However TCPDF seems to force elements into the mm width of an A page without scaling this page dimension or the margins I modified example from the documentation to illustrate my case the code can be seen here The resulting PDF is example pdf Tested with TCPDF and master branch at fde bb Has anyone else encountered a similar behaviour with TCPDF and has an idea how to solve this I have debugged this for some time now and suspect that it has something to do with the position and width calculations inside MultiCell but Im not sure how exactly this can be fixed Ive an tinymce editor on my PHP webapp to save precompiled content textimages Ive saved an old entry with some text and a image link This is the HTML view of tinymce editor pThis is an imagep img src Then a button named Create PDF and SENDcreate the A pdf version of my tinymce content using TCPDF and send via email All ok when my app was on http Now we migrated to https and when i generate PDF image disappear from PDFi need to manually change in html view of tinymce editor textarea img src to img src adding s to src there is a solution to fix this problem on TCPDF Hello I am using TCPDF for generating form field PDF dynamically We have long text options ie Feed water introduced through openings or connection used for relief water column or water level gauge glass on cast iron boiler in database and its not wrapping in select box in PDF Another issue is its adding white space at the end of options text If you have option like Option character then its adding white space I have tried same code from this example and just added more text to select box options and its not working too Please find attached PDF and see Select for what I am talking about example pdf Waiting for solution because due to this we are stuck Thanks in advance As in subject All versions prior to are not affected From when you use the same image many times in your pdf only first appearance is supported properly All following links to the same image are not visiblebroken In my opinion code from TCPDFdestroy should not always delete images stored in cache located at KPATHCACHE setting If you need more info please let me know Related to
