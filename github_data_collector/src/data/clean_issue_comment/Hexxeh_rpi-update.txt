Adding information for also downloading pi firmware Hello i want to reinstall the same firmware i have in my raspberry and not a newerbeta one how can i do it and how can i install a specific firmware revision thanks When there is a backup available and no internet connection is available rpiupdate should have an option to easily restore this backup For example the option restorebackup could trigger this When a backup is being made the local tree of files for boot and for libmodules before the backup is being made should be stored somewhere Probably in bootbakfiles and libmodulesbakfiles Before a backup is being restored the local paths stored in these files should exist under bootbak and under libmodulesbak This would ensure that restoring a backup will place back at least the files that were there Restoring additional files should not be a problem but restoring when files are missing should not be possible and an error should be reported on which files are missing After restoring a backup the new backup should be the version from which the backup was triggered When a backup has been restored the files files from that backup should be deleted Implementing this feature would allow not so technical savvy users to perform a restore of a backup easily and safely especially when no internet connection is available One of the reasons no internet connection is available is upgrading to a firmware version that breaks internet functionality Additionally rpiupdate help should explain all features no arguments firmware revision argument in terms of a git hash restorebackup argument help argument version argument Hello I run PiServer and when I start raspberry it stuck on boot after rpiupdate can I rollback on previus kernel This allows to skip the partition size check when installing PI files Ive also took the chance to update the README file ref checkpartition addition is causing issues on usecases where rpiupdate is used to build distributions in such case destination may be a simple directory rather than a partition per say Could this check be done in a softer manner to play nice with such usecases Would be nice if WANTPI usage is explained in READMEmd expert options too Thanks for consideration Set curl download retry to times make it work in pool network Would you like to proceed does not accept y Like aptget install X y this tool need a flag for automatic updates like Ansible o similar software I try to update Raspberry firmware and my Ansible play fail because rpiupdate promp for a major update in the kernel It would seem like a good idea to set varrunrebootrequired if a reboot is required no This would mirror the logic aptget establishes
