Hello Im running iStats on a MacBook Pro with MacOS I have noticed that temperatures only update around once every minutes when using iStats For example my cpu temperature has been stuck at for a while now even though Im not idling anymore I made sure to reset SMC and NVRAM No luck Intel power gadget seems to be updating temperatures consistently however they are slightly hotter that iStats I assume its reading a different sensors To replicate Let computer idle Run watch istats Take note of cpu temp Open a browser or other program Check CPU temp If youre having the same issue as me youll notice that there is no change in any of the temperatures Thanks Edit I have noticed putting my laptop to sleep for a few seconds the reawakening it forces the temperatures to update Edit I have noticed that temps do update regularly but only whilst the laptop is on charge As soon as the machine is disconnected all stats freeze for at least minutes After a while the app stopped working I am getting the following error Failed to execute process usrlocalbinistats Reason The file usrlocalbinistats specified the interpreter SystemLibraryFrameworksRubyframeworkVersions usrbinruby which is not an executable command It would be great if it could tell you if the batter was charging discharging or full I have ruby on macOS Catalina I tried installing iStats in my normal account but received a lack of write access error Subsequently I logged into my administrator account and oddly also received an unable to write error I manually changed the permissions for the target folder and tried installing again only to receive even more errors ending with ErrnoEACCE Is this an issue with my configuration The specific final line was Permission denied rbsysopen LibraryRubyGems cacheparseconfig gem CFStringGetCStringPtr usually returns null I added a fallback with CFStringGetCString to allocate a string This is consistent and in compliance with Apple The following link should give a bit more insight CFStringGetCStringPtr ObjC doc With this fallback type of system older systems will still behave as they did and newer ones will get the battery string the new way Either way it should all work the same The only thing Im unclear of and maybe you can help with is how does the freeing of the pointer work Im not familiar with rbstrnew so I dont know if the GC will clean up that pointer or not If theres any improvements I can make or you can shed more info on how this works that would be great Thanks for this great little tool you saved me plenty of time reinventing the wheel ps Can you also give a bit more info as to how to betterquicker debug Thanks again After I upgraded to macOS Catalina the Battery health indicator is no longer working and displays unknown Screenshot at Im using iStats on macOS Catalina Im embarrassed about this but I still use Mac OS X Lion I just really like Aqua Theres one problem isnt the only way to update Ruby is with Homebrew Homebrew drops support for outofdate OSes like all the versions of Mac OS I have at home Whenever I try to install it shows this AnfunfunsMacBookAir computer gem install iStats ERROR While executing gem GemFilePermissionError You dont have write permissions into the LibraryRubyGems directory AnfunfunsMacBookAir computer sudo ARCHFLAGSWnoerrorunusedcommandlineargumentharderrorinfuture gem install iStats Password ERROR Error installing iStats iStats requires Ruby version So in other words Im stuck Homebrew said it wouldnt have any support on Yosemite and the install failed for even installing Homebrew on Yosemite Doubt it would work on an even older OS MacBook Air October OS X Lion Build G Thanks Add sensor description for Mac mini Late nVidia MCP Controller This change supports a configuration clause in sensorsconf that allows setting a persistent preference for temperature scale The configuration group allows for other possible future settings to be included in it A new command line option is added so that if fahrenheit is set in the configuration it can be overridden on the command line Example section of sensorsconf appconfig temperaturescale fahrenheit The new command line option is c celcius The help option has been updated to reflect the new option
