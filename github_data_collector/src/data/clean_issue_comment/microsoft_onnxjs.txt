Ive exported an ONNX model from PyTorch using opset version the lowest version the PyTorch export supports and it includes a LogSoftmax operator which results in the following error when I try to use it in ONNXjs TypeError cannot resolve operator LogSoftmax with opsets aionnx v This version of LogSoftmax has been available since version of ONNX so it would be nice to support it Implemented Pad operator for cpu backend I am having trouble with on a new iPhone with iOS It only works when I disable webgl in the advanced settings of Safari I cannot reproduce the problem with a desktop browser and I see no error messages when connecting a remote debug console to the mobile Safari Is there anything else I can try to get more information about the root of the problem Some suggested changes Feel free to cherrypick only some of them if you dont want to use all of them When is the next release of onnxjs scheduled I am interested in support for more operators especially Upsample Shape and Max operators i use a model from maskrcnn and load the model in onnxjs just follow the instructions const model new onnxInferenceSession await modelloadModelmaskrcnnR FPN xonnx but errors occur int is not supported why is that how to solve it I exported a Pytorch model to ONNX but I cannot load it on the browser for inference Details about my problem ONNX version Python version Python Anaconda Inc Browser Google Chrome ONNX model Code html head head body Load ONNXjs script src Code that consume ONNXjs script Create an ONNX inference session with default backend const session new onnxInferenceSession Load an ONNX model sessionloadModelNumberPredictoronnxthensuccess consolelogsuccess success catcherror consolelogerror error script body html Error message bError unrecognized input for node unnamedLSTM b Uncaught in promise TypeError cannot resolve operator BatchNormalization with opsets aionnx v at ObjecteresolveOperator onnxminjs at tresolve onnxminjs at einitializeOps onnxminjs at onnxminjs at tevent onnxminjs at einitialize onnxminjs at eanonymous onnxminjs at onnxminjs at Objectnext onnxminjs at a onnxminjs I suspect that this has to do with BatchNormalization only being supported in opsets v the error indicates that the package is utilizing opset v However per documentation it seems that version of this package utilizes opset v Im using a webgl backend in browser Chrome
