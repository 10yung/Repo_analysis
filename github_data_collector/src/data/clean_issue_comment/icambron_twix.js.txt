It seems really weird because simpleFormat works fine but humanizeLength invariably fails with the error TypeError Cannot read property humanize of undefined js const getText timeToAdd const now moment const reminderTime momentaddtimeToAdd minutes const range nowtwixreminderTimeformat range is a time span from the current time to the reminderTime const humanized rangehumanizeLength Fails with TypeError Cannot read property humanize of undefined const humanized rangesimpleFormat Works fine return humanized Any thoughts Thanks for this great project There is a while Bug I am iterating with weeks between dates and here is the code that I used var itr momenttwixnew Date T new Date T iterateweeks var range whileitrhasNext rangepushitrnextformatYYYYMD consolelogrange Which generates the below result When I was requesting for week sequence starting from th October why I am getting results from a week prior Expected Result How can I resolve this issue I am facing a problem with twixs iterate method as the result is trimming of the time from the results Implementation var itr momenttwixnew Date T new Date T iteratemonths Current Result T T T T T T But Expected T T T T T T So what has to be done to iterate method so that above result can be fetched This package doesnt have a default file set You can set it via jsdelivr browser or main field in packagejson Hey I now know about toArray but I got caught out today when iterate didnt return an iterable suitable for Arrayfrom homesrc cat testjs javascript const moment requiremoment const twix requirelibtwixminjs let start new Date let end new Date consolelogmomentstarttwixendtoArraydayslength consolelogArrayfrommomentstarttwixenditeratedayslength consolelogArrayfrommomentstarttwixenditeratedays homesrc node testjs Arrayfrom should expand the iterable so I guess the object returned from iterate is not truly iterable in the way required by the spec Nice library though saved me a bunch of time elsewhere so Im still net positive on timesavings thanks to twix It wasnt immediately clear to me that twix should be imported only for its side effects on moment using import twix instead of import from twix Maybe worth adding to the detailed documentation heavyexclamationmark This is not possible to use Twixjs with momenttimezone when I importing like this via Webpack import moment from momenttimezone import twix And use something like momenttwix So I got error Uncaught in promise TypeError WEBPACKIMPORTEDMODULE momenttimezonedefaultatwix is not a function tada But this is possible to do if I want to use moment as momenttimezone import moment from momenttimezone import moment from moment import twix And use something like momenttwix Question is Does it possible to use momenttwix when moment is momenttimezone PS All are latest versions Thanks so much
