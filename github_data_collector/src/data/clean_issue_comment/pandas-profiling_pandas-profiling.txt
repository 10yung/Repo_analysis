Introducing static type checking to this repository It finds some errors it makes some errors The internally computed table of expected frequencies has a zero element at correlationnamecorrelationname errorerror Describe the bug The user encounters several issues when running pandasprofiling in JupyterLab The jupyter widgets are not enabled by default nor does the package provide a warning The user has to manually run jupyter labextension install jupyterwidgetsjupyterlabmanager Nonwidget components eg the overview table are not formatted properly interface A clear and concise description of what the bug is If the description consists of multiple nonrelated bugs you are encouraged to create separate issues To Reproduce The problems above can be reproduced by running the code below in JupterLab As featured on the Google Cloud Platform website import pandas as pd from pandasprofiling import ProfileReport df pdreadcsv sep profile ProfileReportdf titleGCP Banking Data profile Missing functionality More details on which rows are potentially duplicate As I failed to find them in the report or using pandas or manual query especially when the dataset is K lines or large datasets Screen Shot at Proposed feature Just like Missing values and correlations tabs at the bottom of the report we could have one for Duplicated rows or information as well Also a bit of an outline what is deemed as duplicate in my case out of K were duplicate its a marginal figure but its also good to know which ones are they and what are they they might make a small dent on the endresults Alternatives considered Maybe manually query or use pandas to filter duplicate rows Additional context Unfortunately I cant share the dataset but if I can reproduce this via another instance that is shareable I will do so Although I think its not a bug as such Missing functionality On the back of the issue raised I would like to request for improved documentation about removed features and alternative ways to overcome them when using the new version of pandasprofiling starting v Proposed feature docs on why stylefullwidth True minifyhtmlTrue cannot be used anymore and what to do instead changes made to how rejected variables info can be retrieved once the profiling task is finished some more details on what kind of correlations are used and this can be selected via a parameter I did see some work go in wrt to this see Also described in Alternatives considered A solution or two provided in Question If I ran pandasprofiling on a raw dataset and then on a preprocessed version of the same dataset would I notice a change or improvement in the results The preprocessed version would have columns scaled normalised and scaled Does scaling or encoding the columns help with accuracy or performance Note I dont mean removing outliers or bad data or those kinds of preprocessing Version information Current or previous versions of pandasprofiling PS can we also have a Question type for raising issues as this is not a bug report Missing functionality Testing does not verify the types but type hints are often provided Static type checking can help us catch errors Proposed feature Static type checking should be integrated into the testing suite Problems detected by the type checker should be resolved Add to travisciyml if TEST types then pytest mypy m mypy pandasprofiling fi Add to requirementstesttxt pytestmypy mypy Alternatives considered There are more static type checkers available for Python For example Microsofts Pyright Arguments for a specific alternative type checker are welcome Abnormal values analysis Division by zero is fixed The error Division by zero is fixed For the variant of matches of values P and P the check for increase in percentage of a maximum from P For the variant of matches of values P and P the check for increase in percentage of P from a minimum Added flag checkabnormalvalues to initiate abnormal values analysis can be False by default Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe When youre profiling data and have a report later down the line you might have to reprofile that same data to see how the data has progressed This includes going through both reports and manually comparing the difference in them Describe the solution youd like A nice solution to this would be a system to compare two reports to highlight and outline the differences between the report in terms of how this data is being transformed
