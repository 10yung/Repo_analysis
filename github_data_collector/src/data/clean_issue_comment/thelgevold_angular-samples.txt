 I was using the example you have on testing an EventEmitter and I discovered that my test was passing because the test runner could not find an expectation Try changing the expect inside the subscription to be something you know will fail like expect false to equal true and your test might still come back that it passed Maybe I just have something setup incorrectly so Im sorry if Im wrong about this but I just wanted to give you a warning In angular samplesunittestscenarioseventemittereventemitterspects folder can you explain the code there My understand about your code would be you called the function sayHello in the code manually why dont you use mouse event function like click Of course I dont know if there is such click function exist why put childsayHello after childgreetingsubscribe Can you explain how the done function work here Is there any other way to handle asyn problem I have heard that angular make it more easier to deal with the problem When I looked at your blog I still have some questions Can you recommend me some reference to learn Angular an Angular unit testing
