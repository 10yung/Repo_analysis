Is there an alternative NanoCPUs is the simplest way to limit CPU usage by a container It is in the docker HostConfig within the Resources struct see Thanks Hi Any plans to add an SSH client to docker lib From users can connect to the docker daemon using SSH password less Situation I have a docker daemon running under CoreOS and exposed the TCP port by creating and binding a TCP socket as described in the docs I have the situation that in some cases the server config using Ignition fails and the docker daemon does not start up but the socket on port is reachable When calling now clientPullImage the request stays hanging at that point I tried to pass InactivityTimeout but without result Is there some other way to pass some timeout to the PullImage call thx cheers Heiko
