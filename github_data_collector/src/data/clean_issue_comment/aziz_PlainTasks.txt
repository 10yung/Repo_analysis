Hey this is my absolute favorite todo list and Id really like to encourage the development of some features that I and probably many others desperately need Is there a way to create monetary incentives in form of bounties for issues aziz I would also love to know if you are interested in giving other people maintenance or even ownership rights or if you would rather have people fork the project The Readme lists the headertotask attribute which If true a project title line will be converted to a task on the certain keystroke Theres no documentation on what this keystroke is or how to set it Being able to convert a task to a project or a project to a task would be quite useful which seems like this is the intended purpose of this attribute Thanks for the very nice work I come here in search of a substitution of Taskpaper when Im not on my mac and intend to use both interchangeably I wonder is there some secret user setting to replace the tag started in PlainTasks with start which is what Taskpaper use for counting days spent etc In the worst case I can findreplace upon opening and closing the file but Im hoping I can avoid that When you have a TODO file open and you browse the available color schemes in Sublime you can see the plaintask colors changing on the fly and adapting to the currently selected scheme You can see this behaviour here However when you actually switch to a color scheme it reverts to the default theme or the one specified in the configuration file Is it possible to use no color scheme at all and instead adapt to whatever scheme is being used in Sublime I tried setting the colorscheme property in settings to nothing but then there was no highlighting at all If you remove the key completely then it just uses the default theme Filter by tag also folds some of the abovelying project titles Is this a bug Or am I misunderstanding it afbeelding It would be great to add support for opening https links or basically opening any schema links ftp file etc You could use the same shortcut ctrlo What do you think It will be nice to have this extension in VS Code Nothing in VS Code comes close to this one ToDo is similar but missing some features This is minor but the link to your introduction screencast ends with video unavailable It appears that the statistics at the bottom ie overall document statistics dont get updated when you remove task items until you take focus off the document then return to it For example if I have out of tasks marked as done the bottom statistics will say done But if I remove two of them it doesnt update the statistics until I switch to another document or application the come back to it At that point itll say done Given that those statistics get updated immediately when adding new tasks Id think theyre intended to work the same way when removing tasks Themes stop working after commit c bba a cbf f a
