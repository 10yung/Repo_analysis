Sometimes I want to add custom entries to pages that already contain entries The tldr guidelines only allow up to entries per page Maybe we could set up a way to register patchfiles with tealdeer eg by placing them somewhere in the configtealdeer directory Those patchfiles would be appended to the corresponding pages when updating the cache tealdeer currently fetches all languages from the tldrsh API However it only ever displays English documentation It seems that tealdeer should offer a flagconfig option that would display documentation from other languages when available Or maybe it should read the LANG environmental variable Alternatively if tealdeer is not going to display nonEnglish documentation it probably should not save the nonEnglish docs in the users cache since they take up space without providing any benefit In an ideal world tealdeer would offer a user the option of selecting their languages before downloading the cache but that seems like a lower priority This is useful for when you want to open it up in a pager which doesnt support ansi escape codes by default In my use case it allows me to open it inside vim without having to use an addon to convert ansi escape codes to colours Compiling pager v error E failed to resolve could not find unix in os C Users user cargo registry src githubcom ecc db ec pager src utilsrs use stdosunixffiOsStringExt could

and they are problems with it See In they migrated to the directories crate Maybe tealdeer should do this too As discussed in there could be a config option where if its set the cache automatically refreshes itself when its outdated Implementation notes copied from here This would require a slight reorganization of the main function Handle argsflagconfigpath and argsflagseedconfig right after handling argsflagversion simply move up the code blocks Move the config loading code in printpage into the main function right after the argsflagseedconfig handling block In srcconfigrs add the new config elements to the RawConfig and Config structs and add the defaults to RawConfignew The default configuration can be generated with tldr seedconfig My suggestion would be updates autoupdate false autoupdateintervalhours The autoupdateintervalhours could then be set to MAXCACHEAGE by default I am running FreeBSD but trying to use tldr os sunos truss to view the page for SunOSs truss which
