 pagefacingup Context During work on saw that intercept function is too hard to read and understand This is the main reason of this PR pencil Changes Moved parts of code from intercept into new functions responsible for request and response Also cleaned up these code parts Changed transaction time measurement method from manual to invocation of available fields in Response class Updated documentation warning Breaking No pagefacingup Context After merging I decided to review some of the code which works with headers and simplify it a little bit both in terms of usage and code quality During this work I found out that comparison of headers in filterHeaders was casesensitive while the official HTTP standard states that header field names are caseinsensitive So it means that the library had a bug which I also fixed here pencil Changes Changed parameter type in redactHeader function to accept vararg note that nothing changes for existing users Replaced headers comparison with caseinsensitive alternative Updated Readme and ChuckerInterceptor documentation to match changes warning Breaking No camera Screenshots Before img width altScreen Shot at src After img width altScreen Shot at src pagefacingup Context After fixing visibility for internal classes I decided to also try to make all the resources we have like strings drawables values etc private so users wont see them in autocomplete suggestions According to all we need to do is to create some public resource might be even empty so others are marked as private in final aar Unfortunately this approach wont work when the library added as module like we have in sample app so wasnt able to check locally pencil Changes Added a single resource marked as public warning Breaking Nothing wrong expected pencil How to test Try to get snapshot from Jitpack as comgithubChuckerTeamChuckerfixhideresourcesSNAPSHOT and try to check autocomplete in the app using this dependency loudspeaker Describe the bug Selecting response body using select all IME prompt only selects the line and not entire body incidentally you are unable to select more than line using the drag handles bomb To Reproduce do request open response select a word via double tap then either press select all or try to drag the handles you are unable to wrench Expected behavior As with Chuck I expect to be able to select the entire response body camera

notifications sound but after looking through the code found some space for improvements like flexibility in turning onoff notifications for transactionserrors and some code improvements Also found out that icon for transactions notifications was the last raster drawable in the project and replaced it with vector pencil Changes Created separate notification channels for transactions and errors Replaced png Chucker notification icon with vector drawable Minor code cleanup crystalball Next steps Consider making notifications silent and without vibration but be sure that they appear on devices with Android Q without problems like in I believe it is caused by warning Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe The plugin which currently used for publishing along with POM generation is officially abandoned according to dart Describe the solution youd like In order to avoid possible problems with compatibility in future Chucker should migrate to some alternative like

offers quite a lot optimizations More info on changes The library is in release candidate state so I am sure that no changes should appear there and we can safely update Chucker to use latest components Additionally this migration allowed to make the code cleaner and more concise pencil Changes Added dependency to corresponding library Updated ViewPager adapters in MainActivity and TransactionActivity to be able to work with ViewPager as well as changed layouts to use ViewPager Please do provide url encode and decode for api request
