Hi When I run the command mosql collections collectionsyml skiptail for importing data from Mongo db to Postgre I am getting the following error rescue in block in copydata uninitialized constant MoSQLSchemaPGError NameError SQL Tables are creating successfully But the data is not imported Any idea about this issue Connects to Is this project dead I see no updates in a few years and all the pull requests are stale Should I bother fixing the tests in my PR and trying to integrate it Summary Im starting to use mosql to migrate from mongodb with mongoose schemas to postgres This diff has a number of improvements that were necessary for my migration Support for foreign keys on nested schemas ObjectId is now stored as bytea Support for array types Support for default notnull etc Better bulk insert support and perf via the the use of SequelDatabasemultiinsert Examples This corresponds to the following var ChildrenSchema new mongooseSchema name type String var TestSchema new mongooseSchema name type String tags type String balance type Number meta type Object children ChildrenSchema alphaflow test columns id source id type bytea notnull true name source name type text tags source tags type text array balance source balance type int meta source meta type jsonb meta table test schema alphaflow children meta table testchildren schema alphaflow columns id source id type bytea not null name source name type text Testing done A bunch of manual testing including on some rather complex schemas Note this diff is not safe to integrate as it broke most of the unit tests My company just used MoSQL to migrate our production MongoDB into Postgres but we needed it to support SSL for Composeio which it didnt seem to handle yet Hopefully this may be helpful for others trying to use this project in the future usrlocalrvmrubiesruby librubysiteruby rubygemsrb in findspecforexe cant find gem mosql a GemGemNotFoundException from usrlocalrvmrubiesruby librubysiteruby rubygemsrb in activatebinpath from usrlocalrvmgemsruby binmosql in main from usrlocalrvmgemsruby binrubyexecutablehooks in eval from usrlocalrvmgemsruby binrubyexecutablehooks in main Hi this merge request fixes some minor issues It was created with help of Feram repo If it helped to improve this repository please consider to star Ferams repo repo to show some love PS The Feram team feramhq is currently working on making this technology available for everyone If you want to be one of the first to use it please sign up up for the newsletter on feramco repo feramhq feramco I have not written Ruby for a while but I needed this for a project and it seems to work This adds the possibility of selecting a specific value using an array selector This is especially useful for projects where there are arrays where you always just want the first value rather than creating a Postgres array Hello Im very interesting in this approach I would like to know if you still use this method in Stripe or you can say something new about this Thank you Full table scans It would be great to be able to specify columns that need to be indexed in collectionsyml Ive been doing testing with this tool to migrate data from mongo db and this one of the issue that I have yet to find out a solution been wondering a while looking for a solution but theres no clear solution until now Please find the stack trace in the attachment mosql version unknown but when I try to uninstall the mosql it mentions the version of mosql ruby version ruby p revision x mingw I made a changes to clirb under this folder C Ruby x lib ruby gems gems mosql lib mosql to delete USR at line from the list to fix issue of running mosql Hope to hear from you guys stacktracetxt
