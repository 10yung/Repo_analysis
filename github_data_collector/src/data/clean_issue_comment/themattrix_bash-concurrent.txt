I checked the code superficially it seems the only place it uses sth BASH specific is BASHOPTS I havent been able to narrow when or how I get this error screen shot at am But it usually occurs when I run quite a large script over and over again Restarting the computer usually fixes this but not always Once my system gets in this state I cant even run the demosh file in this repo On this system the current TMPDIR is varfolders bmm f rz lbp rphrmv s gnT This line of code crtstatusdirmktemp d TMPDIRtmpconcurrentlibshXXXXXXXXXXX ultimately generates a Tconcurrent which is odd but I dont think is the problem Interestingly I can login to a different user account and the demo file works log back in to the original and still have the problem Hi everyone Your project awesome I would like to help to make the integration of the project to be easier with bpkgio bpkgio add project to the bpkgio bpkgio
