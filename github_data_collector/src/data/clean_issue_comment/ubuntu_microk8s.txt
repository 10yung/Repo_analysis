sinspect generated tarball inspectionreport targz We appreciate your feedback Thank you for using microk s Had been following the Quick start guide at May be related to but I see differences This is a clean install of ubuntu but running on zfs does this matter I have installed microk s via the snap the node will not ever become healthy Running on Ubuntu eon microk s v but I see Events Type Reason

scheduler and controllermanager components are listening I mean currently thuey are listening to and Is there any way to change that Hi I just install ubuntu on my raspberry pi b I just need some help When I install microk s I can not start a pod it is pending and when I try status an error is thown This are the commands sudo snap install microk s classic OK microk skubectl start OK microk sstatus microk s is not running Use microk sinspect for a deeper inspection microk skubectl create deployment nginx imagenginx OK but pod is in pending status Any ideas thankss this is my inspect

a Darwin Darwin Kernel Version Sat Nov PST rootxnu RELEASEX x multipass version multipass mac multipassd mac When running microk s on the server rather than doing port forwarding it should be possible to access the dashboard via ingress similar to kubeflow dashboard I run microk s in the restricted environment and google dns is unreachable Due to this reason I cant resolve any remote addresses as the default resolvers currently and by default point to describes how to change the value temporary but the settings revert if I enabledisable plugins There should be an option to set up upstream dns permanently If microk s is installed on a computer which has capital letters in the hostname pods cannot be created after enabling rbac The reason seems to be that the hostname is normalized to lowercase by kubernetes which fails rbac authorization checks when it is compared to the nonnormalized hostname Symptoms include failure registering the node failing to mount secrets etc I didnt keep a record of the different failures but this is an example note that the capitalization differs between the lease and the user Jan myPrecision microk sdaemonkubelet E controllergo failed to update node

lease with the same name as the requesting node After changing the computers hostname to be alllowercase everything worked perfectly With Kubeflow stable we can enable testing of microk senable kubeflow We would like to improve the microk sstatus command by offering descriptions for each addon This comes as a follow up to the work in and in an effort to address issues such as Please review the following doc and leave comments as you see fit Thanks Improve microk sstatus proposal
