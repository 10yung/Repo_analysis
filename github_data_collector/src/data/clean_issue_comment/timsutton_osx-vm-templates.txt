In Catalina the output for software update appears so Software Update Tool Finding available software Software Update found the following new or updated software Label Command Line Tools for Xcode Title Command Line Tools for Xcode Version Size K Recommended YES Label Command Line Tools for Xcode Title Command Line Tools for Xcode Version Size K Recommended YES softwareupdate i expect Command Line Tools for Xcode not Label Command Line Tools for Xcode Support for MojaveHigh Sierra is preserved since the added sed pipe wont change output without Label Hi timsutton I am wondering what it would take to get MacOS Mojave supported here Maybe it already works and the README hasnt been updated If it is not supported I am glad to help and make some PRs if Im pointed in the right direction In Yosemite the High Sierra installer is automatically downloaded to Applications when installing all updates This change ignores that update to keep the final box clean and without unncessary content This PR adds support for High Sierra to prepareisosh Removes some whitespace converts tabs to spaces A few minor changes suggested by shellcheck Sets checksum values to none since Packer warns if there is no checksum or checksum type specified Why Even though we cant install unsigned packages on anything beyond I think having this script support High Sierra is still useful This is based on preparevdish script and uses Parallels disk tools to convert a VDI into Parallels internal HDD format The new script preparepvmsh creates a Parallels virtual machine pvm with that disk attached The new VM is used by the new parallelspvm builder to build an image for vagrant Parallels disk tools should come with any installation of Parallels Desktop I am successfully using the new preparevdish script to generate a macOS VM Unfortunately it looks like Recovery Partition is not present in the resulting disk image I assume that is committed on purpose to save disk space Is there an easy way to transfer that partition from the sparse bundle I am using VMware Fusion Professional so that I can make use of the NVRAM to disable SIP and enable Kexts to be default imported This PR Is too large Complete rewrite of the README to make it more procedural and organized Switch from vdi to vhd type so that we can convert from VHD to both VirtualBox and Parallels disks Add Chefclient as a provisioner This was out of pure need for our own builds and base box creation so I thought it might be useful to have here Happy to remove if outside the scope of the repo Reformats templatejson with packer fix also subjectivepreference The prlctl commands are slightly nauseating but thats how packer fix chooses to format for some reason Adds a new preparepvmsh script to convert VHD into a parallels pvm to use with Packer More a lot more in the README Known Issues Questions Before Merging preparevhdsh does not actually work with any versions less than macOS Sierratable should probably be modified if it is okay to keep Adds a second version of installparallelstoolssh Although the two versions are basically the same thing I have found more consistent success with installparallelstoolssh Not sure why Open to suggestions This has been a WIP for a while so there might mistakes in here so keen eyes are appreciated Is macOS Server like a stripped down version of macOS for command line workflows and such If so could we include a shell script to generate ISOs for macOS Server and packer configuration for running macOS Server in Vagrant Im trying to get a High Sierra Vagrant box packed but after importing the OVF I get a UEFI shell with no access to ls Screenshot Im using High Sierra as the host as well as the guest Is there any particular reason that OSInstallmkpkg is listed twice in OSInstallcollection Is that some kind of workaround for some specific oddity or is this perhaps a typo
