I dont know if this is an issue with sbtweb or an consequence of my lack of knowlege about sbtweb and sbtplugin the context is a Play project I apologize if the latter is the case though Id appreciate some help Essentially Im trying to hook a task into the asset generation phase as described here Its sbtwebpack which is defined as an InputTask not a pipeline stage task Its dependent on the webjars so to my knowlegde this should work val foo TaskKey Unit foo foo printlnnow running foo foo in Assets foo in AssetsdependsOnWebKeyswebModules in Assetsvalue It does not What I am looking for is a way to have foo run in any asset generation phase ie assets stage dist run corejs is not copied to targetwebwebmodulesmainwebjarslib during the assets phase Every other npm webjars I tried is but for some reason corejs is not I can provide a test project if needed Steps to reproduce would be create new play project add following dependencies libraryDependencies orgwebjarsnpm corejs libraryDependencies orgwebjarsnpm decimaljs run sbt assets Result decimaljs is present in targetwebwebmodulesmainwebjarslib corejs is not Classloading policy changes lead to errors like this ERROR SECURITY

might be an sbtweb issue though we havent narrowed it down entirely yet I checked and the revisions with which the problem was reproduced both transitively depend on sbtweb More details at Im writing an SBT plugin and Id like to allow users to set different values for Setting String which is defined in my plugin in their own buildsbt There are Assets and TestAssets But these configs dont seem to allow me to achieve what I need Is there another way Thank you If you use sbtweb combined with Scalajs and you use the following in your buildsbt sbt managedClasspath in Runtime packageBin in Assetsvalue When you try to load the project in IntelliJ with this following line IntelliJ tries to do a full optimized Scalajs build when you try to load the SBT project Often this times out and causes the project to be unusable within Intellij I am not entirely sure if this is an issue with Scalajs or sbtweb sbtweb is what requires you to put managedClasspath in Runtime packageBin in Assetsvalue inside your buildsbt but I think this clashes with Scalajs If I the build with Assets Seqrjs the build can finish but if I run pipelineStages in Assets Seqrjs the build hangs after updating every time sbt frontcompile info Loading global plugins from homecodeapesbt plugins info Loading project definition from homecodeapesrcgitcronusproject info Set current project to cronus in

use autoprefixer to transform those css files Both less and autoprefixer will output source maps but in the end we only get the source map from the output of autoprefixer to the intermediate output of less rather than the original source file As a developer this complicates finding the source of a particular bug To remedy this I was thinking about writing a plugin that is able to merge all source maps produced when pushing a source file through the assets pipeline To do this Id need to know which source maps could be concatenated ie a sequence of source maps generated for a particular input file Ex styleless less lessstylecssmap autoprefixer autoprefixerstylecssmap For the input styleless Id like to get a Seqlessstylecssmap autoprefixerstylecssmap Is there any way of getting this information Not really a bug but trying out the following line in buildsbt as per the readme managedClasspath in Runtime packageBin in Assetsvalue I get the error Reference to undefined setting webassetspackageBin Ive added in pluginssbt only the following for sbtweb addSbtPlugincomtypesafesbt sbtweb latestrelease Any specific imports to be made What might be missing Also this piece from the same documentation yields an error WebKeyspackagePrefix in Assets public Hi I have a multimodule play app that has the following structure APP modules LINKSTOMODULEA LINKSTOMODULEB MODULES MODULEA MODULEB MODULEA and MODULEB have CoffeeScript assets and I have sbtcoffeescript plugin enabled in APP When I run APP and when APP is trying to compile the CoffeeScript assets in MODULEA and MODULEB it throws following exception javalangIllegalArgumentException runOps function returned results for unknown ops But if I replace the kinks under modules folder with the actual modules in MODULES folder everything would work Is there anyway to let sbtweb work with symbolic links currently Thanks Kinds Simon
