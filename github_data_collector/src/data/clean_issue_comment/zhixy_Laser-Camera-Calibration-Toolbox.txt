Does this also work for a D Laser Range Finder How can a D finder produce a depth image as shown in your tech report Hello I had trying to launch this tool on test data but Matlab outputs error Enter base name of scans without numbers or suffix lasertarget Enter suffix of scan files xyz Reference to nonexistent field activeimages Error in lasercamcalibsearchscansbnCallback line handlescamcalibparamsimagenumbersfindhandlescamcalibparamsactiveimages Error in guimainfcn line fevalvarargin Error in lasercamcalib line guimainfcnguiState varargin Error in matlabgraphicsinternalfigfileFigFilereadhObjecteventdatalasercamcalibsearchscansbnCallbackhObjecteventdataguidatahObject Error while evaluating UIControl Callback What I should do Regards Hello when I use this new fuction D display input p error double type cant match input param with fuction pointCloud Thanks Hello I am using your toolbox to calibrate with VLP Since it is a long range lidar it has an error rate which seems to bit a bit bigger than the device used in test sets around cm The procedure goes smooth but the result is simply bad and the fit as visually confirmed makes no sense Interestingly enough some samples even report a reflection where there is none making me believe that the program has an issue with extracting the target plane Can you comment on this How precise must this scanner be hello im using velodyne VLP LiDAR when i do calibrate camera and lidar data i have a error message about Index exceeds matrix dimensions Error in ObtainPlanePoint line indexsamples temp nsamples Error in selectplanefrompointcloudcontinuecallback line theta alpha minError inliers ObtainPlanePointpcLocationcurinfoPosition Error using uiwait line Error while evaluating UIControl Callback so what can i do next step Is there any way to directly import camera intrinsic parameters We are using bumblebee stereo cameras and their proprietary calibration already gives us very accurate values So we dont want to replace that with MATLAB calibration But when I loaded the sample CalibResultmat there are a lot more variables than whats in MATLABs cameraParameters object or struct like extrinsic of the boards and errors etc I tried to just create an instance of cameraParameters and just fill in the intrinsic with what we have but the GUI just crushes when trying to load the laser scans no activeimages in the parameter object
