As per title Swave website is inaccessible While the documentation already contains a few hopefully interesting showoff examples we can always use more This ticket serves as a standing issue to provide a ticket number that can be used in PRs contributing more examples Itd be great if all code examples on would be fully linked in a way that allows one to simply click on the identifier of a transformation to get to the respective documentation page Once we get done and their is already a complete automatic index of all transformations available it shouldnt be too hard to hook into the snip directive identify all transformation identifiers and inject the respective links Adding renaming removing transformations currently requires a manual update of the various index locations from where the transformation page is being referenced Once is resolved it should be possible to write a custom paradox directive which parses the transformation sources and generates the respective documentation indices automatically We currently dont run all tests on travis because the tests tagged as NotOnTravis arent stable enough due to timing issues Apart from having no build status info for the respective logic our test coverage data are therefore incorrect too low The task here is to tweak the NotOnTravis tests until they run smoothly on Travis and then remove the NotOnTravis tags Solution after the release of version Integrate the sbtmimaplugin into the build in order to be able to properly manage binary compatibility See for example the shapeless build for inspiration Especially synchronous pipelinesgraphs which dont need to dispatch onto any Executors which arent readily available in a nonJVM environment should work nicely with scalajs Solution enable scalajs support by modifying the build setup and properly separating dependencies Problem Users have very little information on the core entry points to the API the exact mechanics of each of the available stream operations the inner workings limitations guidelines Additionally contributors dont have any technical information on the best process for contributing especially with regard to adding new operations Proposed solution Put up and add proper documentation
