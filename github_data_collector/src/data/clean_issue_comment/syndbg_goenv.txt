Im not sure why goenv doesnt do anything here on aarch Ive installed both rbenv and pyenv too and pyenv is installing Python for me on there right now and I am pretty sure rbenv would be doing the same I tried running goenv install with verbose both on and off and nothing gets printed out to the console Heres the goenv section of bashrc export GOENVROOTHOMEgoenv export PATHGOENVROOTbinPATH eval goenv init export PATHGOROOTbinPATH export PATHPATHGOPATHbin Can INSTALLmd accept a complete refactoring at this point or should we keep adding exceptions and notes for eg zsh and Ubuntu I know that the existing INSTALLmd is pretty much a direct port of the one from pyenv Im wondering if were purposely staying with that template or if we can stray I ask because I may have another note to add to it On Ubuntu or any other distro that points BASHENV at bashrc if you follow the instructions in INSTALLmd it currently tells you to put the goenv init command in bashprofile to prevent a loop This can create a problem though because if you do that the goenv init command isnt run when starting a subshell from editors or IDEs I ran into this problem when using vimgo for instance because vimgo needs to be able to shell out to run guru etc When the subshell is started it doesnt run goenv init so GOPATH may not be set right depending on what else is in your dotfiles Heres a general fix Rather than call goenv init from bashprofile as INSTALLmd currently recommends I instead put this at the bottom of my bashrc if z GOENVINITDONE then export GOENVINITDONE export GOENVROOTHOMEgoenv export PATHGOENVROOTbinPATH eval goenv init export PATHGOROOTbinPATH export PATHGOPATHbinPATH fi For me this fixed the problem I had and I wonder if this sort of fix would prevent many of the problems others run into So rephrasing the question above should we add this sort of thing as yet another Ubuntu note in addition to the existing Ubuntu and zsh notes or should INSTALLmd be reworked completely For instance should we perhaps provide the above code as a script that is sourced from bashrc rather than continue with the multiple appends were doing now First off thanks for the great tool Ive run into a few problems since upgrading from version X brew install HEAD goenv Previously I had the following in my bashprofile which seemed to work ok if which goenv devnull then eval goenv init fi export GOPATHHOMEgo export PATHGOROOTbinPATH export PATHGOPATHbinPATH The docs for GOENVDISABLEGOPATH specify Its recommend that you use this as set to to avoid mixing multiple versions of golang packages at GOPATH when using different versions of golang See So now I have the following in my bashprofile and Im leaving goenv to manage my GOPATH if which goenv devnull then eval goenv init fi export PATHGOROOTbinPATH export PATHGOPATHbinPATH Currently my projects are all in the HOMEgosrc dir UsersgwgosrcgitlabcomGrahamWaltersprojecta UsersgwgosrcgitlabcomGrahamWaltersprojectb Can you confirm I should be moving them into the versioned dirs HOMEgoversionsrc Usersgwgo srcgitlabcomGrahamWaltersprojecta Usersgwgo srcgitlabcomGrahamWaltersprojectb Alternatively is it possible to only separate the binaries Something like the following UsersgwgosrcgitlabcomGrahamWaltersprojecta UsersgwgosrcgitlabcomGrahamWaltersprojectb Usersgwgo binprojecta Usersgwgo binprojectb Followed all the instructions but this doesnt seem to work on alpine or go and godoc give command not found gofmt works goenv gitmaster ls cache go darwinamd targz goenv gitmaster goenv install Downloading go darwinamd targz C it still needs to download the archive file gone version beta When printing out the version numbers they dont come out in semver order goenv versions set by homehughestgoenvversion Using sort fixes it but I dont know if this is a linux extension to sort or cross platform goenv versions sort versionsort set by homehughestgoenvversion Hi there I notice that there havent been any X releases lately in favour of beta releases Are we likely to see any more X releases coming out Is a stable release likely to drop soon If there arent likely to be any new X releases would it be appropriate if we updated the Homebrew references to point to the x betas Id love for my team to update to Go but ideally we can avoid manually managing our goenv installations Im less familiar how this project operates but is there intention in the future to decouple gobuild and goenv releases to allow for go version bumps independent of toolchain changes to goenv itself Okay so Im new to Go and found goenv since Im familiar with rbenv pyenv etc Im having trouble getting stuff installed with go get commands that have binaries to actually ever say anything other than command not found Forgive me if this has already been discussed I did browse the closed issues and the open issues but couldnt find exactly this Im assuming this works a lot like rbenv etc I use goenv as I would any other goenv install goenv global I install dependencies such as revel and dep with go get u githubcomgolangdepcmddep go get githubcomrevelrevel goenv rehash and I still am getting bash dep command not found bash revel command not found In my bashprofile on MacOS Sierra export GOENVROOTHOMEgoenv export PATHGOENVROOTbinPATH eval goenv init export GOPATHHOMEgo As seen above I even tried something from another closed issue for setting GOPATH to go as default But no dice Any tips on this
