Hi according to the paper section STN layer is used for transformation estimation Seems the implementation you use in this repo only support affine transformation So does it mean in Fig the warped input is just an affine transformation of Input frames To reproduce the results of the paper on video denoising I want to load the pretrained model to evaluate on the test set of Vimeo dataset But when I reload the model using torch I have encountered the following problem Warning Failed to load function from bytecode binary string not a precompiled chunkWarning Failed to load function from bytecode string unexpected symbol near char homemarstorchinstallbinlua homemarstorchinstallsharelua torchFilelua unknown object stack traceback C in function error homemarstorchinstallsharelua torchFilelua in function readObject homemarstorchinstallsharelua torchFilelua in function readObject homemarstorchinstallsharelua torchFilelua in function readObject homemarstorchinstallsharelua nnModulelua in function read rstorchinstallsharelua nnBatchNormalizationlua in function read homemarstorchinstallsharelua torchFilelua in function readObject homemarstorchinstallsharelua torchFilelua in function readObject homemarstorchinstallsharelua torchFilelua in function readObject homemarstorchinstallsharelua nnModulelua in function read homemarstorchinstallsharelua nnModulelua in function read homemarstorchinstallsharelua torchFilelua in function readObject homemarstorchinstallsharelua torchFilelua in function readObject homemarstorchinstallsharelua torchFilelua in function readObject homemarstorchinstallsharelua nnModulelua in function read homemarstorchinstallsharelua torchFilelua in function readObject homemarstorchinstallsharelua torchFilelua in function load demolua in main chunk C in function dofile marstorchinstalllibluarocksrockstreplscm binth in main chunk C in Could you help me check if the pretrained model has any problem anchen Hi anchen What is the number of parameters for the interpolation model We would like to compare your model with ours Thanks Thank you very much for your work It is a extremely good work I have a problem about how to divide vimeo K dataset into training set and LR images I have seen that there is a getpathsepm in srcevalution and septrainlisttxt in data I want to know how to call to generate the corresponding training set Thanks a lot Hi anchen I pretrained the flownet on the Sintel dataset but that does not converge The batchsize is and learning rate is the loss is defined by calculating the l difference between the last subnets output and the ground truth Can you share the details about pretraining the flownet
