Thanks Problem ShiftIt work perfectly for all apps windows except for Google Chromeapp Chrome windows just dont respond at all System MacBook Pro Late model with Touchbar macOS ShiftIt Google Chrome Attempts to solve Ive tried using both the hotkey activation and the SiftIt menu bar dropdown Both work for other apps but not for Chrome Ive trying to find any hotkeys in Chrome that might be overriding ShiftIt but havent found any Perhaps I dont know where to look Ive also tried searching online both in these Github issues and generally across the internet for anyone else with the same problem and found none I tried using different combinations of external keyboard and monitor to no avail Thanks in advance for any help and thanks making for this awesome app Here is what has happened Some time ago I got my macbook stolen from a hotel room in Vienna While I was waiting for a replacement it is a long process at the university where I work I got temporary replacement a dell with linux While it was kind of hard at the beginning after some time I started to like it Recently I got my hands on a new macbook pro and I realized that I dont want to use it anymore I was constantly hitting the esc key on the touchbar the keyboard was weird and it felt slow comparing to the dell I had despite the same spec Since I no longer use OSX I will not continue working on Shifit If there is somebody rca aegamesi vitalibozhko llouim derekwyatt for example who would like to maintain it I would be very happy ShiftIt solves of my windowing needs but I still keep Moom around for one thing making an app almost fullscreen meaning it takes up of the screen with padding on each side I like to do this with some apps because then I can easily click over to the apps behind it Im not sure what you would call this but if there was an option for this it would make ShiftIt perfect to me Heres what the setting looks like in Moom img width altscreen shot at am src On a laptop parking applications often leaves them too small Id like an option to park left or right but at of my screen width Could you create an option to park applications with custom dimensions ie left top right bottom Fantastic app Sometimes the ShiftIt hotkey recorder gets confused and wont let me assign a new hotkey combination unless I clear out all the olds ones and relaunch the app
