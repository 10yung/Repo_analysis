Hello I was trying to get a list of campaigns and their associated negative keyword lists using the CAMPAIGNSHAREDSETREPORT and got the following error xml version encoding UTF standalone yes reportDownloadErrorApiErrortypeQueryErrorDURINGCLAUSEREQUIRESDATECOLUMNtypetriggertriggerfieldPathfieldPathApiErrorreportDownloadError For context my code is listed below googleauth doAuth start end body statementselect cAccountDescriptiveNameCampaignIdCampaignNameCampaignStatusExternalCustomerIdSharedSetIdSharedSetNameSharedSetTypeStatus report CAMPAIGNSHAREDSETREPORT where startstart endend data getDataclientCustomerId googleauthgoogleauth statementbody I believe this is similar to issues and I was able to resolve this locally on my computer by appending CAMPAIGNSHAREDREPORT to the code block in the statement function to ensure that the AdWords query did not include a during clause example below following reports without statistics and date column comment Im not sure if this quick fix would impact other parts of the code though reports without statistics and date column ifreport in cLABELREPORT CAMPAIGNNEGATIVEKEYWORDSPERFORMANCEREPORT CAMPAIGNNEGATIVELOCATIONSREPORT CAMPAIGNNEGATIVEPLACEMENTSPERFORMANCEREPORT CAMPAIGNSHAREDSETREPORT body sprintfrdquerySELECTsFROMs fmtsselectAreportfmt printsprintfThe Adwords API does not support date ranges in the s Thus date ranges will be ignored report attach report Type compression and apiVersion as attributes of body attrbodyreportType report attrbodycompressed compress attrbodyapiVersion apiVersion return body Sorry if Im missing anything obvious here The csv files in the folder extdata are not updated therefore when Im trying to choose some new metrics that have been added to the reports an error is obtained Is it possible to update those files to their latest version The specific error that I found was when using the AUDIENCEPERFORMANCEREPORT Thanks Manuel Lopes Hi Ive gone through the process of

following error shows up Warning message In readLinescon gzfiletmp encoding UTF incomplete final line found on AppData Local Temp Rtmpg qD x file b ff I was wondering if it is because of the recent addition of UTF encoding The Adwords API only provides geolocation Ids within the GEOPERFORMANCEREPORT Google provides a csv file that matches geolocation Ids to the location name Add csv file as external data to the package and merge names to the result of the GEOPERFORMANCEREPORT The function getData calls the RCurl function getURL I would like to set Curl options so that I can authenticate to my proxy Id like to set Curl options in a similar fashian as below Can a passtrough variable be implemented in the function getData to set these options opts list proxy PROXYURL proxyauth proxyuserpwd proxyport curl getCurlHandle curlSetOptopts opts curl curl ans getURL curl curl ans Regards Stam
