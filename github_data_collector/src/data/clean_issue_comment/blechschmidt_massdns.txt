I wanted to know if a big amount of resolvers is needed for the tool to work properly i tried running the tool with only public and common DNS resolvers and the tool had less REFUSED does that mean that is running ok What would be a good value for s if i have only resolvers in resolverstxt Greetings Thanks for this wonderful tool I am facing following issues while using this tool The tool is not scanning all domains when given list of domains hardly scans of them which I verified by grep QUESTION SECTION in output file generated with o F switch Although above problem is solved for now by using s default is so I think you should change the default value to No explicit option to grep Domain having NXDOMAIN status since it is required for finding domains vulnerable to subdomain takeoverlike Azure Although above problem can be solved by massdns q t A r optresolverstxt domainlisttxt o F w outputmassdnstxt cat outputmassdnstxt grep NXDOMAIN A grep CNAME But it is not efficient Getting different result when using o F and then w and only using w without any output flag Although result should come sameSo please tell me if o F append some extra details which are drop when we are not using it Include Option which do below operation Take list of domains and output only those domain names whose IP can be resolved Should also exclude those domains which have status NO ERROR but only have CNAME and no IP Since this list can be passed further to httprobeor CURL or other tools which do some active scanningAs list fetched above will assure that the domains IP recored exist It would be useful to get the resolver that returned the response in the output Makes it easier to remove resolvers that are returning bogus responses While I was using subbrute script I noticed all the domains were concatenated there was now new line between the domains printed out Trying to find out why all I had to do was to had a n to the script and it all got fixed up When given domain file is empty the program stucks and doesnt exit My command massdns r toolsmassdnslistsresolverstxt hoststxt wc hoststxt result hoststxt Yet another enhancement PR if you know the dedicated resolvers per domain it would be nice to be able to specify those as well in the domains file Suggested implementation space separated list of dedicated resolver after the domain on the same line in the domains input file Thanks for your nice tool to quickly resolve tons of domains It is however not very easy to further process the plain answers with the existing output options Therefore I added another option simple csv to easily parse and process the answers per domain Try to add spysecom it will speed up the recon process and enrich the output hello thanks for this program With massdns i just want to get nxdomain results What command should I run to find nxdomain subdomain names When I run the program with the t flag is works perfect but when I try to change it to type the program breaks with the following error Failed to open domain file type
