This is desirable to prove authorship and because some AVfirewall software complains about unsigned executables Electron builder signs too many files including files that are already signed by Microsoft etc so select files are signed in buildsh instead More files could be signed eg Windows modules Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend This PR reworks the ping monitor to use traffic data from wireguardgo to infer whether a WireGuard tunnel is actually working This brings about extra timeouts timeout for seeing an increase in received traffic over the tunnel seconds timeout for seeing any traffic in the tunnel seconds ICMP timeout seconds The new connectivity checker will infer that the tunnel is working fine by analyzing the traffic data If there seems to be an issue an ICMP packet will be sent to the gateway No response will be waited for connectivity will be infered by observing whether there was an increase in received traffic after the ICMP packet was sent To aid in delivery an ICMP packet is being sent every seconds ICMP packets will be sent to the server to see if the tunnel is working in the following conditions if the last time traffic was received was more than seconds after traffic was sent out over the tunnel If no traffic has been sent or received in the last seconds The changes above are expected to improve the connection stability by not relying on ICMP responses being delivered of the time and decreasing the traffic overhead to verify connectivity by inferring connectivity by counting the amount of traffic thats received over the tunnel The newly introduced timeouts are subject to change after more extensive testing has been done These changes rely on Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend Currently I cannot get Mullvad to work with Windows Sandbox When running the Mullvad VPN app as the host the sandbox never has internet connection when the Mullvad VPN app is active I can get internet access inside of the sandbox if I disconnect from Mullvad This PR replaces the manual mullvadjniFromJava implementations with jnixFromJava derivations Git checklist x Describe the change in CHANGELOGmd under the Unreleased header Internal refactor no user visible changes x Check that commits follow the Mullvad coding guidelines Reviewablestart This change is img src height alignabsmiddle altReviewable Reviewableend Hello guys and thank your for your wonderful job I run android aosp at beta with redmi a I have always on VPN and the battery drain is huge is there any update coming soon is it known I know the typical Gentoo user would rather stick to wgquick but I wonder if anyone else is interested in an eBuild for Gentoo The app refuses to install on unofficial Lineage ROMs Android with the error Android min not sure what are the variables checked by the apk tested with Nexus hammerhead and nexus WiFi grouper Hey Im having trouble with the mullvad vpn client app for linux causing a memory leak in gnomeshell Here I have listed steps to reproduce as well as things I have tried to remedy the problem Install ubuntu Download latestdeb file from mullvad website here Name of file after downloading MullvadVPN amd deb Install Run the mullvad app Notice gnomeshell freezes for a few seconds Amount of time it freezes varies from time to time but no more than seconds Open gnomesystemmonitor Notice a sizable increase in memory allocation to gnomeshell It varies each time I have noticed upwards of gb being used I wanted to be as accurate as possible so I am doing this as I type and in this particular instance I have noticed an increased of around MiB Steps taken to Fix Uninstall and reinstall mullvad Conclusion Did not work Uninstall all extensions except for the that I knew were working before the slowdown Conclusion Did not work Install older version of mullvad app Conclusion did not work Fresh install of ubuntu Conclusion Fixed slightly the app still freezes gnomeshell for the length of time stated earlier but the memory leak is not as big or non existent Right now I am seeing aproximatley Mib left over However after performing this test again gnomeshell shot up to using Gib All of this as reported by gnomesystemmonitor Thoughts currently maybe some update to one of the libraries that the app relies on has caused a problem PS Hope this helps Let me know if there is anymore information I can provide Hi loving Mullvad thank you I just noticed that there was an update to the Mac client but if I hadnt just manually opened the VPN to change locations theres no telling how long it would have been until I noticed that there was an update Please consider changing the icon or popping up a message on start upconnection about an update so that we can always stay up to date Can we get a label with the server ownership in the long list of the servers That would be a nice little detail to have thanks
