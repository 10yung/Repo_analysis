I love using markdown but it just never looks right in the terminal I think something like this could really fix that I realize this project had very lofty goals from the start and that it would take a tremendous amount of time and effort That being said the latest commit was nine months ago Im not trying to complain about this as I realize people have busy lives but I am wondering if you plan on picking this back up or if it is abandoned Joyful compiler errors error E the trait cmdsEscCode cannot be made into an object homeseunlanlegecargogitcheckoutsnottyencoding bc f ba cacaba

rustc version rustc nightly f b e I have a little idea but dont know how it could be done or if its even doable or not The magic wormhole is a fifo between multiple terminal Lets take an example You open a terminal You connect to ssh You then enter a container with lxcattach n foobar You open another terminal You start another ssh session on another machine which cant reach the lxc container You startentertrigger the magic wormhole to bind the two terminal to get data from one term to the other That way you can transfer files or even pipe commands between the two terminals For now you can mimic this with tmux by using buffer copy and all but its quite complex and not very reliable I discussed a bit of this on alacrittys irc channel and was redirected here What do you think of this Is it out of scope technically not feasible Some apps like debconf support dialog for drawing various widgets in traditional terminals If notty can operate as a dropin replacement for dialog or whiptale then it may in that way find some customers Hi Im trying to compile notty and have run into an error building the encoding package Here is the output from my build bash notty gitmaster cargo build

Michael Grunder mgrunder Secure Virtual Memory Enabled System Integrity Protection Disabled Time since boot days minutes I was able to find a few places on the net mentioning this error but unfortunately I dont know nearly enough about rust to figure out a solution Hopefully Im not missing something totally obvious here smiley Edit I get the same error in Ubuntu Hey im really hyped to try out notty but i havent been able to compile it The compilation always crashes because of glib v ive pasted the relevant errors below Im already using the nightly build of rust so it should compile fine since there are other OSX users here that have managed to compile it without errors Ive tried using a newer package of glib but unfortunately that didnt help Also searched on Google and stackoverflow and found some similar problems with glib But the solutions provided there also didnt help Like reinstalling the glib located at usrlocalopt with brew Didnt help either Then cargo updateand rebuild still failing at the same point What could be wrong with my installation settings Do i need a specific glib version or some extra flags to get past the errors Here are the generated

Build failed waiting for other jobs to finish error build failed Hi I am the developer of a new terminal emulator and I am considering adding graphics rendering capabilities to it To that end I have posted some thoughts here Since you also seem to be trying to develop standards in this space I thought I would invite you to join the discussion Theres a typo in Readmemd not have been possible for the physical terminals other terminals emulate You probably wanted to remove other terminals and replace it with to With this pressing AltGr doesnt crash terminal anymore There are other keys that do crash it should I just keep adding them to the match Edit nvm looks like adding other keys to match causes terminal to break
