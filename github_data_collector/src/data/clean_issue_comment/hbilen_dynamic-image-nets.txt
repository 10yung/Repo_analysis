Love the work I am just having difficulty understanding the architecture for the SI DI model From what I see in the architecture of the resnextmat model the model uses a temporal max pooling layer just before the softmax layer It says the input to the temporal max pooling layer are the merged conv features and Video I am assuming the merged conv features come from running the dynamic image through the ResNext model Where does the Video come from Are we supposed to pass the whole video or just a single frame from the video clip I am a newcomer to programming After the fifth step I want to compute approximate dynamic images and get the dynamic image but I didnt find the relevant code I dont know what to do next Thank you for your help Hi I have two questions to ask you thanks How to extract the optical flow diagram How to combine SIDIOFDOF to get accuracy I am trying to train own data using your model My dataset contains folders each of which has frames There are two classes normal and abnormal I wrote the custom sepupdatam for it When I run maintrainm some errors occurred as follow How can I solve it Will I need to change the parameters of architecture to fit this dataset Thanks for your time screenshot from
