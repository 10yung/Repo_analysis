I dont understand the function of flag in example howtodetermineifathreadhasstarted The scripts works fine when I remove the flag part likes below import threading import time class PeriodicTimer def initself interval selfinterval interval selfcv threadingCondition def startself t threadingThreadtargetselfrun tdaemon True tstart def runself printrunning start while True timesleepselfinterval with selfcv selfcvnotifyall def waitfottickself with selfcv selfcvwait ptimer PeriodicTimer ptimerstart def countdownnticks printcountdown start while nticks ptimerwaitfottick printTminus nticks nticks def countuplast n printcounting start while n last ptimerwaitfottick printCounting n n threadingThreadtargetcountdown args start threadingThreadtargetcountup args start should be recompiler because with r backslashes will be remained so the findall should return The fix should be to delete the two backslashes The code has missed ignoretypes arg when calling the method of flatten recursively in the example about how to flatten a nested sequence src howtoflattenanestedsequenceexamplepy python from collections import Iterable def flattenitems ignoretypesstr bytes for x in items if isinstancex Iterable and not isinstancex ignoretypes yield from flattenx else yield x The corrected code is yield from flattenx ignoretypes The code is not provided with any kind of license making it difficult to determine if these snippets can be used in a professional context If the ignoretypes is tuple instead of default str bytes need add ignoretypes argument when calling flatten recursively Hello I have set up the urlimportpy script as described but from the jupyternotebook a method or attribute from urlimportpy is not being recognized as such img width altscreen shot at pm src pythoncookbooksrc extendingclasseswithmixinsexample py thats seem not a solutino for minin class which needs init method i have checked on python this is what i got C Python pythonexe Ddevpythonpyqtworkapcepyqtwidgettesttestpy File Ddevpythonpyqtworkapcepyqtwidgettesttestpy line def initself args restrictkeytype kwargs SyntaxError invalid syntax hi David i have just tested pythoncookbooksrc lazilycomputedattributesexample py but happened to findout it does not workout like what the book tell which i meam python cookbook rd After a little research i found that you need to put a object there like this class lazypropertyobject but i dont konw why please tell me if you know PS TEST based on PyCharm Build PY built on December Subscription is active until February JRE b amd JVM Java HotSpotTM Bit Server VM by Oracle Corporation Python v d b a f Dec MSC v bit AMD on win
