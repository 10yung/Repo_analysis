I was wondering how I would edit the table of contents I was using this example as a guideline However under the contents section I dont know how make these contents my own My guess was to edit the Exampleaux filehowever when I use nbpublish it does not update the pdf What is the best way for me to edit table of contents Thanks Hi The issue is related to the resulting image size produced by imagesvconcat and imageshconcat in nbsetuppy I believe that the width height argument of thumbnail should be set to newimthumbnailwidth height pimageANTIALIAS should be replaced by newimthumbnailtotalwidthmaxheight pimageANTIALIAS Thanks for validating and updating your code if correct Is your feature request related to a problem Please describe The export plugins that ship contain many duplicated properties Moreover the documentation states that the procedure for creating a new export plugin is to manually copy one of the existing json files and then add or amend properties in the new file This makes it hard to maintain export configurations as it violates the onceandonlyonce principle Describe the solution youd like Allow export configurations to inherit properties from a parent This would make it simpler to maintain and configure export plugins Describe alternatives youve considered Manually copying andor updating all related json files whenever a change is made Additional context Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here Fix for bug A new SkipIgnored preprocessor has been added and this preprocessor is now configured in the export plugins exluding the standard formats Bug Report Describe the bug The documentation seems to imply that the ipubignore cell metadata applies for all formats but in fact it is only used by slidesfrommarkdown preprocessor To Reproduce Mark a cell to be ignored in a notebook and publish it to a nonslide format eg latex Expected Behaviour The converted notebook should not contain any slides whose metadata has ipubignoretrue Runtime Information please complete the following information IPyPublish eg Python eg OS eg Linux Mint Pandoc optional for pdf issues texlive run tex optional for pdf issues latexmk run latexmk version I am trying to add raw latex into the tex document when converting with nbpublish pdf but I cannot figure out what metadata I need to add either in the document or cell level to get nbpublish to recognize the latex when celltype raw It seems nbpublish ignores the raw cells as designed in the opt in philosophy Which I agree with just want raw latex cells to opt in when needed I can inject raw latex into the tex document when the cell type is markdown but having the raw celltype with the a metadata tag would be good When I was playing around with reproducing the figures shown in the docs it took me an embarrassing amount of time to realize how the metadata inside the cell was vital to controlling the output A clearer example to reproduce the code snippets seen in the docs might be show the code with the corresponding metadata Paring the code with the metadata might also help with explaining the workflow When I first stumbled onto the package I was a little loss with putting everything together The Getting Started page does have an Important tag related to this concern But its so far down the page and it took me reading a majority of the docs to realize the significance Bug Report Describe the bug When using nbpublish with the o option specifying a relative path such as results in the following error message ERRORwritetextfilethe postprocessor requires an absolute folder path To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior Specify a relative path when using nbpublish eg bash nbpublish log debug f slidesipypublishall bayesslidesipynb o target for extended explanation use the additional context section Minimal Notebook Example If possible please create a minimal Jupyter Notebook to replicate the issue Then rename its file extension to txt since Github rejects ipynb and drag and drop it here Expected Behaviour nbpublish should write the published files to the target folder in the current working directory Runtime Information please complete the following information IPyPublish eg Python eg OS eg Ubuntu LTS Pandoc optional for pdf issues texlive run tex optional for pdf issues latexmk run latexmk version Versions of any other relevant python packages Additional context This makes it difficult to automate the publication process using build tools such as Make Note that although by default nbpublish will construct an absolute path this path is still relative to the location of the source file Consider a simple example usecase where we want files to be written to the directory target relative to the source files instead of the default converted The only way to achieve this without relative paths currently is to specify the absolute path of the project thus creating

names jupyternbconvert which are changing to eg displayprioritytpl displaypriorityj see also jupyternbconvert Im trying to use imagesgridconcat to display a few images that I have stored locally However once they are displayed in a Jupyter notebook their resolution becomes much worse probably owing to their new size Is there a way to have them being shown with another size inline Adjusting width or height in nbsetupimagesgridconcatimages width height does not change their inline display I was also able to use mygridnbsetupimagesgridconcatimages mygridresize PILImageANTIALIAS But the resolution issue is still there
