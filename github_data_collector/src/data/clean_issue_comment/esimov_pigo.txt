Hello I had a bug when I execute demo Its nothing bad githubcomesimovpigoexamplesfacedet python demopy Traceback most recent call last File demopy line in module cv circleframe intdet intdet intdet OverflowError signed integer is greater than maximum I was wondering why func Unpack Pigo error needs to be a method of the struct Pigo if that struct is never used inside the method I think making Unpack a method of the package instead of the struct would have less overhead when initializing the classifier What do you think The number of faces in this image should be rectangles so why get out file is rectangles iou or iou duogeren iou outduogeren iou outduogeren
