Thanks for awesome gem Hey there Just wanted to ping you that there is no license in the rubygem version of your gem It would be super cool to add it as it pings our monitoring system about using gems that are without any license Thanks in advance Ported tests to support RSpec syntax Updated Gemfilelock Immediately after updating the YML file I call upon the reload function to make sure the variable I use to read the YML file values are also updated But the variable is not being reflected fast enough I am forced to call upon reload function every time I use the variable just to make sure the correct value is being read This causes a horrible performance issue since it unnecessarily loads the YML file over and over again Making the file uneditable including getting git errors saying unable to unlink bad file descriptor As soon as I shut down the rails server the file is not locked anymore Files on my Windows host rails server in my Ubuntu VirtualBox symlinked network folders Has this gem been abandoned From the increase in pull requests and lack of merging Im assuming so But Im still happily using SettingsLogic in my projects Im curious if anyone is maintaining a replacement or has found a better implementation of the projects features Any plans to support Z Time zone abbreviation name This PR adds the ability to create a settings class with a nested namespace so the base hash can be fetched from inside some yaml key ruby somefilehereyml professional preferences order desc client prefs order asc class ProfessionalPreferences Settingslogic source somefilehereyml namespace professionalpreferences end ProfessionalPreferencesorder desc Clean version of this pullrequest
