libraryumapr librarytidyverse df asmatrixiris embedding umapdf The following error is generated by my RStudion when Im running the above code umaprerror Thanks Hi I am trying to use the package to create a UMAPbased unicategorical analysis similar to ONEsense but when I change umapdefaultsncomponent i get an error after the algorithm tries to create the initial embedding Error in result d drop FALSE incorrect number of dimensions I think that for the Python version this works fine Am I doing something wrong Can you help me out Thx Ed Code from vignette rmlist lsall TRUE devtoolsinstallgithubropenscilabsumapr force TRUE libraryumapr librarytidyverse df asmatrixiris embedding umapdf Error in throwe could not find function throw sessionInfo R version Platform x appledarwin bit Running under macOS Matrix products default BLAS SystemLibraryFrameworksAccelerateframeworkVersionsAFrameworksvecLibframeworkVersionsAlibBLASdylib LAPACK LibraryFrameworksRframeworkVersions ResourcesliblibRlapackdylib locale enUSUTF enUSUTF enUSUTF CenUSUTF enUSUTF attached base packages stats graphics grDevices utils datasets methods base other attached packages forcats stringr dplyr purrr readr tidyr tibble ggplot tidyverse umapr loaded via a namespace and not attached Rcpp cellranger pillar compiler plyr bindr tools lubridate jsonlite nlme gtable lattice pkgconfig rlang Matrix cli rstudioapi yaml haven bindrcpp withr xml httr hms grid tidyselect reticulate glue R readxl modelr magrittr backports scales rvest assertthat colorspace stringi lazyeval munsell broom crayon Hi I am using the r wrapper function of UMAP with all the requirements satisfied but unfortunately I cannot set the seed into the umapr function eg umaprumapiris nneighbors randomstate I always ran into the following error Error in pycallimplcallable dotsargs dotskeywords ValueError cannot be used to seed a numpyrandomRandomState instance However if I remove the randomstate parameter its working fine but not reproducible could you please suggest what could be the reason behind it and any help in solving the error Thank you Himanshu Doing this on large datasets with many variables requires returning a huge object which considerably slows it down and uses more memory Could make this optional behavior Is python available Is umap module available
