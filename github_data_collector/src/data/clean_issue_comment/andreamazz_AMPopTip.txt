I have a view as an anchor that moves when I go from portrait to landscape but the pop tip doesnt move with the anchor Is there a step I forgot When I custom my customView with gradient background color the arrow background color is difficult to adapt it Hi can we add a masking view that focus on the pointed view darken or colorize the entire view currently shown and do like a cutout to focus on the pointed view Attempted fix for Thanks for the great framework Wanted to report what seems like a bug with a similar behavior to In the image the tooltip is being presented from the superview of the people button it is pointing at but it ends up being positioned partially off screen The full config for the popTip is popTipcornerRadius popTiptextColor UIColorblack popTipbubbleColor UIColorwhite popTipborderColor UIColorwhite popTipshadowColor UIColorblack popTipshadowRadius popTipshadowOffset CGSizewidth height popTipshadowOpacity popTiparrowSize CGSizewidth height popTipedgeMargin popTippadding popTipshouldDismissOnTapOutside true popTipshouldDismissOnSwipeOutside true popTipshouldDismissOnTap true popTipconstrainInContainerView false Would it make sense to have a property like constrainOnScreen that is similar to constrainInContainerView except that a check is made to make sure that he tooltip is on screen Note that I increased edgeMargin to and it had no effect in this case Another side note is that I set edgeMargin to since if a tooltip is close to the top of the screen and the arrowSize is larger then the tooltip arrow does not render correctly but that is a separate issue I can file In the example above the superview is fully on the screen but because of constrainInContainerView false the tooltip is allowed to be laid out off the screen Also note that the tooltip could be presented from the keywindow or a top level view controller to avoid being offscreen since the window is full screen and constrainInContainerView can be set to true but then if the button or whatever the tooltip is pointing at moves then the tooltip is just left floating pointing at nothing Keeping the tooltip presented from a view close in the view hierarchy avoids a lot of corner case handling for when views move When I tap the PopTip the view below the PopTip also receives touch event Please let me know if anyone has solution for this Thanks in advance Hello How could I apply a UIBlurEffectStyle to my customView or the PopTip directly Currently the arrow is not shown when a view with blureffect is added to the poptip If you tap or swipe outside popup BUT overon existing UI control UIButton etc shouldDismissOnTapOutside shouldDismissOnSwipeOutside does not work It would really be helpful to cover this It is difficult otherwise complex UI many UI controls to cover all those situations and hide popup manually When PopTip is shown on TextField TextField need to be tap times for it to becomeFirstResponder or for the keyboard to appear st tap hides the PopTip then nd tap makes the TextField first responder and will show keyboard Even if shouldDismissOnTapOutside false it needs to be tap times for the TextField to becomeFirstResponder
