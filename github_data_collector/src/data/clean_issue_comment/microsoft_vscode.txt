How about using the font from JetBrains JetBrains Mono as the standard font The font was specially made for coding and will be used in every JetBrains IDE from now on IntelliJ IDEA etc The font has a full set of features which are meant to improve the coding experience I think its way better to read and the ligatures are very useful to me ligatures are disabled in VSCode by default tho For example I could explain all the features of the font but that would take too long I would suggest checking out Its also free to use JetBrains Mono typeface is available under the Apache license and can be used free of charge for both commercial and noncommercial purposes You do not need to give credit to JetBrains although we will appreciate it very much if you do Obviously this is just my opinion but I feel like this font fits very well into VSCode as it provides a better coding experience to me Feel free to drop your thoughts about this Peek Problem messages dont seem to be wrapping for me or displaying a scroll bar I dont know what the expected behaviour is meant to be It looks like its the same issue in Except the error message doesnt resize whenever I resize VSCode it just keeps cutting off more of the message Version Commit f dd dd b d f d ab c df Date T Z Electron Chrome Nodejs V electron OS Linux x arch Steps to Reproduce Open Peek problem dialog that extends across the screen

small at least in a hidpi screen with a x scaling factor Increase its size to Now parts of the GUI show way too big fonts documentation popups python interactive window output etc Launch with code disableextensions to check Does this issue occur when all extensions are disabled Yes So to recap Im unable to use Ubuntu Mono its either too small or it plays bad with other parts of the GUI My screen is x I love the toggle fold command because I can use the same keyboard shortcut to fold and unfold Im using space bar with a when expression that checks to see if Im in normal mode vim extension However the foldunfold recursively does not have a toggle I have unfold recursively set to shiftspace but I wish I could have that fold recursively as well Please read our Rules of Conduct
