 arm v arm v a I used WFLW to train pfld network but the landmark for eye openning and clossing did not work It means if I close my eyes the eyes landmark still likes opening state How do you train solve the issue in your model Thanks I am curious to know what kind of DL inference framework used this HyperLandmark android app Can you share this information lbfmodel dlib The android demo looks pretty good especially in terms of speed Can you share the strategy and the algorithm of face bounding box detection nv multiTrack FaceTrackingInit multiTrack Update multiTrack getTrackingInfo landmark Hello I have a custom model tflite model that predict the landmarks on the eye regions Can I use this model with the project to detect the eye region oppo A server Channel is unrecoverably broken and will be disposed DrawFacePoints As our recent researches use this code to detect human face landmarks Could you please provide the citation of this code
