 What is the problem I am trying to create an navigatable index of figures glossaries tables in markdown fe by applying some scope syntax and regenerating the index by looking up all the content with the same scope The already working table of contents seems like it could be enhanced to do this Im not sure if it is feasable to do so but it would be a great addition to be able to do so How can I reproduce it markdown Main Title Modified feature table of contents The usual table of contents goes here but for headlines marked with scope syntax only the main headline of that section will appear in the TOC none of its subheadlines Section section Section section Glossary glossary Resources resources Section Section Glossary scope glossary New feature Trying to introduce indextable of contents with scope glossary here The fragment IDs could be prefixed with that scope like the following links simulate Term glossaryterm Term glossaryterm Term Wont be shown in main TOC but in the Glossary index Term definition Term Neither will this Term definition Resources Some additional content It would be great to be able to call a command Update all table of contentsindices of course What is the problem I would love to be able to differentiate markdown headers with colors like offers but without the unneeded complexity of that extension How can I reproduce it NA Is there any error message in the console See VSCode Menu Bar Help Toggle Developer Tools No For the problem like command not found please try to wait for a few seconds after you open a Markdown file for the first time doesnt work update vscode doesnt work reinstall this extension still doesnt work please open the developer tools to see whether there is any error message and then paste it below What is the problem This is actually a feature request Is it possible to add a configuration setting to specify a path for HTML output in lieu of printing to the same path as the Markdown file By the way thank you for a terrific extension How can I reproduce it Is there any error message in the console See VSCode Menu Bar Help Toggle Developer Tools List autocomplete does not work if there is a code block above with language mark Example Fixed bug Fixed bug there autocomplete working SoftwareSerial mainSerialSERIALRX SERIALTX RX TX List item text List item there autocomplete working c SoftwareSerial serialSensorSERIALRX SERIALTX false RX TX Fixes there dont working Is there any error message in the console See VSCode Menu Bar Help Toggle Developer Tools There are no errors in the console For the problem like command not found please try to wait for a few seconds after you open a Markdown file for the first time doesnt work update vscode doesnt work reinstall this extension still doesnt work please open the developer tools to see whether there is any error message and then paste it below Hi In our team we would need to use different styling when printing to HTML There is currently style sheets added in the HTMLs and that makes difficult to overwrite the styles It would be nice to have a setting that allows us to select the css maybe either defaultsnone or a path entry For now we add a css html link at the top of our MD but its not overwriting the previous ones Thank you for your time Example markdown Test Heading heading Heading heading Heading Something Heading See Heading heading When I update Heading to Another Heading the toc changes to markdown Another Heading anotherheading Heading heading but the link See Heading heading does not Would be very nice to see a new feature that will update page links that link to sections when the section header changes Similar to but more dynamic For the problem like command not found please try to wait for a few seconds after you open a Markdown file for the first time doesnt work update vscode doesnt work reinstall this extension still doesnt work please open the developer tools to see whether there is any error message and then paste it below What is the problem markdown this extension stops users code snippets function markdown markdownjson I created an autocompletion file markdownjson for the markdown file I hope to add some personalized completion schemes but after the test I found that the plugin blocked my custom completion behavior How can I reproduce it user snippets It is hoped that in the next version the userdefined completion will not conflict with the plugins selfdefined completion function Perhaps a userdefined completion function can be added just like user snippets Is there any error message in the console See VSCode Menu Bar Help Toggle Developer Tools no For the problem like command not found please try to wait for a few seconds after you open a Markdown file for the first time doesnt work update vscode doesnt work reinstall this extension still doesnt work please open the developer tools to see whether there is any error message and then paste it below What is the problem In previous version of the plugin the behavior of TOC generation with inline code was md code code code With an update to the behavior is md code code code Notice the TOC generated does not have the backtick inline code marker Since I cannot find specific discussion in the CHANGELOG and in the issues I would like to ask if the change was intentional or accidental How can I reproduce it Install version and to see the difference What is the problem global def doesnt persist between math expressions as described in Katex Official Documentation unless at least one macro is defined in Settings How can I reproduce it Delete all entries of markdownextensionkatexmacros in settingsjson reload window then create a markdown file with content as below markdown global def ud mathrmd ud ud is shown red in the preview panel Then add entry in settingsjson json markdownextensionkatexmacros whatever textwhatever Reload window and a roman d is shown in preview panel correctly By the way it seems that defining macros with arguments in settingsjson isnt supported Is there any error message in the console Seemingly there arent any error messages related to this plugin in the console backspace String s s
