Hi I have added google login button to my website and after the success authentication I can retrive user profile but when I reload the page press F I lose the authenticated user profile How can I retrieve the authenticated user profile I have added a cookie to maintain the session but I cant get the user profile by googlesignin library These are my use cases A Without reload the page Working Open the website Sign in with google account Browse in the website Logout from the website B Reloading the page Issue Open the website Sign in with google account Browse in the website Reload the website Logout from the website Issue because I lost the authenticated user after the reload and it shows an issue in the next code const auth gapiauth getAuthInstance await auth signOut Thanks in advance Device iPhone X OS version iOS SDK version Steps to reproduce Create a Google SignIn button and display it Rotate the device Observed Results As you can see in the images the text of the button doesnt fit itself well to the new buttons size more correct to say that it does fits itself when it should remain as is in bother orientations Portrait to Landscape Landscape to Portrait Notice that after hovering holding the button and release it outside of the buttons bounds fixing the issue so you may just run the same process you run when hovering the button on screen rotation Expected Results The text shouldn t smear or shrink like it does Device iPhone X OS version iOS SDK version Steps to reproduce Create a Google SignIn button among with another buttons to see the difference Observed Results As you can see in the image the buttons height is smaller than the rest of the buttons what also makes the G logo to be noncentered and not aligned to the SignIn text Expected Results The button should fit its container and align the G logo in the center of the button vertically Relevant Code Im getting some warning about auto generated height in the console LayoutConstraints Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints Probably at least one of the constraints in the following list is one you dont want Try this look at each constraint and try to figure out which you dont expect find the code that added the unwanted constraint or constraints and fix it NSLayoutConstraint x b a FBSDKLoginButton x d U d U ea U d U d U e height active NSLayoutConstraint x e buttonHeight

Describe the problem When font size is set to maximum on device no scrollbar visible on google signin popup dialog See below screenshot img width altScreen Shot at PM src Steps to reproduce Set fontsize to maximum on device Make sure device has logged in google accounts Open app supporting google signin Attempt signin with google Rotate the device to landscape Observe no indication of scrollbar as shown in image above Observed Results No scrollbar visible even though we have more content Expected Results Scrollbar should be visible indicating there is more content to be seen in the popup Step Are you in the right place For issues or feature requests related to the code in this repository file a Github issue For general technical questions post a question on StackOverflow tagged appropriately Step Describe your environment Device iPhone devices OS version ios ios ios ios SDK version Using the libGoogleAnalyticsServicesa file to analytics Step Describe the problem We are getting crash logs in Fabric related to Google Analytics Most of them occur when the user is in background We have a theory regarding these We believe they might be occurring as Google Analytics tries to access its sqlite file for data using a backgroundTask But when the device is locked it is unsuccessful to get the data as we were using NSFileProtectionComplete and hence it crashes This is our assumption and we would like to know if anything similar has been observed with other projects We have changed our protection level to NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication but are still getting the crashes We came across a link in the Apple developer forum stating that changing the Data Protection in the entitlements file might not always update it for all files and proper update happens when we programmatically change the protection level for all files Heres the link Again this is just our assumption and we would want to know if anything similar has been seen so that we are sure on how to resolve this issue Steps to reproduce We havent been able to reproduce these But we are getting a good number of crashes on Fabric Possible scenario Use the app version where Data protection was NSFileProtectionComplete Then update to a version where Data protection is NSFileProtectionCompleteUntilFirstUserAuthentication Then use the app for sometime for events to generate Then close the app and immediately lock the device Observed Results What happened This could be a description log output etc As mentioned we are getting a good number of crash logs on Fabric Expected Results What did you expect to happen Expected the app to not crash Relevant Code Heres the crashing stack Crashed GAIThread EXCBADACCESS x f Crashed GAIThread libsqlite dylib x e sqlite finalize
