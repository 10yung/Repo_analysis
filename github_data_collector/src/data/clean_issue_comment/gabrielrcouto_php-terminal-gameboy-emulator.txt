Sticking Timing Vars in Timing Trait If you think this is a good idea I can obviously continue this and repeat this for the first approx lines of variables that are set at the top of the Core class The Config DIR in my mind is a little easier to navigate and should make things easier to find Peace Clint How about branchseperated repo with zephir version What is zephir you may ask language to write extensions for php in simple way without knowing C to many indentations We can increase the FPS searching for performance bottlenecks After a research I disabled the scanLine function and the CPU emulation performance increased x On other words Lets improve what scanLine does The phar file is the repository itself Including it in the master branch is the same as including a duplicate of all the code which is probably out of date If youre installing the code via composer the phar is useless as you would just execute the bin file directly and ignore the phar reisraff suggested me a way to change the key mapping It will be nice to have some ini file were we can put the configs What is the best way to store the file Stored on a default folder like config Stored on any place and passed via argument config configini drmariodemo Simply put dont convert every time onetime or over multiple iterations build an array or object you can use to lookup values its going to be so much easier than computing anything to simply serialize the results somewhere even if its done at runtime costing RAM assuming the GBA has colours or something insane like that
