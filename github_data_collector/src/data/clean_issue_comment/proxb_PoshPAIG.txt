First of all Thanks for the great script just started using it and i already love it After Installing the Server SSU using PoshPAIG the following CU was not Downloaded instantly I had to reboot the System in order to get the Servers to download the following update wich was the CU When viewing the Windows Update Interface on the machine it still showed the SSU to install but when chekcing the eventlog i get the event telling me that the update was installed successfully Is it possible to get an USOclient StartScan and StartDownload button This would probably prevent me from needing to restart the server more than actually required Im not able to Audit any servers i add in Get below error on everyone servername ERROR ERROR ERROR Exception calling CreateInstance with arguments Creating an instance of the COM component with CLSID CB D F EEE DA C F FE from the IClassFactory failed due to the following error ba The RPC server is unavailable Exception from HRESULT x BA Another

our servers but we found the issues when setting concurrent sessions as and running the script to install script is showing patches installed and status as completed But when we check on random destination servers the patches are not installed when we try to capture the installed patches report its failed the csv files generated doesnt contains patch installation status Can you please help I

Access is denied Exception from HRESULT x EACCESSDENIED Im running PoshPAIG script as domain admin I tried to audit patches on workstations with UAC enabled and with UAC disabled both gives same error result When I attempted to audit patches by running PoshPAIG directly on workstation with Windows error message was different WARNING Exception from HRESULT x PoshPAIG randomly started giving inaccurate audit results It will detect that there are for example updates and it installs those updates just fine but says only has installed After reboot it says there are no more updates but I will go on the machine and there will be installed but pending reboot Giving this tool a trial run on some servers I received error x EE Running getitem HKLM SOFTWARE Policies Microsoft Windows WindowsUpdate on the affected servers I found the WUServer and WUStatusServer were pointing to the wrong machine It would be good to add functionality to GetSet this value for selected servers Would it be possible that once the updates have installed it automatically checks to see if a reboot is required Currently from ive seen it installs updates and says completed but in actual fact they arent really completed unless the reboot is performed and for that to be seen you have to run another check It would be handy that if updates are installed it then checks for reboot if not reboot needed it marks as completed if reboot is needed it marks as pending reboot Hi Guys Any way to have this remove the vbs file form the C on the target machine Shaun the Install Patches function is not working When selected it returns back a CompletedSuccessful msg immediately But no patches are applied Also no errors are given
