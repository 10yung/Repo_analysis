Hi Kris I have found that when adding a multicheckbox choice to a Form class it fails to bind when there are multiple values Only plain string data parses out correctly for example I have in a Kris LaravelFormBuilder Form extension class thisaddhistory choice choices heroin Heroin alcohol Alcohol cocaine Cocaine Crack expanded true multiple true This results in a string heroinalcohol cocaine a simple json string saved to the database when all boxes are checked However any multiple selected fields do not properly binddisplay when the data from the Eloquent Model is read back into the form using the mode option To get around this problem I had to resort to pulling any multiselect items out into the form controller as an addendum using addAfter so I could hard code the selected option processing the string with jsondecode formaddAfterdrugtypes history choice choices heroin Heroin alcohol Alcohol cocaine Cocaine Crack selected jsondecodemodelhistory expanded true multiple true Should the parsing of multiselected value work automatically as well in the binding process Is there something I missed in saving the data Thanks Kris LaravelFormBuilder FormHelpermergeOptions merges options with rules option behavior incorrectly It should replace the rules entirely or just appends new rules The current strategy may cause the merged rules duplicated and has no way to replace the default rules entirely Can I create a form row with this package Anyway the following code works for me Maybe this type of field can be added in the buildin ones php php namespace App Forms Fields use

is completely disabled after the fact This would be useful to us because we reuse the forms on our show pages by disabling them The edit create and show pages all share the same partials Sometimes these disabled forms need some custom display logic only on the show page Although Travis CI works fine too since this is hosted on GitHub and since youre going to start on a V I made the guess to add GitHub Actions support to the repo Currently test PHP with releases from source prefersource and from releases preferdist since users are more likely to get assets from the latter Theres an option to add Windows and Mac OS to the matrix but itd result in jobs which seems a bit too enthusiastic Im trying to render a checkbox and its label separately using the formlabel and formwidget helper methods However the label is not rendering because of the way the checkbox template is doing its checks on the passed in booleans How should this be resolved Create a custom template If possible I would rather not Thanks in advance I am in the process of preparing a new branch for laravelformbuilder which will be specific to Laravel x moving forward We will be maintaining the current branch for issues related to Laravel but moving forward all new features will be applied to x branch If you have issues related to Laravel please continue to report them here but know that they will only be
