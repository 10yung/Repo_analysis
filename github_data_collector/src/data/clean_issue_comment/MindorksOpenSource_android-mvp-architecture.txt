for chinese developer to update the jar from aliyun repository I am Unable to login phone Nokia android version device Hi all friends Friends to better understand this framework lets do everything by example Examples help us to master this framework more effectively Examples can be as follows such as forms lists and even small projects This can help a great deal Form Submit Forms Lists Lists Hi I find out therere many issues without your responses Will you still keep updating this app Thanks Internet error never occured when web service called How we can manage it with this Currently I have successfully implemented MVP architecture in my android app but When I am loading data inside my fragment the UI hangs till the loading finishes When Loading finishes and data is loaded inside fragment then only I can interact with click on different buttons This is my network api call public SingleListPostsModel getFacebookFriendsFeedString idusername String userid String facebookId String page return Rx AndroidNetworkinggetApiEndPointGETPOSTDATA addHeadersmApiHeadergetProtectedApiHeader addQueryParameteridusername idusername addQueryParameteruserid userid addQueryParameterfacebookId facebookId addQueryParameterpage page build getObjectListSinglePostsModelclass subscribeOnSchedulersio observeOnAndroidSchedulersmainThread This is my presenter implementation of the API Override public void getFacebookPostsOnlineString idusername String userid String facebookId String page getMvpViewshowLoading getCompositeDisposableaddgetDataManager getFacebookFriendsFeedidusername userid facebookId page subscribeOngetSchedulerProviderio observeOngetSchedulerProviderui subscribenew ConsumerListPostsModel Override public void acceptListPostsModel response throws Exception getMvpViewgetFacebookPostsresponse todo add data and loop to get all friends list getDataManagerupdateUserInfo responseinfogetId responseinfogetUsertoken DataManagerLoggedInModeLOGGEDINMODESERVER if isViewAttached return getMvpViewhideLoading getMvpViewopenMainActivity new ConsumerThrowable Override public void acceptThrowable throwable throws Exception if isViewAttached return getMvpViewhideLoading handle the login error here if throwable instanceof ANError ANError anError ANError throwable handleApiErroranError Please let me know where I am going wrong in making the UI more async and do you need any more details about my code The drawer shouldnt be unlocked whenever onResumed method is called Steps to reproduce Open about from Hamburger menu Press system Home button Open recent apps and choose the App The drawer is unlocked Expected should be locked hi I integrate this architecture in my code but I have found that it is not a good way to keep the reference of a activity like the following java Override public void onAttachContext context superonAttachcontext if context instanceof BaseActivity BaseActivity activity BaseActivity context mActivity activity activityonFragmentAttached Because the reference may be finished destroyed which is not valid for use In fact I have to check whether the activity is valid all the time which I really feel bothered Can we find a better way Thank you very much The fact that a major part of your database package is full of Helpers and Utils feels wrong to me I get that this works for a small scale project as here but as and when this grows the helper nomenclature kills all OO patterns I do not however have a better solution as yet Thoughts
