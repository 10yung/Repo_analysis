wallabag I use demo free hosting Steps to reproducetest case Just add any web pages after that open this page call left side menu and hit print You will have only fisrt page on printer I see that this issue was reported before here and here with no solution so far But could it be done that instead of nothing Wallabag saved the corresponding videos URL For example Ive saved this article Wallabag saved all the text and images but not a single video and in the place where the videos should be theres an indication of its duration for the first video for the second etc Looking at the pages code I see that the first video has this URL Well couldnt that URL be in the Wallabag copy instead of the duration data so at least the reader could click on it and see the video even if not embedded BTW Wallabag formats the descriptive text below the videos like a tittle section when in fact the original format has a smaller font than regular text Thats not very important but rather distracting and without much sense when one reads the article Wallabag can export to various formats like PDF EPub and others Could be added a new option to export in markdown format For taking notes and create brief documents MD is usually preferred than ODT and HTML Its a light format there are a ton of apps compatible with it and you can edit them in anything that can edit plain text I have tried to deploy the container on a synology NAS for couple of hours Finally got it going but I had to deploy it with root and no user ID or group ID parameters at all I also get a few other problems I SSH in to my

wallabagwallabag The MariaDB is the linuxserver container I realise after reading some that I did not actually specify utf mb in that container in any way That environment variable was not defined in there wiki and Im kinda noob I just follow tutorials Should I do something there In my haproxy reverse proxy config I have bunch of configs which all work great On several other containers This one I just pointed to the http port of wallabag and thats it I seem to reach the site and logincreate account and API etc However the viewing experience in the wallabag http gui is awful Sometimes fonts just double up on eachother If I delete a article I get error Not Found Wallabag CoreBundle Entity Entry object not found Some articles dont fetch at all I tried the fdroid app on my android and that seemed to work fine But on my firefox on linuxdesktop with wallabagger addon I get these unfetchable entries in wallabag I didnt find any log or anything at all in the docker folder Maybe I didnt mount it Couldnt find anything about how to mount log directory in the wiki But in my synology docker log for the container I see bunch of these error FastCGI sent in stderr PHP message PHP Warning

upstream fastcgi host wallabagdomaincom referrer Just spamming it in the logs Could anyone please help a noob like me understand whats wrong Thanks Environment wallabag version How did you install wallabag Via git clone php version OS debian type of hosting dedicated which storage system you choose at install MariaDB Steps to reproducetest case When I export unread articles to an epub file If the export includes all unread articles it works perfectly If I filter the unread articles first the export fails with this message Internal Server Error Type error Too few arguments to function Wallabag CoreBundle Repository EntryRepositorygetBuilderForSearchByUser passed in wallabag srcWallabagCoreBundleControllerExportControllerphp on line and exactly expected I send the exported file to my ereader as such I like to limit it to the articles that I intend to read with that device Maybe this is a fringe usage but it certainly makes the export function more useful as unread articles can build up quite quickly and arent always first priority Thank you to everyone at wallabag for a very useful application Issue details If a tag contains special characters for example then the tag is not searchable If the tag is added from wallabagger firefox it gets encoded to amp Adding the tag when viewing the entry in wallabag doesnt encode the character Environment wallabag version or git revision that exhibits the issue wallabagger firefox extension How did you install wallabag from wallabag docker OS Debian which storage system you choose at install SQLite MySQLMariaDB or PostgreSQL MySQL No source code issue but your download link does not seem to work anymore wget tar xvf latestv package Ive tested also wget nocheckcertificate tar xvf latestv package result Issue details I just did a fresh install of wallabag on an raspberry pi B Everything goes well with the installation until we access the database for reset then it gets stuck In raspbian buster for pc raspi VM w VirtualBox this error doesnt appear and all goes well Not sure if its a problem with wallabag or with mariaDB since doing a DATABASE DROP wallabag after the failed install takes also seconds or so which seems too much and probably indicates something wrong with it Docker wallabag works fine in the same raspi Environment wallabag version How did you install wallabag Via git clone then make install php version OS raspbian buster hardware raspi B which storage system you choose at install SQLite MySQLMariaDB or PostgreSQL MariaDB Steps to reproducetest case git clone make install All goes well except that the installation gets stuck at this point OK Success Your system can run wallabag properly Step of Setting up database It appears that your database already exists Would you like to

stuck the same way Hey I got an error while fetching a Google Docs link When trying with the FiveFilters test page it seems to work fine When trying with f me or Wallabag it results in a heres the relevant portion of the log with f me Trying using method get on url Use default useragent Mozilla Windows NT WOW AppleWebKit KHTML like Gecko Chrome Safari for url Use default referer for url Trying using method get on url Request throw exception with a response Not Found So for some reason it tries to fetch instead of the actual URL However I cant find a siteconfig which would cause that to happen and doing a similar request with curl produces the correct HTML without something like a redirect curl useragent Mozilla Windows NT WOW AppleWebKit KHTML like Gecko Chrome Safari referer grep o UNLWS glyphs So Im really wondering where that URL is coming from or how I could further debug it thanks for any pointers Note Ive read the issue template but deleted it because Im not hosting Wallabag myself and I dont think the Wallabag details are relevant also not sure if this is the right place or if this should rather be in the f me repo cc j k r
