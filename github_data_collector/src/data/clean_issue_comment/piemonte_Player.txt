Currently if I set up Player like swift let player Player playerplaybackLoops true And then set the local URL play on it Im getting it played only once I checked what PlayerPlaybackDelegate reports and it reports a couple of playerCurrentTimeDidChanges and then playerPlaybackDidEnd Do we have a regression It was and still works fine in I would like to be able to play an array of videos Currently Player only supports playing AVPlayerItem at a time Id like loop through the array of videos and play them in order The videos are in m ua Is anyone already working on this If not Ill make a PR piemonte I have a stories like feed going on and for memory purposes once a story is advanced I clean up the player in the previous VC by setting playerplayerViewplayerLayerplayer nil which works But most important to free up memory I found is to playerLayerremoveFromSuperlayer This works fine if I use my own AVPlayer AVPlayerLayer instance but removing it from playerplayerViewlayer as AVPlayerLayerremoveFromSuperlayer produces a crash Why is that startupTime Stream startup time measured in seconds totalDurationWatched Total time spent playing obtained from the AccessLog timeWeightIBR Time weighted value of the variant indicated bitrate stallRate Stall rate measured in stalls per hour stallWaitRatio Stall time measured as durationstalled durationwatched Hi I wanted to video continues to play in background when the user presses the home button and i tried this but it didnt work Any idea Thank you We are using Player to play video inside a collectionview with cells that are full screen Is there an example on how to properly use Player inside a reusable cell It is better if with H hardware accelerator VideoToolBox function Hi I just started using this component in my tvOS app and cannot find how to display the controls like AVPlayer one and use the AppleTV remote Thanks Arthur
