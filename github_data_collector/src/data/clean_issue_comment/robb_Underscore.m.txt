nil passed to a callee that requires a nonnull st parameter Is there any plan for Carthage support Underscorem which does not support tvos Added method to zip elements passing an array of arrays that returns another array of arrays zipped This method only works if all the subarrays have the same length should i add some checks here this objc transforms into this objc warning all the arrays should have the same lenght I would like to add specs but cant make the tests run Always getting this error after pod install objc ld library not found for lPodsUnderscoreTestsExpecta clang error linker command failed with exit code use v to see invocation The documentation for find says text Returns an object from the array the passes the test It should say array that passes the test union is not in Underscorem but would be useful There are some very useful functions in underscorecontrib that are missing from underscorejs My plan is to fork Underscorem and add these methods as I need them but I wanted to check that you are open to adding functions like these first Thanks Itd be cool to have some inline documentation for both Xcode CocoaDocs beer
