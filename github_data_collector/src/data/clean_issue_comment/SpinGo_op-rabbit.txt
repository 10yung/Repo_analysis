Reference Where to add comspingooprabbitQueueModeledArgs Possible values default default lazy There is an awesome RabbiMQ plugin What do you this about addon that implements custom Exchange Binding for this one I have implemented this one on top of oprabbit in my company so it is pretty easy for me to contribute it It looks like explicit nack can be used only synchronously and the only way to use it asynchronously is by supplying it as an implicit default RecoveryStrategy for BoundConsumerDefinitionie the subscription So to consume some item asynchronously we should roughly use something like ackFuture bodyprocessresult The doc says that if the future fails then the RecoveryStrategy is appliedie the wanted nack is called But this leads to being hit which looks like thread blocking Are there any plans to improve this And a nd question Is there any other approach to use nack asynchronously besides the approach abovealso used in oprabbitcoresrctestscalacomspingooprabbitconsumerSpecscala test Hi would it be possible to release a new version The last release was th of Feb Thanks I have this project using oprabbit and Im trying to send a message directly to a queue but the queue doesnt exist yet Im using rabbitControl Messagequeuemessage queue thequeue to publish messages but I cant find a way to declare the queue and have it created automatically and use additional parameters such as ttl Is it possible to achieve that or do I have to manually create the queue with such properties I am using the RecoveryStrategylimitedRedeliver strategy I want it to send messages to the DLX i declared which is attached to a queue where failed messages are picked off I keep getting this val exx Exchange ExchangeDirecttype Exchangedirectopdead val onAbandon RecoveryStrategy nacktrue val redeliverDelay FiniteDuration seconds implicit val recoveryStrategy RecoveryStrategylimitedRedeliver retryCount exchange exx retryQueueName retry tbd onAbandon onAbandon redeliverDelay redeliverDelay I have it set up as shown above Is there something I am missing I do not want a retry queue I just want it to retry on the same queue if it fails I want it sent to the DLX rabbitmqclientShutdownSignalException channel error protocol method methodchannelclosereplycode replytextPRECONDITIONFAILED inequivalent arg xdeadletterexchange for queue tbd in vhost received none but current is the value opdead of type longstr classid methodid If I use traditional newmotion DefaultConsumerchannel handleDelivery I can read from a remote RabbitMQ but when I try using oprabbit I just cant get it to work INFO fooakkaactordefaultdispatcher akkafoouseraconnection akkafoouseraconnection connected to amqpanonymousddweathergcca INFO foooprabbitdefaultchanneldispatcher akkafoouseraconnectiona akkafoouseraconnectiona connected INFO fooakkaactordefaultdispatcher akkafoouseraconnectionconfirmedpublisherchannel akkafoouseraconnectionconfirmedpublisherchannel connected INFO fooakkaactordefaultdispatcher akkafoouseraconnectionb akkafoouseraconnectionb connected ERROR fooakkaactordefaultdispatcher akkafoouserasubscriptionqanonymousgsk Connection related error while trying to rebind a consumer to qanonymousgsk Waiting in anticipating of a new channel Caused by comrabbitmqclientShutdownSignalException channel error protocol method methodchannelclosereplycode replytextACCESSREFUSED access to exchange xpublic in vhost refused for user anonymous classid methodid These are the parameters that work fine with newmotion but not with oprabbit canada hosts ddweathergcca username anonymous password anonymous port exchange xpublic queue qanonymousgsk routingKey v postobservationsswobml requestedHeartbeat ssl true If someone can read from this RabbitMQ using oprabbit Id be very interested to know how you did it because Ive been beating myself up for days trying to get the oprabbit version to work Depends on akkarabbitmq released scopedfixtures comtimcharper ackedstreams needs a scala release I also have a temp fork of oprabbit with published jars I have to read from a RabbitMQ in Canada and publish to an internal RabbitMQ here in the US I have all the credentials Im just trying to figure out what the code would look like since typical applicationconf setups only have one RabbitMQ I have to connect to read from the one in Canada using SSL
