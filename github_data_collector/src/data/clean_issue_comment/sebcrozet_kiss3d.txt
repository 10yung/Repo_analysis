Right now kiss d only supports rendering to a single canvas element I have a use case where Id like to embed multiple instances of kiss d on the same page a blog post that goes through implementing a d simulation Ive identified a few blockers WebGLCanvas always looks for a single canvas on the page canvas This can be worked around on the JavaScript side by changing the id of the target canvas before creating the window and then changing it back afterwards WebGLContext does the same thing Now this one is more complicated to work around because kiss d only ever keeps a single context in memory One solution to this is to instantiate one WASM module per canvas the trick for supporting multiple canvases Mouse and keyboard events are relayed to all canvases because they all listen on window As a temporary fix on my fork Ive added the following check inside the event handlers rust if etarget andthentarget CanvasElementtryfromtargetok maportrue canvas canvas edatacanvas return EDIT For the last point a better solution is to add event listeners to the canvas element directly except for window resize mouse up mouse move which needs to be modified to support the pointer leaving the canvas Hello I am trying to develop a simple d first person shooter game and I need these two functions The problem I cannot use the setcursorgrab on its own because if the mouse is already on a edge of the window eg and I move the mouse left the WindowEventCursorPos will still return so i canont detect the fact that the user is trying to move the mouse left am I wrong Using setcursorposition in conjunction with setcursorgrab solves the problem as Im now able to center the mouse The Conrod TextBox Widget uses WindowEventChar for inputting characters and also depend on KeyBack being mapped to CKeyBackspace These additions make the widget work when being used with Conrod UI inside of kiss d Hello before I begin my question I want to state that this is not a feature request I want to inquire whether what I am planning to do is at all feasible When prototyping graphical applications immediate mode GUI libraries like imgui or nuklear often come in handy to me These libraries are renderer agnostics they just produce command lists that can be interpreted by any rendering system or library My question now is Is it at all possible to gain access to the internals of the OpenGL state used by this library in order for me to implement rendering of these generated command lists and therefore establish support for these GUI libraries Is this worth getting into further Cheers Is it possible to get the functionality of windowsnapimage without actually opening a window I need to render a large number of simple geometric scenes but I only need the ImageBuffers and attempting to open a bunch of windows in parallelized threads isnt possible on MacOS Ive tried windowsnapimage without windowrender and just get an empty black image If theres a way to do this that Im just missing Im sorry This is a great crate and is otherwise perfect for what Im trying to do Thank you Everything seems to compile just fine but I cannot find any binary to run in targets I tried kiss dcibuildsh kiss d cargo build In both cases compilation finished without any erros but when I go to kiss dtargetdebugexamples it is empty I cannot find anything about how to run examples in the documentation Ive written a simple program that renders a set of cubes First I tried rendering them with the FirstPerson camera then FirstPersonStereo The FirstPerson view looks mostly how Id expect monodiff However the stereo objects are strangely elongated in Y stereodiff Link to the source code This is reproducible on Mac OSX Ill try on a linux system as well I used let mut g windowaddgroup to create a SceneNode Next I added a bunch of spheres to this group using let mut obj gaddsphere Then I moved these spheres to random locations with objsetlocaltranslation Now I want to scale the entire group with respect to the origin But the only scale function in the group I see is setscale which only scales the spheres individually and doesnt affect their positions at all How do I scale the entire group with respect to the origin Any way to detect which object is under the current mouse position what about callbacks on objects to allow selection etc via mouse
