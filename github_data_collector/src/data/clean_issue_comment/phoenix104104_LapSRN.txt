hello can I train this code in CPU not GPU if I train it in CPUwhich part of code do I need to modify And how many days do I need to train thanks for your codeAs you mentioned in the paperthe training dataset is t and bsd Howeverthe dataset is t bsd g So what is the result for your paper Is is consist of General Some thing wrong when I use channel bilinear kernel Following is the upsampling results and original images qq qq My init code is followings function net addUSNnoisenet layername varname parname filtersize scale cropdefault stridedefault scale netaddLayerlayername dagnnConvTransposeupsample stridedefaultcrop cropdefaulthasBiasfalse varname varname parname f netgetParamIndexparname filters singlebilinearkernel netparamsfvalue filters netparamsflearningRate netparamsfweightDecay netparamsftrainMethod adam end Do you have any idea of this problem Thank you Thanks for your code I cant reproduce the result with my own model when training the T BSDS and General images The PSNR of Set x only but the papers PSNR of Set x is Can you provide some details about the training parameters How many epoch can be trained to achieve the effect of the paper Thank you for your answer
