Adding credits for Jon and Eddie to the readme I need to take another minute to put github links in there This is my case I installed the PostgreSQL from Homebrew and made it as a service But I dont want the service auto start when OS booting Then I modified the plist and set KeepAlive and RunAtLoad to false After that I tried to start the service with lunchy start postgres but its not working At first I thought I made some mistakes in configuration After several rounds test I figured out launchctl start homebrewmxclpostgresql was working for me Then I found lunchy use loadunload behind the startstop command IMO maybe we should follow the launchctls convention make them corresponding This a working in progress implementation goals remain posix compatibleaka work with most shellszsh and bash top priority mimic all current lunchy features integrate with homebreweasy install that said Im opening this PR as a request for comments I will work in the Easter holiday in it and I expect to have a almost compatible version next weekend mperham what do you think anyway Thanks a lot for lunchy its a time saver Im not much of a Ruby guy but I was wondering how much work it would take to port this to something that could be installed via homebrew brew install lunchy will drive adoption in places that gem install lunchy will terrify people namely not ruby devs and who remember all too well the nightmare that CPAN wrought on systems It doesnt seem that it would be too challenging overall When you lunchy start w myservice or lunchy stop w myservice the state is saved for next boots In the past days launchctel was adding a key to the plist file with the value Disabled but since SnowLeopard the plist file is not changed and it is store elsewhere As far as I know launchctl does not offer a way to know if a plist file is disabled or not for next boots and having to reboot is tedious It would be great to have some way to see which plists are disabled or not The lunchy status command seems the more appropiated place to me for showing it but since it uses the launchctl list output it would be fair enough something like lunchy disabled A link to an article that explains the new locations where the disabled keys are stored
