Hi Thank you for creating a helper to manage VMs more easily Unfortunately some older guests do not support sshd and often dont support telnetd very well either For these guests like DOS could we get a keyboard subcommand similar to Packers bootcommand for provisioning older guests by direct keyboard sequences Hello jedi ever today while exploring GitHub looking for interesting projects found yours and I would love to contribute by designing a logo for it Im a designer in development and an open source enthusiast We would be working together to create the design that fits best Of course its totally free and you can quit whenever you want In case you agree please let me know any preferences you may have about colours shapes etc you may have Kind regards An update in netssh changed the option paranoid False to verifyhostkey never This clutters the output with a lot of depreciation notice paranoid is deprecated please use verifyhostkey Supported values are exactly the same only the name of the option has changed verifyhostkey false is deprecated use never This PR uses the new variable name and value See Because archlinux changed its repo location the current md uri returns a moved permanently message Then using bodysplit on it made the iso and isomd variables be nil And then veewee choked on that Before this commit this is the actual message you get in this case bundle exec veewee vbox build w myarch Downloading vbox guest additions iso v Checking if isofile VBoxGuestAdditions iso already exists Full path veeweeisoVBoxGuestAdditions iso The isofile

message explicit Could not instantiate the box mesh with provider Virtualbox Error in the definition from file veeweedefinitionsmeshdefinitionrb Could not download from NetHTTPMovedPermanently x fe b e c Error in the definition from file veeweedefinitionsmeshdefinitionrb Could not download from NetHTTPMovedPermanently x fe b e c And the second commit switches to the correct new base uri and uses also the latest image always now The last two commits were needed to successfully have a base image As requested in I havent yet attempted to build this Im trying to build export a box for Ubuntu I have the iso and I have built a VM by hand though the graphical UI of VirtualBox several times before Im a new user of veewee but I think I understand how to use it First try These are my steps bash bundle exec veewee vbox define ubu v ubuntu desktopamd bundle exec veewee vbox build force nogui ubu v At this point the output looks normal but it times out after the Done typing message The full output is below at I execute the export anyway as bash bundle exec veewee vbox export ubu v but it waits forever bundle exec veewee vbox export ubu v Vagrant requires the box to be shutdown before it can export Sudo also needs to work for user vagrant Performing a clean shutdown now Waiting for ssh login on with user vagrant to sshd on port to work timeout sec Of course I edited the isofile in the definitionrb so it matches my iso filename Second try I was wondering why the ssh login waited forever so I executed ifconfig in my host to check if any vbox interface was present there was not So I figured maybe some network configuration was missing By looking at other VMs I already have I tried to catch their network settings into my definitionrb file So I executed again the vbox define with another definition name and then added some parameters in the definitionrb file virtualbox vmoptions pae off nic hostonly hostonlyadapter vboxnet While the vbox build was executing I saw the vbox interface in my host by I couldnt login with ssh yet using and port number The full output of the vbox build is below in Thanks in advance Full output bash bundle exec veewee vbox build ubu

veeweebinrubyexecutablehooks in main Enhancement request to maintain templates outside of the gem and it is configured by Environment variable or HOMEveeweecfg or something Have an actual separate repository for standard templates and people can add their custom templates locally PR new ones to get added Think this would make VeeWee easier to use and be able to manage issues related to core and templates separately Anyone do a template yet of Ubuntu Xenial Added new ubuntu amd and i templates Old iso files are not available any more The scan was run using ClamXav Specifically says it is
