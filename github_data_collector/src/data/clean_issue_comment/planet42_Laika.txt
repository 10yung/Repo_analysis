reopening reopening jenshalm I was wondering if there was any appetite for accepting a patch for a plaintext renderer class PlainText extends RendererFactory TextWriter The use case I have for such a renderer is to be able to use markup in the description and usage messages for options in an option parser command line parser library The plaintext rendered output would go to the terminal so I am also considering optionally having ANSI terminal codes to be used for some of the elements Since the various option help and usage messages are in Markup we can then also render the command line usage messages in HTML for displaying on a documentation site or in PDF for distribution elsewhere I was thinking of starting from the renderHTML class and the associated test class and adapt it until it produces plaintext What do folks think of this idea Hi and thank you very much for Laika I was curious whether you have considered crossbuilding Laika to JavaScript using Scalajs As I see it Laika would be great to use at the client side since it could transform the users text as they type it in the browser as opposed to sending the text to the server and back Best Matthias Is it possible to write a Document Tree Model back to reStructuredText somehow Could it even be possible to do it lossless that is recreate the exact original document from the tree model Use case would be an editor that changes a few elements programmatically but stores back reStructuredText
