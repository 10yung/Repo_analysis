I download the prototxt and caffeModel from google drive but cant load in in my matlab matlab will crash when I run the following code def fullfilemodelsmobileidgalleryprototxt net fullfilemodelsmobileidcaffemodel convNet caffeNetdefnettest matlab crash at this line for examplesub mean image or just divide some value Runtime on CPU Memory footprint during inference mean classification accuracy FPS frames per second is it information about caffe Hi there Could you release more about the setting of training parameters I found it difficult to reproduce the result Hi I am using torch openface for testing the performance of lfw dataset Since your model is caffe based I use loadcaffe library for torch to convert the model into torch Standard preprocessing process of caffe is resizing the scale to and substract the mean value of the image and the input channel should be BGR However I still cannot reproduce the performance of mobildid model Can you please tell me what kind of preprocessing do you perform Or any special operation Also in the paper they claim to use Euclidean distance for face verification in LFW dataset instead of SVM or Joint Bayesian but the github page claims that one has to use Joint Bayesian to get the performance Does this mean the provided model cannot get similar performance in the paper by using Euclidean distance Hello liuziwei I want to train my model use my dataset and use your pretrained model to predict so I need the trainvalprototxt solverprototxt deployprototxt files Can you commit these files
