Some applications can only use https proxy is there anything that can be done Its happened when I try to update MATLAB R b into update using this command C Program Files MATLAB R b bin win updateinstallerexe updatepack X x R b After that there are two connection error on the dispatch log but havent crashed yet C WINDOWS system dispatch start debug SOCKS server started on localhost Dispatching to addresses request bd dispatch bd error bd serverConnection Error connect EADDRNOTAVAIL at TCPConnectWrapafterConnect as oncomplete netjs end bd clientConnection request dispatch error serverConnection Error connect EADDRNOTAVAIL at TCPConnectWrapafterConnect as oncomplete netjs end clientConnection The MATLAB window that was supposed to show the update installer throwing an error Failed to load URL with error ERRSOCKSCONNECTIONFAILED After I closed the window the dispatch process crashed here is the cmd log eventsjs throw er Unhandled error event Error read ECONNRESET at TCPonStreamRead internalstreambasecommonsjs Emitted error event at at emitErrorNT internalstreamsdestroyjs at emitErrorAndCloseNT internalstreamsdestroyjs at processtickCallback internalprocessnexttickjs C WINDOWS system Here is the correct MATLAB update window Here is my system proxy settings While it is not a crucial bug because I could still successfully update without any problem by turning off my proxy but still I would like to report it here Hi Im testing dispatchproxy with Xubuntu LTS on my pc with eno and wlx interfaces I have three problem the wlx interface doing nothing and blocking the entire process Im using firefox with on proxy only http proxy Output dispatch start H p debug http HTTP server started on Dispatching to addresses request c e dispatch c e end c e clientRequest response c e request d de dispatch d de end d de clientRequest after long time error d de clientRequest Error connect ETIMEDOUT at ObjectexportserrnoException utiljs at exportsexceptionWithHostPort utiljs at TCPConnectWrapafterConnect as oncomplete netjs The wlx interface works because I use it daily the https connections are not available with single or both connections Firefox with full proxy protocols configuration Browser Secure connection failed error socks Unsupported SOCKS version Add script to build ES with babel Import module os and list network interfaces Since I see there is a new collaborator I will post this idea here Ive been using a service called Speedify recently and it seems to balance the load between my two connections depending on the bandwidth of the connections Basically my idea is instead of setting how many times you want dispatchproxy to use a connection out of the total by using dispatchproxy will update those values at runtime depending on how fast each connection is a faster connections proportional use would increase proportionally to its bandwidth the total bandwidth and slower connections proportional use would decrease This would improve the quality of the overall connection since you would use more of the fast connection and less of the smaller connection Dont hesitate to ask if I wasnt clear at some point Hello Alexandre Im a computer science student at Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden and want to make something awesome in the summer break I love this proxy tool and want to contribute Can you add me as collaborator in this project so that I can close issues and confirm merge requests Of course I will carefully test the code before doing any merges It would be great if we can collaborate together and make this project even better Feel free to tell me what you think Sincerely Roderick I am using two wireless adapters to combine their speed for torrent client I have tried everything with the limited knowledge i have and i have found no solution I am using Windows x Vuze and when Vuze starts it has a Green Ok proxy circle and then it becomes Yellow and the command prompt in which dispatch is running stops with the eventjs throw er Unhandled error event error If i try to run it again same thing happens I hope you can tell me what should i check or what i might be doing wrong Here is a screenshot I have been trying to combine two connections and even when i bind interface or ip in vuze the speed is same like its using just one connection somehow I would be very thankful if you tell me a way to combine two wifi connections for better downloading speed on a torrent client You can email me at fangproxyyahoocom for any suggestions Hi there while I was trying to connect to the Internet with dispatch Proxy I received this message from the browser No connection can be established with the Proxy Server Can you help me Tim I have multiple connections which all requires a proxyI want to combine them through dispatch and a proxy on top of dispatch so that all traffic would pass through the required proxy So I have DispatchProxy setup and working with the Socks configuration for my system as well as my browsers When I look at the debug output Im seeing ECONNRESET errors about every seconds or so Example dispatch cef connect cef clients googlecom end clientConnection end d clientConnection end b clientConnection error serverConnection Error read ECONNRESET at exportserrnoException utiljs at TCPonread netjs error d serverConnection Error read ECONNRESET at exportserrnoException utiljs at TCPonread netjs end b serverConnection request c d statspublicgrammarlyio dispatch c d connect c d statspublicgrammarlyio end c d serverConnection end c d clientConnection And then on some rare occasions I see it come out like this error f dd clientConnection Error write ECONNABORTED at exportserrnoException utiljs at SocketwriteGeneric netjs at Socketwrite netjs at doWrite streamwritablejs at writeOrBuffer streamwritablejs at SocketWritablewrite streamwritablejs at Socketwrite netjs at Socketondata streamreadablejs at emitOne eventsjs at Socketemit eventsjs It doesnt seem to matter whether Im browsing or watching YouTube or downloading The errors come at a rather consistant rate they dont seem to be affecting performance but I thought Id leave some feedback in case it would be helpfull Let me know if theres any more I can do
