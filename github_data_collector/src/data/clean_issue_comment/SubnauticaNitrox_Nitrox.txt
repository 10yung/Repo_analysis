Likely more Dictionaries are Included in everything we are serializing We should work towards switching all of them over to lists for serialization I know u can Fix this bug by copying the mono file into the SubnauticaData file but then the no menu bug appears for me and i know that u can fix that bug by downgrading the version of subnautica but when i do that the first fix of the SystemIoDirectory wont work and it wont find the file Assumption chatlog isnt loaded yet for receiving player Error log Im running instances of Subnautica at once so it looks a bit weird INFO Trying

subnautica with nitrox with my friend for a while now However today i changed locations and thus networks and when trying to play today when i try to join my server it says launching game in the upper left hand corner but nothing happens If i try again it says that my name is already in use My friend is able to connect normally without issue Is there a way to fix this I host the server on my machine and we use hamachi I dont know if there is any other issue like this but when I try to start the multiplayer version of the game of Epic Game the game opens but there is no Menu I can do nothing Can someone give this issue any attention Ive tried every other fix from other issues here ive asked in discord and searched everywhere on google The log does not show any serious errors from
