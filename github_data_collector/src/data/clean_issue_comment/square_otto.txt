comsquareupottoBusthrowRuntimeExceptionBusjava at comsquareupottoBusdispatchBusjava at comsquareupottoBusdispatchQueuedEventsBusjava at comsquareupottoBuspostBusjava It would be nice if EventHandler was package public so that subclasses of Bus could override dispatch I have that change in a local fork but Id rather depend on the official library So I said buspost int and then tried to get it inside my Fragment and it havent worked Then I changed it to String and everything became fine Is it ok Good morning it is the first time I will use Otto and I wonder if you could give an example of that class should be created and where it should place the functions which will be Subscribes I understand the operation but I can not understand where they are to be the functions that are activated by the certain event which want to capture to make a sincrinizaci n between threads Thank you and I hope your help PS if I do not explained well ask and I write otherwise This website should include a notice that otto is deprecated When registeringunregistering within parent classes consumers now have the ability to point to the parent and use producersubscriber annotated methods within This uses the child class instance to reflectively trigger the parent class method Based on I just lost days and a lot of hair because of a usecase where my subscriber did not get an event I changed my bus registration from onResumeonPause which is used eg at to onStartonStop and everything works Moved the android specific code to its own project thereby making the core otto android independent This enables coreotto to be used in a cross platform project The bus can still be initialized with a ThreadEnforcerAndroidMAIN thread enforcer and injected using eg Dagger The purpose of this exercise is to support translation of code using j objc The two licences show different copyright holders and dates this can cause confusion when it comes to providing licence details The licence in the readme specifies the copyright holder to be Copyright Square Inc Copyright Google Inc Whereas the site states Copyright Square Inc I want to use otto in different activity I write some code public class
