Hi is here the ability to add arrows automatically based on identical column names Without specifying the references and primary keys I dont want to use database just tables in R Thank you I love your package In the process of playing around I made the attached function which I am finding very useful Adding it here in a pull request in case you want to incorporate or develop something along these lines Hi If I save a model in yaml with writeyaml I have no way to reload it back in an object mode I did this with the sample file I manage to load it into an object model But if I try to save the object model into a yaml file writeyaml it Doesnt work Thanks Is it possible to map out the tables and queries relationships on access databases Other than to zoom the page in would there be any way to enable buttons to zoom in and around large schemas To begin with great work I find this package very useful I would like to render a graph as a table of contents in RMarkdown where each column links to a section within the document Is there a simple way to solve this I thought of two possible solutions but havent figured out how to get it to work Modify the column title eg speed a hrefwwwexamplecomspeeda but then it says Error in label of node Master Make use of the graphviz URL attribute not sure though if its possible to specify it columnwise See example below but with the same link for all columns r requiredatamodelr x dmfromdataframescars x dmcreategraphx nodeattrs URL title dmrendergraphx Then it would refer to the section My title title in the document All suggestions are welcome just like I think that this libraryDiagrammeR graph creategraph addnnodes addedge graph rendergraphtitle The Graph Title adds a title to the graph Would it be possible to extend that functionality to dmrendergraph Especially because it seems that dmrendergraph has a property called graphname but thats only used for a mouseover effect it would make sense to export that to title no Hi I am using your code on a Azure SQL db and it worked great but seems to have somehow missed two references Take a look this is the output when I develop dm using this function sQuery dmrequerysqlserver dm sqlQuerychannel sQuery stringsAsFactors FALSE errorsTRUE The little red diamonds added by me so you can see the affected fields I have gone through and developed the dm using this query SELECT CONVERTvarchar AccessProperties as AcProp FROM AccessSystemGetFieldSchemaCache which gives me Im hiding the ID field so dont worry bout it Bizzare no What could it be I install your package using devtoolsinstallgithubbergantdatamodelr But when I call dmrendergraph I get a error telling me to install DiagrammeR Hi thanks for the package it has already been quite helpfull I have an sqlite database which Im trying to model see code below but Im having two small issues with more complex foreign keys If one column in a table is part of two or more foreign keys it gets multiplied in the graph at least in my code I solve that rather hackishly below but I wonder if there is a better way or if Im doing something wrong in the first place For composite foreign keys I get multiple parallel arrows Id rather have just one arrow I have not been able to solve that one so any tips are appreciated librarydplyr librarytibble libraryRSQLite db dbConnectSQLite dbpath inf lapplydbListTablesdb functiontb fk dbGetQuerydb paste pragma foreignkeylist tb mutatefrom ascharacterfrom dbGetQuerydb paste pragma tableinfo tb leftjoinfk by cname from mutatekey asintegerpk selectcolumn name key ref table refcol to mandatory notnull type columnordercid addcolumntabletb before bindrows dm asdatamodelinf same column referencing different tables multiplies the columns correct by changing the dm object dmcolumns dmcolumns distincttable column keepallTRUE graph dmcreategraphdm rankdir BT colattr ccolumn type dmrendergraphgraph kind regards Jesse
