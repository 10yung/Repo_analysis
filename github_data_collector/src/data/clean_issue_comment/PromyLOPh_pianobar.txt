Related issue This is a rebase of fbfc f d ec daa d onto the current master The rebase seemed pretty straightforward only a few things needed to be manually merged and it was pretty trivial to merge them but Im not familiar with the code base so it might not be entirely correct Currently it compiles and runs fine but doesnt seem to play any ads Subject of the issue Trying to run pianobar on WSL Hyper terminal Ubuntu Getting it to run but just skipping tracks with Cannot open audio device message without any sound Your environment dev Windows WSL Ubuntu ffmpeg version york config user password controlproxy controlproxy controlproxy fifo homerolleconfigpianobarctl audioquality high autostartstation eventcommand homerolleconfigpianobareventspy Steps to reproduce Install WSL Install all dependencies and pianobar followed this tutorial Configure pulseaudio for Windows and testing Expected behaviour Songs should play normally with sound without errors Actual behaviour Sound works when running paplay testwav on Terminal It just needs export PULSESERVERtcp to be run before However when running pianobar it looks like this debug on rolleOptimusmntcUsersOptimuspianobar pianobar

where volume changes are extremely delayed seconds to take effect Your environment arch ARCH x config file is userpasseventcommand catching only songstart alsalib Steps to reproduce Start pianobar adjust sound with or Expected behaviour Volume should change immediately Actual behaviour Volume takes several seconds to begin adjusting and then slowly fades to the correct volume Additional notes Adjusting volume with alsamixer is instantaneous pianobar git as of now When a Quickmix song is playing and the user switches to the station this song is from a new playlist is fetched and the current song interrupted pianobar should still fetch the playlist but keep playing the current song as it already is from the intended station Thanks Love the app Been coding a mod to it but run into a problem when exitingrestarting and Pandora flagging my account with Multiple Streams Pandora is counting the successive calls to login when restarting PB and flags the account thinking its multiple users I have to wait a bit for them to age out the error before working again Is there a logout routine with Pandora to avoid this Upon launching pianobar I receive the following message pixxxxxx pianobar Login Ok Get stations Error Internal error pixxxxx This error occurs on three different Raspberry Pis One running Jessie B and two running Stretch one a B and one a B Running standard pianobar from aptget Was working for over a year Started receiving the error message a week ago Sunday Started working again this past Saturday two days ago Started receiving this error again today Standard config with changes for username and password only Web Pandora works fine Any ideas what would cause this error message Cannot open audio device I was able to get pianobar to compile in the Termux app on a Chromebook However when I try to run the app I get console errors that say bash Cannot open audio device Pulseaudio is running There is a Termux package called playaudio It will play a sample MP file from the Termux command line Your environment version of pianobar dev your Linux distribution and release version output of termuxinfo command bash bash termuxinfo Updatable packages

T C T ffmpeglibav version and the flags it was compiled with if you compiled yourself ffmpeg v installed via pkg app in Termux your config file barebones config with user and password Steps to reproduce Getting pianobar to compile in the Termux environment was tricky and I didnt document it so this is my best guess LMK if I missed anything install packages Use the pkg install command to install clang ffmpegdev jsoncdev libcurldev libgcryptdev libpulseaudiodev make pkgconfig pulseaudio install libao There is no libao package available so I had to build it from source download the source curl o libao targz tar vxzf libao targz cd libao configure prefixPREFIX make make install edit Makefile On line of the Make file change the else block to return this CCgcc stdc make pianobar I had to use make bc gmake isnt listed as a package in Termux make clean make start pulseaudio pulseaudio run pianobar pianobar Expected behaviour It should play audio after getting station and song Actual behaviour It gives the error message and skips to the next track bash Cannot open audio device Is it possible to support playlists And maybe create a station from a playlist after it ends
