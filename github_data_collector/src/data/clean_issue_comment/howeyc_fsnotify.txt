While reading file from a network drive we are getting below error short read in readEvents on what changes needs to be done on networkDrive permission to get rid of this issue it is working fine with windows inbuild drive ie C D My Code is as follows package main import fmt log os time githubcomhoweycfsnotify func main fmtPrintlnhello world watcher err fsnotifyNewWatcher if err nil logFatalerr go

Continuous Higher Standards I found out that I can not add watch so I modified it to public can be merge watcher err fsnotifyNewWatcher watcherAddWatchtmpmydir flags Hi What are the build instructions to build fsnotify Also trying to add s x supportbut cant find any build file to build the code Hi I was referring to the below example to get used to this module as I need to watch a repo file and based on events I need to perform certain actions Issue For testing I am watching one file homeankitdeltatxt The problem is that I receive events only first time if any modification is done to the file homeankitdeltatxt but after that I never receive any events even If I accessremovemodify this file Output of my implementation event homeankitdeltatxt RENAME event homeankitdeltatxt MODIFYATTRIB

watcherWatchhomeankitdeltatxt if err nil logFatalerr Hang so program doesnt exit done do stuff watcherClose Hi What I encounter is the watcher can detect event in a directory when files are copied written deleted or edited one by one in the folder But when when I tried to paste multiple files all together in one command into the folder The watcher is most likely to only detect one file and ignore the rest of the other files that was copied to the folder Any solution to this issue Will greatly appreciate your help Thanks OSwindow folder create D test CREATE rename event D test RENAME

than are allowed Would you accept a patch that uses a single inotify instance and multiple watchers This appears to be the approach recommended by the Linux kernel docs Hi go version go linuxamd I runed containers with application source code in volume with daemon which listen changes of files in volumes volumesfrom appcontainer in volumes folder mounted by NFS your library can see when i change files inside container but when i change it from outside no notifications I found out in that this problem with NFS is known but It is unclear how important that case is Suggest me please Must
