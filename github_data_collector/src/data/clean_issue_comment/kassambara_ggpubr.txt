Hi Is there any possibility to define the cut limits for the balloons in the legend For example in the first figure the balloon cuts are c but could these be c

I am using ggline to draw some plotsCan someone please tell me how can I increase the thickness of the shapes in legend and in my plot This is done usually through geompointstroke in ggplot but in ggpubr this doesnt work Hello everyone This is a minor problem but I wanted to check if there is any fix I am generating two plots in a lettersize PDF landscape but I want them to be closer to a square size If I dont change the margins in the ggplot code I end up with plots too tall occupying the entire page However if I add a margin the ggarrange add the label at the top of the page and not close to the graph Is there anyway to solve this This is my code pdffilehistpvaluespdf paperspecial width height useDingbats FALSE plot ggplotreseb aesxpord themeplotmargin margin cm

histpvaluespdf Best Luiz We are very happy to have found ggpubr we find it very useful Ive encountered two apparent bugs however both having to do with the label option I am very new to GitHub and fairly new to R I already found that what I had reported earlier as a bug was just that I didn t have the latest version of ggplot But what I report here is seen on multiple Windows and Mac machines under R with ggpubr as the only package installed so I am confident about the bugs Sekhar Ramakrishnan When I use color option to display bars of subgroups the labels are displayed in reverse order within each level of the primary grouping variable val c grp cAAAABBBB grp cXXYYXXYY df dataframeval grp grp ggbarplotdf xgrp yval colorgrp addmeansdlabelcAX AY BX BY position positiondodge If I use labelTRUE the labels are correct the right mean is displayed on each bar There is likely a bug in the way label is handled when labels are provided instead of settling for the means This appears serious since wrong labels on the bars can lead to misinterpretations I stumbled on the bug while trying to display statistical significances The second less serious bug is that the labels on the negative bars are not on top but inside at the bottom of the boxes even with labelTRUE Both problems go away if I create a new group grp with four levels val c grp cAXAXAYAYBXBXBYBY df dataframeval grp ggbarplotdf xgrp yval addmeansdlabelcAXminus AYplus BXminus BYplus I believe the negativebarlabelpositioning bug has something to do with positionpositiondodge If I add that optional argument which should have no effect when there are no subgroups the negative bars labels go to the inside bottoms ggbarplotdf xgrp yval addmeansdlabelcAXminus AYplus BXminus BYplus position positiondodge I hope this report helps Dr Kassambara fix this problem with labeling bars in a twogroup situation As I mention above ggpubr is a very valuable resource Here is my data LINK Here is a sample of what I

facetwrap and even the size option which is documented does not seem to work Thank you in advance for your help and thanks for developing this very useful package Preface I am an rnewbie so Im not sure whether this is an issue or expected behavior and whether this is a ggpubr or ggplot issue Expected behavior Given a dataframe with column names that are nonvalid variable names ggscatter produces a plot given the appropriate x and y column names Observed behavior Despite being able to access those columns from the dataframe in the console ggscatter chokes if given a dataframe with nonvalid column names and the corresponding x and y column names MCVE Lets make two dataframes one with checknames FALSE ie with nonvalid variable name columns and one with checknames TRUE We can access columns with data from each of these frames without a problem libraryggpubr datanamesnotchecked dataframeAA BB checknames FALSE datanamesnotchecked AA datacheckednames dataframeAA BB checknames

statcormethodPearson the default is R Rpval I would like to change it so that it is in this format R rhopval Is that possible to do I like the convenience of ggarrange for combining multiple ggplot plots into a multiple plot when writing reports in R Markdown However I found some of my plots overly squashed and didnt seem to find in the documentation on how to adjust the size of the product plot Do I need to use ggexport to save it as a png file of specified dimension and then use knitrincludegraphics to insert it to my report I understand that I could set figheight and figwidth in the chunk options but that seemed to reduce the plot resolution
