anyone can you give me a steps to test the pretrained model Hello Kim Using the MATLAB MRCG proved to take a lot of RAM I can not use a bigger than Min file as an input with GB RAM system In the paper it was written that a very long sound file was used for train so how could you compute the MRCG for it Thanks Ravid Hi dear I ran your reposity but it shown some error I find there is no data under datatrainfeat directory can you help with me Thanks weizhe Thanks for the code repo Q Could you please explain the meaning of the following functions in VADutilspy Truelabel Trueframe frame rawlabel vadpost What exactly are these functions doing Really appreciate if you could reply ASAP The greater the detail you can provide the better Thanks a lot Can anyone share the noisy data General Series Combo and NOISEX Hi I am a DSP engineer and acoustician Im new in the field of machine learning and neural networks and I am learning a lot working on your code I am trying to understand the feasibility to squeeze your VAD graph architecture to be used in realtime Right now I am able to retrain the neural net modifying a few parameters mainly the frame window and overlap using the D dataset in your paper Although it looks like the best ways to improve the graph computation are To use a less complex feature extractor other than the MRCG I pretend to investigate this hypothesis later To retrain the neural net for smaller batch sizes with D In your paper your use which corresponds to several seconds of audio I ve tried to perform this training multiple times for different batch sizes and I failed so far in this quest Sometimes the accuracy of the training achieves a high value but it never generalizes for the test data I believe something is wrong on the training parameters and thats because I am contacting you for guidelines Did you ever try to train the neural net for smaller batch sizes Something should be changed on the net architecture or on the training parameters What is the recommended relative size of the audio to be tested over batch size More clearly may I test a graph trained with a large batch size with a very small audio sample My intuition is that it is not possible Thats because I would like to retrain the net with a smaller batch size so that I could perform sequential tests with an audio buffer of reasonable size lets say ms Finally do you have any recommendation for simplifying the network computational complexity without sacrificing too much in performance I appreciate your time in sharing your knowledge and experience Cheers Lucas Firstly thanks for your contribution in VAD field I have two question wether the train data of net input is the MRCG feature what is the deference of VADLSTM and VADLSTM tks Hi See you again How is everything going Could you please supply the trained modelI just want to have a test emmCould the model strip the silence Or How could I realize Thx According to my understanding when an audio file is passed to the VAD model to be analyzed the DNN as well as other models gets loaded to do the job but when a second audio file is passed to the VAD the module gets reloaded which takes up a lot of time Is there any way to load the module only once and have the module predict on many audio files Thanks Hi Kim Apologize for disturbing you for many times but I have problem understanding your normalization code I found some code in the acousticfeatexm matlab Save global normalization factor globalmean trainmean lengthaudiolist globalstd trainstd lengthaudiolist save savedir globalnormalizefactor globalmean globalstd and in every datareaderXXXpy python normparam sioloadmatselfnormdirglobalnormalizefactormat selftrainmean normparam globalmean selftrainstd normparam globalstd My questions are Is a global normalize factor for the whole dataset saved in acousticfeatexm Why dont calculate factor for every single train file and apply normalization on it If so why this factor is used also during the prediction phase because datareaderXXXpys are also used during the prediction Is this a mistake Thanks in advance Charlie Jiang
