I do realise that this library was created long ago when js didnt had classes but now it is different The require of assert is really another specific issue for using the library in electron It is recommended to have nodeIntegration turned off this means that any require will not work but if it is import thatss another story and might just work And last time I used assert was for tests or otherthings done only in dev build not in production This allows yarn licenses to properly generate attribution Adds a formatter option to the getCloseMatches function that is passed each element of the possibilities array before matching takes place It would be cool to have a way defining ignore the letter case changes Like difflibndiffbefore after caseSensitive false I am not sure if I can work this around with charjunk and linejunk stuff Is it possible to distribute this through bower
