how do the method calculate the Height by bits Could you tell me the formula Hi Omar here is my modification to support dataframe input and hence better support for facetgrid Fixes issue By removing redundant scalexcontinuous and coordcartesian arguments from the output of geomlogo It would be wonderful to be able to pass in custom xaxis labels For example if I am making a consensus sequence around a start codon we want the A of ATG to be position Currently this is challenging in ggseqlogo because geomlogo includes a scale function which is inconsistent with ggplot s separation of concerns I dont think that it is necessary as in my hands that scale argument does not change the resulting plot Could we remove scale from geomlogo and then if necessary create a scalelogo function with start position as an argument Edward Hi Ive started using ggseqlogo for these plots and its great Theres now EDLogo an alternative means of plotting sequence logos to highlight depletion as well A new sequence logo plot to highlight enrichment and depletion Kushal K Dey Dongyue Xie Matthew Stephens doi Is it possible to implement the EDLogo algorithm detailed there in ggseqlogo Thanks Edward This is a great package with a lot of flexibilities But When I tried to adjust the width of the letters the x axis moved Notice the alignment between the ticks of ggseqlogo plot and the sequence letters in following plots If I used default stackwidth which is Ive got capture Then if I set it to capture The vertical grids became a little bit narrower even though not so obvious by eyes But if I set it to capture Note the relative positions of the ticks to the sequence letters it is exactly what I want The sequences were plotted by ggplot s geomtext and the plots were arranged by gtable r libraryggplot libraryggseqlogo librarygtable librarygrid generating the plots g gtableunit npc unitc npc g gtableaddgrobg gcurvgrob g gtableaddgrobg gtable grob g gtableaddgrobg gtable grob g gtableaddgrobg glogogrob gridnewpage griddrawg If I just try to solely plot with ggseqlogo with stackwidth capture For stackwidth capture You can easily tell the different padding from the first tick to the left border Of course as a single plot it is completely OK but I expect the stackwidth shouldnt affect the tick positions so that we can better align the seqlogo to other plots By the way the motif length is actually marked in the plots the rest regions are filled with zeros Thanks
