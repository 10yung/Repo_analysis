provides the described functionality Description Description of the issue I am not sure if this can be classified as a bug or not but it was a bit annoying so I think I might put this out as an observation On my mac when I double click on the Atom title bar Atom window just vanishes You might think that it crashed or was closed for some reason When I try opening Atom again from the dock no window opens No matter how many times you try opening Atom again it opens but with no window I realise there is a faint line at the bottom left corner of the screen and I drag it and pull it to increase window size only to realise it is the Atom window that it was minimized to the extent of making it seem invisible on the screen After the window is maximised and I quit Atom next time Atom opens up maximised Versions Atom Version Additional Information Any additional information configuration or data that might be necessary to reproduce the issue Enter steps to reproduce Atom x Electron

languagehaskellscoped linter linteruidefault I unchecked Automatically download updates yet Atom still periodically updates itself and in doing so completely breaks my environment The reason why I cannot let Atom update itself is because apm does not work behind corporate proxies has been this way for years now When update happens Hydrogen stops working because it was built for an earlier version of Atom It is actually very interesting how Atom updater is able to work with the same corporate proxy but apm cant Description I have noticed unusually high CPU usage just by having the Atom Editor open I have also noticed that the Windows Antimalware Service Executable begins using an unusually high amount of CPU power when the Atom Editor is open which goes away by closing the editor Steps to Reproduce Open Atom Editor Fresh install or extensions doesnt matter Check the task manager Notice both the Atom Editor and the Windows Antimalware Service Executable using an average of CPU each It varies slightly depending on the device though Expected behavior A more normal amount of CPU usage and for it not to affect the Windows Antimalware Service Executable Actual behavior High CPU usage from both the Atom Editor and the Windows Antimalware Service Executable Reproduces how often Reproduces of the time on multiple systems I have tested Versions OS Windows I am unsure when it started I have tested and experienced this problem on and Additional Information I have tested with both a Microsoft Surface Book laptop that has an th Gen Intel Core i U with GB of RAM And an HP Pavilion desktop with an Intel Core i and GB of RAM both have the same problem with the I seeing an average of CPU usage and the I seeing an average of CPU usage I have tried both a fresh Atom Windows Install so there is no thirdparty program that could affect the CPU Because its a fresh Atom install it also cant be any plugins installed in atom The size and type of files open in editor does not appear matter Enter steps to reproduce Atom x Electron OS Pardus GNULinux Thrown From Atom Core Stack Trace Uncaught Error Cannot call function getPosition on missing remote object Error Cannot call

place for getting support Keep in mind that Atom is highly customizable in a number of ways and we strongly prefer that you consider these options before filing this issue tweak Atoms configuration styles and keybindings install a community package use the Atom API in your init script to create a package or to enhance an existing package If youre convinced that none of these options are appropriate for the feature you want please explain why thats the case by completely filling out the issue template below Also note that the Atom team has finite resources so its unlikely that well work on feature requests If were interested in a particular feature however well follow up and ask you to submit an RFC to talk about it in more detail Summary I installed atom using the apt repo and deb file Both methods did not automatically install the buildessential dependency that was needed to install packages within atom Motivation Let others have an easy way to solve similar issue Describe

path following drive id eg Z fileexampletxt is loading as Zfileexampletxt when using a network share as a mapped drive Steps to Reproduce Map a network drive on a Win Home machine for eg as Z Install atom using the official installer v Open cmdexe Move to drive z Execute Atom atom Expected behavior The file path to include the trailing slash on file path such as Z examplefile Actual behavior The file path drops the slash such as zexamplefile The file and folder contents display correctly and load CtrlS works to save existing files etc etc The problem becomes annoying when you need to amend the filepath such as rename file for example right click rename the new file path is autoloaded incorrectly which prohibits saving without amending the slash issue first Reproduces how often Constant
