 The line in question is return popcnt x This converts a bit value between and to a bit countt which has no chance whatsoever to overflow but the compiler doesnt know that As a result I get warning C return conversion from unsigned int to immerdetailhamtscountt possible loss of data I think return staticcastcounttpopcnt x should clear up this warning without changing behavior Sidenote I think Im not going to be using Immer since Im struggling with nested immutable data updates One way would be to port the API of to C but using gettersetter methods instead of properties But Ive decided to use a doublebuffered document with mutexes instead immer now generates the following warnings in Xcode and similar in Visual Studio It would be nice if these could be fixed Im writing an audio engine which needs to recompute note timings each time the list of events changes It seems like flexvectors memory layout is a rrbtree which contains a few pointersintegers and should be comparable for identity equality not content equality Is there a constanttime way to check if a immerflexvector shares the same identity as another one theyre copies of each other or another object Im using this in order to invalidaterecompute a program cache vecbegin define private public and vecimplroot What about other container types specifically immerarray flexvector has a insert method for inserting into the middle which Im using in my inprogress code flexvectortransient does not Is this intentional The website claims defaultheappolicy might become the default in the future But defaultheappolicy claims defaultheappolicy freelistheappolicycppheap and already uses freelistheappolicy as default Does the website need to be updated For a music editing program Im storing a series of timestamped events note data in an Immer container I would like to use the timestamps as keys in a sorted map but Immer lacks sorted maps Im trying to emulate it using a wrapper around a sorted vector of structtime event usually under events so copying isnt awful but having to reimplement all operations is extra work Should I just stuff an immerboxstdmap or something in an Immer container For instance when modifying a struct wrapped with immerbox it may be simpler to obtain a mutable instance of the struct rather than wrapping all mutations inside an immerboxupdate Is this possible to do without sacrificing performance Greetings immer developers and contributors We re reaching out because your project is an important part of the open source ecosystem and we d like to invite you to integrate with our fuzzing service OSSFuzz OSSFuzz is a free fuzzing infrastructure you can use to identify security vulnerabilities and stability bugs in your project OSSFuzz will Continuously run at scale all the fuzzers you write Alert you when it finds issues Automatically close issues after they ve been fixed by a commit Many widely used open source projects like OpenSSL FFmpeg LibreOffice and ImageMagick are fuzzing via OSSFuzz which helps them find and remediate critical issues Even though typical integrations can be done in LoC we have a reward program in place which aims to recognize folks who are not just contributing to open source but are also working hard to make it more secure We want to stress that anyone who meets the eligibility criteria and integrates a project with OSSFuzz is eligible for a reward If youre not interested in integrating with OSSFuzz it would be helpful for us to understand why lack of interest lack of time or something else so we can better support projects like yours in the future If we ve missed your question in our FAQ feel free to reply or reach out to us at ossfuzzoutreachgooglegroupscom Thanks Tommy OSSFuzz Team According to the README However running this command results in the following error installing immergit fatal nixstoreilk xjlhjrma zc zi yf malnsyvvmastertargz does not appear to be a git repository fatal Could not read from remote repository Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists error program git failed with exit code use showtrace to show detailed location information Indeed when you fetch tarballs from and unpack them the resulting folder is not a git repository One solution if you wish to install with Nix is to clone the repo and install via the defaultnix expression bash git clone cd immer nixenv if defaultnix
