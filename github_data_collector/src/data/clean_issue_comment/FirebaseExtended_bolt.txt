repo from the Security Alerts page details With the following rules bolt objectAccessobjectId rootobjectaccess objectId authuid path shareduserIdobjectId is Obj create objectAccessobjectId owner thissharingacceptedbyreceiver false And database looking like json objectaccess obj user owner user read There are pitfalls I have encountered so far unsharing scenario writing shareduser obj null objectaccessobj user null triggers create even though that node is not being created subsequently failing on sharingacceptedbyreceiver false deleting scenario writing shareduser obj null objectaccessobj null triggers create even though that node is not being created subsequently failing on objectAccess owner Is this expected behavior Id expect in this case to skip all of CRUD alltogether and allow the write I understand that this may allow certain probing of the database by malicious users to find null values but its still counterintuitive and should likely be documented I recently switched to using firebasebolt Ive been trying to do something like rootchildcollectionchilddochasChildsomeKey When trying to compile this it complains that the hasChild function is undefined I tried going around it with rootchildcollectionchilddocchildsomeKeyexists And I got the same complaint about exist I found a work around with null but it would be nice if we could have those two functions out of the box type InitialTimestamp extends Number validate initialnow initialinit priorthis null this init this priorthis compiles to validate newDataisNumber this null this now this this Would be nice if this just threw an error at compile time Existing method type UserName extends String write rootusers this null validate thislength thistest w Proposed method type UserName extends String write path usersthis null validate thislength thistest w type InitialTimestamp extends Number validate initialthis now Returns true if the value is intialized to init or retains its prior value otherwise initialvalue init value priorvalue null init priorvalue can be type InitialTimestamp extends Number validate priorvalue null this now this priorthis We are allowed to use validate read write create update delete but not index within type definitions It would be nice to be able to specify the index at the type level and have that index apply anywhere it is used Another reason is to tightly couple indexing to the type schema As long as I mainly use optional types to be able to update individual properties instead of passing whole object I want to create an optional type so instead of writing javascript type User id String Null active Boolean Null I can do smth like javascript type User id Str active Bool type Str extends Null validate thisisString When doing so following is generated javascript id validate false In addition would be nice to have ability to implement something like OT ie OString OBoolean I just tried bolt for the first time today and its amazing Its sad to see that it isnt getting much development This should really replace the default Realtime Database rules It would be an incredible way to refresh an already great product Someone mentioned security problems with Firebase RTDB rules in another issue and I can personally agree My RTDB had minimal security built in because it is impossible to maintain With Bolt my security and consistency is times better with a huge improvement in maintainability There IS NO COMPARISON between Bolt and RTDB JSON rules I should also note that I have never touched Typescript which seems to have some similarities to Bolt and it was easy enough to jump in Id like to see someone release a basic Intellisenselintauto format package for VSC as well as setup RTDB rules in console to accept bolt right out of the box as well as get a seal of approval for being production ready I dont care what app youre building there is ALWAYS a use for RTDB and Bolt makes it that much better Currently it is not allowed to have both wildcard properties and fields Therefore it is not possible to define types that allow properties other than the ones defined in the type statement Only workaround is to not use type statements and manually define the validate rules which is very cumbersome See also issues and This pull request allows a single wildcard property inside a type definition and when present disables the generation of the default validation rule that does not allow any field other than the ones defined
