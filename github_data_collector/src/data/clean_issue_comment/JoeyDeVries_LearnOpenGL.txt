Hello I learned a lot through your tutorial but I want to continue to learn more can you continue to update the tutorial I hope there is a skeleton animation tutorial thank you Ive been following your tutorials on loading models with assimp and project cant load textures on the provided model also on my models with edited path in mtl file Project gives me a following error Texture failed to load at path without no path displayed Same thing happened in your git project when Ive compiled it Is that an issue or maybe I should write some additional code for path on Linux currently using Kubuntu Thanks for your tutorials but I found the link below show the page you requested does not exist in the database Do you have any plans to write the CSM tutorial Cant compile on Linux undefined reference to gladLoadGLLoader In order for me to be able to run the demos I had to add a link to libIrrXMLdylib within the lib directory After installing assimp via Homebrew I linked the library like so cd LearnOpenGL ln s usrlocalliblibIrrXMLdylib lib Otherwise I would get the following error for all demos gettingstarted hellowindow dyld Library not loaded rpathlibIrrXMLdylib Referenced from usrlocaloptassimpliblibassimp dylib Reason image not found abort gettingstarted hellowindow Hello I am using VS I generated the libsheaders for my specific platform Then referenced them in CMake so the project would target them that didnt work and I had to replace the default libsheaders which came with the repo and generate a default config The problem is that when opening some of the projects such as gettingstarted texturescombined some of the source code cannot reference the correct directory a key example is the following texturescombinedcpp Shader ourShader texturevs texturefs tries to build the shader program by passing two shader files relative to the source directory src gettingstarted texturescombined texturescombinedcpp src gettingstarted texturescombined texturevs however the header which executes ourShader is in a different directory includes learnopengl shaderh it is trying to find the vsfs files in this directory but they are in the source directory does this mean the project is misconfigured or have I made a mistake Apparently because it is hosted on Digital Ocean which IPs are massblocked by law in Russia Im going to run it on Android But I dont know how to modify the cakes Compiling the current file as it is will result in the following error Error configuring CMake server C Users bit AppData Local Android Sdk cmake bin CMake Error at glfwCMakeListstxt findpackage By not providing FindGLMcmake in CMAKEMODULEPATH this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by GLM but CMake did not find one Could not find a package configuration file provided by GLM with any of the following names GLMConfigcmake glmconfigcmake Add the installation prefix of GLM to CMAKEPREFIXPATH or set GLMDIR to a directory containing one of the above files If GLM provides a separate development package or SDK be sure it has been installed In addition if your Android NDK has a main CMakeFile I wonder if you need to modify the CMakeFile in this file hello Thanks for your tutorialsbut when I use the first examplegladLoadGLLoader fails and return I use vs opengl Hi all I try to render the depth buffer following the shadow mapping depth tutorial and source code and here is my code with some modifications based on the original code However the result looks like this the depth map seems work but it only shows up on half of the screen Does anyone have an idea how to solve it I am running on macOS High Sierra and thanks in advance
