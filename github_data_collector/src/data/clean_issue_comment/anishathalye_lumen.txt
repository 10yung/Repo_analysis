I got this suggestion via email Im writing down a summary here for reference It would be interesting if we could darken specific apps or even windows using a semitransparent dark overlay The result might be less contrast between dark and light windows It also wont suffer from the delays of changing monitor brightness There is a disadvantage Lumen might save some power by allowing you to use a lower brightness when using apps with a light background while using apps by overlay might make you keep your LCD brightness higher Darkening via overlay seems like something technically feasible in macOS Some related things app that dims background drawing on screen making a drawing follow windows semitransparent overlay to reduce brightness I really love the idea of the app and started using it but since it takes of my CPU when using it Id like to deactivate it during day time and activate it again automatically in the evening Can you add the ability to set a schedule for it Thank you Lumen does not adjust in real time often blinding me when changing to a bright screen for half a second Then when I switch to a dark screen it takes the same time to see it Please add a setting to adjust refresh rate Itd be great to have the option to disable lumen for a limited period of time An example of this is the application flux which can be disabled for an hour until sunrise this could just be until some specific point in time or for the life of the current app The main reason why this would be useful is sometimes you do not want to autoadjusting of the brightness to occur such as when you are watching a video While lumen can be disabled during these times I often forget to reenable it It would be really interesting to have an option to invert colors based on overall background similar to Tranquility app screen with many bright colors should be inverted eg browser windows and screen with dark predominant dark colors eg terminal should stay dark on the line of but still a different issue I am getting headaches watching videos or just scrolling web pages When I switch between the browser white pages and my terminal black background I expect the brightness transition but when I just scroll or even dont do anything video playing I expect the transition to happen over a longer period of time if any actually My suggestion would be to detect clicks only mainleft button and keypresses ignore dead keys and only then treat the transitioning as normal Otherwise treat the transitioning as slowed down When Lumen is deactivated then gray out the menu bar icon It looks very out of place compared to all other application icons img width altscreen shot at pm src Yesterday I used it for a while and idea is really good but faster brightness changes gives me a headache Brightness changes could be more slower or transition time could be adjustable by some settings According to this comment on HN it seems that Lumen doesnt currently work properly with external monitors multiple monitors
