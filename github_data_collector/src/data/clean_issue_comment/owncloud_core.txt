Unit tests added Acceptance tests added Documentation ticket raised link Changelog item see TEMPLATE Contexts and traits in acceptance tests Currently we have Several traits such as Provisioning Webdav etc These contains steps which are used in almost all of the tests suites These are available through the featureContext in tests The featureContext uses BasicStructure which in turn uses all other traits such as Provisioning Webdav etc So Basic Structure is just a unnecessary interface in between which we can remove To improve the contexts and traits in acceptance tests we need to do Get Rid of BasicStructure Refactor all traits into contexts except Provisioning Webdav and Sharing as these are the essential features of owncloud and traits such as Logging and Ip specific features only used by some tests Fix behatyml in core and all other apps to use newly created contexts related issue x rollback html and css structure changes from that broke compatibility with advanced share attributes that get registered by apps example and x make sure expiration code works as expected x adjust required unit and acceptance tests ezgif comvideotogif Hi ran the updater today going from to
