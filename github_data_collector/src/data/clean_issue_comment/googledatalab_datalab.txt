assuming that it will be resolved No GCP issues now and it is still very slow the machine is vCPUs Any advice on how to make it work Thanks Eila I am getting the following error W GPG error testing

suggestion you tell me which one it is I want to connect to datalab using my vscode editor which now has excellent support for notebooks The vscode way to do this hash steps Run the notebook on the remote datalab kernel this works fine I can execute the code on the remote kernel which makes sense since datalab is based on jupyter Connect to the remote file system via ssh to be able to save the notebook on the remote workspace this doesnt work since the host OS of datalab is missing some of the requirements Whats the best way to go around this Hello When using datalab connect command i get the following message Error Unauthorized which does not have access to Cloud Shell When connecting with ssh i get the following message Connection Failed You cannot connect to the VM instance because of an unexpected error Wait a few moments and then try again I tried creating a new machine and received the same message Any advice Many thanks Eila The datalab beta creategpu command is broken The reason for this is that Since root is read only configuring docker for use with gcr as root will fail The cosgpuinstaller container requires a more recent version of the NVidia drivers Everything works fine after changing the following Updating the nvidia drivers to be compatible with the cosgpuinstaller docker image Using version which is the same as her Changing the home directory for the cosgpuinstallerservice to one that is writeable No longer running dockercredentialgcr configuredocker before the waitforstartupscriptservice I have created some custom datalab docker image to install python libraries we use often The Dockerfile is shown below The libraries however do not seem to be available on Jupyter after creating datalab instances using this image since Jupyter uses different python binaries from some specific environments bash which python usrlocalenvspy envbinpython which python usrlocalenvspy envbinpython What would be the correct way to install python libraries in a custom docker image or how can I prescribe the python binary I want to use with datalab please Thanks Dockerfile FROM gcrioclouddatalabdatalablatest COPY requirementstxt tmp RUN echo Adding missing
