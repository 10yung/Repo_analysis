My understanding is that you do not want to explicitly support Objc However I realized that a few methods are able to be bridged successfully but are not necessarily automatic Would you consider at least marking this method Objc compatible Unowned self references cause a crash when trying to perform an animation whileafter the checkbox is being deallocated Changing them to weak self references fixes this adding m check box delegate for check and uncheck I try to make these single selection but I cant find any way to do that Is there any way or its not allow us to make it Xcode fails with the following error The package dependency graph can not be resolved unable find any available tag for the following requirements Have a lot error related to NSString class PodsM CheckboxSourcesM CheckboxAnimationGeneratorswift Type String has no member easeIn PodsM CheckboxSourcesM CheckboxAnimationGeneratorswift Type String has no member easeOut PodsM CheckboxSourcesManagersM CheckboxBounceControllerswift Type String has no member round did you mean count PodsM CheckboxSourcesM CheckboxAnimationGeneratorswift Type CAMediaTimingFillMode aka NSString has no member forwards Is it possible to make these properties visibles in objc replacing open var uncheckedValue Any with objc open var uncheckedValue Any Thank you in advance change unowned references to weak results in crashes in some instances Can we set the color when isEnabled is false Id like to show the checkbox greyed out when its disabled
