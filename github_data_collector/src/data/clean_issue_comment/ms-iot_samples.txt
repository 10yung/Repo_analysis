based on with some merging thanks eGdev Hi Im working with a Raspberry Pi and Windows IoT Core v and USB Aeon Labs ZStick Gen attacched to RPi The ZWave Provider works great with all ZWave devices until I reboot RPi after which I do not receive any signal from sleeper device until they send the message WAKEUPNOTIFICATION but this could happen after a day So every signals sent by these devices in this period are lost I think it depends from the provider that does not save the information about the devices so when I restart it the provider must query them again to discover the implemented classes which cannot happen for the sleeping devices Examining the code I noticed that the saving of this information was explicitly deactivated at samplesAllJoynSamplesZWaveAdapterAdapterLibZWaveAdaptercpp OptionsGetAddOptionBoolSaveConfiguration false Could be this the cause Its possible to receive signals from sleepers devices after reboot Thanks Best Regards Marco You are viewing archived documentation AllJoyn is no longer supported by Windows IoT For questions please open an issue on GitHub or leave us feedback in the comments below Would you mind clarifying the above statement posted at I the latest version of IOT capable of running AllJoyn OnBoarding and Soft Access Point what are the other options available for creating a private network between a UWP IoT based device Application and a Windows WPF Application via wifi using usb wifi dongles only ultimately neither device will actually have internet capability Wifi Direct seems to do a good job between UWP applications but not between UWP and Wpf Applications Visual studio crashes when I am trying to debug AppServiceBlinky nodejs sample at a Remote Machine

Windows IoT For questions please open an issue on GitHub or leave us feedback in the comments below When this happen Any announcement were made I cant find any information about that Can you give us developers some clarification Do we have any alternatives Hi Im working with a Raspberry Pi and Windows IoT Core Ive installed OS version dowloaded from I have also a Aeon Labs DSA ZWUS ZWave ZStick Series USB Dongle attached to RPi Everything should be set up correctly to run the zwave sample as per I have IoTOnboarding and ZWaveAdapter headless app running on RPi anyway I do not see anything on

Injector I could inject the keyboard HID reports from the sample they seemed to work However when I changed the HID reports AND the HID report descriptors to emulate a radial controller nothing happened anymore The wheel tab in the settings app appeared showing that windows properly recognized the HID report descriptors but the HID events did not work Ill post code later so that it can be reproduced The HIDInjector sample cannot be built on x Line in HidInjectorKdc gives an error because sizet is bit on x and ULONG is bit Im trying to create a light sensor but i dont know how to do it working on windows iot core Is there a sample or can someone help me with a guideline
