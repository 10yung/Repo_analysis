In the typescript config I would like to have a public usage test as well similar to the one standard has I would like to extract this test into its own repo standardpublicusagetest Would that be cool feross And would it be alright if its TypeScript pretty please cat The dependency eslintpluginnode was updated from to This version is not covered by your current version range If you don t accept this pull request your project will work just like it did before However you might be missing out on a bunch of new features fixes andor performance improvements from the dependency update Publisher mysticatea License MIT Find out more about this release details summaryFAQ and helpsummary There is a collection of frequently asked questions If those don t help you can always ask the humans behind Greenkeeper details Your Greenkeeper bot palmtree Ive written up the use cases for the void operator yesvoid but in short the main use case is for making nonvaluereturning arrow functions explicit while keeping them in a single line so the novoid rule should be removed from the base config as an oversight yesvoid The dependency eslintpluginimport was updated from to This version is not covered by your current version range If you don t accept this pull request your project will work just like it did before However you might be missing out on a bunch of new features fixes andor performance improvements from the dependency update Publisher ljharb License MIT Find out more about this release details summaryFAQ and helpsummary There is a collection of frequently asked questions If those don t help you can always ask the humans behind Greenkeeper details Your Greenkeeper bot palmtree Ive updated Japanese documents to to apply changes of original documents from e to ecda No review by other Japanese speakers is required All original committ list e bc ecda no changes for Japanese document What is the purpose of this pull request put an X next to item X Documentation update Bug fix New feature Other please explain What changes did you make Give an overview Remove bundlejs from the list of of default ignored files because it is no longer ignored Which issue if any does this pull request address Is there anything youd like reviewers to focus on What version of this package are you using What problem do you want to solve Allow writing more readable code in cases when a variable is checking against a range eg javascript if x x or javascript if x x What do you think is the correct solution to this problem define more yoda precisely and allow this edge case with exceptRange option Are you willing to submit a pull request to implement this change Yes What version of this package are you using eslintconfigstandardjsx What operating system Nodejs and npm version MacOS Catalina node npm What happened Weird formatting in prettierstandard package its done more correctly What did you expect to happen Another formatting like its done in prettierstandard Are you willing to submit a pull request to fix this bug Nope I came across some conflict between prettierstandard and eslint with standard and standardjsx presets included Example const A ReactFC children divchildrendiv const B ReactFC onDelete void children divchildrendiv const MyComponent FunctionComponent const someLongMethodHandlerName obj parameter string parameter string return A B onDelete someLongMethodHandlerName parameter parameter parameter parameter B B A this is how prettierstandard formats the code but eslint with standard and standardjsx presets expects the next version diff const A ReactFC children divchildrendiv const B ReactFC onDelete void children divchildrendiv const MyComponent FunctionComponent const someLongMethodHandlerName obj parameter string parameter string return A B onDelete someLongMethodHandlerName parameter parameter parameter parameter B B A To me first variant is more correct cc sheerun Shouldnt they use the caret operator How could we claim to support a newer major version that might renameremove a rule change some rules options etc LinusU From this pr where CI is failing its not clear what is failing exactly I suggest what could help is making all the errors thrown in the test suite a little more descriptive as a start
