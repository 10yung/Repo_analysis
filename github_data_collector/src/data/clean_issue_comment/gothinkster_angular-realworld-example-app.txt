Security The properties proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter have been added to the list of properties that must be enumerable If a property by that name is found and not enumerable on its parent it will silently evaluate to undefined This is done in both the compiled template and the lookuphelper This will prevent new RemoteCodeExecution exploits that have been published recently Compatibility notes Due to the securityfixes The semantics of the templates using proto defineGetter defineSetter and lookupGetter in the respect that those expression now return undefined rather than their actual value from the proto The semantics have not changed in cases where the properties are enumerable as in js proto some string The change may be breaking in that respect but we still only increase the patchversion because the incompatible usecases are not intended undocumented and far less important than fixing RemoteCodeExecution exploits on existing systems Commits v November th

it looked like it has failed for many errors Could someone indicate the version of node yarn and the angular so to eliminate the errors Thanks Hi I guess Id start with asking if there is any special reason why importing the ionicons css in the indexhtml itself link href relstylesheet link hrefcodeionicframeworkcomionicons cssioniconsmincss relstylesheet typetextcss Should the ionicons package is added to packagejson and css path is added to styles in angularjson which is supposed to be best practice Tuan Readme modified If you want to change the API URL to a local server in the README you can see the instructions that suggests to edit srcenvironmentsenvironmentts and change apiurl to the local servers URL ie localhost api However if you do that you will get a CORS error Access to XMLHttpRequest at from origin has been blocked by CORS policy Response to preflight request doesnt pass access control check No AccessControlAllowOrigin header is present on the requested resource Maybe in the instructions will be useful to also indicate that a proxy must be configurated Create a file srcproxyconfjson with the content api target URL secure false ie URL Edit the file angularjson to include serve options proxyConfig srcproxyconfjson configurations Point to the proxy url in srcenvironmentsenvironmentts export const environment production false apiurl
