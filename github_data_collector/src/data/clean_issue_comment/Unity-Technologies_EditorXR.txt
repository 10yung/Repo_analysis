Hello I would like to know are there Valve Index knuckles controllers support are planned For consuming EditorXR it would be useful if it was addable via Unity Package Manager whether as a github feed or as an official Unity package when i use universal render pipeline i need to update materials and shaders In the EditorXR case i cant Is it possible to update the materials and shaders to use URP Thanks This shouldnt be necessary if you dont need button input but the current code assumes you have one of these interfaces From forum post Noticed that while sculpting terrain outside of VR the EditorXR is trying to open itself randomly Despite not pressing the keybind to launch it Im noticing that the window opens itself up without prompt and then crashes the entire editor SteamVR is open outside of it the Unity project launches that on its own but it just sits idle Hi I dont know exactly whats going on but Ive found that suddenly some UI elements are not selectable using the rays that are sent out from controllers The strange thing here is that it was working perfectly two days ago Also I can confirm theyre placed in UI layer The Unity version Im using is f Im thinking to update it to latest release Any idea whats happening Thanks in advance When EXR is open and you open a different scene it will prompt you to save your current scene This will save the main camera in the scene as disabled Using Unity f Import Package HoloToolkitUnity unitypackage Window Mixed Reality works fine before Importing EditorXR unitypackage causes following errors AssetsHoloToolkitSpatialMappingScriptsTapToPlacecs error CS InputManager does not contain a definition for Instance AssetsHoloToolkitSpatialMappingScriptsTapToPlacecs error CS InputManager does not contain a definition for Instance AssetsHoloToolkitUtilitiesScriptsHeadsetAdjustmentcs error CS InputManager does not contain a definition for Instance AssetsHoloToolkitUtilitiesScriptsHeadsetAdjustmentcs error CS InputManager does not contain a definition for Instance Is there a way I can fix this or will have to wait for fix Not sure what is causing this crash but when using the MegaBook asset from And Accessing the inspector with the main book asset where all the settings live unity hard locks my whole system I followed the EVR Guide V instructions and I dont see any visuals in the Oculus it remains black In the HMD I do see the chaperone wall but I dont see the controllers I do see a small white square down in the lower left of the HMD In the Unity editor I see the HMD geo tracking and I see the controllers tracking After Ive installed the EditorXR package I see the following warnings TextMesh Pro is already installed editorxr While installing the Oculus Utilities I get the following option I select Yes editorxr Install Versions Unity f TextMesh Pro b EditorXR unitypackage OculusUtilitiesunitypackage
