Zend is now officially the Laminas project and we have to redo the dependency This will be addressed in the next major release Currently we are thinking about removing Zend dependency entirely and replace it with Note you will experience BC break if you use Zend dependencies indirectly Hi This PR introduce logging capabilities for workers via RPC I know users can already logs by printing on stderr but logs always appears with a WARNING level It could be a great addition to be able to control log levels and fields This could make logs aggregations in containerised environment easier as apps could log directly on the container stdout Hello When I restart RoadRunner daemon it can not bind to the same port it was opened and returns errors like ERRO metrics bind address already in use If i check thoses ports it says tcp TIMEWAIT I googled the issues and looks like theres a issue with go lang when it does not reuse ports Tested on linux ubuntu Thank you Is thinkphp Supported How we can customize logs and change severity I mean mechanism like here First of all thanks for your software Its been a great experience working with it I moved my Symfony application to Roadrunner which improved the performance but New Relic integration does not seem to work I was wondering if anyone has successfully integrated it or you have any tips on this Thanks in advance Need a new RPC method to register metric from the application metrics must only be declared once so consecutive runs would have no effect Integrate as the source of profiling data and pass this data into rr service via RPC Store data in local db BoltDB or memory and share information about application performance via RPC or expose the port Need UI there is support for run workers in background Add Mercure or something similar But first wait until solved
