 Tooltips demos on the Plottable website dont work Maybe they havent been updated Dependabots update of webpackdevserver from to cause version mismatches due to its dependencies on later versions of webpacks with breaking changes such as separating webpackcli into a separate package This caused errors when yarn start was run after installation and build In addition in a testcase for row wrapping in chart legends the strings were no longer sufficiently long enough to cause row wrapping causing tests to fail despite legend row wrapping functioning fine I elongated the strings enough that now the test runs correctly Is Plottable actively developed I see web site examples not updated for the new version For exampleI would like to use rollup and test the following Users should be able to pull in just the parts of Plottable they care about using import statements import just the Category Axis import Category from plottablebuildsrcaxescategoryAxis Bug report Ive got a bar graph using a GuideLineLayer in a similar way to the Space Race example at I have the same fault as can be seen with the example where when I hover over the last item First Man on the Moon as the label is aligned to the left of the gridline the text cannot be displayed due to lack of room The documentation refers to xAlignment which takes the arguments left centre and rightwhich I assumed refers to the placement of the label However any change to either xAlignment or yAlignment has no effect and the label is always shown at the bottom left of the gridline regardless of these values My plan was to detect where the mouse is hovering over the graph in the onPointerMove and change the xAlignment accordingly Live example URL unable to get jsfiddle to work but this issue can be easily seen using the demo at Steps to repro Create a PlottableComponentsGuideLineLayer Set the xAlignment to centre Allow the graph to be drawn normally Expected behavior The text label of the date for the gridline should be centre to the guideline Actual behavior The text label of the date for the gridline is always bottom left regardless of what xAlignment or yAlignment is set to however calling the getter for these methods returns what I have set the value Possible Solution The text label should respect the alignment and update accordingly Context Ensuring that the date label can be seen regardless of where on the graph the mouse is currently hovering over Environment Include as many relevant details about the environment you experienced the bug in Plottable version Browser nameversion Google Chrome Version Official Build bit OS nameversion MacOS example Bug report As described in chrome has started handling events differently This is affecting for example zoom behaviour in plottable even in the examples on the page Quick fix is to set passive false when setting up the listeners Live example URL Steps to repro Install chrome Go to url Zoom and check the console output Intervention Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener due to target being treated as passive See URL Expected behavior Scroll behaviour is leaking from the component to the rest of the page The component should handle this as zoom Actual behavior The component is both zoomed and the rest of the page is scrolling Environment Plottable version Browser nameversion Chrome Version Official Build bit OS

choose which events to ignore and what not Can we generalize that a little bit more and have a general filter for all PointerEvent Context What I want to achieve I would like to disable touch interaction in certain case and it seems like one way to achieve that is through the MouseTouchFilter concept in DragInteraction Plottable version all Browser nameversion all OS nameversion all
