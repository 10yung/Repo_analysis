Jade is now Pug Link has been fixed and title has been updated Update dependencies that were screaming in npm audit and upgrade coffeescript to version fixing the little errors with super not being called Looks a bit messy but it works tested creating a new site and thus testing new preview and build CLI commands Seems alright Hope it helps I have a wintersmith blog setup for last some years Recently I found Github is displaying a security warning for marked and suggesting it to be So I did it on my packagejson on my local dev environment and tested it All seems fine to me Can we make it in the repository marked If it is necessary to submit a pull request just for this let me know Thanks Getting this below error in window Error loading plugin nodemoduleswintersmithsassify Module did not selfregister The recentish upgrade from marked to changed how markdown inside html is parsed I have html like this in my markdown files The series ul li part one basic rendering articlesreactinternalspartonebasicrenderingli li part two componentWillMount and componentDidMount articlesreactinternalsparttwocomponentWillMountandcomponentDidMountli li part three basic updating articlesreactinternalspartthreebasicupdatingli li part four setState articlesreactinternalspartfoursetStateli lipart five transactions you are hereli ul With marked it would parse the embedded markdown into html Now it leaves it as is Arguably the new behavior is more correct but this should constitute a breaking change IMO I worked around this by installing marked locally and forcing wintersmith to use it with yarn you can add resolutions to your packagejson file or with npm you need to use npmforceresolutions package I probably missed some communication but it seems updating Wintersmith from to breaks buildspreviews for existing articles For example I have an article that begins with the following sample text title An article title author Eevoo date template articlejade Hey hey hey sportsfans Im opening a Github issue in hopes of getting help Be nice to the maintainer since supporting open source software is hard and mostly thankless When I attempt to preview the site with articles like that the local server starts and runs but when I attempt to view one of the pages I get the following error errmessage error articles therealhelloworld indexhtml page articles therealhe lloworld indexhtml specifies unknown template articlejadearticles there alhelloworld indexhtml page articles therealhelloworld indexhtml spe cifies unknown template articlejade My searching the internet failed along with my spot checking of some github issues Any suggestions on changes to make to the markdown files andor wintersmith config that can make this happy Thanks for any advice you can provide wintersmith build h lists options including clean it also states all options can also be set in the config file turns out that not all options can be set for example clean is not honoured see the wording of the help text should be updated to reflect that some but not all options can be set ideally those that are clionly should have an indicator Supporting AMP imho should be a musthave for static sites these days Is it on the roadmap What do you think about AMP npm install wintersmith g issue the following warning npm WARN deprecated coffeescript CoffeeScript on NPM has moved to coffeescript no hyphen When a content file starts with a UTF BOM I dont get any metadata which can result in hardtofind bugs Were using Wintersmith to generate a docs site and we allow multiple users to add content It is very easy to unintentionally save a file with wrong BOM configuration To reproduce Create a Wintersmith site pre code C Code wintersmith new testsite initializing new wintersmith site in C Code testsite using template blog C Code testsite moment typogr underscore done preinstall lifecycle code pre Run codewintersmith previewcode and navigate to the index page and check that the readme article is present clipboard Next open codecontents articles helloworld indexmdcode using an editor that can add a BOM char at the beginning of the file In Notepad select EncodingConvert to UTF and save the file Refresh the preview and notice that the README link is missing the wintersmith s blog The root cause is that the metadata section is not detected properly since youre reading the first chars of the content looking for markdowncoffee which in this case is the BOM char The naive approach would be to use something like codestripBOMcode in but I dont know if thats enough for all cases
