Finally testing out dataspice and it is awesome I noticed that the distribution section isnt displayed in the built site however It would be nice if it did I know this package isnt under super active development but I thought Id just add the issue in case anyone has timeinterest to have a look A colleague wanted to convert their dataspice to an EML XML doc today but we couldnt figure it out without a few lines of code r json jsonlitereadjsonmydataspicejson eml emldasemldjson emldasxmleml Do we have this already in dataspice and I just missed it If not would it be reasonable and useful to have a function to do this We could include emld as a soft dependency and wrap the above code or similar in a single function All works smoothly until buildsite throwing this error buildsitepath hourdataallmetadata Error in parsecontxt bigintaschar parse error premature EOF right here Any idea how to fix It would be really great if we could produce Roxygen documentation for data from dataspice metadata Hi folks I wanted to introduce a project Im a part of including sharing some work a few members have been doing with dataspice Wed love to think about coordinating efforts with you PsychDS psychdsgithubio is an inprogress technical specification for datasets in psychology which uses Schemaorg compliant metadata We began this project as a conference hackathon this summer and since then have been hashing out the specification and simultaneously coming to learn who all else is working on related projects including Frictionless Data and now thanks to your issue DataCrate Eventually we hope PsychDS will support specific subfields to converge on more standard ways of representing particular kinds of data but have realized that getting social scientists on a shared technical footing ensuring discoverability is a big deal The project is heavily inspired by BIDS for neuroimaging data We are currently in the stage of wrapping up the draft of the written technical specification and beginning to road test it on some real datasets Beyond creating datasetlevel metadata we are attempting to enforce some basic folder organization file formattingnaming and wellstructured documentation of variables Heres a direct link to the longform specification doc At the same time some intrepid coders started working on some standalone RShiny apps designed to produce this kind of output In particular Erin Buchanan doomlab forked dataspice a while ago to try and tinker with it and has been working with undergrads to write a tutorial thats appropriate for people who havent used R before to approach a tool like dataspice Here is Erins update We took the structure of dataspice a grouping of shiny apps that one interacted with using RStudio and converted it into one Shiny app that is published to the web for anyone to use The app auto builds the CSV structured files from an uploaded dataset and then allows the user to step through entering the information for the access attributes bibliography and creators files Here we fixed a couple typos and other issues that was prohibiting dataspice from being fully functioning and added more detailed instructions The app still allows users to write spice and create a schemaorg compliant JSON file and HTML report with some CSS tweaks Erin will have more details on the structure of the version shes been working on and wed love to talk about ways to join forces or coordinate In particular would it make sense to open some issues to merge back Erins work or is there a better way to start out than that If it makes sense we can put out a call to the PsychDS mailing list to see if we have some extra hands to help Also if anyone has time to take a look wed love to know if you have any feedback on how PsychDS could work more smoothly with apps like dataspice or if you see anything we havent considered that might cause conflicts Thanks all Melissa Erin Hi I just became aware of this project which looks very promising We have been working on a similar effort to package research data with schemaorg json also with an HTML file the DataCrate spec Looks like the JSONLD were producing with various tools all of which are still in alpha is quite similar to that here Anyway I think we should look at aligning our efforts Will anyone from this project be at the Research Object meeting on October in Amsterdam I will Hey dataspicers I wrote up a set of functions helpers to convert EML to dataspice formats Id be happy to merge it into dataspice if you all think its appropriate In any case it would be great to get some feedback amoeba cboettig Irene x Create blog post on fork of ropensciroweb x Announce on Slack Fill in said blog post This comes from a good question in my dataspice demo today If user X authors a dataspice page for their dataset and another scientist Y wants to use it itd be cool if they just ran r importspice And their computer downloaded something like somedatasetzip which had the dataspicejson and the files described in accesscsv attached to it somehow Had a great question in my dataspice demo at NCEAS today that dovetailed with something we had talked about at the unconf What if we output to Rmd or md and the scientist could make use of that as they want The Rmdmd could be converted to HTML still but the intermediate format would be of greater utility to the user Also had a suggestion for converting to Word or Google Docs in some form The comment also pointed out that a lot of scientists ours include use Drive as a storage location over GitHub so being able to work with dataspice in a Google Drive workflow would be useful making HTML output less useful
