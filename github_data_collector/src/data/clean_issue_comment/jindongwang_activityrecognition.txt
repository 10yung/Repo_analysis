To the author of the paper Stratified Transfer Learning for Crossdomain Activity Recognition I come across your work in cross domain adaptation for activity recognition and find it very interesting to read I was just wondering if you have the source code also available in python or pytorch Other questions regarding the paper Does the source and target domain have the number of samples for each classes Should the source and target domain have the same amount of samples Do you update the mmdloss for each batch or the entire dataset Can you maybe also share the data with me I cant find the matlab matrix for dsadsmat Thanks for your reply Best regards Biying
