Hi I wondered why you don t have streams support I cloned the repo and thought to add it myself but found that some methods do not work for example case stream echo fullkey len redisxLenfullkey break Fatal error Uncaught Predis ClientException Command XLEN is not a registered Redis command I see composer dependence predispredis xdev and newer They abandoned the composer Now it is distributed as a compiled library Please replace the composer dependency in the project with the compiled one so that you can develop the project further working with the latest redis if there is thousands of keys in redis web frontend will load all data from backend which is slow and stupid use pagination on keys which have the same prefix actually user do not need to load all keys on the left side so only load keys that user choose phpredisadmin is difficult to use in develop environment because it load all keys
