 Summary Readmemd Added configuration and code change instructions to run Matlab demo code in GNU Octave Datasetm and randinm code changes for GNU Octave described in Readmemd Notes All changes were tested on GNU Octave on Windows The latest binary distribution for MAC OS GNU Octave does not support classdef To make the code work in this environment change Datasetm to a struct Ie remove the classdef statement remove the properties section and move each one of the methods into a separate file I dont have a Matlab environment needed to test the Datasetm superclass change matlabmixincopyable handle Ie I couldnt verify whether this change actually works in Matlab or see if it degrades performance results in too much memory usage or has other negative side effects The Readmemd instaructions are probably sufficient if you decide not to accept the code changes If you accept the code chnages then you may remove the redundant instructions from Readmemd
