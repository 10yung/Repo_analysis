Creating the factory file for W UBU fixed rank geometry where U is on the Stiefel and B is positive definite Nicolas First thanks for building ManOpt Its just great I have been looking into the source code but could not figure out whether the strong Wolfe conditions are employed at any stageversion of the line search algorithms As far as I know this is essential for achieving descent in the LBFGS algorithm Or are there other linesearch methods in ManOpt that can ensure this All the best Hi everyone I noticed manopt may take a long time to clone Looking closer at the repo distribution I see most of the content MB is due to web and releases This is quite inconvenient for people like me packaging manopt as a local submodule in their projects for solving dependencies Given the size of this project I think it might be great to move those two heavy components not directly related to the manopt functionality to independent repositories maybe NicolasBoumalmanoptweb and NicolasBoumalmanoptreleases Worst case you can have those repositories as submodules in NicolasBoumalmanopt although I would discourage that altogether Let me know what you think
