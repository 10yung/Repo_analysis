 For Apps supporting iOS it would be nice to expose a colorProvider UITraitCollection UIColor example callsite swift let label UILabel let label UILabel labelbonMotStyle init alignmentcenter colorProvider Ideally one would abstract this semantically switch case light return darkText case dark return lightText return label The implementation on the BonMot side would involve updating the current AdaptableTextContainer implementations A way to enable tests even when building w SwiftPM Only two tests fail on macOS testAvailableFeatures testImageTinting Fixes using the improved interaction between switch and if in Swift I believe this requires removing support for Swift Let me know if that assumption is incorrect It s come up once or twice in projects since some protocols that we use with model or state types require that things be Equatable for collection diffing reasons It would also probably simplify some tests Possible challenges anything that contains a closure Might need to throw some reference types in the mix to make it all work out Hi Im trying to convert an HTML snippet with styles and links to an attributed string What parsing approach would you recommend Here is the HTML I am trying to convert ollistrongBee Geesstrong a href target blank emStaying AliveemalilistrongDaft Punkstrong a href target blank strongemAround the WorldemstrongalilistrongKanye Weststrong a href target blank strongFlashing Lightsstrongaliol This has various phrases with nested emphasisstrongahref tags I would like these nested tags to be converted to custom font styles for an attributed string Im sure others have attempted this before wondering if there is a recommended approach Before swift var style StringStyle fontsomeFont colorsomeColor minimumLineHeight styleadaptations fontMetricstextStyle title maxPointSizenil return style After swift return StringStyle fontsomeFont colorsomeColor minimumLineHeight adaptations fontMetricstextStyle title maxPointSizenil Way of the future Looks like this is actually a problem with how iOS handles setAttributedTitle on UIButton We could support the work around by setting the buttons labels attributedText first and then using that to setAttributedTitle Discussioninvestigation of problem lineSpacing tracking or adapt img width altScreen Shot at src lineSpacing only img width altScreen Shot at src lineSpacing tracking or adapt img width altScreen Shot at src This bug appears only with single line strings this is not a BonMot bug its probably NSAttributedString bug ZevEisenberg Any ideas
