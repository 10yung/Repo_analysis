It only generated a sql which has only one column in primary keys After I Looked at code it seemed a bug in the func tl TypeLoader LoadTableIndexes Ex CREATE TABLE multicolumnpk rootid bigint NOT NULL parentid bigint NOT NULL childid bigint NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY rootidparentidchildid KEY ichildid childid ENGINEInnoDB DEFAULT CHARSETutf mb Generated from index multicolumnpkchildidpkey func MultiColumnPKByChildIDctx contextContext db XODB childID int MultiColumnPK error var err error sql query const sqlstr SELECT rootid parentid childid FROM multicolumnpk WHERE childid run query XOLogsqlstr childID rk RelatedKnode exists true err dbQueryRowctx sqlstr childIDScan rkRootID rkParentID rkChildID if err nil return nil err return rk nil I have a Custom defined search query sql SELECT count as repeated FROM However the xo generated Go code turns count as string go GENERATED BY XO DO NOT EDIT Custom defined search query MyCount type MyCount struct Repeated string repeated What Im missing Whats the workaroundsolution Thx I have some stored procedures in my schema Xo detects and generates code for them but the code appears to use positional variables v v rather than the parameter names Is there an option I m missing Would it be possible to get the names using templates I just try customtypepackageabc and realized that XO DOES NOT recognize int as a known type in Go Then field ColumnX int was generated as ColumnX abcint Please add this to KnownTypeMap A small change in MsParseType function to support Nullable Datetime types I have no idea if there was a reason to not include it since the beginning This small and simple change allows access to know if a field is a foreign key or not in a custom template For example range Fields if ColIsForeignKey Name end end In addition if two tables have similar names usertype and usertypes for example two structs with the same name will be generated with different fields So sad This PR will fix this Its necessary to be able to add more custom tag to fields of table struct Its not just about sqlx but also other custom marshalunmarshal lib as well Example Custom Tags adding multiple custom tags to fields of table struct Sometime you want to add one or many custom tags to fields of table struct for compatible with other lib sqlx for instance and this option can help you to do that bash usage example xo pgsqluserpasshostdb o models customtags db abc Then in userxogo you will get go type User struct ID uint jsonid dbid abcid id LastName string jsonlastname dblastname abclastname lastname other source code Closes Closes I have a table named quota and xo automatically generates a struct called quotum which makes me confused because all other singular nouns are kept in original form So this is a bug or a feature
