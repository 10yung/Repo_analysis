 After this commit was added to the master branch building synergy no longer builds the tests Is this an intentional change If so how do I build the tests Operating Systems Server Windows Client Windows Professional Synergy Version stableb efb Steps to Reproduce Start Synergy Edit Settings Check or Uncheck Enable Auto Config Ok The state synergy is in will remain unchanged until you close and reopen synergy If auto config was disabled before opening settings you will still receive the warning that auto config is disabled despite enabling the option Enable Auto Config and pressing Ok The reverse is also true If you open synergy with auto config on then you repeat the steps above then you will notice synergy does not warn you that auto config is off despite you just turning it off Whether this is intended or not it is counter intuitive because it gives the user the impression that changes may or may not have been applied after changing the options If the options are only addressed upon the program starting up then that is a large hinderence to its usability Original PR Related to Printscreen sends AltPrintscreen to Windows clients Previous patch only removes the altprintscreen scancode from being mapped to VKSNAPSHOT AFAIK This patch adds sendkeyboardinput and sendmouseinput to replace keybdevent and mouseevent but are functionally the same other than the ability for sendkeyboardinput to send virtualkeys and scancodes so Windows can produce certain keycombos like altprintscreen Theres still a bit of special handling for AltPrintscreen so the correct key updown scancodes are sent but everything appears to work Feel free to test and make suggestions I lost the original commit author details during the cherrypick But the source of this change belongs to yupi I also Removed a couple if blocks as otherwise they will never be removed and will linger haunting us for eternity Last commit fixed a asingment in an if block instead of Original PR TBH Im not even sure if this code is used but I think the corrections are straightforward This was a good catch and should defiantly be merged I have linked this to as it may affect it Original PR Fixes Fixes quote key on US international keyboards New PR created as old PR would pull in v changes Server Linux Client Windows I try to copy something like an article in mix of text and images There is no image English text becomes Chinese Im using Linux as Server Windows as Client I copied text from Server to Client The text is from Udacitycom the end page is OneNote or Word English becomes Chinese I can fix this by pasting with Keep Text Only It is be nice if the Synergy fixes this Operating Systems Server Windows Pro Client MacOS Synergy Version stableb efb Steps to Reproduce Configure server with TLS Connect with client On the client get prompted to match the fingerprint in a dialog to that on the server Expected Fingerprints to match Actual Fingerprints do not match Extra Info Appears to be due to different fingerprinting algorithms being used The server interface displaying the SHA fingerprint while the verification on the client showing the SHA which will never match being different lengths generating the SHA fingerprint did appear to checkout with on the server something like OpenSSL x noout fingerprint sha inform pem in APPDATA Local Synergy SSL Synergypem OpenSSL x noout fingerprint sha inform pem in APPDATA Local Synergy SSL Synergypem the first matching that provided in the server interface the second matching that in the verification dialog on the client I just compiled Synergy on Windows and got everything working but there was one last step that wasnt specified on the wiki page Getting the project compiled and copying everything worked find but once I ran it for the first time I kept getting the following message in the log log ERROR ipc connection error connection refused After a little bit of digging I noticed the service was not even showing up After a brief look into the code I noticed I could run an install command on synergyd After starting an admin command prompt and running synergyd install the error messages went away and everything worked fine Perhaps there should be a little addition to compiling for Windows or a setup section that specifies how the service should be installed
