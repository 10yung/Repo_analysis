In PHPStorm when you have code like enumequals you dont have autocomplete of possible options That should be achievable with meta file Now I am not going to lie I tried and failed php my enum class method static Status INCOMPLETE method static Status PENDING method static Status FEEDBACK method static Status OPTIONAL method static Status APPROVED class Status extends Enum private const INCOMPLETE incomplete private const PENDING pending private const FEEDBACK feedback private const OPTIONAL optional private const APPROVED approved and failed attempt of meta file cache invalidated just in case php php namespace PHPSTORMMETA registerArgumentsSetprofilestatusenum App Doctrine Enum StatusPENDING App Doctrine Enum StatusAPPROVED App Doctrine Enum StatusFEEDBACK App Doctrine Enum StatusINCOMPLETE App Doctrine Enum StatusOPTIONAL expectedArguments App Doctrine Enum Statusequals argumentsSetprofilestatusenum Used example was intentionally for real enum class just to see if I can make it work I am honestly not sure if this is a bug in PHPStorm or more likely that I messed up but if someone has experience with this it would be nice to have autocomplete by reading from values method The reason I created this issue is that if this library has meta file PHPStorm will automatically pick it up One composer update should be enough for endusers Hi this is a wonderfull project I already used it because SplEnum is not always available The one thing I am missing is an interface for the MyCLabs Enum Enum class It would be more easy to use the interface for typehint Thx Hello Im trying to use this and am running into problems class TestEnum extends Enum const Nothing const TestOne const TestTwo const TestThree test TestEnumTestOne isValid TestEnumisValidtest This is false What am I doing wrong Thanks for this library MyClabs Not sure if this should be resolved or not I find it problematic that when searching the method does not consider that there may be several constants with same values Example of an international dialling code enum php const ITA this is fine and unique value const IMN UK and Isle of Man share the same code const GBR UK and Isle of Man share the same code Then when I instantiate the Enum like so php testEnum new CountryCallingCodeCountryCallingCodeGBR vardumptestEnumgetKey return IMN not GBR Bug at this line proof It will be better use the name of constant for toString Ideally SomeEnumFoo should always return the same instance of SomeEnum so you can do someEnumValue SomeEnumFoo instead of someEnumValue getValue SomeEnumFoo Heres another idea Perhaps a variant of this class which doesnt have a value for each enum member so SomeEnumFOO doesnt work but SomeEnumFOO does Could be used like so in PHP php class SomeEnum extends ValuelessEnum const values FOO BAR QUX Or something like that Maybe not a good idea What do you think
