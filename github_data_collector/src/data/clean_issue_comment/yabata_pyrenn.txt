Is there a way to terminate the training of a network if the error rate has converged to a certain significant figure It is not possible to save an untrained network because of the missing Pnorm and Ynorm parameters This can be changed by defining them during creation of the NN and setting them to eg None ore Zero Then changing preparedata is necessary as well
