Hello so far I really enjoy working with GIFU So this is just a feature request and I dont know if it is even possible but if it is please add a way to compress a GIF before I eg upload it to my server Thanks My uicollectionview has a list of cells which contains images When I scroll up and down cells show duplicate images I think it causes by cache I tried to set imageviewimage nil before set imageviews image by url but its not working Please help Hi When i Call stopAnimatingGIF method the Gif Image is hiddenAny Solution For this Please help How is the completion handler parameter below intended to work public func animatewithGIFNamed imageName String loopCount Int completionHandler Void nil Per the api docs it says completionHandler Completion callback function The issue is that the completion handler is fired immediately and not when the animations are finished Seems that the completionHandler is being used by prepareForAnimation and therefore firing immediately Is this by design Link to the API Im trying to compile my project after installing the pod on my Swift project and get the following error Missing argument for parameter in call img width altscreen shot at am src Any ideas on how I can troubleshoot this Thank you It seems that FrameStore animatedFrames is not thread safe it will write in preloadFrameQueue and read in main queue Is that right When installing Gifu version using Cocoapods its not getting the latest revision which contains the swift version and the compiler thinks that the pod is on Swift even though its actually using syntax I think that you either need to bump the pod version or recut and tag a release that matches version so the podspec is pointing to the latest commit If you turn on ThreadSanitizer and animate a gif an access race is reported in FrameStoreswift at line The error summary is SUMMARY ThreadSanitizer Swift access race FrameStoreswift in T Gifu FrameStoreC animatedFramesSayAA AnimatedB VGvg Is it possible to change the speed of the gif Thanks
