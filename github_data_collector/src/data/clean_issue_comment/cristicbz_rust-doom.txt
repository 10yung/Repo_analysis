 Not sure whether this is along the lines of where you want to take this project but Ive been wanting a proper tool for taking the kinds of level shots on this page but for a program thats open source actively maintained more flexible eventually works with vanilla PWADs etc Heres what it seems like such a command would entail use an ortho view projection instead of perspective disable distancediminished lighting but still draw sector lighting zoom and position view to frame level extents a margin write screenshot to image at a resolution proportional to world scale something like the maps linked above ie larger maps result in larger images up to a reasonable maximum not sure if this is easy to get to from a nonoffline renderer like this one though Again no idea if this is something you find interesting andor want to do with this project but I think lots of people in the Doom community would find this useful Users could probably even rig it up into an autogenerated map generator for doomwiki the idgames archive This project is really cool keep up the good work
