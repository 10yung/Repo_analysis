WhiteSource Renovate View repository job log here PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS Is it a bugfeaturequestion or do you need help If its a bug is it a browser bug Overview of the problem The page keeps scrolling when resizing the element Is resizing on mobile devices something that you would like to support This is most likely a feature request UNCOMMENT THE APPROPRIATE LINES Im using reresizable xxx Could you please provide reproduced project on webpackbin with latest version rnd My browser is Chrome for Android I am sure this issue is not a duplicate Pretty sure went through active and closed threads Description When resizing element on a mobile phone especially vertically the page keeps scrolling I tried using epreventDefault or estopPropagation on onResize method but it doesnt seem to have any effect Steps to Reproduce It is quite easy to reproduce using the available demo at CodeSandBox Expected behavior I would like to resize the dragged element but the page should keep its Y position Actual behavior The page keeps scrolling underneath the element This might be my fault as Im not very familiar with css in general when resizing any of the divs they snap and become bigger than they were before unintentionally Im using reresizable on Firefox This PR contains the following updates Package Type Update Change rollupplugintypescript devDependencies minor
