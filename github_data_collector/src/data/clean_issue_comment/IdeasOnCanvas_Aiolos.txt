Describe the bug I am trying to create a tab bar inside the panel similar to MindNode When embedding a UITabBar inside the Panel I have observed that the tab bars height changes seemingly randomly when interacting with the panel I then realised that this behaviour can be observed in the sample application without changing a line of code which uses a navigation controller instead of a tab bar controller I believe that fixing the underlying issue will make my tab bar also behave well To Reproduce Download the project from Github then run on an iPhone X Observe that the Panel is about px high and looks fine Press optionright on simulator to rotate Observe that the Panel is still about px high however now the dark grey toolbar is showing Rotate back to normal everything seems fine Drag the little line control upwards The Panel will move to a partially open state Notice that the grey toolbar is about px high Now drag the little line slowly and carefully to the top of the screen Observe that the grey toolbar is the same size px when the panel is at full height Now drag the little line downwards to close the panel to the partially open state All is well Now flick the little line upwards the grey navigation bar is now px high almost double the size its been up to now Now drag the little line to close the panel halfway the navigation bar returns to a normal size Expected behavior The height of the navigation bar or tab bar on the panels content controller should remain the same and not change based on the height of the panel or interactions with it as described above Screenshots Screenshot at Screenshot at Screenshot at Screenshot at Device please complete the following information Device Type iPhone X OS iOS Browser NA Version NA Additional context I suppose its proprietary but I would love to see MindNodes custom tab bar controller I plan to override UITabBarController and use the standard icon size hide the text labels and move the bar to the top to achieve a similar effect which should be fine I hope I am a paying MindNode user who loves the app thank you for this control its amazing Any reason why you are not supporting CocoaPods install Thanks for your feedback
