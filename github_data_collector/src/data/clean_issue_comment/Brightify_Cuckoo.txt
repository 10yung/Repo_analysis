Security Alerts page details Ive been trying to use Cuckoo on a tvOS project with Carthage and noticed there wasnt a tvOS target so I created them based on their iOS counterparts changing only a few settings to their tvOS specifics such as the base SDK and supported platforms Related to Hi all My team wants to slowly integrate the Cuckoo framework into our project for generating mocks We want to support tests that still use our own mocks and new refactored tests that use Cuckoo mocks The problem we are facing is that there are conflicts between mocks we wrote ourselves and mocks that Cuckoo generates eg same classname for the mocks and it also reduces readability because it s not immediately obvious if you are working with Cuckoo mocks or not Is it possible is there a way to add a prefix to the classnames of the generated mocks eg generating a mock for protocol Abc will generate CuckooMockAbc CKMockAbc Thanks in advance To reset all Mocks without specifying Mock instance I think this is what was meant The double negative threw me Bumps ffi from to details summaryChangelogsummary Sourced from ffis changelog Changed Revert closures via libffi This readds ClosurePool and fixes compat
