I have PLCrashReporter integrated into my app and I have some crashes reported because of the watch dog timeout But PLCrashReporter does not seem to recognize this as a crash and I dont see a report being generated for this Exception Type EXCCRASH SIGKILL Exception Codes x x Exception Note EXCCORPSENOTIFY Termination Reason Namespace SPRINGBOARD Code x badf d Termination Description SPRINGBOARD processexit watchdog transgression application exhausted real wall clock time allowance of seconds ProcessVisibility Background ProcessState Running WatchdogEvent processexit WatchdogVisibility Background WatchdogCPUStatistics Elapsed total CPU time seconds user system CPU Elapsed applicatn CPU time seconds CPU Triggered by Thread Repro rename a source file to mm Make a device build run on a device without a debugger Have it crash in a standalone i e not a class method function Observe the mangled function name in the call stack in the crash report Report Application Specific Information from Apples crash reporter info Hello all I have used this fork for some time as it was the only one to build correctly with Carthage While looking through the official PLCrashReporter repository and working through the build issues I had seen a post from ElektrojungeMS citing this fork as an option which provides Carthage compatibility Up until now I havent found any problems with its use however recently I have run into some issues which Ive never experienced before Currently while running a carthage build I get the following message Dependency plcrashreporter has no shared framework schemes for any of the platforms iOS It appears that the only valid scheme which Carthage is able to build is the Mac scheme This is probably unintended though I cant quite tell why its happening Looking at the schemes there appear to be unique schemes for iOS although they have suffixes iOSDevice iOSSimulator Considering those files havent been touched in years I dont think its anything wrong with the repository I wonder if any recent changes in Xcode currently at are causing this problem Is anyone else running into this issue Any help is appreciated Thanks very much Hi everyone Im very pleased to let everyone know that my team at Microsoft has worked with chrispcampbell and Plausible Labs and agreed to transfer this repo to the microsoft organization on GitHub and we are taking over maintainership of the project going forward More details will follow in blogposts that were going to publish some time later today and that Ill of course add here too Having worked with PLCrashReporter ever since I started at HockeyApp in Im really super happy that we found a way to keep this project healthy and am super looking forward to whats to come If you have any questions please feel free to ask them here derpixeldan and I are happy to answer Problem Solution Make PLCrashMacros public in framework or compile will failed after drag CrashReportframework to target project at a dc Added gitigonre at f cb And added two feature to generate key report and fingerprint of crash report which are necessary to me but may not be globally useful
