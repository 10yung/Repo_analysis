I think itd be a good idea to list the hashes for the game assets that were included with the original origin of this source code so that people can be sure they are getting the right data Im saying this because I suspect that the data may differ between different releases and versions the different versions of the CD GOG or Steam releases I know the source code will probably be compatible with later versions of the assets but itd still be good to know what state the original assets this source came with were in DialogHelpersh did not play well with github due to the ISO format frcameracreate doesnt check arg before calling LGmemcpy with it as a source Some invocations of frcameracreate call with arg as NULL leading to a nullpointer deref Found while running the code under valgrind I havent has a chance to look at the C standard and there might be reasons or cases where this is okay If the compiler guarantees to inline a function the storage for the local notionally becomes local to the caller so it could potentially be okay in some cases However g warns about these inline operators and from looking at the unoptimised output they are not being inlined and the code emitted explicitly returns null This is worth bearing in mind for people who are porting the source to other toolchains Ive tried compiling the source code from the sit file on different Macs OS and in Classic using CW Gold and on every machine the final link fails with Not enough room in heap zone The problem appears to be dLib either the code or data field for dLibPPC will be way too big and the total fields at the bottom add up into the hundreds of MB The codedata sizes in the dLib project look fine and the file itself is KB all normal Removing and readding the library to the Shock project doesnt seem to help neither do different compile options Has anyone else come across this problem It is important to specify that the license is GPL version or later as is the recommendation of GNU the publishers of the license shown in the license itself Add links to license files Something seems to be wrong with the newlines One can possibly use sed to fix it img width altscreen shot at src The Macstyle line endings were making browsing the files on modern systems difficult Using mac unix I fixed up the line endings for all nonbinary files when possible I didnt touch any of the u files
