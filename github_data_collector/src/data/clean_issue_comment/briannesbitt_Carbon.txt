proposals and documentation requests Having all those informations will allow us to know exactly what you expect and answer you faster and precisely answer that matches your Carbon version PHP version and usage Note Comments between and wont appear in the final issue See Preview tab Hello I encountered an issue with the following code php echo CarbongetLocale en echo Carbonnowlocale en echo CarbonnowstartOfWeekdayName Monday CarbonsetLocaleenUS echo CarbonnowstartOfWeekdayName Monday echo CarbonnowlocaleenstartOfWeekdayName Sunday Trying to figure out all of the different apparently competing localization settings makes my head spin The issue seems to be that firstWeekDay will only ever be determined by a local translator not the default translator Carbon Traits Localization Date php case name firstWeekDay return thislocalTranslator thisgetTranslationMessagefirstdayofweek staticgetWeekStartsAt Im not sure what the point of staticweekStartsAt isbackward compatibility It conflicts with what the default translator is supposed to return As far as I can tell the only way to solve this is to use the deprecated methods setWeekStartsAt AND setWeekEndsAt which for some bizarre reason is not calculated automatically or explicitly include the locale call every single time I use these methods even though it already is the default Am I missing something obvious here I would propose removing the default values for staticweekStartsAtEndsAt and changing the getters to only use them if they are explicitly set php case name firstWeekDay return staticgetWeekStartsAt thisgetTranslationMessagefirstdayofweek null This is a simple change and I would be happy to submit a PR if acceptable but it would technically be breaking even though its a bugfix in my opinion Carbon version PHP version Run the command composer show nesbotcarbon to get versions Use echo phpversion to get PHP version Some issues can depends on your context settings macros timezone language So to be sure the code you give is enough to reproduce your bug try it first in You can use the Options button to change the version then when you get the bug with this editor you can use the Export button copy the link of the opened tab then paste it in the issue Then we can immediatly get your issue I expected to get with default en or enUS locale echo CarbonnowstartOfWeekdayName Sunday Always give your expectations Each use has their owns You may want daylight saving time to be taken into account someone else want it to be ignored You may want timezone to be used in comparisons someone else may not etc But I actually get echo CarbonnowstartOfWeekdayName Monday If you did not succeed to get the same result in then precise the result you get Thanks Carbon translations has been checked against CLDR in Missing translations has been added and some mistakes in Carbon have been spotted In the next version Ill try to spot more possible improvements by checking the revealed differences Hello As described in the in the title do you plan to translate the documents of the project Or do you have MD version of the documents of the project I plan to translate the documents into other languages because the English version is not convenient for me to read Resolves Just threw together a WIP nothing works atm taking parts from and Larastan kylekatarnls is this the direction you want this to go DONT REMOVE ME This issue template apply to all bug reports feature proposals and documentation requests Having all those informations will allow us to know exactly what you expect and answer you faster and precisely answer that matches your Carbon version PHP version and usage Note Comments between and wont appear in the final issue See Preview tab I am trying to statically analyse my code with PhpStan and found no mechanism to discover Macros that are registered with Carbon php Carbonmacrofoo function now new Carbon nowfoo When running PhpStan on that code i get an error message like this Call to an undefined method Carbon Carbonfoo PhpStan allows configuring extension points that extend the analysis capabilities in such a way that Macros can be detected for example I can champion this feature Are you willing to add it to Carbon Hei I havent been actively developing in PHP since a year or so but Im still getting occasional updates from One of the news is that have finally been merged Itll be available in PHP but Im not sure about the earlier releases It may be then a good idea to think about making CarbonPeriod extend the DatePeriod However as we had to remake the thing from scratch Im not sure about the compatiblity particularly as I dont know which versions of PHP should be supported by Carbon In any case I think I should be able to help with the research and refactoring after the sommer if you think that should be done January x Fix OPCache preloading compatibility x Improve performances bottleneck in loading translations files x CarbonPeriod no longer set default locale to iterated date x Allow local settergetter macros Fix creation of Carbon instances using reflection Improve compliance of translations with CLDR database second step deeper check Documentation Create a tutorial to show bestpractice with Laravel and February Allow constructors to take DateTimeDateTimeImmutableDateIntervalDatePeriod Documentation Create a tutorial to show bestpractice with Symfony Long term Refactor CarbonPeriod to extend DatePeriod Improve performances Improve and create more mixins libraries such as and A big thank you to Tidelift subscribers and
