can be solved with openssl EDIT OpenSSL dont seems to be the point for my error openssl is already the newest version ubuntu Greetings and thanks in advance for any comment on what follows I would really need a real solution to this problem that makes ArchiveBox less useful I cant be the only one to have it and dont know where else to ask An archive of a web page should be a version of that page that looks and feels as much as possible as the original even when that page is loaded today in a browser totally disconnected from the Internet Or twenty years from now in an emulator of todays browsers when the original website and all its auxiliary resources may be long dead If the archived page does not passes those tests it has little or no value because it is still dependent on third party resources that may disappear any moment A month ago I filed an issue here because I found out that wget as used in ArchiveBox was not passing those tests for details see filed an issue here Immediately after that discussion I searched online again and found no real solution to that problem The web is full of pages some years old claiming to know how to solve the problem above but if you look at them they just copy from each other the same options we discussed here one month ago Ive archived some thousands pages while filing that issue here and can confirm those options fail way too often to do what they promise So in parallel I asked how to make wget always create REALLY complete REALLY offline copies of web pages directly to the wget developers The result Zero answers after one month Summarizing what I have taken home so far is that wget cannot do real useful archives or at least nobody knows how to use it to that purpose and that this issue raised more interest here than on the wget list So this seems the best place to ask am I missing something Or is it time to replace wget with something else both in and outside of ArchiveBox If so with what For example Firefoxchrome plugins like SingleFile save whole page as ONE HTML file with javascript images and even video if you want embedded inside it Technically it should be possible to add to the archivebox container that plugin and code selenium that instead of calling wget tells the browser save this page with singlefile Besides being above my own skills however this approach has the big problem that would make impossible the deduplication of identical images scripts etc across different pages thus creating much much bigger archives Thoughts Please fill out the following information feel free to delete

providers Im not seeing anything running for the PR I just opened in If all it is is running the commands from Im happy to send a PR adding that too Hi writing this as regular issue because I am not sure if its a bug or what else I am running the docker image of archivebox as explained in the archivebox wiki Works fine except every now and then it leaves big core files named coreNNN Why does this happen and what should I do if anything Thanks Greetings and thanks for ArchiveBox It looks really interesting So far my only issue with it is that it does not makes local copies of all the images embedded in a page only those hosted on the same server As an example when I told the archivebox docker container to archive this article Selection with this command echo docker run i v archiveboxtestingdata nikisweetingarchivebox I got an outputhtml file that DOES includepoints to a LOCAl copy on my own server of the big image on the left but not of the round thumbnails in the right sidebar If I rightclick on any of them and select copy image location I do not get as I would like a link like somelocaljpgfilejpg I get the location of the original image on another server ie This means that if I used the archive on a computer disconnected from the internet I would not see those thumbnails Can this behaviour be changed I remember wget had some option for this but IIRC it does not always work well in these cases Thanks in advance for any feedback
