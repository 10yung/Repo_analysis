 It can work on FF and Chromebut no response on Safari First of all thanks for great plugin Nowadays a lot of project are Vuejs Reactjs Angularjs so forcing people to include JQuery is not good idea Its better to convert it to Pure JS Its been more than a year since the last release Time to cut perhaps Try copying an image to clipboard do a google image search and copy an image to the clipboard then using example page try and paste into the paste regions Note that in Chrome it works perfectly but in IE nothing happens Also note that in last content editable example the image flashes up for a second and then disappears Gary I was testing the demo in various browsers and got different results for where the image was pasted In the following browsers I clicked in the blank area below the rd div and the pasted image appeared below the rd div Edge Firefox In the following browsers I clicked below the rd div and the pasted image appeared above the rd div Chrome For IE the image wouldnt past unless I clicked into one of the divs on screen For all browsers clicking inside one for the sample divs the image is pasted below the selected div I would image the different paste locations when clicking below the rd div is just a quirk in the demo right Besides using pastejs for pasting images to textareas I also use it to react on pasted strings that have a specific format Eg when pasting a codepen url like I dont want to insert this exact string into the textarea but a markdown link to it like this CodePenio For this I need to prevent the original string being inserted into the textarea How can this be achieved Currently pastejs is an ideal solution for handling copy and paste programmatically of both text and bitmaps Have you ever considered including also pasting of files In some platforms Windows especially a common way of copying files around is by pasting them Id venture its as common as drag drop on Mac I know you can read files with JavaScript but Im not sure if the events that allow file reading If they get enough information from pasted files While testing support for Safari I noticed in the demo scenarios pasting a file in contenteditable pastes the file icon I didnt expect it to paste the contents but in the other fields only the file name was pasted as text Have you considered adding file paste support so it behaves similar to a file select input button Looks like this bug was finally fixed I dont know for sure but perhaps this will let you get rid of the hidden editable hack for Firefox Hey there Thanks a lot for this amazing little helper we use it in our web app extensively We have an image upload field which is simply a textarea now and using pastejs a pasted image is converted to base and the base string is sent to the app and there saved as a normal PNG file At the moment we rely on users having a supporting browser IE FF Chrome But wed like to add a switch that displays a normal upload field when the browser doesnt support pasting Is there an easy way to detect this You have this matrix in the README it would be great to have a little JavaScript helper method returning truefalse depending on support status Best wishes
