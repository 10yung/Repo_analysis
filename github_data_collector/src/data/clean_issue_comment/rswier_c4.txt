A Hello World program is traditionally used to introduce novice programmers to a programming language I hope that the output looks more good for a novice programmer How can I forward declare a function related issue update pull request missing comma when calling test and compile ok int testint a int b return a b int main int result result test return patch else if tk Id while tk exprAssign e PSH t if tk next while tk exprAssign e PSH t if tk next iftk printfd error unexpected comma in function call n line exit else iftk printfd error missing comma in function call n line exit I added comments to make it effortless for someone to swap out the unistdh header in order to compile on Windows I realized that a preprocessor directive would not work since that is unsupported so the comments should be the best alternative Now variables can be declared within functions anywhere not just at the beginning and enums can go into functions too The three similar declarationparsing blocks are unified into one The end result is thereby negative code growth lines using void main instead of int main
