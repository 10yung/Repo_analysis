When kernelDensity interpolation fails it is because all values in y are the same In such cases it is desired to have maximum possible horizontal spread of samples in the scatter as it would have if all but one value in y are the same or values in y are close together Thus maxDisplacement should be not in the catch clause Fixes The showScatter option should create a scatter plot of the underlying data for each box overlayed on the plot The data should have a random xaxis offset with respect to the box centre However all data points with value do not get such a random offset or all get the same offset In any case they look like a single dot Hello this is a great toolbox and is liked the styling and the customization of the boxplots However I stumbled upon a bug in the calculation of the median This script and the corresponding figure should clarify this issue data figure subplot b iosrstatisticsboxPlot data title IoSRSurrey Matlab Toolbox Median num strbstatisticsmedian subplot boxplotdata title MatLab R b Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox Median num strmediandata iosrBug Hopefully this bug can be easily fixed I have a boxplot as follows axiosrstatisticsboxPlotyshowLegendtrue axhandleslegendFontSize This line doesnt work even after changing it I even tried going into the function and adding setobjhandleslegendFontSize in line where the legend is created but all this does is make the legend box bigger not the font Modified description
