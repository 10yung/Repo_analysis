Thanks for amazing library How to disable outside click when menu is open added a new property to IIViewDeckController and controls centerViewControllerviews origin x file IIViewDeckLayoutSupportm method CGRectframeForSideIIViewDeckSideside openSideIIViewDeckSideopenSide line CGFloat xOffset openSide IIViewDeckSideLeft maxSizewidth maxSizewidth Why did you hardcoded the value I need to change the value above via new property of IIViewDeckController in IIViewDeckLayoutSupport selfviewDeckController openSideIIViewDeckSideLeft animatedNO animated is no cant open side view but Yes can can support carthage Swipe to close or Cancel side menu is not working in viewDeck SDK I was using it with Pod There are cases where you simply want to do a manual installation of ViewDeck in your project and want to use the compiled framework as the ViewDeck documentation suggests Everything will work fine until upload to the App Store it will give an error because architectures i and x are included in the ViewDeck library and those are not allowed anymore by Apple So for those ViewDeck users heres a tip to strip these architectures automatically from the compiled framework Use these steps There is an improved version of the stripping script here Make sure you add this build script as a new step after the Embed Frameworks step in build phases otherwise it wont work After doing this uploading to App Store will work fine again As for the ViewDeck developers a request to remove these architectures from the compiled framework Thanks in advance i try the func preferredStatusBarStyle and selfnavigationControllernavigationBarbarStyle blackOpaque but canno effective how do use it
