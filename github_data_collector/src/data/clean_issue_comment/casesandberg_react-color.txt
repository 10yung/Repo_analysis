The color choosing circle and the sliders are fixed and do not move with upon click and drag Hence its does not allow us to choose a color in the latest version Everything works fine on rolling back to We need to tinycolor rgb instead of hex to let use transparent When we change transparent nothing happens Because we use hex which doesnt include alpha field See repro here It does trigger for other colors Fixes Closes The satisfies iconsmaterial peer dependency requirement If reactcolor requires a stricter version range then that should ideally be used Looking through the issue history I see that this peer dependency was removed in due to issues with npm v These issues are probably not relevant anymore Using Yarn release candidate I get the following error YN reactcolornpm doesnt provide react requested by iconsmaterialnpm Seeing as reactcolor has a dependency on iconsmaterial it is also responsible for in some way providing its peer dependencies in this case react This is strictly enforced in Yarn PlugnPlay which will be default in Yarn when I change the color property or change it by clicking the palette the rgb values change but not alpha Set input label width to match input width casesandberg This is just an option for solving this problem Im submitting this to have something to discuss Also the storybook doesnt seem to have an option to change the colors so I had to edit the storyjs file to actually see a white circle color swatch Maybe there is a better way to do this Addresses Issue I thought the intent of the source key in the onChange event was to show which editable field is in use by the Chrome Picker but it always returns rgb Am I misunderstanding the usage or is there a bug
