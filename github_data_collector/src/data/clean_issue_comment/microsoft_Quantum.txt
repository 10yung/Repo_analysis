Hello Im trying to install QKD for developing in C and command line So I installed the NET Core SDK version x then I tried to install templates with command line dotnet new i MicrosoftQuantumProjectTemplates But this command line give me an error C Users Julien templateengine dotnetcli v scratch restorecsproj error NU Package MicrosoftQuantumProjectTemplates not found no package associated to this ID exists in ressources C Program Files dotnet sdk NuGetFallbackFolder Restoration failed ms for C Users Julien templateengine dotnetcli v scratch restorecsproj I have translated it from french My computer is Windows x I made exactly same steps on an other computer Windows x also with same NET SDK version and it works well and Im able to run the hello world Q sample I suspect the reason is because I have Visual Studio installed on the computer do you think it could be the reason Any help to solve my problem Thank you very much Best regards Julien Another great hire inbound for Team Quantum This PR parallels microsoftquantumlibraries by updating the existing halfmoons sample to use the new API features in that PR and by adding a new sample based on the wine dataset that demonstrates constructing classifier structures in Q This PR also prepares both samples for eventual onboarding into the samples browser by adding appropriate READMEmd files Installed a fresh Visual Studio Added latest Q from under extensions Created Q application project new q console app Compile or just sit there long enough and IDE will give the error error activating the remote language server Q Language Extension on every compile This was reported by someone else on now closed issue back in for VS In that case it was fixed with an update Maybe this is a regression
