and how they address the issue Changed the margins from auto to for image rendering in rendermime Userfacing changes Describe any visual or user interaction changes and how they address the issue Changes the alignment of images from IPythondisplayImage when embedFalse For visual changes include before and after screenshots here Before Before After After Backwardsincompatible changes Describe any backwardsincompatible changes to JupyterLab public APIs When using Create new view for output with a cell that outputs a Bokeh plot it just doubles the plot in the original cell output with no plot output in the new View If a second Output View is created the plot is tripled in the original and so on Edit the same happens with New View for Notebook The issue is the same as this with holoviews Other outputs such as strings in the example below are instead correctly sent to the new child Views Interestingly splitting the original cell ShiftCtrl while making disappear all the plots in the original cell output correctly updates the first created child View All the other child Views remain instead without any plot This splitting also makes orphan all child Views they are no longer linkedupdated to the original cell Code to reproduce the issue tested on a trusted notebook in a fresh conda environment with jupyterlab bokeh python from bokehio import outputnotebook show from

constraints of integrating Kite LSP Completions and eventually snippets into JupyterLab These are the meeting notes JupyterLab Kite call Jan Agenda Presentation from Kite on what an integration would look like from a user perspective Discussion of surfacing an integration to users Presentation how the collaboration would benefit users Slide deck v Imminently possible using the existing infrastructure in JLab for completions Noticable improvement in completions UX Completions sorted by relevance Show docs for highlighted completion in the contextual help panel Completions that show up automatically instead of needing to press Tab Faster completions side by side GIF showing difference in speed between Jedi and Kite x more completions than Jedi Function assist Richer contextual help Keyword arguments not in the argspec but learned from code on Github Updating docs display based on which parameter the user is typing v More buildout Snippets Starts with extending the editor to support snippets inserted text with template variables Kite can return completions contain snippets Helps the user fill in arguments to function calls Users could also define snippets Example usecases Common import sets Common code snippets Jason We would need a snippet editor v Future ideas Search reference examples to find common answers Kite has a large curated data set of answers to common queries Examples Discussion of the above Jason This functionality sounds great Brian We also have infrastructure for sharing datasets across extensions Jason Snippet editorlike functionality is were working on a new way for users to write very short extensions LoC and those happen via the JLab UI Discussion of extension manager Summary Goal Helping users as much as possible by making it easy to discover relevant high quality extensions Summary of requirements Neutrality Level playing field Low burden on curating extensions Explicitly not taking Liability for users installing dangerous extensions Low code maintenance burden on Jupyter core team eg avoiding a live service to maintain Discussion log Brian Theres a lot of potential to surface extensions to users more clearly Theres opportunity to make it easier for users to find the extensions that are most helpful to them Eg how stable is the extension how popular etc The first step would be to redesign the extension manager and in general a notion of the extension universe Examples of other extension marketplaces Firefox surfaces extensions based on what the user is doing Jetbrains recently revamped their extension marketplace VS Code does a pretty good job Jason We dont have the infrastructure to heavily curate an universe of extensions So we punted to NPM Brian Theres a line we cant cross implying that any particular extensions that we dont own verify quality are special But the internet has many models now that dont require central approval for things to bubble up Eg popular likely secure but vetted by the community Any legal risks Jason This is a good example of the types of conversations collaborations we like to have with motivated rd parties with resources to push things forward And adding perspective beyond open source devs Brian There are ways to go beyond the extension manager contextual recommendations Level playing field is key In theory another extension could do the things you do and also show up in contextual help Brian cool idea using ML to manage prompts Daniel When I was writing Go I didnt know about goimports and once I found it I realized I had a lost opportunity there Brian In an app store there are multiple levels of sorting is it in the list how theyre sorted Should we have a mechanism to lightly curate the list of extensions managed from code on Github eg pull requests etc Implements minimal oversight to eg blacklist a hostile extension But avoid the problem of largescale reviewapproval of a traditional app store Whitelist vs blacklist approach and blacklist approach is lower maintenance Jetbrains is the full commercial app store experience and VS Code is much more informal I recently installed Jupyterlab and after i launch it i am unable to browse contents of Desktop Documents and Downloads Every other directory that it lists i am able to browse into except these three where majority of my work is I can click on these three folders repeated but nothing happens Anaconda navigator Jupterlab jupyter notebook However jupyternotebook works perfectly fine Not to mention I have rebooted OS clean installed anaconda navigator as mentioned on their website Still same issue If i repeatedly click on any of these folders i get this error message in anacondanavigator I LabApp The port is already in use trying another port I LabApp

test this out for me on Windows Userfacing changes NA Backwardsincompatible changes NA I Would like to know if jupyterlab expose a handler for post rename file as it does for save with the handler named postsave Thanks
