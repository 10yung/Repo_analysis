thrift is available as a port in vcpkg a C library manager that simplifies installation for thrift and other project dependencies Documenting the install process here will help users get started by providing a single set of commands to build thrift ready to be included in their projects We also test whether our library ports build in various configurations dynamic static on various platforms OSX Linux Windows x x UWP ARM to keep a wide coverage for users Im a maintainer for vcpkg and here is what the port script looks like We try to keep the library maintained as close as possible to the original library Explain the changes in the pull request below I discovered this repo because Synk had flagged one of our dependencies as having a security vulnerability That vulnerability is a ReDos attack that resides in the marked module that is part of jsdoc From what I can tell all the modules listed as dependencies are not required at runtime and can be made devDependencies This also happens to fix the security issue I cannot find any explicit reference to these modules in the build artifact The builds pass and everything appears to be fine when I run the tests in Docker So from what I can tell this change should have zero noticeable impact on consumers of Thrift Did you create an Apache Jira ticket not required for trivial changes If a ticket exists Does your pull request title
