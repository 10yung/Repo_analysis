This adds a Packageswift so that the library can be installed using Swift Package Manager Cant seem to find where it prints the above message My controller includes a ImagePickerController as soon as that displays the background stops animating Any ideas why and how can i make it move again when the imagePicker dismisses Environment Xcode Swift Carthage command carthage update Pastel platform ios nousebinaries Build output Build Failed Task failed with exit code usrbinxcrun xcodebuild project UserslvjunDesktopStarOrder iOSCarthageCheckoutsPastelPastelxcodeproj scheme Pastel configuration Release derivedDataPath UserslvjunLibraryCachesorgcarthageCarthageKitDerivedData B Pastel sdk iphoneos ONLYACTIVEARCHNO CODESIGNINGREQUIREDNO CODESIGNIDENTITY CARTHAGEYES archive archivePath varfoldershlr qrxd lfx v xf c gnTPastel SKIPINSTALLYES GCCINSTRUMENTPROGRAMFLOWARCSNO CLANGENABLECODECOVERAGENO STRIPINSTALLEDPRODUCTNO launched in UserslvjunDesktopStarOrder iOSCarthageCheckoutsPastel This usually indicates that project itself failed to compile Please check the xcodebuild log for more details varfoldershlr qrxd lfx v xf c gnTcarthagexcodebuildc ufBTlog I have a button in my app which has a random gradient functionality How can I remove any existing gradient on the screen and replace it with a new one I dont see any functionality in the api code which will allow us to set new gradients without removing the entire view and readding it to the screen It was working on first view controller But when i use this on other view controllers on same story board and on other story board just animated once and than stopped Do I have to set up the specific view controllers Wherever someone leaves my app and lets it go into the background when they then later open the app the gradient is no longer cycling Is there away to restore the state the gradient was in before being sent to background thank you I think I should be able to do it with func applicationDidBecomeActive application UIApplication but I dont know how I tested application with xcode profiler Result is this img width altscreen shot at pm src I think the problem is when CGColor objects are creating every animationGradient call Maybe caching the objects will solve it When running a gradient animation on one ViewController is it possible to continue the same animation from its current state on a different ViewController upon transitioning
