This updates to the devel branch of ggez v This fixes Known issues things to fix before merging some of the text is misaligned actually the alignment seems to differ perplatform so Ill look more into this only works on nightly since ggez uses edition x the shield powerup is not positioned properly x does not work on macOS x remove SDL deps and guides ggez no longer uses SDL but now uses winit and glutin instead Things to consider Should we remove FiraMono from the repo ggez now bundles DejaVuSerif by default removed No need to merge now this is here so we can fix things as they come Note this is all on a separate wasm branch Things that need to happen x Extract ggez business logic to its own crate ggezbackend x Add wasm backend with extern functions to drive execution of the game Figure out if we can come up with an abstraction layer for the view so we can share more code Document every method in the root library Instead of playing the sounds at the same time it queues them Therefore the sound is played multiple times after the enemies are destroyed
